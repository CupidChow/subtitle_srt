3
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,530
[Four years ago, in the peach blossom
forest of Zhoudi Tower]

4
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,070
A friend who would move heaven and earth

5
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,920
to kill me.

6
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
A friend whom I would search

7
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,380
to the ends of the earth

8
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,030
just to find.

9
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,920
Yan,

10
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,840
for the past six months,

11
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,640
you've been avoiding me.

12
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,670
Actually, that day...

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
Back then,

14
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,780
under the blossoms stretching for miles,

15
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,820
Senior Brother taught you,

16
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,570
me,

17
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,700
and Zhumei our craft.

18
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,370
It was warm in the spring.

19
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,460
What a beautiful time.

20
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,990
But now,
the flowers still bloom as they did,

21
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,130
yet the people are gone.

22
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,610
After Senior Brother left,

23
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,610
Zhumei vanished without a trace.

24
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,390
In the Zhoudi Tower,

25
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,510
only you and I remain.

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,190
Lici,

27
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,770
you composed this melody back then.

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,650
Today, let's play it once more for him.

29
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,120
What do you say?

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,010
A childhood composition

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,090
could never compare
to

32
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,450
Senior Brother's masterpieces.

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,840
But I think

34
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,480
this melody

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,200
is the best I've ever heard.

36
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,250
Yan…

37
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,480
This is the only melody

38
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,250
worthy of sending you to your grave.

39
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,840
You used a curse bug on me?

40
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,690
If you hadn't come wounded,

41
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,040
I couldn't have
planted it in you so easily.

42
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,990
Tang Lici,

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,300
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

44
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,650
Yan…

45
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,390
Yan,

46
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,490
it's been four years

47
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,870
since we parted.

48
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,790
Killing me once wasn't enough for you.

49
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,430
Now,

50
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,190
you're using the Hao family massacre

51
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,480
to lure me into your trap

52
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,430
to kill me again.

53
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,650
Since that's the case,

54
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,049
I'll play along.

55
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,330
Let's see if after four years,

56
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,549
you can still manage to kill me.

57
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,150
It was him.

58
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,330
It was Tang Lici.

59
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,680
It was Tang Lici!

60
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,570
It was he

61
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,440
who told me to say this.

62
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,840
It wasn't me.

63
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Please spare me.

64
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Let me go.

65
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,790
There's someone

66
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,960
so vicious in the jianghu.

67
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,300
How dangerous.

68
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,020
Stop playing dumb.

69
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,860
Why did you kill Lord Hao?

70
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,550
For money?

71
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,120
Or did he have something

72
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,750
on you?

73
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,670
It was because...

74
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,480
Who's there?

75
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,480
Chi Yun!

76
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,060
The Blood Ghost Pill?

77
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,290
Jianghu matters
should be settled in the jianghu.

78
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,350
Either you kill me,

79
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,650
or I kill you.

80
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,430
Masters and servants
can turn on each other for money.

81
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,070
Brothers can betray and kill each other.

82
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,720
In the end,

83
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,250
the heart is the hardest to see through.

84
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,730
Demons are everywhere.

85
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,320
Amitabha.

86
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,910
Right and wrong, good and evil—
they're just a thought apart.

87
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,000
What you can't let go of is obsession.

88
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,650
You're very wise, sir.

89
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,820
Salvation lies in your own hands.

90
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
I believe

91
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,150
you'll eventually reach the other shore.

92
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,910
Yan,

93
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,290
I'm coming for you.

94
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,170
When it comes to lightness skills,

95
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,870
who can compare to me, Chi Yun,

96
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,630
the Cloud?

97
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,910
Stop!

98
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,970
A messenger goose?

99
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,630
You're from the Yanmen Sect?

100
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,240
I forgot Yanmen had this trick.

101
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Had I known,

102
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,630
I'd have raised a hawk myself.

103
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,420
Where did Chi Yun go?

104
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,410
Miss Zhong!

105
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,390
Miss Zhong!

106
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,500
Miss Shei?

107
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,440
Where did this ship come from?

108
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,070
Miss Shei, why are you here?

109
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,350
Mr. Tang brought me here.

110
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,180
He said we'd meet you here.

111
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,520
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

112
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,700
You won't be able to catch up with him.

113
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,730
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

114
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,030
And why did Miss Shei come too?

115
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,700
Since we're hunting down the culprit,

116
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,890
it's natural to bring along the victim.

117
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,320
The person you're looking for

118
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,250
has already gone dozens of li west.

119
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
Taking the waterway would be faster.

120
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,530
You already know everything.

121
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,740
That man is incredibly agile.

122
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,250
He's no ordinary fighter.

123
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,510
With the Cloud,

124
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,390
we won't

125
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,760
lose him.

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
And we can

127
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,930
catch up with them.

128
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,590
I never expected

129
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,570
this pleasure ship
would have such mechanisms.

130
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
Wait.

131
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,480
Mr. Tang, why are you so certain

132
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,200
that Chi Yun will come this way?

133
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,270
I'm not certain

134
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,530
about Chi Yun's route.

135
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,030
I'm just certain
where the killer is headed.

136
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,390
You mean…

137
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,050
you already know
who the killer is?

138
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,480
Due to my personal affairs,

139
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,070
I have gathered much information.

140
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,510
And coincidentally, one clue

141
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,290
points right here.

142
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,720
Six months ago,

143
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,000
the Westwind Swordsman, Feng Chuanxiang,

144
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,600
vanished mysteriously
from Liulian Cottage.

145
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,790
Only his footsteps leading into

146
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,120
the cottage were found.

147
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,620
None leading out.

148
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
It is said that

149
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,910
in Liulian Cottage,

150
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,630
there were traces
of two people living there.

151
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,570
After Feng Chuanxiang disappeared,

152
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,090
his mysterious roommate

153
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,690
vanished too.

154
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,630
And the answer

155
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,670
lies in this very item.

156
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,960
A goose feather?

157
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,590
Long and resilient;

158
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
lustrous and smooth.

159
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,480
This is no ordinary goose feather.

160
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Messenger geese?

161
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,610
Yanmen's messenger geese?

162
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,180
100 li east of Yan County

163
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,300
is the Yanmen Sect.

164
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,440
This river flows from east to west.

165
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,370
If the killer wants
to avoid implicating Yanmen,

166
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,300
he'll head west.

167
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,690
Even if something happens
and he turns east midway,

168
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,290
he'll run right into us.

169
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,440
But...

170
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,570
that's impossible.

171
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,860
Why do you say that, Miss Zhong?

172
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
What kind of sect is the Yanmen Sect?

173
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,580
The Yanmen Sect began as a bandit clan

174
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,750
but was granted amnesty
by the former dynasty

175
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,150
and became

176
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,270
the military guards of the Yanmen Pass.

177
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,870
Their goose-training skills
are remarkable.

178
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,620
10 years ago,
when the world fell into chaos,

179
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,840
the Sword Sect led many great fighters

180
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
to hunt down Yique Yinyang.

181
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,750
Yanmen provided

182
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,870
crucial intelligence.

183
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,390
Its leader, Jiang Feiyu,

184
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,330
has a fiery temper,

185
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,390
but he's extremely

186
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,960
protective of his own people.

187
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,910
That's why Yanmen disciples

188
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,570
value loyalty above all else.

189
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,500
There's a saying in the jianghu:

190
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,310
"Better to offend the King of Hell's men

191
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,310
than to cross someone from Yanmen."

192
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,440
It sounds like

193
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,020
a righteous sect.

194
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,720
It doesn't just sound like it—

195
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,250
it is a righteous sect.

196
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,860
Yang Shangqing

197
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,000
was also from a righteous sect.

198
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,870
I found this

199
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,120
on Yang Shangqing.

200
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,500
To be honest,

201
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,410
my master sent me down the mountain

202
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,200
not only for the Hao family massacre

203
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,600
but also for this matter.

204
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,380
These evil pills

205
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,820
haven't been seen again

206
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,750
since the death of Yique Yinyang.

207
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,360
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

208
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,730
I've paid attention

209
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,730
to the Blood Ghost Pills too.

210
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
My leaving the temple

211
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,390
should tell you what I think.

212
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,520
Then…

213
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,520
Miss Zhong,

214
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,170
don't worry for now.

215
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,090
Come have some refreshments.

216
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,030
Talk.

217
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,630
Who are you?

218
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,680
Who sent you to kill that guy?

219
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,750
You think staying silent will save you?

220
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,480
Don't…

221
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Don't push me.

222
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:42,970
Don't push you?

223
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,000
Then why do you think

224
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,310
I chased you for over 100 li?

225
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,880
For fun?

226
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,920
Brat,

227
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,500
don't take poison!

228
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,869
Even an ant fights to stay alive.

229
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,329
Please don't take poison.

230
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,780
It's not poison.

231
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,230
What the hell is that?

232
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,190
This is getting difficult.

233
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,560
Chi Yun, you're not

234
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,960
as good as you used to be.

235
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,930
I haven't even gone all out yet.

236
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,440
Let's stop here.

237
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,820
He knelt right before you.

238
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,880
The assassin who killed Yang Shangqing

239
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,550
is actually

240
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,650
Jiang Cheng.

241
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
Miss Zhong, you know him?

242
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,560
Jiang Cheng is the young master of Yanmen.

243
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,270
He's upright and chivalrous,

244
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,860
a close friend
of the Westwind Swordsman.

245
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,030
They often went to the Huaxi region

246
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,160
in the Sword King City

247
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,520
to fight injustice and help the weak.

248
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,330
They're known

249
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,890
as the Twin Heroes of Huaxi.

250
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
Six months ago,

251
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,830
the Westwind Swordsman

252
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,240
vanished mysteriously at home,

253
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
and Young Master Jiang
also went missing.

254
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,610
How did he become like this?

255
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,530
What are you murmuring?

256
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,300
Foxy Tang, what are you murmuring?

257
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,440
I still need to ask him

258
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,100
why he killed Yang Shangqing.

259
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,310
Is anyone hurt?

260
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Drop the act.

261
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,570
I really don't remember anything.

262
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,520
Young Master Jiang.

263
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,350
You…

264
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,390
You've got the wrong person.

265
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm…

266
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm not Young Master Jiang.

267
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,310
Over a year ago,

268
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,160
I met you and Mr. Feng

269
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,710
at the Sword Sect in the Central Plains.

270
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,710
I'm not mistaken.

271
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
Now that we know who he is,

272
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,000
there's no need for questions.

273
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll just take him

274
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
to the Yanmen Sect

275
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,200
and let his people

276
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,410
explain for him.

277
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,310
Watch out!

278
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,040
Mr. Tang.

279
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,970
You're injured.

280
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,240
You're injured.

281
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,190
Don't use this hand for now.

282
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,000
You wanted to take your own life

283
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,450
because you were worried that your actions

284
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,770
would disgrace Yanmen's name, right?

285
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,040
Foxy Tang,

286
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,660
you were right.

287
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,140
The so-called Yanmen Sect

288
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,850
is just a bunch of filth.

289
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,030
Watch your mouth!

290
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,350
You don't know anything!

291
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,510
What should I know?

292
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,430
The Blood Ghost Pills…

293
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,200
Those evil pills

294
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,540
have resurfaced in the jianghu.

295
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,990
I thought I had the wrong person,

296
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,600
but it seems I was right.

297
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
You do have the wrong person.

298
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,510
I'm not him.

299
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,070
The poison has spread within you.

300
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,240
Your energy flow is reversed.

301
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,370
You don't have long.

302
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,410
You're not afraid of death,

303
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,510
but you don't want to die now.

304
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,310
You still have unfinished business.

305
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,910
Am I right?

306
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,090
If you don't want to speak

307
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,190
with all these people here,

308
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,050
we can talk privately elsewhere.

309
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,480
Hey!

310
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,310
What's so secret

311
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,110
that it
can't be said in front of us?

312
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,920
Foxy Tang

313
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,680
is being so mysterious.

314
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,140
Miss Shei,

315
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,510
how is

316
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Mr. Tang's injury from earlier?

317
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,810
Miss Zhong, don't worry.

318
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,680
Once we get back,

319
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,130
I'll apply some more medicine for him,

320
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,130
and he'll be fine.

321
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,990
But, Mr. Chi,

322
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
what exactly are

323
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,980
the Blood Ghost Pills?

324
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,600
Why does everyone

325
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,110
go pale

326
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,510
when they're mentioned?

327
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,920
They were created by Yique Yinyang,

328
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,110
the former dynasty's Imperial Preceptor
and leader of the Jile Sect,

329
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,270
to control people.

330
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,680
To control people?

331
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,610
In the jianghu,

332
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,900
power has always been respected above all.

333
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,640
Who doesn't want

334
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,370
to excel and rise above others?

335
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,370
But not everyone

336
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,000
has the ability and talent.

337
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,390
Greed knows no bounds.

338
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,480
The weak crave power,

339
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,190
and the strong

340
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,720
seek shortcuts
to become even stronger.

341
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,130
Those evil pills

342
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,070
can give your cultivation a huge boost.

343
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,070
So initially,

344
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,480
the Blood Ghost Pills

345
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,200
were treated

346
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,400
like a popular tonic.

347
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,350
But soon after,

348
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,200
people realized

349
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,260
they'd been duped.

350
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,830
Why?

351
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
Anyone who takes those pills

352
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,910
has to keep taking them for life.

353
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,260
If they stop,
they go mad and die.

354
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,090
So whoever has the Blood Ghost Pills

355
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,890
controls those people's lives.

356
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,300
Yique Yinyang

357
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,130
used this very method to seize control

358
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,520
of half the jianghu.

359
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,130
More than a year ago,

360
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,180
after arguing with my father,

361
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,100
I went to stay with Chuanxiang.

362
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,150
We lived together on Mount Huaxi,

363
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,550
practicing martial arts

364
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,830
and fighting for justice.

365
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,500
[Liulian Cottage]

366
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,970
During that time,

367
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,170
my martial skills improved dramatically.

368
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,030
I thought it was because

369
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,890
Chuanxiang was training with me.

370
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,170
But little did I know,

371
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,030
he was secretly taking evil pills

372
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,680
and mixing them into my food.

373
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,080
After I found out about this,

374
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,510
I confronted him
about why he spiked my food.

375
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,680
He wouldn't tell me.

376
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,130
He only told me to trust him,

377
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,370
saying he'd help me.

378
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,660
Jiang Cheng,

379
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
please trust me.

380
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
I will help you.

381
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,310
But I didn't want

382
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,310
that kind of help.

383
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,030
And I didn't need

384
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,960
to improve my skills

385
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,200
through such means.

386
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,350
After that,

387
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,840
I refused to take the pills again

388
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,030
and asked Chuanxiang

389
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,030
to help me suppress the poison in me.

390
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
But that process

391
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,600
was agonizing.

392
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,930
It was so painful
that just

393
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,330
thinking about it makes my mind go blank.

394
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,570
Then, six months ago,

395
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,360
Chuanxiang suddenly disappeared,

396
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,640
leaving me alone.

397
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,440
I searched everywhere

398
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,080
but couldn't find any trace of him.

399
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,860
So I carried
the remaining pills he had bought

400
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,440
and started

401
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,700
tracing their source,

402
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,990
which eventually led me

403
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,200
to Yang Shangqing.

404
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,470
So you feared

405
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,200
Yang Shangqing

406
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,530
might expose the truth,

407
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,790
ruining the reputation of Feng Chuanxiang,

408
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,790
the Westwind Swordsman.

409
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,440
That's why,

410
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,820
even at the risk of being

411
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,220
chased down by the Cloud,

412
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,780
you still killed him.

413
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,790
If I'd had

414
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,790
any other option,

415
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,920
I never would've taken the pill again.

416
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,350
Wind swept across the reed flowers;

417
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,790
moonlight shone on Mount Huaxi.

418
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,640
We...

419
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,580
we were such good friends.

420
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,680
Mr. Tang,

421
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,110
I want to find Chuanxiang

422
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,760
and ask him

423
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,920
why he did this to me.

424
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,990
We were friends who'd die for each other.

425
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,660
Why do we have to turn against each other?

426
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,910
Very well.

427
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,050
I understand.

428
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,740
You're fortunate.

429
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,640
Today,

430
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,030
I'm in a good mood.

431
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,010
I'll give you two choices.

432
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,860
Choice one:

433
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,420
you die now.

434
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,980
That way,

435
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,690
everyone in the jianghu

436
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,380
will immediately know

437
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,990
the Jiang family of Yanmen

438
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,640
colluded with the remnants
of the Jile Sect

439
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,800
and took evil pills.

440
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,790
Choice two:

441
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,840
I help you suppress the poison,

442
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,000
and you'll die in three months.

443
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,660
Then I'll consider

444
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,170
leaving Yanmen's reputation intact.

445
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,140
What's the condition?

446
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,380
That pipa player in black—

447
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,400
you've seen him, right?

448
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,610
He revealed clues

449
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,440
that led you to Yang Shangqing,

450
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,390
didn't he?

451
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,450
He looks exactly like you.

452
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,770
He killed a lot of people

453
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,560
and saved a lot of people too.

454
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,720
He's a madman.

455
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,360
Where is he?

456
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,950
He is nowhere

457
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,750
yet everywhere.

458
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,700
You won't find him.

459
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,030
He only appears

460
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,360
when he wants to see you.

461
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,600
Mr. Tang…

462
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,230
help me.

463
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,560
He can't help you.

464
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,230
Because he can barely protect himself.

465
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,070
Report!

466
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,080
Master Jiang,

467
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,030
we've spotted the young master

468
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,360
in the reed marsh ahead.

469
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,270
Foxy Tang!

470
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,470
Foxy Tang, what's going on?

471
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,680
Why is he dead?

472
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,470
Look.

473
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,890
What is that?

474
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,200
This is…

475
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,100
A curse bug.

476
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,680
Oh, no.

477
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,710
The Yanmen Sect

478
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,110
must think we killed him.

479
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,160
Mr. Tang,

480
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,790
we…

481
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,790
Foxy Tang,

482
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,120
Yanmen's goose formation

483
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,850
is quite famous in the jianghu.

484
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,910
Be careful. Don't…

485
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,750
Kill!

486
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,080
I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng.

487
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,440
I'm willing to go with you for punishment.

488
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,310
I plead guilty

489
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,600
and surrender myself.

490
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
Master Jiang, please temporarily

491
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,510
uphold justice for the Sword Sect.

492
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,370
Are you insane?

493
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,720
What do you mean?

494
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,120
This guy

495
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,020
is my accomplice.

496
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,850
Master,

497
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,290
I've completed

498
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,120
almost

499
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,440
all the tasks you gave me.

500
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,070
Now, you are

501
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,390
the esteemed Master of Fengliu Shop.

502
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,710
Tang Lici is just a nobody

503
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,040
hiding in a ruined temple in Yan County.

504
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,710
You could even

505
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,310
kill Shao Yanping

506
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,510
from the Sword Sect

507
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,370
without breaking a sweat if you wish.

508
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,620
Forgive my ignorance,

509
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,400
but why don't you

510
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,060
just kill Tang Lici outright?

511
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,840
So why go through

512
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
all this trouble?

513
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
What's the point

514
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,680
in killing a monster like him?

515
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,400
He can't be killed,

516
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,010
and he has no humanity.

517
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,640
Tang Lici is certainly a monster.

518
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,230
Hua Wuyan, am I right?

519
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,900
Miss Hong.

520
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,989
Master,

521
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,989
you can't let him

522
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,420
die so easily.

523
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,070
If I can kill him once,

524
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,730
I can kill him a second time.

525
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,850
Hong,

526
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,670
tell me—

527
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,469
how should I kill him this time?

528
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:00,969
Naturally,

529
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,440
you should make him feel what you felt,

530
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,940
suffer what you suffered,

531
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,250
ensure he's condemned by all,

532
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,580
and completely ruin his name.

533
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,330
In the end,

534
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,630
let him die miserably

535
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,840
amid the curses of thousands.

536
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,690
Someone help!

537
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,630
I'm not his accomplice!

538
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,990
I'm just a passerby!

539
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,070
Let me out!

540
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,220
I'm innocent, I swear!

541
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,440
Look at the Yanmen Sect.

542
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,890
People are in cages

543
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,320
while birds are outside.

544
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,190
It's truly a sect

545
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,650
with no respect for rules.

546
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,650
This really has

547
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,960
opened my eyes.

548
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,470
Chi Yun,

549
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,720
be quiet.

550
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,840
What?

551
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,050
You have a plan?

552
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,590
My ears hurt.

553
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,110
You…

554
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,030
Following you

555
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,960
has brought me the worst luck ever!

556
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
"I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng."

557
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,990
Are you insane?

558
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,190
If you wanted to come in here,

559
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,550
you could've come alone.

560
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,010
Why did you bring me along?

561
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,930
I was afraid of being bored alone.

562
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,670
Why are you still carrying that thing?

563
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,870
This is his curse bug.

564
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,030
Your mortal enemy?

565
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,070
Besides him,

566
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,630
who else could have

567
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,090
used something like this?

568
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,360
Even if that's true,

569
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,400
you can't be at the end of your rope.

570
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
Why don't you think about

571
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,930
what his plan might be?

572
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,920
To frame you?

573
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,470
He first framed you

574
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,530
for killing Hao Wenhou and his family

575
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,090
and then pinned
Jiang Cheng's murder on you.

576
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
That's right.

577
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,600
What's right?

578
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,520
Now, unless the dead come back to life,

579
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,370
no one…

580
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,070
can prove

581
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,400
my innocence.

582
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,530
What are they doing?

583
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,110
That...

584
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,070
Foxy Tang,

585
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,470
they're about to boil us alive.

586
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,030
You're too noisy.

587
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,970
I'm starting
to regret bringing you in here.

588
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,050
Stop carving that wood!

589
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,920
Think of something!

590
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,530
They'll cook you in a bit

591
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,990
and eat you in 18 ways.

592
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,700
Neither of us will escape.

593
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,860
Think of something?

594
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,390
Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

595
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,150
Then you...

596
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,320
Because I never planned

597
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,380
to get out on my own.

598
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,000
Tang Lici,

599
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,260
you're insane, aren't you?

600
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,470
You truly are insane! I'm certain now.

601
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,800
You are insane!

602
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,630
You…

603
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,890
Mr. Jiang, please believe me.

604
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,920
I swear on my honor as a disciple

605
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,850
of the Sword Sect

606
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,670
that I'm telling the truth.

607
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,320
Enough!

608
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,630
Miss Zhong,

609
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,110
what you're saying is

610
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,910
simply too shocking to believe.

611
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,160
Cheng…

612
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,110
he was my elder brother's

613
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,150
only son.

614
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,670
I practically

615
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,800
watched him grow up.

616
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,260
I know his character well.

617
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,760
How could he possibly

618
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,620
have taken that kind of evil pill?

619
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,250
The evil pills have begun to spread again.

620
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,550
Mr. Tang was

621
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,280
actually helping him

622
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,480
suppress the poison.

623
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,520
Miss Shei can testify to this.

624
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,110
Yes.

625
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,310
Are you done talking?

626
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,420
I know,

627
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,910
Master Jiang,

628
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,760
after losing your son,

629
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,320
you're very…

630
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,650
Have you ever lost a son?

631
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,760
Then what do you know?

632
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,990
You know nothing!

633
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,750
Brother.

634
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,070
Brother.

635
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,870
Master Jiang.

636
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,910
Master Jiang!

637
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,830
Master Jiang.

638
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,000
There must be a reason

639
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,640
why Jiang Cheng took the pills.

640
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,020
It's up to you
to uncover the truth

641
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,110
and clear his name.

642
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,720
If you let grief blind you

643
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,840
to the truth and evidence,

644
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,960
aren't you just playing right into

645
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,360
the real killer's hands?

646
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,960
I saw with my own eyes

647
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,330
Cheng's body explode

648
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,550
in front of Tang Lici.

649
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,330
Tang Lici has admitted it herself!

650
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,630
What more proof

651
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,720
do you need?

652
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,800
Today, I'll make sure

653
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,190
that the murderer Tang Lici

654
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,760
will suffer Yanmen's

655
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,820
Three Cuts and Six Stabs Punishment.

656
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,840
If it turns out later that I killed

657
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,760
the wrong man,

658
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,960
I'll take my own life

659
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,840
to atone for it.

660
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,330
Light the fire!

661
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,630
If they

662
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,280
really put me on that burning stake,

663
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,720
I'll fight my way out of here.

664
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,630
Chi Yun,

665
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,250
a lot of times,

666
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,780
only when you hit rock bottom

667
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,440
does a way out finally appear.

668
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,690
What's happening?

669
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,700
Such a nice fragrance.

670
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,440
The scent of magnolia.

671
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,630
No,

672
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,510
not flowers.

673
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,500
It's sword energy.

674
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,660
Only one person
has this kind of sword energy.

675
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,880
Who?

676
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,630
The one

677
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,180
who vanished long ago—

678
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,920
the Westwind Swordsman,

679
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,730
Feng Chuanxiang.

680
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,850
Mr. Feng?

681
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,190
I heard

682
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,190
you'd gone missing,

683
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,450
and I found it strange.

684
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,570
With such exceptional skills,

685
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,360
how could you

686
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,490
have just vanished?

687
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,720
I did encounter some problems.

688
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,320
Are you here today

689
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,470
to see Cheng?

690
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,450
Cheng has been killed.

691
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,850
I know.

692
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,550
Then why did you

693
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,750
extinguish the fire?

694
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,360
I was going to

695
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
make the murderer

696
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,390
suffer the Three Cuts
and Six Stabs Punishment

697
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,670
before burning him to ashes

698
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,760
to honor Cheng's spirit in heaven.

699
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,670
Understand?

700
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,150
I can say with certainty,

701
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,990
Master Jiang,

702
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,110
that Cheng's death
is part of

703
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,440
something much bigger.

704
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,940
Cheng and I were close friends.

705
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,200
I'd never
deceive you

706
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,730
about something like this.

707
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,170
You know something?

708
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,840
There is indeed something off.

709
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
If you're willing

710
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
to trust me,

711
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,520
would you allow me

712
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,880
to investigate it?

713
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,840
Brother,

714
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,610
isn't that Cheng's…

715
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,770
Master Jiang,

716
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,040
do you believe me now?

717
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,200
What do you want?

718
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,360
I want…

719
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,430
Mr. Tang.

720
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,360
I need

721
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,990
to think it over carefully.
