Whatever works is a good strategy.

Why would I need

your approval?

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,630
Using money to buy loyalty

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,460
is not a good start.

141
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,710
Without any benefit,

142
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,120
you expect those disciples

143
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
to risk their lives fighting evil.

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,320
Is that fair?

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,370
Using profit as bait

146
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,630
will lead to betrayal for profit.

147

The Evil Pill spreads its poison

148
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,770
precisely because of human greed

149
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,700
and delusions of instant success.

150
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,690
Pursuing benefits and avoiding harm

151
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,900
is human nature.

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,910
Isn't it a bit harsh

153
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,240
to hold ordinary people

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
to a sage's standard?

155
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,200
This is what they call,
"With great rewards

157

Eliminating evil completely
is indeed my wish.

171

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,510
It's so dark here,

174
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,600
making us look like

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,660
we're plotting something sinister.

176
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,850
Master Puzhu dislikes crowded places.

177
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,360
The deeper one is in darkness,

178
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,200
the more one craves for light.

179
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,830
With enemies at our doorstep,

180
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,100
if the Sword Alliance
needs anything in the future,

181
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,760
just send someone to inform me.

182
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,380
I will go to Wanhua Hall

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
to discuss matters with you.

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,390
Great.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,930
I never expected

186
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,690
Master Puzhu to be

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,180
someone who knows how to be flexible.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,490
To raid Fengliu Shop's strongholds,

189
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,620
I'll lead by example

190
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,250
and go ahead first.

191
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,750
Perfect.

192
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,550
Deputy Lord Yu

193
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,870
has just arrived at the Sword Alliance
with his people.

194
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,870
I'll go with you to see him.

195
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Master Puzhu,

196
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,450
is it really so unbearable for you

197
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,790
to work alongside me?

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,910
I've heard

199
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,920
that the disciples
of the Tianjing Pavilion

200
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,200
must practice meditation and tolerance.

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,670
How is it

202
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,040
that you don't need to practice these?

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Farewell. Farewell.

204
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,570
I wish you good luck on your journey.

205
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,020
If Master Cheng

206
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,600
also wants to talk about

207
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,190
approval

208
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,410
or other clichés,

209
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,750
I already know it.

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
Perhaps you do have the skills

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,870
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

212
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,390
But with your personality,

213
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,790
you can't inherit
the Seven‑String True Tune

214
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,790
of Fang Zhou.

215
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
Fang Zhou

216
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,610
was a man of integrity,

217
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,120
but in the end,

218
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,240
apart from people's respect,

219
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,410
what else did he get?

220
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Asking such a question shows

221
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,250
you don't understand
Fang Zhou well enough.

222
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,400
I don't want to be Fang Zhou.

223
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,290
You can't be him either.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
You're suspected of being Yique Yinyang.

225
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,790
Though after the battle at Biluo Palace,

226
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,690
this suspicion was temporarily dispelled,

227
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,620
but with your methods and actions,

228
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,030
no one can guarantee

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,750
that you won't become the next

230
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,750
Yique Yinyang.

231
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
You are a threat

232
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,770
to the Sword Alliance.

233
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,270
Tang Lici.

234
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
I'll be watching you.

235
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,970
You asked me before

236
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,000
if I've ever killed the wrong person
with my sword.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,860
Perhaps I have,

238
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
but I have no regrets.

239
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,370
For all my mistakes,

240
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,390
I will atone in hell.

241
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,410
Why are you laughing?

242
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,630
Master Cheng, your words

243
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,870
sound so resolute.

244
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,870
Have you

245
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,930
moved yourself with your own speech?

246
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,920
However,

247
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,560
your desire to atone is one-sided.

248
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,250
Have you considered

249
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,160
whether those souls in hell

250
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,870
are willing to give you

251
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,270
a chance for redemption?

252
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,360
Mr. Tang.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,330
Master Shao, you haven't slept all night.

254
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,690
The turmoil in the jianghu hasn't settled,

255
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,620
making it impossible to rest easy.

256
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Forgive my boldness,

257
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,490
are you and the owner of the Fengliu Shop
Liu Yan

258
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,210
disciples of the same master?

259
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,780
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

260
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,720
was our senior.

261
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,150
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

262
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,410
was a man of principle.

263
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,570
My master Jiangnan Feng and he

264
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,010
once fought fiercely at Tiandu Peak,

265
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,510
together resisting
Yique Yinyang's rebellion.

266
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,970
Mr. Tang,
since you've inherited his legacy

267
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,660
and are willing to join us,

268
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,760
you must also have the desire
to help the world.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
But my purpose

270
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
has never been peace in the jianghu.

271
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,720
That's not contradictory.

272
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,790
Didn't you once tell

273
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,080
Master Puzhu

274
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,790
that even those with different paths
can work together?

275
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,720
As long as our current goals align,

276
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,480
why not journey together for a while?

277
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,150
Rest assured,
since we're traveling together,

278
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,120
I will handle

279
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,310
all Sword Alliance matters properly.

280
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,240
However,

281
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,150
my methods in the future

282
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,550
may be even more unacceptable
to ordinary people.

283
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,080
You

284
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,940
might not have peace and quiet
for some time.

285
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,280
Everyone,

286
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,630
don't be hasty!

287
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,320
Let's talk things through slowly!

288
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Tang Lici!

289
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,280
Take it easy. Calm down.

290
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,060
Let's talk this through.

291
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,970
Sword Masters.

292
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,510
What's the matter?

293
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,800
You've made a mistake in this decree.

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm in charge of the Service Hall,

295
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,720
not the Investigation Hall.

296
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,450
And mine too.

297
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,170
If you transfer me elsewhere,

298
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,230
what will happen to my cases
at the Investigation Hall?

299
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,950
Whatever you have received

300
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,000
is what you should follow.

301
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,510
You don't understand the Sword Alliance,

302
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,000
so please stop messing things up.

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,910
If you turn

304
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,750
the Sword Alliance into chaos

305
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,790
and then just walk away,

306
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,250
what are we supposed to do?

307
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Mr. Tang,

308
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,640
even though you were

309
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,120
invited by
our Ancestor's divine revelation,

310
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,320
you still

311
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
can't be so arbitrary

312
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,790
and autocratic.

313
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,920
Master Jiang,

314
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,870
during your supervision of disciples,

315
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,440
their efficiency was poor,

316
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,790
and complaints were widespread.

317
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,920
The reason for this,

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
in my opinion,

319
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,620
is that you prioritized
personal relationships

320
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,080
and lacked decisiveness.

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,540
Master Shangguan,

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
you were responsible
for the Sword Alliance's finances,

323
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,290
yet for all these years,

324
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,580
the Sword Alliance
has been operating at a loss,

325
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
due to your poor management skills.

326
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,360
Master Pu,

327
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,320
as for your Investigation Hall,

328
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,080
30 cold cases in the jianghu

329
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,980
show absolutely no progress in a year.

330
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,030
The Sword Alliance's reputation

331
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,430
has greatly diminished.

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,650
It's because you

333
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,170
failed to investigate even minor issues.

334
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,980
That's just empty talk.

335
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,790
The Sword Alliance's dossiers
for the past decade

336
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,520
are all here.

337
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,870
Every word I've said

338
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,390
is backed by evidence.

339
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,910
He's gone through 10 years of records?

340
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,510
Doesn't this man ever sleep?

341
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,920
I know.

342
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,130
You've all done your best.

343
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,840
However,

344
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,320
some matters,

345
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,310
like opposing the Fengliu Shop,

346
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
aren't just about effort

347
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,550
or determination to succeed.

348
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,550
Let's try this arrangement
for half a month.

349
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,550
Whether it works or is appropriate

350
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,910
will become clear

351
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,720
after that time.

352
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,970
What if your arrangement
proves even worse?

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I will step down

354
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,310
and leave the Sword Alliance.

355
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,569
That's not necessary.

356
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,800
Really not necessary.

357
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,160
You said it yourself.

358
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,060
Well then,

359
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,069
let's follow Mr. Tang's arrangement

360
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,730
and give it a try.

361
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,990
It's only half a month.

362
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,010
The time will pass quickly.

363
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,680
Fine.

364
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,000
Since I've come to the Sword Alliance,

365
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,420
I won't be leaving again.

366
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,620
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

367
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,790
Master.

368
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,340
We found that Tang Lici

369
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,030
has taken over the Sword Alliance.

370
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,290
He's gathering forces

371
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,650
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

372
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,440
Also,

373
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,750
the item you requested

374
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,920
is ready.

375
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,750
Tang Lici.

376
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,440
I know how to get

377
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,040
the Rebirth Scroll from you.

378
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll go to the Sword Alliance now

379
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,950
to bring you a special gift.

380
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,050
Let's go. Let's go.

381
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,750
Fan.

382
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,750
Are you also here
to join the Sword Alliance

383
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,070
to fight against the Fengliu Shop?

384
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,590
Yes.

385
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,720
There are so many martial artists

386
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
coming today.

387
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,590
This time we'll surely succeed.

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,210
This time we can definitely
stand against the Fengliu Shop.

389
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,200
He's blocked the road again.

390
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Such a troublemaker.

391
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,350
Indeed.

392
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,480
You two can't even catch

393
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,340
a single child?

394
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,730
Stop, stop!

395
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,880
Stop, stop!

396
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,610
Leave this to me.

397
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,800
This is called martial arts.

398
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,860
You've built so many stone fortresses.

399
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,920
Are you trying to hide inside them
to protect yourself?

400
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,920
But

401
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,290
stones can't protect you.

402
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,690
You need to protect them instead.

403
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,050
I want to teach him to read first,

404
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,850
then teach him our martial arts.

405
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,270
One day,

406
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,400
you will use them

407
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,270
to protect what matters to you.

408
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,390
I can teach you martial arts.

409
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,170
With martial arts,

410
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,150
in the future,

411
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,630
you'll be able to protect these stones.

412
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,930
However,

413
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,920
you must promise me.

414
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,080
You can only stack stones here.

415
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,610
You can't block other people's paths.

416
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,150
You don't understand anything.

417
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Then I'll teach you
the "Three Character Classic" first.

418
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,880
Men.

419
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,750
On.

420
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,750
Earth.

421
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,350
Good.

422
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,160
At.

423
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,010
Today I'll teach you
to recognize characters.

424
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,720
It reads "Man on earth, good at birth."

425
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,720
It means

426
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,850
when we are born,

427
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,830
we are all good people.

428
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,440
The reason some people become bad later

429
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,730
is that they are influenced by bad things.

430
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,830
So, Lici,

431
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,990
you must believe that in your heart,

432
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,950
there is always love.

433
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,110
Man on earth.

434
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,440
Man on earth.

435
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,680
Good at birth.

436
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Good at birth.

437
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,960
Lici,

438
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,100
you're learning very well.

439
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,200
Lici,

440
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,770
resist the urge

441
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,500
to knock over this sandcastle.

442
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,090
People do bad things

443
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,830
because they're influenced by bad things.

444
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,490
That's why they do bad things.

445
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,240
Understand?

446
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,270
Tang Lici.

447
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,440
Damn the Central Plains Sword Alliance!

448
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,270
We've had several

449
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,200
of our strongholds raided!

450
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,800
And you just wait here
without doing anything!

451
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,000
East Palace Chief.

452
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,910
When will you understand

453
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,270
that anger solves nothing?

454
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,310
Am I angry?

455
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,880
Am I that angry?

456
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,370
Where is Master?

457
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
Where has Master gone at a time like this?

458
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,700
Is our Fengliu Shop

459
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,720
just going to be bullied like this?

460
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,360
If you don't want to wait
for Master to return,

461
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,200
you can go face them yourself.

462
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,680
Fine, I'll go!

463
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,910
If I go,

464
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,350
what about you?

465
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,270
I'll stay here

466
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,950
waiting for Master to return.

467
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,750
Give me a break.

468
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,070
Don't think that if Master and I died,

469
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,750
you could become the new Master

470
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,400
and be equal to Leader.

471
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,160
Keep dreaming!

472
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,670
What's all this noise about?

473
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,110
Greetings, Master.

474
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,770
Greetings, Master.

475
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,740
Fucui.

476
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,790
You thought I was dead just now,

477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,780
didn't you?

478
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,550
No, no, no.

479
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,920
Not at all.

480
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,190
I just feel

481
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,550
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

482
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,030
is taking a mile when given an inch.

483
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,290
They're going too far.

484
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
I was just upset for a moment.

485
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,640
Fucui actually managed to say

486
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,930
2 idioms in one breath.

487
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,660
I guess pressure does
bring out quick thinking.

488
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,480
Xifang Tao!

489
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:27,710
You...

490
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,880
Master.

491
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,320
Since Tang Lici

492
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,830
became the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance,

493
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,510
he's raided our several

494
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,680
hidden places!

495
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,620
This time's loss is much greater

496
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,290
than that in Sword King City!

497
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,160
We can't just sit and wait for death.

498
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,360
We need to fight back!

499
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,530
What's the rush?

500
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,420
Hearts that can be bought with money

501
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,970
can just as easily be torn apart
by other means.

502
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,970
They've overestimated themselves

503
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,460
and also underestimated me

504
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,890
and the Fengliu Shop.

505
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,550
Take this

506
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,740
to mobilize our people.

507
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,000
Master.

508
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,030
Chunji, you're back.

509
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,330
Let me have a look at you.

510
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,520
Very good.

511
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,280
Very good.

512
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,430
Chunji, your leadership of the disciples

513
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,750
in raiding

514
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,880
the Fengliu Shop's strongholds

515
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,210
is extremely well done.

516
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,660
Thank you for your hard work.

517
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,920
This is simply my duty.

518
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,270
However, Master,

519
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,430
recently,

520
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,340
the Sword Alliance's reputation
has grown tremendously.

521
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,560
Every day, there are many new people

522
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,960
in the martial arts world joining us.

523
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,880
These newcomers

524
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
don't understand the rules
of the Sword Alliance yet.

525
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,030
They need someone

526
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,510
to guide and lead them.

527
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,590
So can I...

528
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,160
It's time to return
to the Shanfeng Branch.

529
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,680
Yes.

530
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,650
Now everyone knows

531
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,140
that Mr. Tang is innocent.

532
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
So what I did back then

533
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,860
wasn't really wrong, was it?

534
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,830
Have you forgotten?

535
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,230
Didn't I tell you before?

536
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,590
I punished you because you

537
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,610
released a suspect without permission.

538
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,700
That wasn't releasing a suspect at all.

539
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,970
It was clearly some Sword Masters

540
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,880
trying to take advantage

541
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,080
to replace me with their own disciples.

542
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Some things

543
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,880
are better left understood

544
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,790
but unspoken.

545
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,920
Alright.

546
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,350
Chunji,

547
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,750
the position of Shanfeng Branch Chief

548
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,880
is still vacant now.

549
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,240
As long as you take it step by step

550
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,580
and remain steady and reliable,

551
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,240
what's meant to be yours will be yours.

552
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
It's just not the right time yet.

553
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,070
Yes, yes.

554
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,570
I understand, Master.

555
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,340
I'm leaving.

556
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,540
I'm leaving.

557
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,530
Such a troublesome one.

558
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,970
Good. Next.

559
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,550
Thank you. Next.

560
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
What's your name?

561
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
How many people have come today?

562
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,750
Zhong.

563
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,760
You're back.

564
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,000
Ms. Zhong.

565
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,520
Today, we've had

566
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,070
160 people join

567
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,480
the Sword Alliance.

568
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,260
Including those still in line,

569
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,540
there are 200 more.

570
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
You can leave.

571
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,640
Our Sword Alliance

572
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,170
welcomes talented people,

573
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,830
but we don't accept just anyone

574
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,690
looking for free food and drinks.

575
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,810
That's not quite right.

576
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,610
I may be a nobody,

577
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,260
but I never cheat for food.

578
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,720
No sect, no martial arts skills.

579
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,690
[Master of Fate]
[Divine Fortune Teller]

580
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,110
If you don't mooch around
and cheat for a living,

581
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,240
what else can you do?

582
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,970
You really don't recognize me?

583
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,320
Should we know you?

584
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,640
Are we supposed to?

585
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
No, no.

586
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,410
Good.

587
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,060
Since we're strangers,

588
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,710
let me tell your fortune.

589
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,450
What's going on?

590
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,230
Senior Zhong.

591
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,550
He's a jianghu con artist.

592
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,680
We'll handle it right away.

593
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,080
Got it!

594
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,240
Li Dayou, 18 years old.

595
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,050
Born in the Year of the Pig.

596
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,110
Wrong.

597
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,680
His surname is Zhang.

598
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,480
Wait.

599
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,700
My birth father's surname was indeed Li.

600
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,750
It was after my mother remarried

601
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,440
that I changed my surname.

602
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
How did you know that?

603
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,350
I also know

604
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,210
you had good luck with money today,

605
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,400
but unfortunately,

606
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,030
you lost it all at once.

607
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,270
Wrong.

608
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,000
He made a mistake this morning

609
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,640
and was just fined a month's salary.

610
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I did find a money pouch.

611
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,960
It's worth more than my monthly salary.

612
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,830
It was you!

613
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,960
So my money pouch

614
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,030
was picked up by you.

615
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,550
Give it back to me now.

616
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,590
I found this.

617
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,550
How can you prove it's yours?

618
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,150
What disgraceful behavior.

619
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,360
I've heard

620
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,400
that the Sword Alliance has welcomed

621
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,060
a Guest of Honor surnamed Tang

622
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,110
and issued a notice.

623
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,200
It states that anyone with a skill,

624
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,330
of good character,

625
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,270
and willing to

626
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,310
resist the Fengliu Shop

627
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,030
and contribute to the cause

628
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,260
can join the Sword Alliance.

629
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Tell me,

630
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,510
I've traveled

631
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,550
over mountains and ridges to get here.

632
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,480
Doesn't that count for something?

633
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,750
The Sword Alliance's announcement
is certainly valid.

634
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,200
Please state your name first.

635
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,130
Thank you, Miss.

636
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,110
My name is Fang Zhou.

637
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,970
Pleased to meet you.

638
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
What's your name?

639
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,920
Fang Zhou.

640
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,790
Fang as in square.

641
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,680
Zhou as in boat.

642
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,510
Do you know

643
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,270
Head Fang of Zhoudi Tower

644
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,880
had the same name?

645
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,000
Well,

646
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,810
there's nothing I can do about it.

647
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,410
My parents gave me this name.

648
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,590
It's my honor
to share the same pronunciation

649
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,070
as Head Fang's name.

650
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,000
Surely Head Fang was generous enough

651
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,750
to tolerate someone like me.

652
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,550
Besides,

653
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200
Head Fang's "Zhou" means

654
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,350
encompassing the world,

655
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,460
while my "Zhou" is just

656
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,110
a lonely boat drifting

657
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,790
in this vast universe.

658
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Even so,

659
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,630
I kindly advise you

660
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,360
if you meet Mr. Tang,

661
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,560
you'd better

662
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,830
not mention your name.

663
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,550
Why?

664
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,850
Just because my name is also Fang Zhou?

665
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,920
There are countless people
with the same name.

666
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,070
Besides me, there must be

667
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,750
thousands of other Fang Zhous.

668
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,720
Are you saying

669
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,850
Mr. Tang can't stand to see any of them?

670
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,600
Is he really that arbitrary
and domineering?

671
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,510
Yeah.

672
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,160
That's too domineering.

673
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,310
That's so unreasonable.

674
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,160
How is Mr. Tang being arbitrary
and domineering?

675
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,830
You don't know him,

676
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,230
so don't speak nonsense.

677
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,690
This is indeed my fault.

678
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,960
I apologize to you, Miss.

679
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,780
Alright, alright.

680
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,110
We don't stand on ceremony
at the Sword Alliance.

681
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,110
Go get your disciple uniform first.

682
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,400
Thank you very much, Miss.

683
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,030
Don't go! Read my fortune!

684
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,750
Tell my fortune!

685
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,480
Don't rush. Don't rush.

686
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,480
One at a time.

687
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,590
Good.

688
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,790
Obviously,

689
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,850
this is a diagram of human meridians.

690
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,740
So today,

691
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,890
I'll be explaining to everyone

692
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,590
how the modified version

693
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,640
of the Blood Ghost Pill
from the Fengliu Shop

694
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,300
causes harm to the human body.

695
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,070
Of course,
my explanation might be insufficient.

696
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,530
Shen will fill in the gaps.

697
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,180
What's the difference

698
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,590
between the current Blood Ghost Pill

699
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,960
and the poison pill
spread by the Jile Sect

700
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,220
from over a decade ago?

701
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,070
The former is more potent,
and its toxicity is more concealed.

702
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,920
The one who refined the poison pill
is not anyone else

703
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
but the current Master

704
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,000
of the Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

705
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,960
Fine, fine.

706
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,620
The underworld is giving a lesson
to the upright people.

707
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,070
Indeed, when you live long enough,

708
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,400
you'll see everything.

709
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,590
Among these people,

710
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,240
only Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

711
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,830
fought against people

712
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,960
who took the new Evil Pill.

713
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,490
The poison pill he modified

714
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,550
can make the user's power

715
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,790
increase more than tenfold.

716
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,880
You sneaky fox,

717
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,970
always appearing out of nowhere.

718
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,480
I heard

719
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,200
a fortune teller
joined the Sword Alliance.

720
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,000
Why don't you go see him?

721
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,790
A fortune teller?

722
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,720
I saw you and Shei

723
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,790
whispering by the stream.

724
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,110
I'm saying you should go see him too,

725
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,640
to see if someone as ice-cold as you

726
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,900
can turn into a softie.

727
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,830
It's over. It's over.

728
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,270
It's all over. It's all over.

729
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
You'll soon face a bloody disaster.

730
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
How can I avoid it?
Do you have any magic charms?

731
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Magic charms?

732
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,310
Of course not.

733
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,030
Just don't go outside,

734
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,090
and you'll be fine.

735
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,400
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

736
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,530
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

737
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,880
That won't work.

738
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,310
We have to get up at dawn

739
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,880
to practice sword formations.

740
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,750
This was arranged

741
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,880
by Mr. Tang.

742
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,510
He makes you get up at dawn?

743
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,640
-Yes.
-That's right.

744
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,340
Yes.

745
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,990
What is Mr. Tang thinking?

746
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,740
What's on Mr. Tang's mind?

747
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
How would ordinary disciples like us

748
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
know?

749
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,310
Could you decipher this for us?

750
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,370
Yes.

751
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,070
Please do us a favor.

752
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,830
Please.

753
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,680
Let me try.

754
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
If you want to know what's on my mind,

755
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,550
why don't you ask me directly?

756
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,940
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

757
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,230
You haven't paid yet.

758
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,380
Interesting.

759
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,510
Welcome.

760
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,830
Would you like your future read

761
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,430
or your lifespan predicted?

762
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,940
My surname is Fang,
courtesy name Pingzhai,

763
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,790
and nickname Carefree.

764
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,100
So Mr. Carefree Fang,

765
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,290
your profession is fortune-telling?

766
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,320
Just a humble skill.

767
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,000
It's not even one-tenth

768
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
of what I've learned.

769
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,910
By the way,

770
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,730
let me formally introduce myself.

771
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,310
My surname is Fang, given name Zhou,

772
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,870
and courtesy name Pingzhai.

773
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,720
Pleased to meet you.

774
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
What did you say your name is?

775
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,520
I am

776
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,270
Fang Zhou.

777
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,150
You don't stay in Fallen Shisan Tower.

778
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,710
Why have you come to the Sword Alliance?

779
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,389
You know,
the Sword Alliance is open to all.

780
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,790
If you can come

781
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,190
and Shen can come,

782
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,760
why can't I come?

783
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,630
I also wish to follow the righteous path.

784
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,480
What do you want?

785
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,710
Mr. Tang,

786
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,880
you have a supreme martial art technique

787
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
called the Rebirth Scroll.

788
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,070
Endless Secrets of Heaven and Earth,

789
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,280
Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

790
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,080
You've given yourself away.

791
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,320
Chief Fang.

792
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,320
Fallen Shisan Tower.

793
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,840
Chief Fang of Dieban Chonghua.

794
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,540
What do you want with the Rebirth Scroll?

795
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,030
You claim to join the righteous path,

796
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,880
yet you're here for

797
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,120
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique.

798
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,560
I've been exposed.

799
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,150
Why don't you just play along with me

800
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,840
for a while?

801
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,780
But come to think of it,

802
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,760
you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique,

803
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
and you've become

804
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,890
a Guest of Honor of the Sword Alliance.

805
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,540
Is there a problem?

806
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,300
Forget it.

807
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,320
Since the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance can't offer it,

808
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
I'd like to see

809
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,320
whether Master Liu
from the Fengliu Shop will give it to me.

810
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,380
Stay away from him.

811
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,150
Otherwise,

812
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
I'll make sure

813
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,340
you'll get it but won't live to use it.

814
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,360
Mr. Tang, I've read your fortune.

815
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,450
The results are surprising.

816
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,340
You're not a human of this world

817
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,480
but a fox demon.

818
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,090
Then you should also know

819
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,030
that fox demons excel at

820
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,200
gutting humans

821
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,150
and digging out their hearts

822
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,930
to examine them closely

823
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,910
to see if they're loyal or treacherous.

824
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,690
Why is it you again?

825
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,230
We hired you

826
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,630
not to deceive others.

827
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,280
Mr. Tang,

828
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,000
did he

829
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,050
tell you any nonsense?

830
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,190
Ms. Zhong,

831
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,600
long time no see.

832
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,210
Long time no see.

833
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,570
Don't worry, Miss.

834
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,880
Mr. Tang

835
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,950
has found me a good job.

836
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
I won't be fortune-telling anymore.

837
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,680
That's right.

838
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,380
A job very suitable for Mr. Fang.

839
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,800
During your time working
at the Service Hall,

840
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
I hope you

841
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,030
can think carefully

842
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,490
whether you want to be honest

843
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,600
with me or not.

844
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,190
You want me to do odd jobs?

845
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,190
Do them properly.

846
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,440
When did you return, Ms. Zhong?

847
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,690
About 2 days ago.

848
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,710
Master said you were busy.

849
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,920
If I hadn't seen you
while passing by just now,

850
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,880
I wouldn't have come to bother you again.

851
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,080
Even if we hadn't met,

852
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,810
I would come looking for you anyway.

853
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,960
I heard

854
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,530
that you lost your position

855
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,520
as Branch Chief
of the Shanfeng Branch because of me.

856
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
I lost my position

857
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,280
because someone else wanted it.

858
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,000
Mr. Tang, you don't need

859
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,930
to take everything upon yourself.

860
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,960
I just

861
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,800
feel it's unfair.

862
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,790
There's no such thing as fair or unfair.

863
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,670
It has always been about

864
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,530
whether others choose you or not.

865
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,630
I think

866
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,150
Master Shao must

867
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,680
have his own difficulties.

868
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,960
Ms. Zhong.

869
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,180
Come with me to a place.

870
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,120
Let's go.

871
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
The food is ready.

872
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,050
And the wine is here.

873
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,190
Did you twist your ankle, Miss Shei?

874
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,920
Take it easy.

875
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,320
Ms. Zhong.

876
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,230
Zhong.

877
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,030
Ms. Zhong.

878
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,510
Everyone's here.

879
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,400
Why are you so late?

880
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,590
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

881
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,590
Shen and I finished our lessons ages ago.

882
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,430
Those Sword Masters
kept asking us questions.

883
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,270
They asked me.

884
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,150
You couldn't explain it clearly.

885
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,630
Ms. Zhong,

886
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,980
please sit down.

887
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Come, have a seat.

888
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,670

I

892
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,280

When we battle against the Fengliu Shop,

896
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,730
Yanmen Sect will lead the charge,

897

This is the finest wine from Yanmen.

Frosty Leaves' Red.

No.

I just feel

951
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,330

since I last saw everyone.

953
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,150
The last time we went to Sword King City

seems like it happened in a previous life.

955

I'd like to toast everyone.

we should always drink together.

958
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,290
You always know what to say.

959
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,530
You seem very happy tonight, Ms. Zhong.

960
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,180
Why is it you again?

961
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,710
Do you need something?

962
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,760
I asked you first.

963
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,840
So you should answer me first.

964
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,430
Of course I'm happy.

965
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,960
Your turn.

966
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,440
I don't have anything specific.

967
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,880
Why?

968
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,490
Can't I chat with you without a reason?

969
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,790
You're so strange.

970
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,760
If you came to the Sword Alliance

971
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,090
with other intentions,

972
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,250
I suggest

973
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,420
you leave now.

974
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,970
You're quite perceptive.

975
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,230
Fine.

976
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,390
I'll tell you.

977
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,480
I came to the Sword Alliance

978
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,960
to see

979
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,110
the true face of the fox demon.

980
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,590
Why?

981
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,820
Why?

982
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,760
Because...

983
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,290
Mr. Tang is indeed detestable and hateful,

984
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
but I must admit

985
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,000
that he does have a captivating charm.

986
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,150
It makes one unable to resist

987
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,000
falling deeply for him.

988
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,280
You dare to provoke Mr. Tang?

989
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,510
Aren't you afraid
that you'll bring disaster upon yourself?

990
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,880
It's the danger that makes it attractive.

991
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,880
You

992
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,210
understand this feeling best, don't you?

993
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,240
What are you talking about?

994
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,280
What I want to say is,

995
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,960
to get his attention,

996
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
you can't follow the ordinary path.

997
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,760
You need to be the most special person.

998
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,920
Don't let yourself need him;

999
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,690
make him need you instead.

1000
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,300
What's between Mr. Tang and me

1001
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
is none of your business.

1002
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,510
To be honest,

1003
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,240
I've read your fortune too.

1004
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,840
Your destiny shows weak family bonds

1005
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,510
and no power or wealth.

1006
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,630
What others are born with,

1007
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,230
you must fight desperately to obtain—

1008
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,630
only then might you stand a slim chance
of getting it.

1009
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,490
If you miss just one opportunity,

1010
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,320
you'll lose everything.

1011
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,440
Mr. Fang, do you think

1012
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,260
I would believe your words?

1013
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,170
It doesn't matter if you don't.

1014
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,230
But if I were you,

1015
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,440
with such a fate,

1016
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,480
I would contentedly

1017
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,880
be an ordinary disciple

1018
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,320
and marry a simple, honest man.

1019
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,370
Why struggle for more?

1020
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,320
What if I insist on struggling?

1021
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,960
Then I can help you.

1022
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,320
I don't need it.

1023
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,920
Think carefully,

1024
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,170
Ms. Zhong.

1025
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,770
A letter from Shisan Tower.

1026
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,650
The Peach of Three Hues in Pink Attire.

1027
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,190
She is Xifang Tao.

1028
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,350
Hand it to Godfather personally.

1029
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,370
Bring back his reply.

1030
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,020
Aren't you going
to ask what this is about?

1031
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,080
I don't have Chi Yun's curiosity.

1032
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,630
The more you know,

1033
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,090
the sooner you die.

1034
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,210
Sometimes,

1035
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,320
the more you know,

1036
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,280
the better your chances.

1037
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,320
Fang Pingzhai,

1038
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,000
your true identity

1039
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,480
is about to be revealed.
