[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,480
Miss Tao.

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,259
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Miss Tao's talent, appearance,

6
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,810
wisdom,

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,620
and martial skills

8
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,220
are all top-tier in this era.

9
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,340
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

10
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,120
Sir, are you trying

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,520
to compliment my beauty?

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,759
You certainly possess

13
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,960
beauty to be proud of.

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,400
But that is not my question.

15
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,950
After being friends for so many years,

16
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,900
you've only now decided
to have a heart-to-heart with me.

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,790
But if you want to know

18
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,120
someone else's secret,

19
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,310
shouldn't you

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,840
reveal your own first?

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,630
I was, in fact,

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,110
the crown prince of the former dynasty.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,650
The current emperor

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,000
is my cousin.

25
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,710
You were the crown prince
of the former dynasty?

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,120
The chaos caused by Yique Yinyang

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,520
began because my father trusted traitors.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,500
Though I was the crown prince,

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,180
I failed to stop my father.

30
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,670
I could only watch helplessly

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,020
as people suffered terribly.

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,970
Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost.

33
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,560
Even if only a fraction of the blame
were mine,

34
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,090
I could never atone for it.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,520
That is why

36
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,180
I joined the Tianjing Pavilion
for cultivation.

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,290
Then you have even more reason to kill me.

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,640
Only by killing me
can you save more people.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,900
You are using your life as bait

40
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,870
just to see me

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,630
fall from grace?

42
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,520
For someone like you,

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,260
with such an unyielding will,

44
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,370
the sound of your collapse

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,640
will surely be clear and resounding.

46
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,360
While cultivating
in the Tianjing Pavilion,

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
because I regretted my own

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,079
inability to save those people,

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,520
my inner demon ran wild,

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,490
and I almost lost control.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,260
It was my master who told me

52
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,190
that every person

53
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,120
should have

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,380
a chance to start anew.

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,150
I am,

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,190
among all those still living,

57
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,610
the one who deserves death the most.

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,520
If I don't die,

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,560
then others certainly shouldn't.

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,210
If I cannot forgive others,

61
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,710
I certainly cannot forgive myself.

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,690
You always wear that bracelet.

63
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,230
Perhaps there's still goodness in you.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Master Puzhu,

65
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,519
what's inside these beads

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
is deadly poison—

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,800
cinnabar.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,050
It can be poison,

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,130
but it can also be medicine.

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,730
It all depends on your intention.

71
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,810
What are you doing?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you died here,

73
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,800
I'd be responsible for your death.

74
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,960
My legs are injured,

75
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,630
but my inner energy remains.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
If I heal your wounds,

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,980
you can escape.

78
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Don't forget,

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm the West Palace Chief
of the Fengliu Shop.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm not trying to convert anyone.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,290
I just don't want
any more blood on my hands.

82
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,720
If you commit evil again,

83
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,580
others will surely deal with you.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
But by then,

85
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,480
it may no longer be

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,140
something I can intervene in.

87
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,190
In the battle at the Peony Pavilion,

88
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,050
Xifang Tao did not show up either.

89
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,190
Either she and Master Puzhu

90
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,510
are still

91
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,420
locked in combat,

92
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
or

93
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,320
they've made peace.

94
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,920
Although we still

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
haven't found Master Puzhu,

96
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,870
in my view,

97
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,680
he and Xifang Tao

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,450
should both still be alive.

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,210
You fought in such a fierce battle.

100
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,670
Why didn't anyone call me?

101
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,480
How's the task

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,680
I asked you to do?

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,630
You won't believe it!

104
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm telling you,

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
good thing I went myself.

106
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,970
We'll talk about it later.

107
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,580
I'll take my leave now.

108
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,220
Let's go.

109
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,000
My journey

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
can only be described

111
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,560
as legendary.

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,310
I've been through endless hardship,

113
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,680
dealing with all kinds of creatures,

114
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,940
to complete your task.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,659
Let's just say—

116
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,220
my brains saved me.

117
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,390
I'm lucky to be alive to report back.

118
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,750
Guess who I ran into

119
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,600
at the Fallen Shisan Tower?

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
Qiaoyi Qiankun.

121
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,870
How did you know?

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,020
Were you secretly tailing me?

123
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,320
Wait.

124
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,340
Weren't you busy fighting
at the Peony Pavilion?

125
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,070
Fang Pingzhai has always been
full of wild ideas.

126
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,630
In this world, the only person

127
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,270
willing to daydream like him

128
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,310
must be

129
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,240
the equally crazy Qiaoyi Qiankun.

130
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,160
Whether it's Fang Pingzhai

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,390
or Qiaoyi Qiankun,

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,910
to the Fengliu Shop,

133
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,030
the two of them

134
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,780
are, at best, outside helpers.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,190
The one truly pulling the strings
behind all this

136
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,520
is likely someone else.

137
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,680
You have a point.

138
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,490
Then I bet you don't know

139
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,490
who brought Qiaoyi Qiankun there.

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,870
A child.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,120
The task is done.

142
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,590
Where's the thing I want?

143
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,159
As long as you hand it over,

144
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,560
things like defying fate

145
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,830
or turning back time won't be a problem.

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,070
Qiaoyi Qiankun seemed to have

147
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,930
just rushed over from somewhere.

148
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,000
I followed them to the Shisan Tower

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,430
and overheard them talking.

150
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,159
I didn't understand

151
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,110
what they were saying,

152
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,680
but I could tell

153
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,080
it wasn't anything good.

154
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,310
Something about miracles,

155
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,159
turning things upside down,

156
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,159
and defying fate.

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,870
Also,

158
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:05,870
that child was able to make

159
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,240
Qiaoyi Qiankun take him so seriously,

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,570
which is quite strange.

161
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,230
But you were right about one thing—

162
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,960
Fang Pingzhai really is crazy.

163
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
Behind Liu Yan,

164
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,930
there is indeed someone else.

165
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,750
He's so foolish to be manipulated

166
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,410
and yet think he's in control.

167
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,510
Mr. Yu?

168
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,480
I…

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,840
have something
to discuss with Mr. Tang privately.

170
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,590
Since when did you two

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
become so close?

172
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,549
What secret can't I hear?

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,169
Fine, talk all you want.

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,169
I'm going to eat.

175
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,169
Shei made dinner.

176
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,030
Come back soon.

177
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,010
Got it.

178
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,650
What is it you want to discuss, Mr. Yu?

179
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,030
Why…

180
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,800
didn't you expose me?

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,930
What do you mean?

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Back at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

183
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
I stabbed you.

184
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,030
I hated you for using Sword King City.

185
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,430
I had always doubted you.

186
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
I wanted revenge.

187
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,320
You knew that.

188
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,320
You only wanted

189
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
revenge, that's all.

190
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,010
If I were you,

191
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,150
I'd want revenge too.

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
In the jianghu,

193
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,630
revenge knows no right or wrong.

194
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,600
Tang Lici.

195
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,910
You keep showing kindness

196
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,200
to an enemy.

197
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,370
What is it you really want?

198
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,510
In the jianghu,

199
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,080
I have more enemies

200
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,550
than fish in a river.

201
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,080
Why would I

202
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,540
show kindness to an enemy?

203
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,930
If your heart were truly set,

204
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,590
if revenge was all you wanted,

205
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,600
then why,

206
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,870
after that strike,

207
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,600
did you stop?

208
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,120
And why didn't you join the Fengliu Shop

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,550
with Yu Qifeng?

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,260
Instead, you came back

211
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,960
to the Sword Alliance.

212
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,480
Mr. Yu.

213
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,120
That sword strike of yours

214
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
meant nothing

215
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,750
to me.

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,610
The Yanhuang Sword?

217
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,080
How did it

218
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,750
end up with you?

219
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
Back at Sword King City,

220
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,150
thanks to this sword,

221
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,700
the poisonous creature could be

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,360
suppressed within 500 zhang.

223
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,010
The city was thus saved
from complete ruin.

224
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,360
You truly do not need to credit me

225
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,690
with that achievement.

226
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,150
But…

227
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,420
if you cannot unleash this sword's power,

228
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,870
then you don't

229
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,000
even have the right

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,550
to speak of forgiving me.

231
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,010
Mr. Tang, you're here.

232
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,790
Master Shao, you wished to see me.

233
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,520
Is there something important?

234
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,200
Sit.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
It's just the two of us here.

236
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,510
Here.

237
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
No need to keep up the act.

238
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,240
This…

239
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,600
That blood you swallowed back
in the Wanhua Hall—

240
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,830
you can spit it out now.

241
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,710
I just did.

242
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,390
I'm not that fragile.

243
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,640
Thank you.

244
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
This battle has

245
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,680
greatly weakened the Sword Alliance.

246
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,840
The Fengliu Shop

247
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
suffered heavy losses too.

248
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,250
They'll have to lie low for a while.

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,480
So, right now, there's something else

250
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,000
that's far more important.

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,720
Mr. Tang,

252
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,510
the injuries you got at Biluo Palace

253
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,030
haven't fully healed, have they?

254
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,960
At the Peony Pavilion this time,

255
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
you were hurt again.

256
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,480
That's why

257
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
finding a great physician

258
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,670
to restore your strength

259
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,220
is of utmost importance.

260
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,150
After all, the peace of the jianghu

261
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,820
rests entirely on you.

262
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,910
I

263
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,270
can't possibly carry such a burden.

264
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,840
Mr. Tang,

265
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,370
you may not
have come for peace in the jianghu,

266
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
but I'll hand over Liu Yan

267
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,120
for you to deal with.

268
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,810
As expected,

269
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,480
Master Shao, you know well

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,720
how to negotiate.

271
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
You flatter me.

272
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,280
Mr. Tang, focus on healing.

273
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
As for the Sword Alliance's affairs,

274
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,460
leave them to me

275
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
and the other sword masters.

276
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,670
However,

277
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,880
great physicians mostly

278
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,430
live in seclusion.

279
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,320
Even if I want to find one,

280
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,510
there's nowhere to start looking.

281
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,720
Don't worry about that.

282
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
From what I've heard,

283
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
within our Sword Alliance,

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
there's actually someone

285
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,630
who's an old friend
of the incredible physician Shui Duopo.

286
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,670
If we can invite her

287
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,870
to the Sword Alliance,

288
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,550
that would be ideal.

289
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,260
The mountain wind's a bit chilly tonight.

290
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Have I

291
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,280
caught a cold?

292
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,270
Master Shao.

293
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,170
Mr. Tang.

294
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,630
-Master Shao.
-Master Shao.

295
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,830
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

296
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,980
Chang,

297
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,030
you've been practicing well lately.

298
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,030
I just saw you practicing.

299
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,240
You need to raise your arm

300
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,360
to make your punch more powerful.

301
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,080
Am I right?

302
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,630
Qi, you've grown taller.

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,780
Almost as tall
as your third senior brother.

304
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,720
Bao,

305
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,510
yesterday I saw you

306
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,240
throw away the green vegetables

307
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,100
from your meal.

308
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,720
Don't think I didn't notice.

309
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
So Master Shao,
you found me out after all.

310
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,080
Of course I did.

311
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,640
You really do
notice everything, Master Shao.

312
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,080
We'll head to bed then.

313
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,100
Go on, go to bed.

314
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,790
Let's go.

315
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,150
Young people these days

316
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,950
really should get out more

317
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,920
and spend some time with friends

318
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,610
instead of staying cooped up inside.

319
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,670
Chunji,

320
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,870
the kitchen made roast chicken tonight.

321
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,670
It smells amazing.

322
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,550
Have you eaten?

323
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,260
You need to eat something.

324
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,700
That's how your wounds will heal faster.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,870
Master,

326
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,410
I've already eaten.

327
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,360
Chunji.

328
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,790
What happened at the Peony Pavilion
wasn't your fault.

329
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,600
Master,

330
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,030
I'm tired.

331
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,320
Alright.

332
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,540
Get some rest then.

333
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,440
So,

334
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,910
your worry

335
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,720
is about Ms. Zhong.

336
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,080
I knew you'd figure it out.

337
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,870
That's why you deliberately

338
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,050
brought me here.

339
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,840
You saw it too.

340
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Chunji has locked herself up

341
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,910
in her room,

342
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,120
not eating or drinking,

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,190
and not speaking to the other disciples.

344
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,270
Everyone's already

345
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,080
stopped blaming her.

346
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,550
But she just can't get over

347
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,950
that hurdle in her heart.

348
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,590
She won't forgive herself.

349
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,510
Mr. Tang,

350
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,480
she…

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
You…

352
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,390
Don't worry, Master Shao.

353
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,360
I understand.

354
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,090
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

355
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,180
Why did they even save her?

356
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,000
She's the one who caused all this!

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,240
What can we do?

358
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,200
She is

359
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Master Shao's disciple after all.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,750
If we'd followed

361
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,110
Mr. Tang's original plan,

362
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,270
the Peony Pavilion battle

363
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,200
wouldn't have cost
the Sword Alliance so dearly.

364
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,270
Yet she still wants
to return to Shanfeng Branch.

365
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,270
Delusional!

366
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,630
Yes, delusional!

367
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,480
Delusional!

368
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
Stop blaming me.

369
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,200
Why save her at all?

370
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,160
She's the one who caused it!

371
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,750
Stop blaming me!

372
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,480
Just leave it at the door.

373
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,270
Ms. Zhong.

374
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,040
Mr. Tang.

375
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,290
Do you have a moment?

376
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,170
Please, come in.

377
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,440
Mr. Tang,

378
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,370
you saved me at the Peony Pavilion.

379
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,750
I should have properly

380
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,950
thanked you for that.

381
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,920
But right now,

382
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,320
I really don't know how to face…

383
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,790
face you.

384
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
Because of me,

385
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,240
the Peony Pavilion battle

386
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,550
caused heavy losses.

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,310
All of this…

388
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,400
The losses

389
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,730
we suffered in that battle…

390
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,640
if someone must

391
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,370
take responsibility for them,

392
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,640
it should be me, as the one

393
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,070
who led the charge.

394
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,030
Ms. Zhong,

395
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,400
you don't have to

396
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,730
shoulder all the blame.

397
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,310
Besides,

398
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,110
when we decided
to attack Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

399
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,310
everyone in the Sword Alliance
was excited.

400
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,830
No one objected.

401
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,550
Mr. Tang, you're always like this.

402
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,110
Your words of comfort

403
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,100
won't make me feel any better.

404
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,480
I did not

405
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,030
come here

406
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,200
to comfort you.

407
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,440
I came because

408
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,550
the Sword Alliance
is in need of talented people.

409
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,810
We need you, Ms. Zhong.

410
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,310
I'll be leaving tomorrow,

411
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,000
and I'd like to go

412
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,480
with peace of mind.

413
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,550
I believe

414
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,510
Master Shao feels the same.

415
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,480
Do you really think…

416
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,470
the Sword Alliance still needs me?

417
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,200
Ms. Zhong, you hadn't made

418
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,930
any major mistakes in the past,

419
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,150
so you'd never learned from one.

420
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,550
I do have some experience.

421
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,750
I once

422
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,270
took a wrong step…

423
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
and caused

424
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,030
irreparable regret.

425
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,280
All I could do was bear the mistake,

426
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,450
walking through darkness,

427
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,270
one step at a time.

428
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,330
Because there was no other choice.

429
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,270
But

430
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,800
if you let that consume you,

431
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,720
that would be the true betrayal

432
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,960
of the dead.

433
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,400
So,

434
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,160
the more you carry,

435
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,760
the more you must move forward.

436
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,680
Carrying such a heavy burden,

437
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,930
won't one easily stumble

438
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,630
and be laughed at?

439
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,850
If you stumble, get back up.

440
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,140
If people laugh at you,

441
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,880
let them.

442
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,080
When the light finally shines through,

443
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,790
all those past hardships

444
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,690
will be nothing

445
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,960
but a little frost on your journey.

446
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,550
But who can truly do that?

447
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,190
Who can do it?

448
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,340
The Ms. Zhong I once knew—

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
she surely could.

450
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,920
It's late.

451
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,160
I'll

452
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,710
take my leave now.

453
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,730
Thank you,

454
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,950
Mr. Tang.

455
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,590
Those bastards from the Sword Alliance

456
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,110
really destroyed
most of the Peony Pavilion.

457
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,000
Damn them.

458
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,410
You blind animal!

459
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,350
Fucui,

460
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,200
how dare you!

461
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,010
Greetings, Leader.

462
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,310
Every plant in the Plum Garden

463
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,560
is not to be touched.

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,530
Even plucking a single leaf

465
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,160
will cost you your life.

466
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes.

467
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Bai Suche,

468
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,550
the Black Tulili I asked you to gather—

469
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,410
how is it going?

470
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,450
It's done.

471
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,400
I went out and came back,

472
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,440
and you still haven't made up your mind?

473
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,040
Only patience wins the game.

474
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,830
Hurry up.

475
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,700
Stop complaining.

476
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,720
Master, you left behind
this unfinished game.

477
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,270
Leader, you once said

478
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,400
the Fengliu Shop
doesn't belong to me alone.

479
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,300
Leader, you must

480
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,560
also bear your share of responsibility.

481
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,280
You're right.

482
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,720
At this very moment,

483
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
you still have the mood to play Go?

484
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,020
The Peony Pavilion may be destroyed,

485
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,290
but the Sword Alliance

486
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,440
has also suffered greatly.

487
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Both sides need time to recover.

488
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
So we'll withdraw our forces for now

489
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
to rest and regain strength.

490
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,970
This is a game of strategy.

491
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,460
The Go game is the same.

492
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,570
The pleasure of the game lies in

493
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,760
the moment the winner is revealed.

494
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,270
Some win

495
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,720
by sheer luck;

496
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
others

497
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,160
by careful calculation.

498
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,870
Some will even pay any price,

499
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,010
losing everything they have,

500
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,160
yet still claim

501
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
the art of the game

502
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,290
is to play moderately for amusement.

503
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,750
Without the desire to win,

504
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,320
one can avoid obsession.

505
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,100
Without the desire to win,

506
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,400
you'll never win.

507
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,960
Without obsession,

508
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,760
one cannot achieve greatness.

509
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,750
Look,

510
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,930
you've lost.

511
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,110
This is the thrill of victory

512
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,910
and the sting of defeat?

513
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,510
How come I've lost

514
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
but don't feel upset?

515
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,090
Please, Master, focus on healing.

516
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,720
She's one of the Fengliu Shop's
key fighters.

517
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,780
The defeated soldiers you brought back

518
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,310
are nowhere near her worth.

519
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,080
Did Xifang Tao run away?

520
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,680
Should we call her Xifang Fled now?

521
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,720
That joke

522
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,780
isn't funny at all.

523
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,550
No one…

524
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,200
can escape the grasp of the Fengliu Shop.

525
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,240
Palace Chief,

526
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,050
you're leaving so soon?

527
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,880
Why don't you stay a few more days?

528
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,510
I hadn't left Biluo Palace

529
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,370
for a long time.

530
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,730
Being out for so long this time—

531
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,530
I'm still not used to it.

532
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,110
The battle at the Peony Pavilion

533
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,310
was a narrow victory.

534
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,650
Everyone in the Sword Alliance

535
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,320
owes thanks to Biluo Palace

536
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,970
for stepping in to help.

537
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,590
However,

538
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,310
I imagine what concerns you most now

539
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,400
is not that,

540
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,030
but rather

541
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,080
the court's attitude toward Biluo Palace.

542
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,960
Of course,

543
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,200
that concerns me.

544
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,590
But

545
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,450
what interests me even more

546
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,840
is your change, Mr. Tang.

547
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,770
In just a few short days,

548
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,830
your heart has changed completely.

549
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,750
The Mr. Tang standing before me now

550
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,410
seems more willing to open up.

551
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,280
Palace Chief,

552
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,660
peering into someone's heart

553
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,440
isn't exactly a good habit.

554
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,880
I've already sent a message
to my godfather

555
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,110
to inform His Majesty

556
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,410
of Biluo Palace's contributions.

557
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,430
Thank you.

558
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,640
That was our agreement.

559
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,370
"Poor teaching"

560
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,310
"reflects the teacher's laziness."

561
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,810
"If a child doesn't study,"

562
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,870
"it is not proper."

563
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
"If one doesn't learn when young,"

564
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,560
"what will they do when old?"

565
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,740
"If jade is uncut,"

566
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,270
"it cannot become a useful vessel."

567
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,470
"If you don't learn,"

568
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,630
"you won't know..."

569
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,010
"Righteousness."

570
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,030
"If you don't learn,"

571
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,240
"you won't know righteousness."

572
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
You forgot again?

573
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,510
"If you don't learn,"

574
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,790
"you won't know righteousness."

575
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,640
"As someone's child…"

576
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,170
It seems what I was curious about

577
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,700
has already been answered.

578
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,300
Foxy Tang still hasn't returned.

579
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,560
Your change, Mr. Tang,

580
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,680
is because of them.

581
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,200
Are we eating or not?

582
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,590
No.

583
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,270
Master hasn't returned.

584
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,600
No one is allowed to eat.

585
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,110
Shei's cooking is excellent.

586
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,240
Palace Chief Wanyu,

587
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,160
why not stay

588
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,290
and have a simple meal before leaving?

589
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,550
No, thank you.

590
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
Mr. Tang,

591
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,440
I believe we will

592
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,970
have a chance to meet again.

593
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,920
You've finally returned!

594
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,880
Sit.

595
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,070
We've been waiting for ages.

596
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm practically starving.

597
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,880
Starving?

598
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,880
I don't mean to blame you,

599
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
but how could you fight

600
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,750
such a world-shaking battle

601
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,160
without me?

602
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,180
Weren't you starving?

603
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,960
What?

604
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,000
Not starving anymore?

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,070
It's all your fault!

606
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,240
Why did you have to send me

607
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,880
to keep a lookout at that exact time?

608
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,510
We're done!

609
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,590
It's over between us…

610
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,450
for 30 minutes.

611
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,110
Senior Xue Xianzi is here.

612
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,270
Senior,

613
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,050
why do you keep popping up unexpectedly?

614
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,480
Master Shao said

615
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,530
only you know the way there.

616
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,730
They're… they're my chopsticks.

617
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,920
What way?

618
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,830
It's 30 minutes already?

619
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,960
Don't be a busybody.

620
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,750
Where exactly are you going?

621
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,790
To go sightseeing,

622
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,960
eat good food, and drink fine wine.

623
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
And we're not taking you.

624
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,720
Shei's cooking is still so good.

625
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,400
Senior...

626
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,900
Little fox,

627
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,040
now you know to call me Senior.

628
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,050
What do you mean, "Master Shao said"

629
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,420
"I know the way there"?

630
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
Truth is,

631
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
only I know the way there.

632
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,530
I wanted to ask, did you

633
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,510
pay back the interest

634
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,000
on the money you owe me from last month?

635
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
What interest?

636
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,860
What monthly interest?

637
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,590
I don't know.

638
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,810
If you can't pay back the money,

639
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,740
what will you offer as collateral?

640
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,070
Alright.

641
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,800
Aren't you going
to Shui Duopo for treatment?

642
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,560
It's such a joyous thing.

643
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Talking about money ruins the mood.

644
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,200
Shui Duopo, the incredible physician?

645
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,070
You're finally going

646
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,600
to treat your old injuries.

647
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,680
You must take me with you this time.

648
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,880
Master.

649
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,080
I want to go too.

650
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,640
The journey is long.

651
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,090
You'd better not come.

652
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,070
I am going.

653
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,030
When you went to the Peony Pavilion,

654
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,890
Stone was very worried about you.

655
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,510
Was Stone the only one worried about him?

656
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,370
Besides Stone,

657
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,460
no one else was worried about him?

658
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,880
Little fox.

659
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,730
How does it feel to have someone

660
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,720
worry about you?

661
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,680
Ever felt it before?

662
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,810
Then let's go together.

663
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,350
Go eat.

664
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,110
Chi Yun.

665
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,510
Have another one.

666
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,400
Shen.

667
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,790
Eat.

668
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,480
Try this.

669
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,420
Try it.

670
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,410
Delicious.

671
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,310
Palace Chief, you're not in a hurry.

672
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,160
Why not stay

673
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,420
and dine with Mr. Tang?

674
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,890
Did you notice?

675
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,100
He's clearly in unbearable pain,

676
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,240
yet he keeps pretending to be fine.

677
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,480
You're talking about Mr. Tang?

678
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,420
But what does that have to do

679
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
with my question?

680
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,220
If I stayed any longer,

681
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,590
I wouldn't be able
to resist advising him again.

682
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,010
But he dislikes it when others

683
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,240
try to read his heart.

684
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,160
So,

685
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,930
let's go.

686
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,480
My wound is healing so slowly.

687
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,230
Mr. Tang,

688
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,310
you're a monster too.

689
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,440
You should understand—

690
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,020
to monsters like us,

691
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,640
redemption means everything.

Yique Yinyang,

698
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,300
this is how you tricked Fang Zhou,

699
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,070
using the rest of his life

700
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,860
to help you practice
the Rebirth Scroll, right?

Lici,

706
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,110
they're just ordinary people of Shenzhou.

707
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,770
They have all seven emotions.

708
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,930
They may grow angry because of this

709
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,330
and misunderstand you.

710
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,610
But I believed in you.

711
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Doesn't that prove

712
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,070
our seven years of friendship
at Zhoudi Tower

713
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,550
were real after all?

714
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,740
But the truth is,
those seven years at Zhoudi Tower

715
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,840
were built entirely on lies!

Here.

717

Eat more.

718
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,840
You eat so much, yet never grow bigger.

Foxy Tang is always punctual.

720
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,930
Didn't we agree to leave at dawn?

721
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,110
It's almost sunrise now,

722
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,730

723

[Tingyun Pavilion]

725
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,030
I felt relaxed,

726
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,070
so I

727
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,760
slept in a little.

728
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,070
Mr. Tang,

729

Everyone's here.

Here is the map.

732
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,510
You can go on your own.

00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,360
As for me…

734
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,440
You…

735
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,370
Little fox,

736
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,880
what happened to you?

737
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
Why is your hair grey?

738
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,880
Isn't this normal?

739
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,380
Yours is all white, Elder.

740
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,140
Knock it off.

741

I'm over 300 years old.

742

Paying one's debts
is only right and proper.

743

Since I owe you money,

744
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,230
I'll

745
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,830
escort you all the way there.

Shei and Stone

747
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,110
are waiting at the mountain gate.

748
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,640
Let's go.

749
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,530
Let's go, guys.

750
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,050
Master Shao,

751
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,920
farewell.

752
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,230
Let's go.

753
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,110
Master Jiang?

754
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,750
What brings you here?

755
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,800
Chunji,

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,440
are you feeling better?

757
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,510
I came on behalf of other sword masters

758
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,950
to check on you.

759
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,440
Chunji,

760
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,480
why are you still here?

761
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,030
Why not return to your room
at Shanfeng Branch?

762
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm no longer

763
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
the chief of Shanfeng Branch.

764
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,190
Nonsense.

765
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,070
You've done so much

766
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,400
for the Sword Alliance.

767
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,960
In the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion battle,

768
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,280
you led from the front

769
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,590
and risked your life
to save the disciples.

770
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,510
If anyone dares say

771
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,960
you're not the chief of Shanfeng Branch,

772
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,490
I'll be the first to object!

773
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,070
This room's far too small.

774
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,000
How can you recover properly here?

775
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,030
Go back to your room at Shanfeng Branch

776
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,290
and recover properly.

777
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,960
Come in!

-Yes.
-Yes.

780
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,160
Careful, slow down.

781
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
Master Jiang.

782
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,230
What's going on?

783
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,680
You've always been Branch Chief Zhong.

784
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,840
In my heart, you always will be.

[Mount Baojing]

786
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,290
What kind of cursed weather is this?

787
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,840
Compared to my Snow-Return Storm,

788
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,800
it still falls a bit short.

789
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,230
Looks like

790
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,630
this snow won't stop

791
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,440
anytime soon.

792
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,190
Good thing we left Shei and Stone

793
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,390
at the cave entrance.

794
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,770
With snow this heavy,

795
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
we might not find

796
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,890
a passable path.

797
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,760
Wait.

798
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,510
These black stones

799
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,710
look weird to you too?

800
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
I found them

801
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
exactly the same

802
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,160
as what I saw just now.

803
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,400
You don't know the way

804
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,480
and are leading us around
in circles, right?

805
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,800
Nonsense!

806
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,400
How could I not know the way?

807
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,880
Around here,

808
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
these black stones are everywhere.

809
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,200
They're not stones?

810
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,150
More accurately,

811
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,920
they're bricks from an ancient city wall.

812
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,740
What kind of wall brick

813
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,880
crumbles so easily?

814
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,670
It was scorched brittle by fire.

815
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,800
What kind of fire could be that intense

816
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,960
to make solid bricks brittle?

817
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,550
Besides,

818
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,440
this is the middle of nowhere.

819
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,630
It doesn't look like
there was a city here.

820
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,230
There was.

821
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,380
There used to be a small kingdom here

822
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,490
called Gumo State.

823
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,210
Gumo State?

824
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Never heard of it.

825
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,670
I have.

826
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,670
Intelligence gathering
is the Shisan Tower's specialty.

827
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,760
Gumo State was only about

828
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
the size of a city.

829
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,130
A plague swept through.

830
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,510
To stop its spread,

831
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,630
the king gathered the bodies
and burned them.

832
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,710
But accidentally,

833
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,800
it set the whole city ablaze.

834
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,920
By dawn, the entire city was gone.

835
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,030
Still the same question:

836
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,090
what kind of fire could be so powerful

837
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,760
as to burn down an entire city?

838
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,020
So there's another version of the story:

839
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,630
the king of Gumo State angered the gods,

840
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,330
who first sent a plague

841
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,710
and then divine fire.

842
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,360
Divine fire?

843
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,190
Wait.

844
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,440
Why is that physician living

845
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,290
in a place like this?

846
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
Let's keep moving forward.

Chunji.

849
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,510
Look,

850
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,000
these are all herbs

851
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,590
for strengthening the body
and boosting energy.

852
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,440
We're all family in the Sword Alliance.

853
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,630
If you ever need more,

854
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,070
just tell me.

855
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,980
I'll get them for you right away.

856
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,590
If your room isn't clean enough,

857
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,550
call your fellow disciples to clean it up.

858
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,920
Don't you think

859
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,770
that Master sacrificed

860
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,030
many people from the Alliance to save me?

861
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,030
Of course not.

862
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,620
Though Master Shao

863
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,900
hesitated at first,

864
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,110
Mr. Tang

865
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,360
spoke passionately,

866
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,590
saying you are

867
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,250
a role model for all disciples

868
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,780
and must not be abandoned.

869
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Otherwise, it'd demoralize everyone.

870
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,000
And it's just as well—

871
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,230
we should let the Fengliu Shop see

872
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,090
how united the Sword Alliance is.

873
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,360
We stand with Mr. Tang.

874
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
We'll fight Fengliu Shop to the end.

875
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:53,760
Chunji,

876
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,480
those foolish words you just said—

877
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,630
who did you hear them from?
