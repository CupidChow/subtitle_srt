[Episode 26]

3
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,039
Master Shao was initially

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,400
hesitant indeed,

5
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,590
but then

6
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,080
Mr. Tang gave a passionate speech,

7
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,070
saying that you are

8
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,710
a role model
for the Sword Alliance's disciples.

9
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,870
We support Mr. Tang

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,370
and will fight against the Fengliu Shop.

11
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,009
Chunji,

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,110
who told you

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,090
all that nonsense just now?

14
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,509
All of you, come here!

15
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,760
Master Jiang.

16
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Uncle Master, please don't.

17
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,550
Chunji, don't be afraid.

18
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,960
I'll stand up for you.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Will you dare

20
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,690
to speak nonsense again?

21
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,280
No.

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,640
Apologize to Ms. Zhong.

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,250
Ms. Zhong, please be merciful

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,630
and forgive our ignorance.

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,520
Get out.

26
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,780
Yes.

27
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,760
Master Uncle.

28
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,579
Why are you suddenly like this?

29
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,710
Chunji.

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,820
Master Jiang.

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,260
Chunji,

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,940
I heard from other disciples

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,340
that you've moved back to Shanfeng Branch.

34
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,630
What Master Shao means

35
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,100
is that Chunji can return

36
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,630
because she's the Branch Chief

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,870
of Shanfeng Branch.

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,000
Other than her,

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,950
I won't allow anyone

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,200
to sit in this seat.

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,450
I see.

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,180
It seems you have something

43
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,520
to discuss with Chunji.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,180
I'll leave you two alone then.

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,800
Master.

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,550
What's going on here?

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,070
It seems the news has spread.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
What news?

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,120
Chunji,

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,490
don't you know about

51
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,240
the tattoo on your body?

52
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,170
What tattoo?

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,490
I don't know anything about it.

54
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,290
See for yourself.

Recently,

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,720
I asked Master Shao

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,590
about the tattoo

59
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,800
on Miss Zhong's back.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,780
To find the Princess of Lang Ya

61
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,620
is a matter of great importance.

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,680
I've written to inform my godfather.

63
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,250
If someone from the palace comes,

64
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,329
Master Shao, don't be surprised.

65

If you're not dead in four days,

66

I'll give you a great gift.

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,280
A gift that will make you

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,520
truly valuable.

Minister Tang
and General Yuchi have arrived.

71
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,000
Invite them in.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Yes.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
Minister Tang?

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,510
Why would a court official

75

Miss Zhong,

please come with me
to the Empress's temporary palace,

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,860
so she can verify your identity.

I'll give it to Zhong next time.

What is it?

97
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,570
I suppose getting Shui Duopo's help

98
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,960
won't be easy.

99
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,110
It's easy.

100

She's right in there.

101
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,650
Just go knock on her door
and ask for treatment.

102
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,730
If she agrees to treat you, good.

103

If not, we'll think of something else.

104

It's not troublesome.

105
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,620
If it's not troublesome,

106
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,550
why are you running away?

what trouble have you brought now?

111
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,160
Have you changed your mind?

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,680
Are you planning to hand
little Xue Fu over to me?

113
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,310
Don't even think about it.

Little Xue Fu staying with me

You want to go back on your words?

Not a chance.

118
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,680
I should never have agreed

So this is Shui Duopo?

She's so young.

129
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
She's actually

131

Yique Yinyang is already dead.

He has nothing to do with me.

138
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,680
Let me check your pulse.

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,410
What kind of martial arts do you practice?

140
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,360
With an injury like yours,
you should be dead by now.

141
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,690
How are you still alive?

142
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,510
Are you interested, Senior?

143
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,320
I'm not interested.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,670
Just curious.

145
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,490
You, come here.

146
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,390
Me?

147
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,790
As I thought.

148
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,320
I see now.

149
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,870
There's no medicine for your injury.

150
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,940
Indeed, there's no medicine

151
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,340
for my injury.

152
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,230
It's understandable that you're at a loss.

153
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,580
Who are you underestimating, youngster?

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,810
I only said there's no medicine for it,

155
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,410
not that it can't be treated.

156
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,200
It's just that there's no medicine.

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,840
Besides,

158
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,910
it would only treat the symptoms,
not the cause.

159
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,500
Senior,

160
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,550
what do you mean?

161
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,610
Glowing Meteorite.

162
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
That's the medicinal catalyst

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,730
to treat your friend's injury.

164
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,670

a strange meteorite

fell onto Mount Baojing,

167
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,010
about three li southeast.

168
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,290
It looks like crystal,

169
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,850
shimmering like a rainbow.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's called the Glowing Meteorite.

171
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,240
It's found only in that one place,

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,420
but the terrain there is treacherous

173
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,600
and there are strange phenomena.

174
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,630
Over these decades,

175
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,630
many have tried

176
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,230
to climb the mountain
and retrieve this stone.

177
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,070
In the end,

178
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,310
they either died on the towering peaks,

179
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,790
or

180
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,650
simply disappeared without a trace.

181
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,790
Nothing hard about that.

182
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,720
With our martial arts skills,

183
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,950
surely we can retrieve it.

184
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,280
I'll go get it tomorrow.

185
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I'll go with Shen.

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
Don't think that you can
climb the mountain

187
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,670
just because
you have great martial skills.

188
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,600
It's a hundred times more dangerous

189
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,770
than you can imagine.

190
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,900
How dangerous is it?

191
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't really want to say.

192
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,270
Unless this old man

193
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,270
hands over Xue Fu.

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
Dream on!

195
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,200
What's the relationship

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,750
between you and this Xue Fu?

197
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,920
It's not some magical treasure, is it?

198
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,790
Mr. Tang,

199
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,710
come with me.

200
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,140
The rest of you stay here.

201
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,170
What has happened these days?

202
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,880
Has the Sword Alliance attacked?

203
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,710
Since you're here,

204
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
hiding away

205
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,570
is not the style of the Sword Alliance.

206
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,910
West Palace Chief,

207
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,980
you are truly perceptive.

208
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,780
You have an extraordinary bearing,

209
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
quite different from

210
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,250
those of the Sword Alliance.

211
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,310
May I ask your name?

212
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,720
Why have you appeared

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

214
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,780
I am Dieban Chonghua,

215
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,020
Fang Pingzhai.

216
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,870
I would like to ask you

217
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
for a small favor.

218
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,910
So, you're the renowned

219
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,570
Chief of Fallen Shisan Tower.

220
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,600
But

221
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,440
with your abilities,

222
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,540
what can I

223
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,030
possibly help you with?

224
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,160
I'm looking for someone.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,930
Unfortunately,

226
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,380
Peony Pavilion was empty.

227
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,140
I could only wait here
for someone to come.

228
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,670
But fortunately,

229
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,680
patience has paid off.

230
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,780
I chanced upon you, West Palace Chief.

231
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,110
Who are you looking for, Chief?

232
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,540
The Master of a Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

233
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,710
I have some business to discuss with him.

234
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,800
Unfortunately,

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,370
I

236
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,740
also wish to know Master's whereabouts.

237
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,600
Don't you see that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

238
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,120
is now deserted?

239
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
It seems that I

240
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,910
will have to capture

241
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,260
an important figure from Fengliu Shop

242
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
to attract

243
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,720
Master Liu's attention.

244
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,580
Do you know

245
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,820
Master Liu's whereabouts now?

246
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,260
Chief Fang,

247
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,200
does an assassin who betrays Shisan Tower

248
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,800
have any chance of survival?

249
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,760
Of course not.

250
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,080
Then why do you think

251
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
Fengliu Shop

252
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,250
would treat its people
better than Shisan Tower?

253
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,270
Such a charming young lady.

254
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,220
Would Master Liu bear to let you go?

255
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
You really know how to jest.

256
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,140
How about this?

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,750
Let me leave.

258
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,410
Tomorrow night,

259
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,910
I will introduce you

260
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,340
to Master.

261
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,860
Can I trust your words?

262
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,960
Shisan Tower
has always been a place of trade.

263
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
It's a business.

264
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
If you set

265
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,030
a price buyers can't afford,

266
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,750
and since this is a marketplace,

267
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,100
then trust comes first.

268
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,020
Respect for customers is second.

269
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,630
If you want to do business,

270
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
how can you offend the customer?

271
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,270
Your eloquence

272
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,310
truly impresses me.

273
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,510
Very well.

274
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,100
Please inform your Master

275
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,270
that I

276
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,270
await his presence.

277
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,310
You have questions for me?

278
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,670
No.

279
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,070
You want to ask

280
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,220
who I really am

281
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,950
and why I have

282
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,610
such a special constitution.

283
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,190
So,

284
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,790
you've seen others

285
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,520
with a constitution like mine?

286
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm a divine doctor.

287
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,620
One touch and I knew

288
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,220
you're different from ordinary people.

289
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,880
I come from the Tianren Realm.

290
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,860
Tianren Realm?

291
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,340
What place is that?

292
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
Never heard of it.

293
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
The Tianren Realm

294
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,750
originated from Shenzhou.

295
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,580
In our clan,

296
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,920
everyone practiced cultivation

297
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,380
and achieved great merit.

298
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,030
The leader at that time
promised us

299
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,820
eternal life.

300
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,910
Using secret techniques,

301
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,370
he forcibly lifted
the entire Tianren Realm

302
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,740
from the ground.

303
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,280
He foolishly

304
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
sought to ascend to godhood.

305
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,450
But such an act against nature

306
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
caused the entire Tianren Realm

307
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,910
to disappear

308
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,390
into the shattered void.

309
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,340
Thousands of years later,

310
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,430
after experiencing
Tianren's five declines,

311
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,890
our lives hung by a thread.

312
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,310
The later Gumu Kingdom

313
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,460
was built on the ruins

314
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
of the Tianren Realm.

315
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,460
It seems

316
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,390
you truly have no interest

317
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,940
in the Tianren Realm.

318
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,210
You want to examine me,

319
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,770
but you won't ask about my symptoms?

320
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,990
Of course I know your symptoms.

321
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,109
What's with that heart crystal

322
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,280
inside your body?

323
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,690
In all my years of practice,

324
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,810
I've never seen anything so strange.

325
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,770
It's the heart crystal of Fang Zhou,

326
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,230
the Chief of Zhoudi Tower.

327
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,130
Fang Zhou, the Seven‑String True Tune?

328
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,500
Why are you carrying his heart?

329
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,560
This heart crystal

330
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,030
is the key to Fang Zhou's resurrection.

331
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,320
Impossible.

332
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,430
You want to bring the dead back to life?

333
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,360
It can't be done.

334
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,430
But I particularly enjoy

335
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,830
doing what can't be done,

336
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,230
even if it means risking my life.

337
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,740
You're keeping this heart crystal
inside you,

338
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,630
nourishing it with your vital essence,

339
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,630
keeping it alive.

340
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,040
This heart crystal

341
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,220
is now

342
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,590
your most serious injury.

343
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,300
Your hair

344
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,870
must have changed overnight

345
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,050
as your vital essence
was critically depleted.

346
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,830
If it weren't for that girl

347
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,740
outside,

348
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,670
you would be dead by now.

349
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,180
Relying on a medicine person's blood
to survive

350
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,090
will only make you need more and more.

351
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,000
In the end,

352
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,370
you'll need to drain her completely.

353
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,110
It's precisely because this injury
is troublesome

354
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,040
that I need a divine doctor's help.

355
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,300
How long have you carried
this heart crystal for?

356
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,360
Nearly four years.

357
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,450
Then I'll be frank.

358
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,590
This heart crystal has been

359
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,630
in your body too long.

360
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,260
It has already connected

361
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,660
to your heart meridians.

362
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,500
Medicine made from the Glowing Meteorite

363
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
can indeed heal your injury.

364
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,160
But afterward,

365
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,260
your condition will rapidly deteriorate.

366
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,540
It'll be like drinking poison
to quench thirst.

367
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,470
Between you two,

368
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,090
only one can survive.

369
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,590
Think carefully.

370
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,930
If you want to live,

371
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,220
you must remove this heart crystal soon.

372
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,910
Even for a divine doctor

373
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,950
like yourself,

374
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,040
is there truly no other way?

375
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,300
In this world,

376
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,200
some impossible things

377
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,610
are truly impossible.

378
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,950
Think it through.

379
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,500
I understand.

380
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,630
Please allow me

381
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,710
to think about this carefully.

382
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:59,780
♪ As spring wanes
in the eastern district of Pujun ♪

383
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,870
♪ The doors are shut tight ♪

384
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,330
♪ In the silent temple ♪

385
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,780
Leader.

386
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,500
Master.

387
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,310
You disappeared
after the fight with Puzhu.

388
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,170
Where have you been all this time?

389
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,350
I was wounded

390
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,870
and trapped in a cave

391
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,980
below a cliff.

392
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,910
I only returned after recovering.

393
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,910
What about Puzhu?

394
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,020
Is he dead?

395
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,710
We were both badly injured.

396
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,910
He managed to escape.

397
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,910
You are

398
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,590
lying to me.

399
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,600
Why would I have any reason

400
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,680
to deceive you, Master?

401
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,370
When I was returning just now,

402
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,590
I met Fang Pingzhai,

403
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,740
the Chief of Shisan Tower,
in the Peony Pavilion.

404
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,780
He wants to see you

405
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,020
and asked me

406
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,500
to relay the message.

407
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,510
He gave the map of Peony Pavilion

408
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,660
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

409
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,720
He should be avoiding me at all costs,

410
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,430
yet he wants to see me?

411
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,540
Xiaohong.

412
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,070
In the blink of an eye,

413
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,190
you killed them and devoured the bones.

414
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,990
As expected from Fengliu Shop's

415
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,350
Master Liu,

416
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,150
expert in medicine,
curse bugs, and martial arts.

417
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,110
Chief Fang,

418
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,950
do not test

419
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,190
my patience.

420
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,220
I, Fang Pingzhai...

421
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,910
Master,

422
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,300
since you've come to our meeting,

423
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,830
why are you leaving so soon?

424
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,590
Shisan Tower didn't show up
for the battle at Peony Pavilion,

425
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,590
which means you

426
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,200
have no sincere intention
to work together.

427
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,330
As for these people,

428
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,640
they are the price for you taking the map

429
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,870
as that person instructed.

430
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,950
Whether Shisan Tower

431
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,190
has an undeserved reputation,

432
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,020
or you deliberately disrespect me,

433
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
not killing you

434
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,780
is already my mercy.

435
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,670
Do these people represent

436
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,330
the strength of Shisan Tower?

437
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
I believe you have

438
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,670
misunderstood.

439
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,500
Before they attacked,

440
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,210
didn't they know they were attacking

441
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,390
the world-renowned

442
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,980
Master of Fengliu Shop?

443
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,540
How could they dare to imagine

444
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,670
they would succeed?

445
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,830
I came today

446
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,910
to make another deal with you.

447
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,280
The techniques of the Rebirth Scroll.

448
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,430
You can't afford the price

449
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,780
for what you want.

450
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,790
Is that so?

451
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,660
If you find out

452
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Tang Lici said the same thing,

453
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,490
would you be pleased or furious?

454
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,910
You have three final sentences.

455
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,670
So few?

456
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Let me think.

457
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,150
I know Tang Lici

458
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,410
left the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

459
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,490
That's one.

460
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
I also know

461
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,220
where he went.

462
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,870
And finally...

463
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,700
Now is your best

464
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,190
chance

465
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,370
to kill him.

466
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,910
Senior,

467
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,630
I used to

468
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,960
look up to you as my idol.

469
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,040
I can't believe you're like this.

470
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,460
What am I like?

471
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,150
Sneaking around

472
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,220
and taking someone else's treasure.

473
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,870
I took...

474
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,830
Yes, yes.

475
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,150
You're making me worry all day,

476
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,980
being afraid you'd lose Xue Fu.

477
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,830
Better to return her
to her rightful owner,

478
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,830
so Xue Fu can have someone to rely on.

479
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,630
You...

480
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,150
Yes, Senior Xue Xianzi,

481
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,950
how could you do this?

482
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,780
I...

483
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,540
Fine.

484
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,490
Shui Duopo,

485
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,390
I guess

486
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,120
you've got something on me now.

487
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,120
Then promise me

488
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,060
you'll take good care
of the white-haired fox

489
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,590
and I'll bring Xue Fu to you.

490
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,110
Okay.

491
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,110
Bring

492
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,320
little Xue Fu back now.

493
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,420
I miss her so much.

494
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:02,910
Fang Zhou,

495
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,910
Liu Yan was right.

496
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,200
I've actually lied to you.

497
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,330
You still haven't told us

498
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,430
what your name is.

499
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,740
Tang.

500
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,430
Tang?

501
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,520
And your given name?

502
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,920
Perhaps you've forgotten?

503
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,300
Who your parents are,

504
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,100
and why you know martial arts...

505
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,540
Have you forgotten everything?

506
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Their sacrifice

507
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,040
made you perfect.

508
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,150
Killing

509
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,910
is your nature.

510
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,150
Is this

511
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,950
what you call kindness?

512
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,430
May I?

513
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,690
Shen, welcome.

514
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,460
What were you thinking about just now?

515
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,700
I was thinking about how to

516
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
solve the mystery of Mount Baojing.

517
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,590
You're scared, aren't you?

518
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,670
Sometimes,

519
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,500
your perceptiveness

520
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,190
is what frightens me.

521
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,700
Shen,

522
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,910
have you ever thought about death?

523
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,410
I think about it often.

524
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,210
I'm still alive now

525
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,760
because I don't want to meet Huiniang
empty-handed.

526
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,180
But I've always believed

527
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,540
that people should do everything possible

528
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,390
to stay alive.

529
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,740
When you're alive,

530
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,540
there are many things you can do.

531
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,390
But if you die,

532
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,960
there's nothing left.

533
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,520
There are many reasons to risk one's life.

534
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,430
For Puzhu,

535
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,710
Master Cheng,

536
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,800
and Master Shao,

537
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
it's because of responsibility and belief.

538
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,870
Chi Yun and I

539
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,360
do it for love and righteousness.

540
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,210
But you're different.

541
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,040
You're quite talkative today, Shen.

542
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,510
It's because
you're saying too little today.

543
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,360
You've changed.

544
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,150
How so?

545
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,660
You're no longer afraid of Shei.

546
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,470
You use the word "afraid"...

547
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,700
You're not afraid of anyone

548
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,100
because you're powerful

549
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,150
and no one is worthy of your fear.

550
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,150
But no matter
what powerful enemy you face,

551
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,880
you've never been as guarded
as you are with Shei.

552
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,730
That's because

553
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,950
I once thought she was Liu Yan's

554
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,010
undercover agent.

555
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,240
Tang Lici, you know,

556
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,830
you've never explained

557
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,030
your inner feelings.

558
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,890
When you start explaining yourself,

559
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,420
you've already lost.

560
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,780
And what you lack

561
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,240
is someone like her.

562
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,430
At least she can express

563
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,890
her true feelings for you.

564
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,610
She lives more authentically than you do.

565
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,190
You see,

566
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
this is how she is.

567
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,840
She always tries to please others

568
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,920
and can't bear to see others
hungry or tired,

569
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,280
injured or suffering.

570
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,030
Her greatest ability

571
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,570
is that she can sense

572
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,770
other people's pain.

573
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,350
And she can find ways

574
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,410
to comfort others.

575
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,910
But living like that is exhausting

576
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,010
and is without a sense of self.

577
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,460
Don't presume to define

578
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,120
someone else's sense of self.

579
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,740
At least she finds happiness

580
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,320
in helping others.

581
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,580
She lives more happily than you.

582
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,430
She lives more happily than me.

583
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,830
This is self-sacrifice.

584
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
She's willing to.

585
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,020
But I'm not.

586
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,260
No one asked you.

587
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,270
Don't forget our agreement.

588
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,040
Liu Yan is still alive.

589
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,830
At least until he dies...

590
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,670
Rest assured, Shen.

591
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,410
I will keep my word.

592
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,570
Stone!

593
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,520
Stone!

594
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,460
Mr. Tang,

595
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,390
have you seen Stone?

596
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,230
What's wrong?

597
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,560
I got up this morning

598
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,430
to check if he had

599
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,290
kicked off his blanket,

600
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,690
but he wasn't in his room.

601
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,330
I can't find him anywhere.

602
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,060
Stone is missing?

603
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,980
He might have gone to Mount Baojing

604
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,710
to find medicine for Foxy Tang.

605
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,300
Oh no!

606
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,450
I'll go find him.

607
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll go too.

608
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,060
Wait.

609
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,910
The secret of Mount Baojing

610
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,240
hasn't been solved yet.

611
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,300
Chi Yun,

612
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,500
you stay here and keep watch.

613
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,150
Shen,

614
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,740
you search nearby.

615
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,700
I'll go to Mount Baojing.

616
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,540
Mr. Tang.

617
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,470
Don't worry.

618
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,190
I'll definitely bring Stone back.

619
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,190
Stone!

620
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,460
Stone!

621
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,060
Stone!

622
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,750
This is Mount Baojing.

623
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,150
It doesn't look unusual.

624
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,659
But the wind here

625
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,199
is a bit strange.

626
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,750
Stone!

627
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,060
Stone.

628
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,100
Yan?

629
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,060
I never thought

630
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,389
we'd meet again so soon.

631
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,909
Tang Lici,

632
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:01,260
you've shown your weakness.

633
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,620
You seem nervous.

634
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:04,980
What's wrong?

635
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,830
Are you wondering

636
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,350
why I came here?

637
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,889
Or are you thinking

638
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,010
how to deal with me?

639
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,260
[Mount Baojing]

640
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,590
Infuriating.

641
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,230
This mountain path
is truly difficult to climb.

642
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,710
Master came alone to Mount Baojing

643
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,710
to find Tang Lici,

644
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,380
but Tang Lici is cunning as a fox.

645
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,810
And he has Shen Langhun
and Chi Yun as guards.

646
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,230
I must quickly

647
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,460
reunite with Master.

648
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,020
Mr. Shen is so domineering.

649
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,750
I heard Mount Baojing
has extraordinary scenery.

650
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,460
I just came here for a stroll.

651
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,180
Sir,

652
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,960
you won't allow even this?

653
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,670
I'll kill you

654
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,310
to weaken Liu Yan.

655
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,480
Sound Killing.

656
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,710
Gods crushed, ghosts wailing!

657
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,960
I know you're looking for him.

658
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,710
Why else would I be

659
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,910
waiting for you here?

660
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,390
If you want this boy to live,

661
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,140
just tell me

662
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,730
where Fang Zhou's body really is.

663
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,100
Fang Zhou's body is extremely important.

664
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,020
Of course I used

665
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,040
a special formation

666
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,050
to hide it.

667
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,180
Go back to Zhoudi Tower first.

668
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,310
I'll prove it to you.

669
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,050
You must come back with me now.

670
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Not now.

671
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,140
Is his life

672
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,620
more important than Fang Zhou's?

673
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,270
Master!

674
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,690
Master?

675
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,270
Tang Lici,

676
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,840
you don't deserve to be anyone's master.

677
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,660
Stone!

678
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,020
Let go.

679
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,230
Come back with me.

680
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,290
You have no choice!

681
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,100
Enough!

682
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,040
Liu Yan,

683
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,650
the strong winds here are strange.

684
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,310
If we keep fighting like this,

685
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,230
we'll both fall into the abyss

686
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,310
and be obliterated.

687
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,270
Are you afraid of falling into the abyss

688
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,530
or being obliterated?

689
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,500
I'm not afraid.

690
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:25,910
Hey—

691
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,430
Liu Yan,

692
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,350
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

693
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,060
Otherwise,

694
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,710
both of us

695
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,510
will die here.

696
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,360
Until I find Fang Zhou,

697
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,280
I'll go wherever you go.

698
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,950
You're truly hopeless.

699
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,610
Enough nonsense.

700
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,270
Let's get up first, then talk!

701
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,290
Don't think you can fool me again.

702
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,950
Hey—

703
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,830
Liu Yan!

704
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,540
So,

705
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,830
this is why people disappear
when coming to Mount Baojing

706
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,790
to find medicine.

707
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,140
You're awake?

708
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,540
Coming all this way
to find a divine doctor,

709
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,100
only to end up like this.

710
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,500
What?

711
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,350
Couldn't trick me out of

712
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,350
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

713
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,410
so you're anxious?

714
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,820
What a pity

715
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,020
you've run into me again.

716
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,620
Once you meet me,

717
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,180
you can't escape.
