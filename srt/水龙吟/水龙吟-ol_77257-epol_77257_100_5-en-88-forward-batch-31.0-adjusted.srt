00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,920
[Episode 5]

3
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,430
Foxy Tang,

4
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,890
I bet on not taking a step back.

5
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,810
Greetings, Sword King Yu,

6
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,730
from your junior Tang Lici.

7
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,120
You're that Tang Lici

8
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
from Zhoudi Tower?

9
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Master Jiang,

10
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,870
you truly have
an extensive network of friends.

11
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,670
Sword King Yu,

12
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,960
Mr. Tang...

13
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,520
What?

14
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,270
Is the mighty Sword King

15
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,160
planning to renege on his debt?

16
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,490
Perhaps he truly lives up to his name,

17
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,840
the Scoundrel King.

18
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,700
How dare you!

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm complimenting your master.

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,000
One with his sword,

21
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,280
sharp as a dull nail.

22
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,430
Why are you angry?

23
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,150
Besides, if he doesn't like

24
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,480
the title of Sword King,

25
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,490
we can also call him Calculation King.

26
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,740
We captured a criminal yesterday
and he arrived today.

27
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,280
He sees the future,
acting with remarkable speed.

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,940
Insolence!

29
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,400
That depends on how the
Central Plains Sword Alliance

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,860
and Yanmen
explain themselves to the world.

31
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,570
Foreseeing the future

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,360
demonstrates the Sword King's abilities.

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
Acting with remarkable speed

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
shows the urgency of the situation.

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,620
How is the Sword King at fault?

36
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,800
Why are you making me look bad?

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,730
This clearly...

38
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,070
It's clearly a matter

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,700
for the Sword King City to handle.

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,460
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,340
is willing to entrust this matter
to the Sword King City.

42
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
Sword King, please ensure the truth

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
comes to light.

44
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,520
Are you kidding me,

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Foxy Tang?

46
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,620
At such a critical moment,

47
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,400
can't you be serious for once,

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,860
instead of sabotaging me?

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,090
I am always serious.

50
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,910
I took that bastard's sword strike head-on

51
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,700
and then you just
handed the person over to him.

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,390
I was the one who took that strike.

53
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,110
Well...

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
I finally managed

55
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,440
to deceive you once.

56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
How can you call that deception?

57
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,470
How is it not?

58
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,530
Deception

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,960
means taking advantage of someone

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,160
when they are unaware

61
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,300
of your intentions.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,650
I knew your intentions clearly.

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,690
I could have stood by and done nothing,

64
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,750
but I chose to save your life instead.

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,000
So,

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,720
you didn't deceive me.

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,630
Instead,

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,080
you owe me once again.

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,300
This...

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,020
It's all the same.

71
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,800
It's all the same.

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
It's all the same!

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,190
Mr. Tang!

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Chi,

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,779
Miss Zhong,

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,070
are you alright?

77
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,730
We're fine.

78
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,920
Let's go.

79
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,050
Miss Zhong.

80
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,840
It's nothing serious.

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,770
Just a minor injury.

82
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,570
It's nothing.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,490
How about this?

84
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,390
Let's get on the boat first,

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,560
dress your wound,

86
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,770
and get you a change of clothes.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,300
Thank you for your help, Miss Shei.

88
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,830
Let's go.

89
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,890
Foxy Tang,

90
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,400
you haven't answered my question yet.

91
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,159
If I hadn't let Sword King Yu
take him away,

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
then not just Yanmen,

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,070
but the Sword Alliance would also
become enemies with Sword King City.

94
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,310
No matter what the investigation reveals
in the future,

95
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,700
no one would trust us

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,690
because I am deeply entangled

97
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,620
with this matter

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,780
and with them.

99
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,750
So,

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
we're just letting this go?

101
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,720
The lead on the Blood Ghost Pill

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,380
is lost too.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,860
And the person who tried to harm you!

104
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,770
Where is he now?

105
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,480
I know who wanted to

106
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,350
harm me.

107
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,860
As for where he is now,

108
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,000
Jiang Qingyu can't possibly know.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
And regarding the Blood Ghost Pill lead,

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,630
isn't it already

111
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,560
quite clear now?

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,630
Since we have Yu Qifeng,

113
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,030
a more significant lead,

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,560
the smaller leads can be discarded.

115
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,460
You suspect

116
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,250
that old Yu is part of the Fengliu Shop?

117
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,920
Even if he's not part of the Fengliu Shop,

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,080
he has close ties with them.

119
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
Then,

120
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:09,720
won't Jiang Qingyu

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,450
be killed to cover up the truth?

122
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,620
Doesn't he deserve to die?

123
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
I'll be leaving soon.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,530
Shei, Zhong Chunji!

125
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,690
Come have some chestnuts.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,160
I need to get back to the Sword Alliance.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,760
I'll pass.

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I never expected this investigation

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,640
of the Hao family massacre

130
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,370
would lead to a series of cases.

131
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,720
If it weren't for your help,

132
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,040
I wouldn't have been able to uncover

133
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
the Fengliu Shop as the mastermind.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,920
I didn't really

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,650
intend to help you, Miss Zhong.

136
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,720
Rather, I used you

137
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,960
to accomplish my own goals.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,310
The one who found the true culprit
of the Hao family massacre,

139
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,640
capturing Jiang Cheng,

140
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,830
and even

141
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,430
stopping Yu Qifeng

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,260
from taking away the prisoner

143
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
was all Chi Yun.

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,220
He's the one you should thank.

145
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,130
Thank you, Chi Yun.

146
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Don't mention it.

147
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,850
So...

148
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,830
Mr. Tang, are you

149
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,630
planning to go to Sword King City?

150
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,890
There are clues there.

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,800
But that's Sword King Yu's territory.

152
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,610
Sword King City has
thousands of disciples.

153
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,500
Yu Qifeng has the title of Sword King.

154
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,650
The likes of Yang Shangqing

155
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,850
or Jiang Qingyu can't compare with him.

156
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,350
If he's really involved,

157
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,430
then Sword King City

158
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,360
is undoubtedly a dangerous place.

159
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,270
Why not wait until I report to my master

160
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,730
and people from the Sword Alliance?

161
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,560
When the time comes—

162
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,270
Miss Zhong.

163
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,010
I've already made it clear.

164
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,510
I am

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,230
not trying to help
the Sword Alliance solve cases,

166
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,230
nor do I care about

167
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,480
whether the Blood Ghost Pill

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,340
poses a threat to the world or not.

169
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,000
It's just that Sword King City

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,040
happens to have the clues I need.

171
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,510
That's the only reason I'm going there.

172
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,480
So, Miss Zhong,

173
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,280
you needn't worry too much.

174
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,680
I carved

175
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,920
this wooden doll in my spare time.

176
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,160
I'd like to give it to you...

177
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,650
As a memento.

178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,680
This doll...

179
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,770
It's me?

180
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't worry. Just take it.

181
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,270
When Foxy Tang has nothing to do,

182
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,720
he likes to carve

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,980
these useless things.

184
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,400
When it's cold,
you can use it as firewood.

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,100
Miss Zhong.

186
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,890
Miss Shei.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Be safe.

188
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,290
Take care of yourself.

189
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,520
Next stop, Sword King City!

190
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,880
Shen Langhun, Shen Langhun.

191
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,150
You caused

192
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,940
such a huge commotion
in the Floating Abyss.

193
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,990
So tell me,

194
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,120
this mistake

195
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,210
has caused my Fallen Shisan Tower

196
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,720
severe losses.

197
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,960
Who

198
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,650
should I send this bill to?

199
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,800
Aren't we going to Sword King City?

200
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,250
Why does it feel like

201
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,400
we've taken the wrong path?

202
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,320
What's the purpose
of going to Sword King City?

203
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,900
To kill that old Yu.

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,030
You want to eradicate

205
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,700
Fengliu Shop's influence

206
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,810
in Sword King City completely,

207
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,460
so the people behind it

208
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,080
will have nowhere to hide.

209
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,000
That's what I'm here for.

210
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,390
If you say you can make Yu Qifeng

211
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,720
so angry he vomits blood, I'll believe it.

212
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,930
But when it comes to

213
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,550
lurking in the shadows and finding clues,

214
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,110
you're far from qualified.

215
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,790
Even your compliment in the first half

216
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,990
doesn't sound like a compliment at all.

217
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,310
What's your plan?

218
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
We need someone...

219
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,960
who's skilled at undercover work.

220
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,390
Don't you always claim

221
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,200
to be the best in the world?

222
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,620
Now you're at a loss too

223
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,080
and need to find an expert?

224
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,200
My martial arts skills
are indeed superior,

225
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,840
but

226
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,590
I still have you tagging along, don't I?

227
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,600
Are you saying

228
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,230
I'm holding you back?

229
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,200
What's going on?

230
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,770
Hold on tight.

231
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,630
Wha—

232
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
Don't throw up on my boat.

233
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,120
I never thought

234
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,440
that I would get seasick too.

235
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,010
Foxy Tang,

236
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,400
what exactly are you planning?

237
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,840
The fog is thick.

238
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,270
You can't tell east from west.

239
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,080
This is...

240
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,670
The Fallen Shisan Tower?

241
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,000
Wasn't it said that only the Buhuan Tower

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,030
has the path

243
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,200
to Fallen Shisan Tower?

244
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,630
I've been to Buhuan Tower

245
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
so many times,

246
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,310
but I've never come here before.

247
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,800
How do you know about this place?

248
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,060
This is probably the difference between

249
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,790
ordinary guests and VIPs.

250
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,480
You damn fox.

251
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,080
Chi Yun,

252
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,080
I became their VIP

253
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,510
thanks to you.

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,040
By the way,

255
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,250
you still haven't told me
why you came here.

256
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,710
Didn't I tell you already?

257
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,270
I need an assassin

258
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,150
skilled at stealth and tracking.

259
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,240
You mean

260
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,440
the one known to kill all with one strike,

261
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,630
Shisan Tower's

262
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,390
Shen Langhun?

263
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,030
Yes,

264
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,490
Shen Langhun.

265
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,610
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

266
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,360
Although I've never been here

267
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,670
to the Fallen Shisan Tower,

268
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm sure it's full of

269
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,640
all kinds of shady characters.

270
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,350
If a fight breaks out later...

271
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,790
Hey, wait for me!

272
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,440
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

273
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,390
Chi Yun.

274
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,200
Are you looking for me?

275
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,770
I'm right here.

276
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,030
You finally came.

277
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,040
Hurry, rescue me from here.

278
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,980
Chi Yun, come quickly.

279
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,990
Come a little closer.

280
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,770
Chi Yun.

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,790
Chi Yun.

282
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm over here.

283
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Come quickly.

284
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,170
Chi Yun.

285
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,589
That's the Soul-Capturing Alliance
of the Shisan Tower.

286
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,720
They bewitch people's minds

287
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,520
to extort money from customers.

288
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,810
Strange people.

289
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,570
Strange building too.

290
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,770
Mr. Tang, you're truly knowledgeable.

291
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,480
My little

292
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,680
business tricks

293
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
can't escape your keen eyes.

294
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,780
Mr. Tang,

295
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,280
Cloud.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,110
Old customers!

297
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,780
Having an honored guest come,

298
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,070
the Shisan Tower is truly

299
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,350
brightened by your presence.

300
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
Since we last parted,

301
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,680
your habit of scaring people

302
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,420
hasn't changed at all.

303
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,320
Speaking of last time...

304
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,680
Cloud,

305
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,160
you haven't exchanged messages
with Buhuan Tower again.

306
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,070
Have you found

307
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,640
your wife, Bai Suche?

308
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,510
Why don't you quickly dissolve

309
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,200
your contract with Mr. Tang

310
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
and work for the Shisan Tower?

311
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,150
Mr. Tang,

312
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,380
regarding the recent incident,

313
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,270
Buhuan Tower suffered heavy losses.

314
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,350
Have you come

315
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,240
to settle your debt with me?

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
Perhaps

317
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,610
this bill

318
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
should be sent to Fengliu Shop.

319
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,920
You didn't commit the act,

320
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,470
but you still caused harm.

321
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,880
Whether it's you or him,

322
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,430
it's all the same.

323
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,090
Shadow Concealment Technique?

324
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,350
Every grievance and debt has its source.

325
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,480
You've always been a sensible person.

326
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,000
The Shisan Tower once,
on behalf of this person,

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,610
delivered a flute to me.

328
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,310
He only asked you to run an errand

329
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,370
but didn't tell you

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,530
the story behind this half jade flute.

331
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,160
It seems that you, Chief,

332
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,030
are also one of his pawns.

333
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,110
Mr. Tang,

334
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,380
four years ago,

335
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,930
you died.

336
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,920
So what?

337
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,930
A broken flute cannot be rejoined,

338
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,160
yet a dead person can come back to life.

339
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm very curious

340
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,580
about the secret behind this.

341
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,310
Chief, your curiosity

342
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,750
won't help you do business.

343
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,630
Since you're here for business,

344
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,610
what do you seek?

345
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,770
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

346
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,030
You must already know

347
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,070
why I'm here.

348
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,200
Today, I've come

349
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,200
to request the services
of Shisan Tower's top assassin,

350
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Shen Langhun,

351
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,750
for one year.

352
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,070
This isn't your first time

353
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,200
doing business with the Shisan Tower.

354
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,880
You should know our rules.

355
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,550
I don't make a habit of buying on credit.

356
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,880
Please name your price.

357
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,480
Foxy Tang, be careful.

358
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,510
He's utterly ruthless.

359
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,440
What if what I want

360
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,610
is you?

361
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,380
That would be difficult.

362
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,680
I consider myself

363
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,540
more valuable than Shen Langhun.

364
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,560
Perhaps you could pay the difference?

365
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,470
What a pity.

366
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm interested, but you are not.

367
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,730
If you want Shen Langhun...

368
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,720
you'll have to come upstairs
to find him yourself.

369
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,050
Go! I'll cover you.

370
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Shadow Concealment Technique?

371
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,560
Chi Yun, you've grown taller.

372
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,290
What?

373
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
What the hell is that?

374
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,040
Foxy Tang,

375
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,640
can you speak properly?

376
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,980
Mr. Tang,

377
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
four years ago, Liu Yan slit your throat

378
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
and threw you into a well.

379
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,000
No one could survive

380
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,330
in such circumstances.

381
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
But now,

382
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
you're not only alive

383
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,830
and standing here,

384
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,590
but also stirring up

385
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,740
tremendous waves in the jianghu.

386
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
Mr. Tang,

387
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,740
is your secret of not dying

388
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,540
derived from your body

389
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,880
or from the martial arts you practice?

390
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,050
Chief, your life
is already hanging by a thread.

391
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,810
Why bother asking about things

392
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,530
that don't concern you?

393
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,750
Is that so?

394
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,070
But what if

395
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,800
I insist on knowing the answer?

396
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,590
You should know

397
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,340
that the more you know,
the faster you'll die.

398
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,890
Is this all you're capable of?

399
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,240
With such limited skills,

400
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,990
you're not worthy of hearing my secrets.

401
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,450
I built this tower
with all my heart and soul.

402
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
You haven't seen even half of it yet.

403
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,560
Die!

404
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,880
Gui Fusheng?

405
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,210
Take it back.

406
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,230
Turns out the mechanisms
of the Fallen Shisan Tower

407
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,790
were created
by the world's greatest puppet master,

408
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,960
Gui Fusheng.

409
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,710
Mr. Tang.

410
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,270
You think just because you won't talk,

411
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,960
the Shisan Tower won't find out

412
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,020
about your secret?

413
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,020
Do you know

414
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
that before the Shisan Tower,

415
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
no secret can remain hidden?

416
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,520
Foxy Tang!

417
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,830
Mr. Tang,

418
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,060
your martial arts skills
are indeed impressive,

419
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,720
but I

420
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,680
have yet to witness that one move

421
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,240
I've been longing to see.

422
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,900
Why must you be so persistent?

423
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,380
All will be seen from the tower.

424
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,840
Where is the person I want?

425
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,480
Mr. Tang,

426
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,480
being stubborn is wrong,

427
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,920
but so is

428
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,270
being arrogant.

429
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,020
You're finally here,

430
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,680
Shen Langhun

431
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,850
Mr. Tang, when you strike,

432
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,480
you always turn sideways.

433
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,000
When turning,

434
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,310
your energy flow is clearly obstructed.

435
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,640
You have an old wound in your abdomen

436
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,920
that cannot be healed.

437
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,160
Am I right?

438
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,060
You've hidden it well,

439
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,710
but I have still

440
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,200
managed to see through it.

441
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,640
Back in the day,

442
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,520
seven great masters fought against
Yique Yinyang.

443
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,810
Fang Zhou deserved the greatest credit.

444
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,170
After that battle,

445
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,240
he was honored as the world's greatest.

446
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,310
Tang Lici,

447
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,240
could your abdomen wound

448
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,440
be from Fang Zhou?

449
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,200
Shen Langhun,

450
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,780
attack his old wound.

451
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,960
Snake Fang...

452
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,440
Soul Breaker!

453
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,640
Got him.

454
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,070
This is...

455
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,070
Since you insisted on seeing it,

456
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,330
then

457
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,120
watch this carefully.

458
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I understand now.

459
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I understand now!

460
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,880
You're just like him.

461
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,270
The infinite secrets of human and man,

462
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,400
the Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

463
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,480
Only the Rebirth Scroll

464
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,750
can continuously transform
and sustain life,

465
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,400
allowing you
to recover from severe injuries

466
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,790
and come back to life.

467
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,350
But why?

468
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,070
But why

469
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,600
do you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts?

470
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,430
And also,

471
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,620
that wound on your abdomen

472
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
that even the Rebirth Scroll

473
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,640
cannot heal...

474
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,980
What exactly is it?

475
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,590
If you want to
peek into the darkness of one's heart,

476
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,790
be careful not to get dragged into
the darkness yourself.

477
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,440
Tang Lici,

478
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,190
you amuse me greatly.

479
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,230
You can take Shen Langhun away,

480
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,370
but whether he'll obey you

481
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,830
depends on your ability.

482
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,750
Isn't it just a fair exchange of

483
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,080
paying money for a life?

484
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,830
Since when did the Shisan Tower

485
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,200
add this new rule?

486
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,110
That has never been

487
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,110
the rule of the Fallen Shisan Tower.

488
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,170
It was established four years ago

489
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,640
by Shen Langhun himself.

490
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,110
Sword King,

491
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,380
you finally came.

492
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,090
If you hadn't personally intervened,

493
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:14,880
I would certainly

494
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,920
have been taken away by

495
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,710
that little girl
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

496
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,570
I won't ask you for anything more.

497
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,150
I only ask that you allow me
to leave the city.

498
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,679
Let me go to the countryside

499
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,020
and live as an ordinary villager.

500
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,510
Sword King!

501
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,030
Sword King, rest assured.

502
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,290
I'm very tight-lipped

503
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,340
and won't implicate the Sword King City.

504
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,900
About you selling me the medicine,

505
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,300
I haven't mentioned
a single word about it.

506
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,320
Who did you say

507
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,190
sold you the medicine?

508
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,800
The Sword King is tired.

509
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,630
I need to help him relax.

510
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,170
Clean up

511
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,190
and leave us.

512
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,310
Yes, Madam Bai.

513
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,230
What you just did

514
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,930
was not wise.

515
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,360
This matter could have been
handled more elegantly.

516
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
The suspect Jiang Qingyu

517
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,510
feared revenge
from the Fengliu Shop's inhuman forces

518
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,110
and committed suicide out of guilt.

519
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,000
But your impulsive strike

520
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,760
has needlessly cut off this approach.

521
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,730
I am the Sword King.

522
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,000
Why bother with such deception?

523
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,590
If I say
he committed suicide out of guilt,

524
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,120
then that's what happened.

525
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,160
Who dares to question it?

526
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,510
You are so bold.

527
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,590
It seems Fengliu Shop

528
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,150
sending me to assist the Sword King

529
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,550
was unnecessary.

530
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,960
I hope in a few days

531
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,340
when questioned by
the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

532
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,220
you will show the same courage.

533
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,080
Master, you worry too much.

534
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,360
Those incompetent and ignorant elders

535
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,510
can do nothing to me.

536
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
What about Tang Lici,

537
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,110
the one at Yanmen Fort who withstood

538
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,150
your strike?

539
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,730
[Central Plains Sword Alliance]

540
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,140
That's what happened.

541
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,130
After that,

542
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,890
Sword King Yu left with the man.

543
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,840
I believe

544
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,850
the case of the Blood Ghost Pill

545
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,910
must be connected to Sword King City.

546
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,280
Please investigate thoroughly, Master.

547
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,070
Nonsense!

548
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,480
Do you know

549
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,610
who Sword King Yu is?

550
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,730
Since the Yu family's ancestors

551
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,790
founded Phoenix Manor 300 years ago,

552
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,120
10 generations of renowned Sword Kings

553
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,320
have had the reputation
of Sword Grandmaster.

554
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,070
Moreover, Yu Xuanqing the Sword Phoenix

555
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,360
had joined Head Fang and other masters

556
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,880
10 years ago at Tiandu Peak,

557
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,080
and jointly eliminated Yique Yinyang.

558
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,250
He's truly an exemplar of our time.

559
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,600
Now, you dare accuse Sword King Yu

560
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,230
of colluding with Fengliu Shop

561
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,150
to sell Blood Ghost Pills?

562
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,960
Sword Master Jiang,

563
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,210
Jiang Qingyu was just captured,

564
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,590
and Sword King Yu arrived right after.

565
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,400
How could he have such timely information?

566
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,130
If you want to suspect someone,

567
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,440
you should first suspect Tang Lici.

568
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,360
You said the black-clad pipa player

569
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,160
disguised himself as Tang Lici,

570
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,440
intending to bring up

571
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,160
the unsolved case of Zhoudi Tower.

572
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,690
But have you all considered

573
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,590
that if the black-clad pipa player

574
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,590
had no real connection,

575
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,070
how could he stir up so much trouble?

576
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Now, someone has finally

577
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,710
delivered a clue to our doorstep.

578
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,060
Instead of tracking him down

579
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,990
to investigate Head Fang's death,

580
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,050
you're letting him lead you on.

581
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,670
That's right.

582
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,150
This person hid for four years.

583
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,000
As soon as he appeared,

584
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,360
he caused so much trouble.

585
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
The Ranqing Sect was massacred.

586
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,840
Some people say

587
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,880
Tang Lici is the real culprit
behind it all.

588
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,140
He was clearly framed.

589
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,070
You should know

590
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,800
that when
the Ranqing Sect incident happened,

591
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,710
Tang Lici and I
were both at Yanmen Fort.

592
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,550
Their attempt to use the same trick

593
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,280
is so clumsy.

594
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
Can't you all see through it?

595
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,530
You should know

596
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,710
the one who massacred

597
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,960
the Ranqing Sect was a woman in red.

598
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,360
When you were at Yanmen Fort,

599
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,440
did you see her?

600
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,550
If Tang Lici wanted to do evil,

601
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,230
why would he need to act personally?

602
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,630
Perhaps that black-clad pipa player

603
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,960
is also his accomplice.

604
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,560
Chunji, your experience in the jianghu
is still limited.

605
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,420
You may know someone's surface
but not their heart.

606
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,110
Sword King Yu ignored the Sword Alliance

607
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,310
and took the man away,

608
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,920
yet the Sword Alliance
only questions Tang Lici.

609
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,440
When it comes to Sword King Yu,

610
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,440
don't you even dare to question him?

611
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,370
Since the Sword Alliance bullies the weak
and fears the strong,

612
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,610
if I handed the person over to Yu Qifeng,

613
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,340
wouldn't I be doing you a favor?

614
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,550
You've just become

615
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,550
the Branch Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

616
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,840
Have you already disregarded

617
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,760
the Sword Alliance

618
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,000
and us Sword Masters?

619
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,510
For an outsider like Tang Lici,

620
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,010
you're actually arguing with us.

621
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,880
I've said it before.

622
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,310
She's too young and incompetent.

623
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,710
Coming from the lowest class,

624
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,930
she's also shortsighted.

625
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,110
Second Sword Master,

626
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,110
why make it about

627
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,170
the Third Sword Master for no reason?

628
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,560
She used to be a butcher.

629
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,840
What's it to you?

630
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,190
I never said that.

631
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,880
When you were scolding Chunji,

632
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,270
you should have just stated the issue.

633
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,330
Why call her lowly?

634
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:44,880
Everyone,

635
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,760
don't embarrass ourselves
before the younger generation.

636
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,720
The Sword King
is also a member of the Sword Alliance.

637
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,250
The trial of the Yanmen case

638
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,020
is perfectly appropriate.

639
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Chunji,

640
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
you may leave now.

641
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,430
But...

642
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,390
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

643
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,510
Yes.

644
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,900
Chunji is still young.

645
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,700
She spoke inappropriately.

646
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,620
I, Shao,

647
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,920
would like to apologize

648
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,720
to all the masters on her behalf.

649
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,670
-Master Shao, you're too kind.
-Master Shao, you're too kind.

650
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,230
Please sit down.

651
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,880
Please sit down.

652
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,740
Please, do sit.

653
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,760
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

654
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
was entrusted by our predecessor

655
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Jiang Nanfeng with the Tai'e Sword.

656
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,390
In overseeing jianghu affairs,

657
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,110
we must proceed with caution

658
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,840
and be neither unjust nor lenient.

659
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,030
The massacre of Hao Wenhou's family,

660
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,510
the evil pills in Yanmen,

661
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,360
the slaughter of the Ranqing Sect,

662
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,320
and the mysterious Fengliu Shop
behind everything

663
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,690
all must be investigated.

664
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,350
Otherwise,

665
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,480
wouldn't we be failing

666
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
the trust of all martial heroes?

667
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,170
Master Shao,

668
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,110
what are your plans?

669
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,030
The Yu family's Sword Duel Festival
is approaching.

670
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,840
Heroes from across the land will gather
at Feifeng Mountain.

671
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,640
Regarding the Blood Ghost Pill,

672
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,670
we'll see how Sword King Yu

673
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,960
will provide the world with

674
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,980
an explanation.

675
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,670
Yanmen has suffered a sudden tragedy.

676
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,600
Master Jiang must be heartbroken.

677
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,820
I'll write a personal letter.

678
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,360
Lao Liu,

679
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,960
you will go to Yanmen

680
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,490
to offer condolences on my behalf.

681
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,650
As for Tang Lici,

682
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,150
he's mysterious and strange person.

683
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,960
I will find

684
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,290
a suitable candidate to investigate him.

685
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,110
-I will obey the Sword Master's orders.
