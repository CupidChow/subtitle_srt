[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,920
Here and now,

4
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,310
no one

5
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,910
will meddle in your affairs.

6
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,840
You

7
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,070
will die today. There's no doubt about it.

8
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm making this my business today,

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
like it or not!

10
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,720
A traitor of Yanmen.

11
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,070
How dare you silence a witness
right before my eyes.

12
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,850
When those noble clans play dirty,

13
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,979
they make my den of thieves look clean.

14
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,300
Don't worry, Mr. Feng—

15
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,930
I've got your back.

16
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,450
Cloud?

17
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,770
Well, well. It's your choice,

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,590
but you're just

19
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,400
choosing your own poison.

20
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,120
Since

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,120
you're all so eager to die,

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
I'll make sure

23
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,580
you perish together today.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,320
Kill them all!

25
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,560
Are you alright?

26
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,560
What's going on?

27
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,400
Clearly, Jiang Qingyu

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
has long since bribed everyone here

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,160
to ensure Mr. Feng's demise.

30
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,360
Our priority now

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,810
is to get out of here.

32
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,560
Thinking of leaving?

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,590
I've gambled everything

34
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,990
to get this opportunity.

35
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,470
Vice-Chief Jiang,
are you certain about this?

36
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,750
Once this deal is done,

37
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,650
you'll have nothing left.

38
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,480
You're mistaken, Chief.

39
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,079
If this deal succeeds,

40
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,900
I will have everything.

41
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
But this place is shrouded in thick mist—

42
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,810
I can't locate the gate of life at all.

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
Indeed, the Mist Formation of Buhuan Tower

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,280
makes it

45
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,360
difficult to spot the gate of life
with the naked eye.

46
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,430
However, after years

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,230
of cultivating the Yulan Sword,

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,000
I can trace the flow of air

49
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,120
to find the gate of life—

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
it shouldn't be too hard.

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,590
You really are both reliable and sharp.

52
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,590
Which way do we go?

53
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,410
Over there.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,380
Let's move.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,480
One,

56
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,800
two,

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,159
three.

58
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,040
Soon, you'll

59
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,890
all die here.

60
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
Once that happens,

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,050
no one will ever trace the truth
behind Cheng's death again.

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Judging by the sound of the wind,

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
the Floating Abyss

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,130
must be sinking into the depths
of the sea.

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,000
Follow me—

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll lead you out.

67
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,870
It's you!

68
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,060
Jiang Qingyu,

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
you poisoned Jiang Cheng,

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,490
all because Liu Yan manipulated you.

71
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,890
Greed led you to invite evil
upon yourself.

72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,120
How pathetic.

73
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,470
In this jianghu, power reigns supreme.

74
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,040
Once I ascend to that position,

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
who would dare deny

76
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
that the loyal and true-hearted
leader of Yanmen Sect

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,920
stands for righteousness?

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,450
You twist minds
and reverse cause and effect.

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,380
After them!

80
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
It's Cheng's goose.

81
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,390
Foxy Tang,

82
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,210
what are you doing here?

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,100
And you've captured Jiang Qingyu?

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,270
Thank you, Mr. Tang, for sparing his life.

85
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,630
This man is a key suspect wanted

86
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,760
by the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

87
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,670
Right now,

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,390
our priority is to get out of here.

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,390
Which way do we go?

90
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,270
Here.

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,770
This way—

92
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,430
the exit is over here.

93
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,870
Wait.

94
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,550
Foxy Tang,

95
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,810
we need to leave now.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Indeed, Mr. Tang.

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,310
This place is sinking fast.

98
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,440
The longer we delay,

99
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,240
the harder it will be

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,900
for even me to locate the exit.

101
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,340
Is that so?

102
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,490
An exit—

103
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
or

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,100
a one-way path to the underworld?

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,070
Mr. Tang,

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,980
you don't trust me?

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,150
I trust Feng Chuanxiang.

108
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,780
But are you

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,000
really Feng Chuanxiang?

110
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,560
Foxy Tang!

111
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,950
Mr. Tang,

112
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,180
why?

113
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,720
It's because the real Feng Chuanxiang

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
has been dead

115
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,620
for half a year.

116
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,270
He was killed by Jiang Cheng

117
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,170
on the very night
of his alleged disappearance—

118
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,620
slain by Jiang Cheng
in a poison-induced haze,

119
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,750
unable to distinguish hallucination

120
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,490
from reality.

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,320
So that's what happened.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,870
Is that true,

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,190
Mr. Feng?

124
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,330
Tang Lici,

125
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,000
as expected—

126
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,000
you are a worthy adversary of Master.

127
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,500
Let me reintroduce myself.

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
I am

129
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
Hua Wuyan

130
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,520
of the Fengliu Shop.

131
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,840
Emissary Hua,

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,150
you promised me—

133
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
if I helped you

134
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,510
lure Tang Lici and the others here

135
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,310
so you could eliminate them all,

136
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,390
y-you would secure my position

137
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,030
as the leader of Yanmen Sect.

138
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,590
You must not go back on your word.

139
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,360
Silence!

140
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,590
If I may ask,

141
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,550
Mr. Tang,

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
when did you first realize

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,940
I wasn't Feng Chuanxiang?

144
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,000
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,390
Mr. Tang,

147
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,920
pleased to meet you.

148
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,490
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

149
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,870
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

150
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,720
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

151
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
A western sword stroke sweeps afar;

152
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,780
wild geese cross miles of riverbank.

153
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,390
Mr. Tang,

154
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,370
is something wrong?

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,130
You didn't recognize the jade pendant,

156
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,910
nor did you understand the poem.

157
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,600
The answer

158
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
was clear from the start.

159
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,790
So, I gave myself away

160
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
at the very beginning, did I?

161
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,580
He used the Hao family massacre as bait—

162
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,270
first dragging Zhong Chunji's

163
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,600
Central Plains Sword Alliance
into the mess,

164
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
then exploiting Jiang Qingyu's greed

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
for the Jiang Sect leadership

166
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
to stir up chaos within Yanmen.

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,830
Had I failed to see through this scheme,

168
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,230
I would have been hunted
across the jianghu

169
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
and forced

170
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,510
to bring Chi Yun and Zhong Chunji

171
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,150
to the Shisan Tower

172
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,820
to bargain with the Chief—

173
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,650
there, I would have been compelled

174
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,910
to speak with my own lips
and reveal the secret from years past.

175
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,120
Four years apart,

176
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
and his methods remain

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,160
as clumsy as your disguise.

178
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,670
How dare you disrespect the Master!

179
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,280
Did he not tell you

180
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,260
to flee

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
at the sight of me?

182
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,150
If you knew

183
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,870
I was an impostor from the start,

184
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,630
yet still played along

185
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,270
and let these baits into the pond,

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
it was all

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,980
to trace the Master's scheme back to him.

188
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,820
Mr. Tang,

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,630
have you considered

190
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,840
that if this move

191
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
had gone wrong,

192
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,320
their lives…

193
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,200
My time is precious.

194
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,790
I have no interest

195
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,970
in wasting more words on you.

196
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,720
Finding Liu Yan

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
is my true objective—

198
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,510
nothing else

199
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,190
matters to me.

200
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,930
Just as the Master said—

201
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,080
devoid of sentiment,

202
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,270
driven only by cold self-interest.

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,920
It seems

204
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,660
he didn't teach you

205
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,910
when to beg for mercy.

206
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,570
Knowing when to beg me for mercy

207
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,860
would have been wise.

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Take me to him.

209
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Chi Yun.

210
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,230
It's Liu Yan's doing.

211
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,630
He's mine.

212
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,480
Is that so?

213
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,270
Mr. Tang!

214
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,000
I am Cao Wufang.

215
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,790
Tang Lici,

216
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,540
you've grown careless.

217
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,590
A sword through the heart—

218
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,200
a fatal wound.

219
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,150
Foolish.

220
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,500
Two souls in one body—

221
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,000
when one dies, the other lives;

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
when one lives, the other dies.

223
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,880
To think such a constitution

224
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,710
truly exists in this world.

225
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,350
You think I'm a monster?

226
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,790
The Master said

227
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,460
you're a monster too.

228
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,940
Monster against monster—

229
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,350
a perfect match.

230
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,840
Mr. Tang,

231
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,730
can monsters

232
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,270
even understand human emotions?

233
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,880
Go tell Liu Yan

234
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,840
that his petty tricks

235
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,700
are no match for Tang Lici.

236
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
I, Tang Lici,

237
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,150
am second to none under heaven.

238
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,550
If he wishes to settle our score,

239
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,010
let him come himself.

240
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,530
Now get lost.

241
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,050
Tang Lici,

242
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,440
if you wish to see the Master,

243
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,220
follow the trail of the Evil Pill.

244
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,600
But first, you and your friends

245
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,370
shall enjoy this little extra gift

246
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,680
he prepared for you.

247
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
What do we do?

248
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,700
The flames are closing in on all sides!

249
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,340
Foxy Tang,

250
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,470
stop holding back—bring out

251
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,790
your contingency plan now.

252
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,990
Empty-handed as I am,

253
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,610
I have no contingency plan.

254
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,730
Empty-handed—

255
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,050
Aren't you afraid
of turning into a roasted fox?

256
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Mr. Tang,

257
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,230
after receiving word from Miss Shei,

258
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,300
I came as soon as I learned
of the situation.

259
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,030
It seems my timing

260
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,440
is just right.

261
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I knew it.

262
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,829
You cunning Foxy Tang.

263
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,720
Let's go.

264
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,400
I never expected the Vice-Chief Jiang

265
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,800
to be that kind of person.

266
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,550
Right?

267
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,030
He always seemed

268
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,560
so loyal to the Sect Master.

269
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,290
♪ I cross the Yan River in the wasteland ♪

270
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,920
His body

271
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
was completely dissolved by the poison.

272
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,750
All I could recover was this.

273
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,170
♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

274
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,370
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

275
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
You should go—

276
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,570
the ceremony on their side
is about to begin.

277
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,130
♪ Look down on my dream ♪

278
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Go bid your master a final farewell.

279
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,390
Master Jiang,

280
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,790
a year ago,

281
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,640
Jiang Cheng was secretly fed

282
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
the Blood Ghost Pill by Jiang Qingyu.

283
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,190
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

284
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
He never guarded against

285
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,030
his own uncle

286
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,350
and remained completely unaware

287
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,510
of the poisoning.

288
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,480
Cheng...

289
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,550
Then, half a year ago at Liulian Cottage,

290
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,460
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

291
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,440
Feng Chuanxiang couldn't bear
to tell him the truth,

292
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,880
which led
to Jiang Cheng misunderstanding him.

293
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,240
In Jiang Cheng's frenzied,
poison-induced state,

294
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
he struck out

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,270
at his closest friend

296
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,400
in a hallucination.

297
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,330
Feng Chuanxiang, gravely wounded

298
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,280
and knowing his time was short,

299
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,550
didn't want

300
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,510
Jiang Cheng to live with the guilt
of killing his friend,

301
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,750
so he chose

302
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,670
to await death alone.

303
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,550
When Jiang Cheng

304
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,660
woke the next day,

305
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,420
Feng Chuanxiang had vanished.

306
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,390
Tormented daily

307
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,910
by the Evil Pill,

308
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:34,170
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

309
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,810
he spent his remaining days

310
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,960
searching for a truth

311
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,440
he could never learn—

312
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,920
until

313
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,410
death finally took him.

314
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,840
Perhaps death is a mercy.

315
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:46,220
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

316
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,570
Perhaps it's better this way.

317
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,330
At least he never had

318
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,010
to face the truth
of killing his dearest friend,

319
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,830
nor become

320
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,830
a monster enslaved by the Evil Pill.

321
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,420
You think I'm a monster?

322
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,890
The Master said

323
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,470
you're a monster too.

324
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,550
A monster...

325
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,110
What?

326
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,700
With injuries that severe,

327
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
it'd be a miracle if he survived—

328
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,880
and you're saying
his wounds have already healed?

329
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
Yes, Senior,

330
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,720
you should go check on him.

331
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,200
The guy Senior Fang brought back…

332
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
could he be some kind of monster?

333
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,360
So, the little monster's actually awake.

334
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,590
So fierce.

335
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,070
Fang Zhou's only talent
is picking up strays,

336
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,590
lunatics,

337
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,070
and monsters

338
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,270
to waste my medicine.

339
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I'll count to three,

340
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,030
now let go,

341
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,590
alright?

342
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,480
One,

343
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,440
two…

344
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,650
Are you even human?

345
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,300
You were really trying to kill me.

346
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,560
You can't be killed and have no humanity…

Why would a Bodhisattva

also fall into demonhood?

417
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,400
Mr. Tang.

418
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,690
Why are you here?

419
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,790
You've been gone so long,

420
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,590
and I was worried.

421
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,620
There's no need to do that.

422
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,180
Wounds heal on their own.

423
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,810
You're doing unnecessary things again.

424
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,150
I've told you—

425
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,900
this is nothing

426
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
but excess to me.

427
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I don't presume to know

428
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,480
what you want

429
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
or don't want.

430
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,920
I only know

431
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,250
that even if wounds heal,

432
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,700
they still hurt.

433
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,960
Mr. Tang…

434
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,070
are you here to mourn Young Master Jiang

435
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,270
and Mr. Feng?

436
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,160
I don't mourn

437
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,310
fools.

438
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,600
There were clearly chances
to turn things around,

439
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,460
yet through their own stupidity,

440
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,210
they walked step by step

441
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,450
into ruin.

442
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,280
You are not that kind of person,

443
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,410
nor do you truly think that way—

444
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,240
otherwise,

445
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,030
you wouldn't have helped them

446
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,440
find closure.

447
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,640
Save your compassion.

448
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,480
I am a monster.

449
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,560
That is exactly
what's going through my mind,

450
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,530
and no one's words

451
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
will change that.

452
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,790
Someone once told you

453
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,320
that you weren't a monster,

454
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,640
so I'm not

455
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,640
the only one

456
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,270
who sees you that way.

457
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,480
If you can stop my wounds from healing,

458
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,920
then I'll believe you.

459
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
But you can't—

460
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,590
which means

461
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,850
even you don't believe

462
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,640
the empty words

463
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,350
you speak.

464
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,440
Do you know

465
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,200
why Liu Yan wants me dead?

466
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,690
It's because

467
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,720
I killed Fang Zhou.

468
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,160
Master,

469
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,720
I have failed.

470
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,880
I could not lure him

471
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,280
into our gunpowder trap.

472
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,370
Master,

473
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,210
he was useless—

474
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:27,960
but I,

475
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,910
I even managed to stab Tang Lici.

476
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,670
Get back.

477
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
Master, I beg your forgiveness.

478
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
He didn't kill you

479
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,350
because he wanted you back here
with a message for me.

480
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,030
Is that it?

481
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,310
He said

482
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,880
these petty tricks

483
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,940
were no match for Tang Lici.

484
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,920
He said his martial arts were peerless—
second to none under heaven.

485
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,980
And if you wished to settle the score,

486
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,110
you had to go

487
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,810
to him yourself.

488
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,160
How ridiculous.

489
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,970
He wanted me to seek him out

490
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,650
and even thought
that we could settle the score.

491
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,590
Master,

492
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,790
shall we entrust the next phase

493
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,270
of the plan

494
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,450
to Xiaohong?

495
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,240
Mr. Tang,

496
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,830
Cheng...

497
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,440
killed Mr. Feng.

498
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,510
A life must be repaid.

499
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,900
I am willing

500
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,540
to sever my own arm

501
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,690
as atonement

502
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,100
to the jianghu for Cheng's crime.

503
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,760
Master Jiang,

504
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,880
the Blood Ghost Pill

505
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,440
only corrupts those
already consumed by greed.

506
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,750
An insatiable heart cannot be saved,

507
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,030
even by divine means.

508
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,480
I will accept your arm

509
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,550
as atonement.

510
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,480
But in these troubled times,

511
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,310
with corruption and strife everywhere,

512
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,240
keeping that arm

513
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,080
attached to your body

514
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,960
may yet serve a greater purpose.

515
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,810
Indeed,

516
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,000
Master Jiang.

517
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,440
Your son was victimized by vile schemes—

518
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,110
the blame does not lie with him.

519
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,790
Exactly,

520
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,200
there's no need to blame yourself.

521
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
That's right, Jiang.

522
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
The enemy's blood

523
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
stains Yanmen's maples;

524
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,030
As constant as death,

525
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,790
their crimson glows.

526
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,830
From this day forward,

527
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,680
your causes

528
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
are Yanmen's causes;

529
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,880
those who oppose you

530
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,750
are Yanmen's enemies.

531
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
Master Jiang,

532
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,990
you honor us too greatly.

533
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
Thank you all.

534
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,720
Take a look.

535
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,310
[Under Haoyun Mountain]

536
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
Come take a look!

537
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,270
Try one.

538
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,110
Excuse me.

539
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,960
Make way.

540
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:52,870
Thank you.

541
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,970
Make way.

542
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,110
Excuse me.

543
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,110
Excuse me.

544
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,110
Sorry about that.

545
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,000
Excuse me.

546
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,600
Excuse me.

547
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,220
Make way, please.

548
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,880
Is this the one?

549
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Sir,

550
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,240
where's that bracelet
I was looking at the other day?

551
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,500
I kept it aside for you.

552
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,510
This time I brought enough money.

553
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,310
Is it for your love?

554
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,480
It's a gift for Zhong—

555
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,290
she's coming back soon.

556
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,350
What are you doing?

557
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,720
Move aside!

558
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,790
What's wrong with you?

559
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,680
What's his deal?

560
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,270
M-My bracelet!

561
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,040
Right. It's your bracelet.

562
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,330
Why is someone from Ranqing Sect here?

563
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,930
Get out!

564
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
Stop tormenting me!

565
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,310
How dare this person cause trouble

566
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,440
in a place under the jurisdiction

567
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

568
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,550
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

569
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,400
I need to go
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

570
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,350
To the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

571
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:00,960
Has Ranqing Sect

572
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,000
run into some kind of trouble?

573
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,830
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,180
Where do you come from, you monster?

575
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,230
Watch where you're going!

576
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,070
Monster? I'm not a monster—

577
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,920
you are!

578
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,700
My apologies.

579
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,000
My Human Sword

580
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,510
is drawn only against villains—

581
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,370
I acted out of necessity just now.

582
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,200
Wait,

583
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,510
I'm from Camellia Island,

584
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,700
you're from Ranqing Sect—

585
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,110
we're both on the side of righteousness.

586
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,710
Let's talk this through calmly.

587
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,560
Ranqing Sect… they're all dead.

588
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,640
All of them!

589
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,350
What did you say?

590
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,920
All dead?

591
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,510
The entire Ranqing Sect?

592
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,200
How?

593
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,510
Who did it?

594
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,310
It was Tang Lici!

595
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,160
He sent

596
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
a demoness in red

597
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,400
and forced us to take large doses

598
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,640
of the Blood Ghost Pill…

599
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,840
I was the only one who…

600
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,540
Look,

601
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,680
isn't that the legendary

602
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,350
Master Puzhu?

603
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,810
Isn't that Master Puzhu!?

604
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,130
I finally get to see him in person!

605
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,120
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

606
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,230
If not for you,

607
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,190
I would

608
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,630
have shamed my sect today.

609
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,920
Of the Three Swords—
Heaven, Earth, and Human—

610
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,710
you have begun to grasp the path
of the Human Sword.

611
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,570
It won't be long

612
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,110
before you reach the Earth Sword realm.

613
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,670
Really?

614
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,350
Truly worthy of Master Puzhu—

615
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,030
such grace and composure.

616
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,960
The killer's name

617
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,400
is Tang Lici.

618
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,920
Come in.

619
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,840
The Hao family massacre case
has been resolved.

620
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
Miss Zhong has already taken Jiang Qingyu

621
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,320
back to the Sword Alliance to report.

622
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,190
Shouldn't you

623
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,450
also return to Yanxian now?

624
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,280
Yes,

625
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Mr. Tang.

626
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,760
Whenever it's convenient along the way,

627
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,800
you may drop me off at any pier.

628
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,330
Why don't you say you wish to stay?

629
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,420
Are you willing to let me stay?

630
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,800
Wasn't that

631
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,310
your goal all along—to stay?

632
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,590
The water is boiling.
I'll prepare tea for you.

633
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,480
You are not Chi Yun,

634
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,820
not my servant.

635
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,550
You don't have to do this.

636
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
You've allowed me to stay,
even if temporarily.

637
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,230
I have little wealth to offer,

638
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,550
so being able to help with small tasks

639
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,800
puts my heart at ease.

640
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,030
You may look.

641
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,050
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

642
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Master Jiang,

643
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,030
I must return promptly
to the Sword Alliance,

644
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,490
so I'll take my leave here.

645
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,550
The traitor Jiang Qingyu

646
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
is now in your hands, Ms. Zhong.

647
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,360
I trust you will bring him

648
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,510
before the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

649
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,170
Yanmen Sect

650
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,000
will also spare no effort in assisting

651
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,440
the investigation
into the Blood Ghost Pill case,

652
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,920
pursuing it to the very end.

653
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,520
Thank you.

654
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,610
In that case,

655
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,290
let us each return to our duties

656
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,290
and trust to fate.

657
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,710
Who is that,

658
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,100
arriving with such grandeur?

659
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,440
The Sword King has arrived.

660
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,370
The Sword King?

661
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,590
Greetings, Sword King.

662
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
-Greetings, Sword King.
-Greetings, Sword King.

663
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
We were unaware of your arrival

664
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,190
and failed to greet you properly.

665
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,670
Had we received word earlier,

666
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,360
I would have prepared a banquet

667
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,150
in your honor, Sword King.

668
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,360
Urgent matters take precedence.

669
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,630
I'm afraid there is no time

670
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,430
to enjoy Yanmen's hospitality.

671
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,400
Might I ask what you mean by that,
Sword King?

672
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,760
The Blood Ghost Pill.

673
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,820
Hand over the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
at once.

674
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Sword King Yu.

675
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,840
No one may approach
the Sword King's presence.

676
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,640
Master Jiang,

677
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,670
if you have something to say,
speak from where you stand.

678
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,190
Hold it!

679
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,320
This is still Jiang's territory.

680
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,630
Calling yourselves an orthodox sect,

681
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,160
you don't even know the simple courtesy
of a guest deferring to their host.

682
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,920
Then do you understand
the principle of first come, first served?

683
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,670
If you want someone next time,

684
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,590
try waking up earlier

685
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,190
and catching them yourself.

686
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,400
Who are you

687
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,030
to act so insolently

688
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,450
before the Sword King?

689
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,590
Chi Yun, the Cloud.

690
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,110
I never expected

691
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,310
someone from the underworld

692
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,910
to meddle in the affairs
of the righteous path.

693
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,070
He knows me?

694
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,670
The young master
of Yanmen consumed the Evil Pills;

695
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,840
Master Jiang's own brother conspired
against his nephew.

696
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,670
A once-great sect has
not only bred traitors

697
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,550
but also colluded with underworld figures.

698
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,920
To see Yanmen fall so low

699
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,550
is truly disheartening.

700
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,680
Sword King Yu,

701
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,770
this individual

702
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,990
has already been handed over

703
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,590
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

704
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,520
That's correct,

705
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,850
Sword King.

706
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,360
I am Zhong Chunji,

707
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,150
Branch Chief of the Shanfeng Branch,
Central Plains Sword Alliance.

708
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,800
Taking the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
into custody

709
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
is under the direct order of my master.

710
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,360
I ask for your understanding, Sword King.

711
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
You wield Little Peach Blossom,

712
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,150
the seventh-ranked dagger
on the Roll of Renowned Blades.

713
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,480
You are Shao Yanping's beloved disciple.

714
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,140
Young lady,

715
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,990
how is your master doing?

716
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,440
My master is well.

717
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,510
Thank you for your concern, Sword King.

718
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,440
But did you know?

719
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Even if your master were here today,

720
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,240
he would not dare stand in my way.

721
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,690
Sword One, Sword Two—seize the prisoner.

722
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,190
-Yes!
-Yes!

723
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,520
Wait!

724
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,410
From the sound of it,

725
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,280
you believe whoever has the strongest fist
makes the rules. Is that it?

726
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,630
The Sword King City has always
upheld virtue to persuade

727
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,760
and martial prowess to eradicate evil.

728
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,400
Do you dare obstruct me?

729
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,090
Look how full of yourself you are.

730
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,280
I'll stand right here
and take one strike from you—

731
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,340
you still won't so much as scratch me.

732
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,360
Mr. Chi.

733
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
Chi Yun, have you lost your mind?

734
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,280
Well, you scum.

735
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Do you dare or not?

736
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,880
If I take even one step back,
you can take him—

737
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,030
I won't say a word.

738
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,960
But if you can't hurt me,

739
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,510
take your pretty-boy entourage

740
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,240
and get lost.

741
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,840
Even Master Puzhu

742
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,000
would not dare utter such insolent words.

743
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,070
Enough nonsense—
do you take the bet or not?

744
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,320
Afraid I'll bully you?

745
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,710
I'll even turn my back—

746
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,650
dare you try?

747
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,510
Sword King Yu,

748
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,150
Chi Yun is just speaking out of anger.

749
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,080
Yes, Sword King.

750
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,460
He—

751
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,380
Very well.

752
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,380
I accept it.

753
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,190
Chi Yun.

754
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,320
Foxy Tang.

755
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,230
I knew it—

756
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,550
every time I'm about to have my moment,

757
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,480
you show up to steal the spotlight.

758
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,220
Foxy Tang,

759
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,550
I bet him I wouldn't take
a single step back.
