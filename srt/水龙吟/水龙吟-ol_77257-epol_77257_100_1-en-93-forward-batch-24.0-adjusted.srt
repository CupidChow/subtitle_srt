00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,790
and carves wood every day,

178
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,840
and the other only steals chickens
and sleeps in.

179
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
You're grown men,

180
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,670
yet you spend your days lazing around.

181
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,080
And you have the nerve to make me,

182
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,140
a child, serve you?

183
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,750
Sirs, what are you doing?

184
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,080
We're looking for someone.

185
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,440
May I ask who

186
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,570
you're looking for?

187
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,930
Tell us!

188
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,360
Where is that

189
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,690
young man in the temple?

190
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,630
Don't waste time with him.

191
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,560
Go in and search!

192
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,650
Yang Shangqing,

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,270
how could you be so brutal

194
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,470
to an innocent child?

195
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,400
Are you the city lord of Yanxian

196
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
or a gang leader?

197
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Young monk,

198
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
are you all right?

199
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,030
I'm fine.

200
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,750
Who are these people?

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,790
Are they the ones

202
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,050
who beat you like this?

203
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,120
Go now.

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Be careful, Miss.

205
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,960
Ms. Zhong, don't forget,

206
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,510
this case involves many parties.

207
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,200
Jinye Temple dares to harbor a suspect.

208
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,750
Everyone there

209
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,080
could be an accomplice.

210
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,370
Go in and search!

211
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,030
Yes!

212
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,200
I finally got

213
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,510
a chance to sleep,

214
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
and now
there's a pack of wild dogs barking.

215
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,090
I'll count to three.

216
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Anyone still here after that

217
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
will face the consequences.

218
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,960
Who are you?

219
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,030
One.

220
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,480
Where is he?

221
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,870
How did he disappear?

222
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,130
Insolent rogue!

223
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Search the place!

224
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,510
-Yes!
-Yes!

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
The Moon-crossing Ring?

226
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
You are Cloud,

227
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,790
Chi Yun?

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Where did you take Miss Shei?

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
Judging by his lightness skill,

230
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,090
he must be that guy's henchman!

231
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,910
Three.

232
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,750
My Lord!

233
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,440
My Lord!

234
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,610
Whether I'm a gangster or not

235
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,360
isn't for a coward like you

236
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,000
to decide.

237
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,360
Chi Yun,

238
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,960
give Miss Shei back to us now.

239
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,120
So you can take her back

240
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,450
and keep torturing her?

241
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,390
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will investigate this thoroughly.

242
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,000
We will not wrong the innocent
nor let the guilty go unpunished.

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
Forcibly taking someone

244
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,150
is a crime too.

245
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,640
Which stupid Central Plains Sword Alliance

246
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,240
thinks it can boss me around?

247
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,110
His name is Feng.

248
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,500
He just got woken up.

249
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,510
Would you mind

250
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,770
calming him down?

251
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,960
You...

252
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,890
It really is you.

253
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,000
Miss,

254
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,500
have we met before?

255
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,190
You look exactly like him,

256
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,170
but your gaze is completely different.

257
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,100
Sound Killing Technique?

258
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,070
Now,

259
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,100
does anyone else want to go in?

260
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,830
The expert in the inner courtyard

261
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,580
is formidable.

262
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,840
We are no match for him.

263
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,260
But I must see him in person

264
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,720
to clear him of suspicion.

265
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,090
Please lead the way.

266
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,200
Miss Zhong,

267
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,830
you...

268
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,120
Heroine,

269
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,870
you've got guts.

270
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,270
I admire that.

271
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
This way, please.

272
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,650
The rest of you,

273
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,350
go back and wait for news.

274
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:46,960
Move.

275
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,210
What did you say?

276
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,280
Miss Zhong!

277
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,400
If you dare to harm Miss Zhong

278
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,660
even a hair on her head,

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Master Shao
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

280
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,590
will not let you off!

281
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,960
Just now, what...

282
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,030
what did he say?

283
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,960
Miss, put this on.

284
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,270
Don't catch a cold.

285
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,720
Tang Lici.

286
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,720
Miss Shei!

287
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,440
I just asked you to help me

288
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
look after this lady.

289
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
I didn't ask you to steal my thunder.

290
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,670
Who asked for your help?

291
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,930
Did you lose the fight?

292
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,440
I, the mighty Cloud, I...

293
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
If you didn't lose,
it didn't really count as help.

294
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
That makes sense.

295
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,960
Is he the murderer?

296
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,480
The murderer...

297
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,570
looked like him.

298
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,930
Looked like?

299
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,110
Their build and appearance

300
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,310
are exactly the same.

301
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,400
But...

302
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,400
I just witnessed

303
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,070
your Sound Killing Technique.

304
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,790
Could you

305
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,530
be from Zhoudi Tower in Jiangnan?

306
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,830
I am Zhong Chunji
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

307
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,400
I request your cooperation

308
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,330
in investigating
the Hao family massacre 3 days ago.

309
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,480
Chi Yun.

310
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,310
Get up.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,440
Me?

312
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,750
Get up.

313
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Sir,

314
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,150
between 7 and 11 that evening, 3 days ago,

315
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,640
where were you,

316
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,800
what were you doing,

317
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,480
and who can vouch for you?

318
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,110
You know

319
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,830
you're no match for me.

320
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,030
Why did you come in to see me?

321
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,640
If I die,

322
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,150
it will prove your connection
to the massacre.

323
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,200
Exchanging my life

324
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,310
for the truth

325
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,230
is worth it.

326
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,380
You're Shao Yanping's disciple?

327
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,240
Shao Yanping is indeed my master.

328
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,270
Just as I thought.

329
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Otherwise, how could you speak of

330
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
exchanging your life for the truth?

331
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,480
You know

332
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,110
you're no match for me.

333
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,300
Why did you come in to see me?

334
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,960
I am investigating this case
under the Sword Alliance's orders.

335
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
If you continue to evade my questions

336
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,830
and just seek to humiliate me,

337
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,110
then do not blame me

338
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,920
for arresting you as a suspect.

339
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,640
You know you're no match for me.

340
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,830
Why did you...

341
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,930
come in to see me?

342
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,830
You...

343
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,640
Foxy Tang,

344
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,640
Did you drink so much tea

345
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,300
that you damaged your throat?

346
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,860
Why do you keep repeating
this one sentence?

347
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,240
I see.

348
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,310
Mr. Tang,

349
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,640
I will come back.

350
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,160
Miss Shei,

351
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,320
I'll take you back.

352
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,010
Miss Shei will be safer

353
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
if she stays here.

354
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,000
Then I must trouble you

355
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,000
to take good care of Miss Ashui.

356
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,550
Miss Zhong.

357
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Thank you.

358
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,750
You're welcome.

359
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,280
Foxy Tang.

360
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,030
What riddles

361
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,080
were you two playing at?

362
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,830
Miss Shei,

363
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,720
do you understand

364
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,180
the questions I asked her?

365
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,350
So I'm the only one

366
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,780
who doesn't get it?

367
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,440
Since you don't get it,

368
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,280
why didn't you ask?

369
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,110
Isn't that what I'm doing?

370
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,440
Asking me won't get you an answer.

371
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,360
I'll go ask Shao Yanping's disciple.

372
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,050
Chi Yun.

373
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,310
If you see Miss Zhong,

374
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,240
ask her one more question for me.

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,100
What question?

376
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,810
What is the one thing

377
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,110
everyone did

378
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,950
at the wedding banquet

379
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,830
except the bride?

380
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,000
Fine.

381
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,350
If you're not the murderer,

382
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,680
then why

383
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,610
do the two of you

384
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,870
look exactly the same?

385
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,190
Naturally, it's because

386
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,890
we once knew each other.

387
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,680
You know

388
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,510
who he is?

389
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,040
An enemy of mine.

390
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,490
He disguised himself as me

391
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,160
to take revenge on me.

392
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,920
Mr. Chi?

393
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,300
Where are your henchmen?

394
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,120
I told them
to go to the Hao Residence first.

395
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,110
I want to investigate alone for now.

396
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,750
Mr. Chi, did you rush here

397
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,530
for something urgent?

398
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,960
What exactly

399
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,250
did Foxy Tang say to you?

400
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,510
Mr. Tang just

401
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,710
asked me 3 questions.

402
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,790
Weren't you there

403
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,830
listening?

404
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
I didn't understand.

405
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
The 1st question

406
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Mr. Tang asked

407
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,530
was why I wanted to see him.

408
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,550
I came because the Sword Alliance

409
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,810
sent me to investigate

410
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,110
the Hao family massacre.

411
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,440
As for the 2nd question,

412
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,340
it looks the same,

413
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
but it actually

414
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
has a different meaning.

415
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,110
It means that if Mr. Tang
were truly the murderer,

416
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,880
we'd clearly be no match for him.

417
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,740
So why didn't he

418
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,530
kill me and Miss Shei?

419
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,110
And...

420
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,140
why didn't he run away?

421
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,790
I see.

422
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,150
What about the 3rd question?

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,180
As for the third question,

424
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,110
what Mr. Tang really wanted to ask

425
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,310
was actually...

426
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,270
Why...

427
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,750
do you...

428
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,650
suspect me?

429
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,750
He wanted me to consider

430
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,550
why Miss Shei identified him.

431
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,510
Remember what I look like.

432
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,570
And that reason is,

433
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,310
of course, that Miss Shei

434
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,240
saw the murderer

435
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
and could point out that

436
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,680
Mr. Tang looks the same as him.

437
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,000
Got it.

438
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,960
Why didn't he just say so?

439
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,440
There's one more question—

440
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,590
one that Foxy Tang

441
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,920
later told me to ask you.

442
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,830
What is something everyone did

443
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,960
at the wedding banquet

444
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
except the bride?

445
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,550
This case is shrouded in mystery.

446
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,160
Among those we know,
the only suspicious one

447
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
is Yang Shangqing.

448
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,720
Why do you

449
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,960
suspect him?

450
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,030
Because Miss Shei

451
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,190
was clearly the victim,

452
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,400
yet Yang Shangqing tortured her severely.

453
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,720
He was obviously in a rush
to close the case.

454
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,480
That makes him

455
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,340
highly likely to be the murderer.

456
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,000
I've long suspected

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,530
that Yang was the murderer.

458
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,100
But the coroner said

459
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,510
the victims died
from the Sound Killing Technique—

460
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,270
no

461
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
external wounds,

462
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,960
only bleeding from the ears.

463
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,640
Well,

464
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,830
Miss Shei

465
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,720
really did see

466
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,850
the black-clad pipa player

467
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,970
who looks like

468
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,750
Mr. Tang.

469
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,480
But we can't find a single trace

470
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,640
of this pipa player.

471
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,640
So now,

472
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,240
let's think about

473
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,730
the other question from Mr. Tang.

474
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,640
What is something

475
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,110
everyone did at the wedding banquet

476
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,350
except the bride?

477
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,720
Tender black-bone chicken!

478
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,110
Fine osmanthus wine!

479
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,920
Sir!

480
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:17,920
Sir!

481
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,070
We just got some

482
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,400
especially tender black-bone chickens.

483
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,540
When paired with osmanthus wine,

484
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,790
it tastes simply divine.

485
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,720
How about it?

486
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,380
Would you like to give it a try?

487
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,520
Then let's go...

488
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,030
-have some chicken first!
-That's drinking!

489
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,720
What everyone at the wedding banquet
would do

490
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,960
except the bride

491
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,620
is drinking the wedding wine.

492
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,250
Let's go.

493
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,420
Examine the bodies.

494
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,370
Check, please.

495
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,920
A good banquet must come with fine wine.

496
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,800
Who would have thought the fine wine

497
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,860
would be poisoned?

498
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,350
No signs of poisoning?

499
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,830
Could we have guessed wrong?

500
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,630
That's right.

501
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,310
If they were really poisoned,

502
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,510
the coroner wouldn't have missed it.

503
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,590
Since Foxy Tang asked such a question,

504
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,160
it must be on the right track.

505
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,640
You trust Tang Lici that much?

506
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,770
Who says I trust him?

507
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,030
It's just that

508
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,750
he always looks

509
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,960
so confident.

510
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,640
He must have thought it through
before speaking.

511
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,230
So the direction must be correct.

512
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,700
The cause of death really does resemble
the Sound Killing Technique.

513
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,560
When falsehood stands for truth,

514
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,790
truth likewise becomes false.

515
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,680
Could it be...

516
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,590
Chi Yun,

517
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,570
is there a poison

518
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,270
that can make one's ears bleed,

519
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,640
making it look like
the Sound Killing Technique,

520
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
but is hard to detect?

521
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,490
There's no such poison.

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,530
There is.

523
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,160
Baibusha.

524
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,310
Baibusha?

525
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,140
You're not in the underworld,

526
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,790
so you don't know

527
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,920
these dirty tricks.

528
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,490
This poison is colorless, odorless,

529
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,960
and has no medicinal properties.

530
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,220
When dissolved in water,

531
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,280
even the best doctor can't detect it.

532
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,720
But if consumed

533
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,640
with osmanthus wine within an hour,

534
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,840
it becomes deadly.

535
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,670
The symptom is

536
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,040
bleeding from both ears.

537
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,510
How can we prove it?

538
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,160
The well.

539
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,480
Water is needed for cooking,
boiling tea, everything.

540
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,510
And before the banquet,

541
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,840
guests would drink tea.

542
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,240
So the well

543
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,170
must hold clues.

544
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,510
I'll go to the wine cellar
to find the osmanthus wine.

545
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,340
You take people

546
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,750
to find the leftover wine
and food from the banquet.

547
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,830
If I'm right,

548
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,570
they won't detect poison
in them separately.

549
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,170
Let's meet at the well later.

550
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,110
Just as you said,

551
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
we didn't detect poison

552
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,010
in the food and wine.

553
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:27,920
Now, let's mix

554
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
the wine and water

555
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,520
to see if my guess is correct.

556
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,030
Sure enough, it's poisoned.

557
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,070
Everyone in Yanxian knows

558
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,720
Hao Wenhou loves osmanthus wine.

559
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,650
For his wedding,

560
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,750
he would certainly serve

561
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,200
osmanthus wine to his guests.

562
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,310
When the host toasts,

563
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,440
everyone must drink

564
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,590
except the bride.

565
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,070
It's about time.

566
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,030
The coroner only tests for poison

567
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,350
by inserting
a silver needle into the throat

568
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,740
to see if it changes color.

569
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,540
But Baibusha and osmanthus wine

570
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,590
passed through

571
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,880
the victims' throat separately.

572
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,610
They must have thought of this.

573
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,590
That's why the coroner

574
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,050
didn't detect any poison.

575
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,680
This proves

576
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,010
they didn't die from the Sound Killing...

577
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,000
Technique.

578
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,000
Foxy Tang,

579
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,030
you didn't expect me

580
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,550
to figure it out

581
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,680
so quickly, did you?

582
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,330
It's only because I've seen so much

583
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,330
that I could clear your name so fast.

584
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,550
And you...

585
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,550
Wait.

586
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,590
I think I've been set up.

587
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
What's wrong?

588
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,300
Foxy Tang worried
you wouldn't find the truth

589
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,240
since you know nothing about poisons,

590
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,110
so he said all those things

591
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,960
I couldn't understand

592
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,090
to spark my curiosity.

593
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,880
That's how he got me
to help you solve the mystery...

594
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,140
and uncover the truth.

595
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,470
This...

596
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,860
Damn that Foxy Tang!

597
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,530
He tricked me again!

598
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,830
Your Sound Killing move yesterday

599
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,060
was powerful.

600
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,010
Looks like your injuries
are no longer serious.

601
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,580
But if you want to stay alive,

602
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,840
it's best not to use your martial arts.

603
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,510
Forget it.

604
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,570
You've been recovering here for 6 months.

605
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,320
No one has come looking for you,

606
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,790
and you have never left the temple.

607
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,430
Yet worldly matters

608
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,000
still found their way to you.

609
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,130
Abbot, are you displeased with me

610
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
for the trouble I brought yesterday?

611
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,200
You didn't bring trouble.

612
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,940
Mr. Chi has been eating chicken secretly

613
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,530
in the temple—that's trouble.

614
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,190
What you brought was karma.

615
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,640
Abbot,

616
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,070
what exactly is karma?

617
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,780
The doer is the cause,

618
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,920
and the receiver is the effect.

619
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,990
If someone

620
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,890
kills because of me,

621
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,590
or if an innocent

622
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,300
suffers because of me,

623
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,730
is that my karma?

624
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,160
It depends on whether you know

625
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,070
and whether you tried to stop it.

626
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,370
If trying to stop it

627
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,510
causes more deaths,

628
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,440
does that still count as compassion?

629
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,640
The wind blows the tiles on the roof,

630
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,600
and a tile falls and hits my head.

631
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't blame the tile,

632
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
for it is not free.

633
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,000
Is it the wind's fault,

634
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,310
the tile's fault,

635
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,400
or mine

636
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,830
for standing beneath the roof?

637
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,250
It's your mistake, Master.

638
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,610
You made a mistake.

639
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,020
You lost 3.5 points in this round.

640
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
Amitabha.

641
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
How interesting.

642
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,160
Your question

643
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,610
is both false and true.

644
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,960
True and false, false and true—

645
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,270
perhaps you even deceived

646
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,350
yourself.

647
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,090
My surname is Fang,

648
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,590
my courtesy name is Pingzhai,

649
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,450
and my nickname

650
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
is Carefree.

651
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,750
I rarely do good deeds in my life.

652
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,030
Delivering a letter for someone

653
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,490
is actually a first for me.

654
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,200
I bought

655
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,110
a piece of news

656
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,370
in a mysterious tower,

657
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,920
yet forgot to tell them.

658
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,980
You'd better send someone discreet.

659
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,090
[To Tang Lici]

660
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh, right.

661
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,070
The message has been delivered.

662
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,199
What a coincidence.

663
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Someone else also asked

664
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,670
the same tower

665
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,230
you entrusted

666
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,760
to deliver that thing here.

667
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,960
I just don't know
if it's a real coincidence...

668
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,190
or not.

669
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,540
A half jade flute?

670
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,159
Sir,

671
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,710
could this

672
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,429
be your karma?

673
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,430
Sir.

674
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,280
Sir?

675
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,610
Does it hurt?

676
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,240
How could someone like me

677
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,730
even know what pain feels like?

678
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,190
I'll go check on Miss Shei.

679
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,800
Chi Yun,

680
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,840
I still feel something's off.

681
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,440
What's off?

682
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,690
What's Mr. Yang's motive?

683
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,190
We don't need to guess.

684
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,190
It all comes down to profit.

685
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,670
If it's really

686
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,400
such a simple, shallow reason,

687
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,840
it proves

688
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,920
Mr. Yang

689
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,250
isn't a man of great wit.

690
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,530
Then how could he

691
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
think of using the Sound Killing Technique

692
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
to cover up his crime?

693
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,600
What do you mean?

694
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,260
Hao Wenhou and his guests died horribly,

695
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,880
and Miss Shei didn't clearly see

696
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,800
the black‑clad pipa player

697
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,920
who resembled Mr. Tang.

698
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,190
But we've proven

699
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,510
Hao Wenhou and the guests

700
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,570
died of poisoning.

701
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,800
So where did that black-clad pipa player
come from?

702
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,660
Four years ago,

703
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,750
Zhoudi Tower was wiped out overnight.

704
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,510
And the Sound Killing Technique
has long vanished from jianghu.

705
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,840
If Mr. Yang really could

706
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,710
find a successor

707
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,320
of the Sound Killing Technique

708
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,920
to cover up

709
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,360
his crime,

710
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,440
he wouldn't have chosen

711
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,320
such a despicable method

712
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,760
as poisoning in the first place.

713
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,480
And he did it so secretively,

714
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,890
as if he was hiding something.

715
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,440
Are you saying

716
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,050
someone wants to frame Foxy Tang?

717
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,250
What do you want?

718
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,650
Beat Yang Shangqing

719
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,630
for 3 days,

720
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,840
and he'll confess to

721
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,350
even stealing the dog lost
in the next city.

722
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:18,950
Just wait!

723
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,000
Chi Yun!

724
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,670
You can't do that!

725
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,270
That's a forced confession.

726
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,590
Hurry!

727
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,880
Hurry up!

728
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,150
Be careful!

729
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,960
That's my family heirloom vase!

730
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,990
My vase!

731
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,000
My Lord?

732
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,430
What are you doing?

733
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,880
The silver's all on the ground.

734
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,280
Are you trying to run away

735
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,370
now that you can't hide it anymore?

736
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,380
Everyone, listen!

737
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,230
I'll give half my gold

738
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,260
to whoever kills this man!

739
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,880
Kill him!

740
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,800
Kill!

741
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,440
Kill him!

742
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,150
Hero,
your martial skills are truly impressive.

743
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,400
All this silver is yours.

744
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,880
Servants!

745
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,230
Take it to this hero.

746
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,030
Tell me.

747
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,450
Why did you try to frame Foxy Tang?

748
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,080
Please come in, sir.

749
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,320
You just got out of prison

750
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,880
and are already in the mood

751
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,480
to play with these trinkets?

752
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,510
Today I saw Feng

753
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,050
and took a liking to him.

754
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,120
Besides,

755
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,190
after all the ups and downs
I've experienced recently,

756
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,480
I always want to find something to do

757
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,610
to distract my mind.

758
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,920
What I did was improper.

759
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,340
Mr. Tang, I hope you and your wife
won't take offense.

760
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,400
I don't have a wife.

761
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,790
I just picked him up on a whim.

762
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,670
How pitiful.

763
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,630
Luckily, he met you,

764
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,100
and you kindly took him in
and have been taking care of him.

765
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,260
It must be fate.

766
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
You're wrong.

767
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,760
I just did it on a whim

768
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,000
to see what it felt like

769
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,930
to adopt a child.

770
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,960
But didn't you

771
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,070
give him a name?

772
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,030
A name

773
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
creates a bond.

774
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,190
One of a kind in a millennium,

775
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,600
break with old words.

776
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,440
So I'll call you

777
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,840
Tang Lici.

778
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,110
Now I see

779
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,840
that no matter what,

780
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,400
I am not him.

781
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,550
Man on earth...

782
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,760
Man on earth...

783
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,030
Good at birth.

784
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,030
Good at birth.

785
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,200
The same nature...

786
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,150
The same nature...

787
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,440
Miss,

788
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,650
you married into the Hao family

789
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,000
to get the money
to pay for your father's funeral.

790
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,960
Now that you've gone through
such a calamity,

791
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,410
if you feel uneasy,

792
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,360
you might seek the Abbot

793
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,100
for a talisman of peace.

794
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,840
It's quite effective.

795
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,070
I have no way to repay

796
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Lord Hao's kindness.

797
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,400
Miss Shei,

798
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,580
you confuse me.

799
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,040
You're a part of the scheme,

800
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,310
yet you know nothing

801
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,590
about it.

802
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,320
I...

803
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,760
It seems

804
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,880
you're just a pawn

805
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,840
he used and discarded,

806
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,360
a catalyst to start his game.

807
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,920
But what did I do wrong

808
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,070
to become this discarded pawn?

809
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,400
If I'm a discarded pawn,

810
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
what role are you playing

811
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,480
in this game?

812
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,280
Chi Yun!

813
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,250
What are you doing?

814
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,360
Miss Zhong!

815
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,440
Miss Zhong, please save me!

816
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,890
He's trying to kill me!

817
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,980
Give me 30 minutes,

818
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,630
and he'll confess everything.

819
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,190
Chi Yun,

820
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,320
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

821
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,800
never forces confessions through torture.

822
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,130
Truth comes from careful investigation.

823
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,390
All the evidence is laid out on the floor.

824
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,320
Can't you see it?

825
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,480
He sent someone

826
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,110
to secretly follow us,

827
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,380
and when he was exposed,

828
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,070
he tried to run off with the money.

829
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,590
Run off with the money?

830
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm just...

831
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,710
Mr. Yang!

832
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,360
Moving!

833
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,590
Please explain

834
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,110
where all this money and these treasures
you're moving

835
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,880
came from.

836
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,150
I earned them!

837
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,710
I'm at least a city lord.

838
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,770
This is just my small savings.

839
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,510
Is that not allowed?

840
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,510
Stop pretending!

841
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,630
Fine!

842
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,590
I'll tell you!

843
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,480
I killed them.

844
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,510
I'm the one
who killed those over 100 people

845
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,710
in the Hao Residence.

846
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,010
I killed them all.

847
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,710
It was my doing.

848
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,070
Then why

849
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,730
did you try to frame Tang Lici?

850
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,590
You're still denying it
when death is near!

851
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,880
No.

852
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,950
I never intended to frame Tang Lici.

853
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,040
It wasn't me.

854
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,500
It was that person.

855
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,140
He forced me to do it.

856
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,930
It was him.

857
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,620
That black-clad pipa player!

858
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,100
What black-clad pipa player?

859
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,840
When?

860
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,710
Where?

861
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,260
He's not human.

862
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,280
He's a ghost.

863
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,140
That night,

864
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,290
when I left the Hao Residence,

865
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,440
I was full of regret and fear.

866
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,880
You poisoned everyone in the residence

867
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,340
and betrayed their trust.

868
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,230
Well done.

869
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,570
A miserable death
is the reward you deserve.

870
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,430
Don't kill me!

871
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,510
I'll give you

872
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,940
whatever you want!

873
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,350
Please don't kill me!

874
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,360
You poisoned

875
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,300
over 100 people in the Hao Residence.

876
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,410
They should have died in utter misery,

877
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,960
but I killed them
with the Sound Killing Technique,

878
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,000
letting them die

879
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,400
in beautiful illusions.

880
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,110
If you want to keep your position
as city lord,

881
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,670
take
the Central Plains Sword Alliance people

882
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,140
to the old temple outside the city

883
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,980
to find me.

884
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Remember my face.

885
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,910
This is your only chance to survive.

886
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,480
It was him.

887
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,770
It was Tang Lici.

888
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,080
It was Tang Lici!

889
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,710
You said

890
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,560
the murderer was your enemy.

891
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,270
But if what you said is true—

892
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,050
that he framed you like this—

893
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,150
why didn't you take revenge on him,

894
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,070
eye for an eye?

895
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:38,240
Or perhaps,

896
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,510
he's not your enemy,

897
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,880
but...

898
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,800
He is my enemy,

899
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,250
and was once my friend.

900
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,480
Forgive my boldness,

901
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,440
but what kind of friend

902
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,550
was he?

903
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,370
What kind of friend?

904
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,360
What's the rush?

905
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,750
We haven't seen each other for so long.

906
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,190
I hope you haven't forgotten

907
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,190
all those memories we shared.
