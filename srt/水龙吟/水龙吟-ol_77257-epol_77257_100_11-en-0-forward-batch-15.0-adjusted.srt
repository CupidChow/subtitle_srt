00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,950
[Episode 11]

3
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,950
I admire your ambition.

4
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,630
That is why tomorrow,

5
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,050
you will kill for me.

6
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:21,039
Master,

7
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,160
who do you want me to kill?

8
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,970
Everyone.

9
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,100
Wuhu Fortress.

10
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,310
Renwu Sect.

11
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
Golden Leopard Gang?

12
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Miss Shei,

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,790
why don't you take a rest first?

14
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,510
You may go now.

15
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,960
Let's go.

16
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh no!

17
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,500
The ledger!

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,560
Miss Shei, be careful!

19
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,150
Sister!

20
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,410
Be careful!

21
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,330
Pull her back!

22
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,200
Watch out!

23
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,590
Fire! Help!

24
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,290
Who are you?

25
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,960
Bafeng Flame Scripture?

26
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Don't run!

27
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,360
Want to leave?

28
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,720
Did you ask me first?

29
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,310
Miss Shei!

30
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,630
Step back.Grab your sister!

31
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,400
Be careful, Sister!

32
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,829
Help!

33
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:03,630
Fire!

34
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
Help!

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,630
Mr. Sen!

36
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,560
Sen!

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,530
Hurry up!

38
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,680
Fire!

39
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,540
There's a fire!

40
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,270
Hurry!

41
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,070
Help!

42
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,600
Over there!

43
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,670
Hurry!

44
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,430
You demon from Fengliu Shop,

45
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,310
put Shei down!

46
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,180
As expected of Cloud.

47
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,430
It's a pity that...

48
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,070
Bai Suche?

49
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,550
Stop chasing!

50
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Unless you can get past me first.

51
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,930
You're not Yu Qifeng's concubine.

52
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,580
You're from Fengliu Shop!

53
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,920
So what?

54
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,270
How could you do this?

55
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,720
Was the Bai family's massacre a year ago

56
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
orchestrated

57
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,600
by Fengliu Shop?

58
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,880
Are you alright?

59
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,780
I...

60
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,470
You knew I was your enemy,

61
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,840
yet you still held back.

62
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,750
The fact that you're still alive

63
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,870
is pure luck.

64
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,790
As long as you step aside,

65
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll pretend

66
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
this never happened.

67
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,430
Besides,

68
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
I just don't want to lose my wife

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,560
at such a young age.

70
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,820
Who said I'm your wife?

71
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,510
Mr. Chi,

72
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,600
look carefully.

73
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,950
Bai Suche,
the "Moonlight Garment" back then,

74
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,800
is already dead.

75
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,750
The person standing before you

76
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,550
is just the Master's attendant.

77
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,750
For the sake of the time

78
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,880
you saved my father,

79
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
this is my final warning to you.

80
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
If you dare stand in Fengliu Shop's way,

81
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,680
I'll make sure

82
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,409
you die without a burial place.

83
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,240
You know better than I do

84
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,700
what kind of man Liu Yan is.

85
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,830
Did you join Fengliu Shop

86
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,830
to seek revenge?

87
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,870
Who are you

88
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,040
to speak the Master's name?

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,550
In the battle of Sword King City,

90
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,260
Tang Lici is doomed to die.

91
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,760
What did you say?

92
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,250
If you want to live,

93
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,310
get lost now.

94
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,700
Otherwise, you'll be the next

95
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,680
to die.

96
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Bai Suche!

97
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,190
Why did you leave before finishing

98
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,390
what you were saying?

99
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,550
What scheme is Liu Yan plotting?

100
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,950
Tell me, Bai Suche!

101
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,510
Bai Suche!

102
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,830
Bai Suche!

103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
No wonder I searched for her for so long

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
with no trace.

105
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,120
So she's been hiding
in Fengliu Shop all along.

106
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,150
Foxy Tang, you're so clever.

107
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,150
Help me analyze—

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,480
why did she join

109
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,280
Fengliu Shop?

110
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And there's Shei.

111
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,750
What exactly are those demons

112
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,350
in Fengliu Shop up to anyway?

113
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,320
How was it?

114
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,320
Did you find her?

115
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,580
There's only one place

116
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,250
where Shei could be hidden.

117
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,750
After fighting with Chi Yun, Bai Suche

118
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,880
never returned to Sword King Mansion.

119
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,700
It seems, just as she said,

120
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,050
Yu Qifeng is planning something big.

121
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
You go over there.

122
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay.

123
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,390
There's no one in the guest quarters.

124
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,390
Could it be that those sect leaders,

125
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,840
knowing they were exposed yesterday,

126
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,370
fled with their disciples?

127
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,750
How are we going to investigate then?

128
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,150
Perhaps that's the case.

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,510
Wait.

130
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,870
Yu Qifeng wouldn't

131
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,730
let them leave at a time like this.

132
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,120
Could they have been...

133
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Zhong, don't panic.

134
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
Perhaps
there's still someone in this house.

135
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,850
Let's keep looking.

136
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,310
Now Shei was taken away,

137
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,040
the ledger was burned,

138
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
and Bai Suche said

139
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
you would die in Sword King City.

140
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,540
Fengliu Shop
must be planning something big.

141
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,150
Foxy Tang,

142
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,350
what should we do now?

143
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,860
Say something.

144
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,780
You want to go rescue Shei?

145
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,720
No matter what he's planning,

146
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,520
both of us have been waiting

147
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,940
for this moment

148
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,200
since Jinye Temple.

149
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,000
Going alone

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is too dangerous.

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's go together.

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,660
I'll go too.

153
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,810
I'm also responsible for this.

154
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,790
No need.

155
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,310
This is between him and me.

156
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,370
I don't want anyone to interfere.

157
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,870
You two

158
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,380
have something else to attend to.

159
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,930
What do we need to do?

160
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,990
Last night at the Qiongtai Banquet,

161
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,150
Liu Yan took advantage of me
being off guard

162
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,680
to attack Wanqiao Chamber.

163
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,790
He let Shen go

164
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,550
just to

165
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
reveal his hiding place.

166
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,680
Yu Qifeng is now in a dead end.

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,580
He hates me to the bone.

168
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,310
To defeat me,

169
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,270
he will certainly use any means necessary.

170
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,360
And Liu Yan

171
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,030
will definitely do something for him.

172
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,160
I'll leave Yu Qifeng

173
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,260
to you two.

174
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,490
Leave him to me.

175
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,000
I absolutely won't

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,590
let that old bastard Yu Qifeng

177
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,650
cause any trouble.

178
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,350
This is the last room.

179
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,610
Where is everyone?

180
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,790
Oh no.

181
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,830
Yu Qifeng will definitely
kill them to silence them.

182
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,890
Let's follow them.

183
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,790
Stop!

184
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:44,960
Zhong,

185
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,740
watch out!

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,120
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,580
are you alright?

188
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,170
Commander Yu,

189
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,050
don't put on a fake act.

190
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
You just intervened

191
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,670
to help them escape, didn't you?

192
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,400
How dare you!

193
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,940
Who were those people just now?

194
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,630
Everyone,

195
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,750
we discovered that

196
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,720
the disciples from various sects
in the west wing

197
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,670
were all taken away,

198
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,930
so we chased them here.

199
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,550
Suddenly losing track of them

200
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,120
naturally put us in a bad mood.

201
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,980
Please forgive us, Commander Yu.

202
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,740
Ms. Zhong,

203
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,000
from what you just said,

204
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,670
do you think those villains are connected

205
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,860
to Sword King City?

206
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,650
Whether they are or not,

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,080
we'll know soon.

208
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,870
Mr. Yu,

209
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,030
those villains couldn't have gone far.

210
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,320
Let's investigate ahead together.

211
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,720
We might find something.

212
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,080
Very well.

213
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,720
The city's security

214
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,250
is also my responsibility.

215
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,450
Sword King,

216
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,550
the Blood Ghost Pill

217
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,120
has been discovered by Tang Lici.

218
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,580
And Puzhu probably has...

219
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Sword King City

220
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,390
might not be safe for us anymore.

221
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,960
Yes.

222
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,920
This is the Master's reward

223
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,420
for everyone—

224
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,240
the newly made divine pills,

225
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
even better than before.

226
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,120
Today,

227
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,800
let's have the divine pills together.

228
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,170
Here.

229
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,240
Here.

230
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,150
Here.

231
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,060
Is this the power of the divine pill?

232
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,080
My strength

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,540
keeps flowing endlessly.

234
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,550
My strength keeps flowing endlessly too.

235
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,150
Mine too.

236
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,080
Sword King,

237
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,600
the Blood Ghost Pill

238
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,120
has already been intercepted by Tang Lici.

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,050
Puzhu will eventually report this

240
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,720
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

241
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
So what?

242
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,240
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,300
has long been wary of Sword King City.

244
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,790
I've had enough

245
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,520
of those incompetent cowards.

246
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,960
And Fengliu Shop is now
at the height of its power.

247
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,480
If we

248
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,880
can eliminate Tang Lici,

249
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,750
we'll be doing Fengliu Shop a great favor.

250
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,440
One day when power shifts in jianghu

251
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,960
and Fengliu Shop
replaces the Sword Alliance,

252
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,550
I won't be

253
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,480
the only Sword King.

254
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,150
You,

255
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
you'll be Sword King Shi.

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
You'll be Sword King Li.

257
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,880
Each one of you

258
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,210
will be a Sword King!

259
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,410
-Sword King Zhao!
Sword King!

260
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,370
Sword King Zhou.

261
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,810
Sword King, since you said so,

262
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,750
I'm willing to give my life

263
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,440
to serve you!

264
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,480
We are willing to serve you!

265
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,390
We're willing

266
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,630
to die for you

267
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,960
without hesitation!

268
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,320
What's going on?

269
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,200
Let's go take a closer look.

270
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,030
Sword King,

271
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,150
what are you doing?

272
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm not breaking my promise to you.

273
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,610
I'm letting you all become a part of me.

274
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,200
After today,

275
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,940
you'll all be Sword Kings!

276
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,440
It serves you right.

277
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,840
More!

278
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,440
More!

279
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,240
More! More!

280
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,840
Not enough!

281
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,790
Not enough!

282
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,589
Pale,

283
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
fragile,

284
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,550
and such beautiful legs.

285
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,680
With a slight twist, they'd snap.

286
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,430
Aren't you scared?

287
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,589
Of course I am.

288
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,650
Then why aren't you screaming,

289
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,720
hoping Mr. Tang will come save you?

290
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Help!

291
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,240
Help!

292
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,880
Save me!

293
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Shouldn't that be what you do?

294
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,560
Mr. Tang

295
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,060
won't come.

296
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,070
He won't?

297
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,350
Mr. Tang cares deeply for you,

298
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,860
with such passionate affection.

299
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,070
How would he not come?

300
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,790
He...

301
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,400
won't come for me.

302
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,550
Even if he comes,

303
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,230
it'll be for Liu Yan,

304
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,270
not to save me.

305
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,310
Well,

306
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,210
does that mean I can kill you

307
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,970
right now?

308
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,950
Master said

309
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,110
someone like Tang Lici

310
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,110
would never

311
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,550
keep unimportant people

312
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,750
by his side every day.

313
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,880
I guess...

314
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,590
he must be deeply in love with you.

315
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,260
You just don't dare to believe it.

316
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,200
Whether you believe it or not,

317
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,720
to Mr. Tang.

318
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,000
I am insignificant.

319
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,670
Whether you're important or not,

320
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,200
we'll see.

321
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,810
I like your legs.

322
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,480
Why don't you...

323
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
give them to me?

324
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,750
Shei.

325
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,430
Shei!

326
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,790
Miss, you are so beautiful—

327
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
why do you need someone else's legs?

328
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Mr. Tang, you care for this beauty

329
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,400
and are so devoted

330
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,750
that you came to save her.

331
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You should be glad

332
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,680
you didn't truly act just now.

333
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,750
So you do care about that lady.

334
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Do I?

335
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,520
You're wrong.

336
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,720
She means...

337
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
nothing to me.

338
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,010
You say one thing but mean another.

339
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,270
Then listen

340
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,880
to the piece

341
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I prepared especially for you.

342
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,490
The Six Paths of Descent...

343
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,530
and Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance!

344
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,310
Combined

345
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,040
with my Mist Flower Pollen,

346
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,920
this move will trap a person

347
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,580
in their deepest inner demon.

348
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,690
If one stays in it for too long,

349
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,140
they will sink into the depths
of their obsession

350
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,830
and never be able to wake up.

351
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,200
Tang Lici,

352
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,110
what is your inner demon?

353
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,710
What is the sin you're hiding?

354
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,310
What is your sin?

355
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,490
The great cause remains unfinished.

356
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,210
How dare you sleep?

357
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,480
Tang Lici,

358
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,400
you were born

359
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,400
to kill.

360
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,290
This is your purpose.

361
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,770
Why did you kill us?

362
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Why?

363
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,110
Why?

364
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,240
Their sacrifice

365
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,830
was to make you perfect.

366
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,790
And your perfection

367
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,590
is meant to allow more people

368
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,920
to survive.

369
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,790
This is your destiny.

370
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,590
You all defied destiny.

371
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,590
You're nothing but a monster!

372
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,920
Who are you to abandon us?

373
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,920
No! I don't want this!

374
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,110
If I really am him,

375
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,880
will they fear me?

376
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,890
I can't drag them down with me.

377
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,410
Come take a look!

378
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Oiled paper umbrellas! Take a look!

379
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,360
Oiled paper umbrellas!

380
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,880
Lici!

381
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,960
Lici, stop.

382
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,280
Seven years have passed,

383
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,040
and you still want to leave?

384
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,810
I don't belong here.

385
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm different from you guys.

386
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,680
Enough.

387
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,170
Don't be trapped by your past.

388
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,160
A place you have forgotten
is not your home.

389
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,490
We all see you as family.

390
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,160
Come back to Zhoudi Tower with me

391
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,820
and continue your life there.

392
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,070
Jile Sect?

393
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,790
They are Yique Yinyang's subordinates,

394
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,990
a group that knows nothing but killing.

395
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,510
See?

396
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,680
Everyone fears people

397
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,880
-who know nothing but killing.
-Lici!

398
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,740
Hide behind me!

399
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,890
Take a good look.

400
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,350
How are you any different from them?

401
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,480
If they ever find out

402
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,610
you're the same kind of person as them,

403
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
they will surely fear you,

404
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,070
stay away from you,

405
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,200
and even...

406
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,200
kill you.

407
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,070
Fang Zhou,

408
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,790
the wound Chief left on your heart crystal

409
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,310
is acting up, isn't it?

410
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,130
No one will come to save you.

411
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
If my death

412
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,440
can save everyone,

413
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,790
then why not?

414
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,920
One life...

415
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,790
for all lives?

416
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,130
I did lie to you,

417
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,200
but if your sacrifice

418
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,880
can make everyone survive,

419
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,210
isn't that a good thing?

420
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,440
But I don't want to die!

421
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,400
If it weren't to save everyone,

422
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,800
you wouldn't have been born
in the first place.

423
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,400
Lici,

424
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,340
go now!

425
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,370
Go!

426
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I need to save him.

427
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
The golden eyes and forehead mark?

428
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,750
The Chief is back!

429
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,680
-Chief.
-Chief.

430
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,400
This is...

431
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
your true power.

432
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,590
This is...

433
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,350
your true nature.

434
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,030
Lici.

435
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,920
You...

436
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,160
Mr. Tang?

437
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,510
Mr. Tang?

438
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,440
He's trapped in his inner demon.

439
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,150
You can't wake him up.

440
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,030
Dying in his inner demons

441
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,570
is better than losing everything
bit by bit.

442
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,030
Chi Yun,

443
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,880
Shen Langhun,

444
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,720
Zhong Chunji,

445
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,480
Gu Xitan,

446
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
and Miss Shei

447
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
in your arms—

448
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,550
all your friends

449
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,050
will soon die with you.

450
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,180
My...

451
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,030
final mercy to you...

452
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
is...

453
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,070
No.

454
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
I need to save him.

455
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,960
Lici,

456
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,640
who are you?

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,350
He found your identity.

458
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,210
He found your identity.

459
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,030
No! I don't want to!

460
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,720
No! I don't want to!

461
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,340
you saw me get injured

462
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,960
and you saw it heal
right before your eyes.

463
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,240
I just think

464
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,350
everyone

465
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,510
might have secrets

466
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,160
they don't want others to know.

467
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
I only know

468
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
that even if wounds heal,

469
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,890
they still hurt.

470
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,120
Mr. Tang,

471
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,400
wake up.

472
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,280
The Seven‑String True Tune.

473
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,900
The Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

474
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,690
Trying to control me with my inner demon?

475
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,680
When did Liu Yan become so naive?

476
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,960
Didn't he tell you

477
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,200
that in his eyes, Tang Lici

478
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,690
is a ruthless, heartless demon

479
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,960
with no feelings?

480
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,510
How can a demon have inner demons?

481
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,960
Mr. Tang,

482
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,440
are you alright?

483
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,070
I'm fine.

484
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,639
Let me take you back.

485
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,010
No need.

486
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,630
But you're injured.

487
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,030
Shei, listen to me.

488
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,020
Chi Yun still needs me there.

489
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,840
Go back to Wanqiao Chamber
and wait for my news.

490
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,880
What is that

491
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,760
black crystal?

492
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,320
Yu Qifeng

493
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,780
is absorbing their power.

494
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,160
We need to stop him now.

495
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,400
Are you okay?

496
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,800
I won't die.

497
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,360
Black Tuli?

498
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,480
I saw it once in Dieban Chonghua's

499
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
collection room.

500
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,070
Legend has it that Yique Yinyang

501
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,800
was unbeatable

502
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,060
because of that thing.

503
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,630
Unorthodox.

504
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,520
I don't buy that crap.

505
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,060
Let's fight him first!

506
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,060
You know quite a lot.

507
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,630
Come on!

508
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,360
Impervious to weapons?

509
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,000
Shen,

510
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,590
why don't we use spells like Foxy Tang?

511
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,320
You know how?

512
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,610
I heard him use one once.

513
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What was it again?

514
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,440
How did his power

515
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
become so strong?

516
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,880
Let's kill him quickly!

517
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,810
Let's go all out!

518
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,360
You two have been fighting me

519
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,230
for so long,

520
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,270
yet your master hasn't shown up.

521
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,070
The Number one assassin?

522
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,580
The overlord of the underworld?

523
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,540
You're just his dogs.

524
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,590
I don't have time to waste on you anymore.

525
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,320
Go to hell

526
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,880
and meet Tang Lici!

527
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,000
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

528
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,850
Invincible!

529
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,670
Snake Fang!

530
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,700
Soul Breaker!

531
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,210
How dare a firefly
compete with the bright moon?

532
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,840
My nickname is Cloud.

533
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,480
You're the firefly!

534
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
You're asking for death!

535
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,760
Tang Lici?

536
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,070
Yu Qifeng,

537
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,960
were you waiting for me?

538
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,150
Tang Lici,

539
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,790
I will repay the humiliation
you've caused me

540
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,500
a hundredfold.

541
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,240
Master.

542
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,310
Tang Lici is fighting the Sword King.

543
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,710
We need to set off some fireworks

544
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,920
to liven things up.

545
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,910
The Tianyan Sword Wall?

546
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,090
Isn't Liu Yan here?

547
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,650
The Tianyan Sword Wall is collapsing?

548
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,990
Tang Lici!

549
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,880
This is Liu Yan's doing.

550
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,090
The mountain wall collapsing

551
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,000
will surely kill

552
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,360
many people at the foot of the mountain.

553
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,840
Shen,

554
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,840
go to Wanqiao Chamber and find Shei.

555
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,110
She knows who to seek.

556
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,110
Chi Yun.

557
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,220
I'll stay here!

558
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,000
Yu has absorbed a lot of people's power.

559
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,900
He's not easy to deal with.

560
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,340
No.

561
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,320
Go meet Zhong Chunji

562
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,360
and Gu Xitan

563
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,640
to evacuate the civilians.

564
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,290
This is my wager with Puzhu.

565
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,860
Help me hold it.

566
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,920
Okay.

567
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,210
Be careful.

568
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,150
It's just us now.

569
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,400
Tang Lici,

570
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,590
to defeat you,

571
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,030
Master

572
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,320
gave me a gift!

573
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,110
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual!

574
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,670
Puzhu forbade me to kill you.

575
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,550
If he knew

576
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,190
you've killed so many people,

577
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,550
he might regret

578
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,550
having shown you mercy.

579
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,020
What is that?

580
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,550
Chi Yun!

581
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,070
Chi!

582
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,480
What happened to the Tianyan Sword Wall?

583
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Where is Mr. Tang?

584
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,920
He's up there dueling with Yu Qifeng.

585
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,880
They caused the mountain to collapse!

586
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,810
Save the people!

587
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,660
Be careful!

588
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,670
Master?

589
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,320
Everyone, listen!

590
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,780
Follow me up the mountain!

591
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,690
Commander Yu!

592
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,360
If you leave,

593
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,620
what about the people of Sword King City?

594
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,110
Hurry!

595
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,190
Quickly!

596
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,480
It's dangerous here!

597
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,730
Disciples of Sword King City!

598
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,030
Follow me to evacuate the civilians!

599
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,550
Yes!

600
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,410
Such an explosion...

601
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,150
If it's really Mr. Tang...

602
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,760
Foxy Tang,

603
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,150
please be safe.
