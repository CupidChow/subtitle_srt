00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 24]

3
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,640
Not a single step back?

4
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Master Shao, you're truly skilled.

5
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,580
But if the Tai'e Sword were sealed,

6
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,240
would you still be so relaxed?

7
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,070
With your amateur skills,

8
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,420
you think you can seal the Tai'e Sword?

9
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,759
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword,

10
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,680
you can win?

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,870
You really underestimate

12
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,070
the Sword Master of the Sword Alliance.

13
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,870
Master Shao,

14
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,079
I've missed you since we parted
at Sword King City.

15
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,430
He's walking so casually.

16
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,670
Is he really here to save someone?

17
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,970
I've been walking with you for so long

18
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,050
and haven't encountered any danger.

19
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,300
Isn't this a bit strange?

20
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,740
Do you think

21
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,240
we're unharmed

22
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,710
because

23
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm in cahoots with the Fengliu Shop?

24
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,400
Liu Yan specializes
in curse bugs and poisons.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,030
The plants and trees here,

26
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,520
like the Bone-Soaking Lotus

27
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,980
we saw on the lake earlier,

28
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,390
appear harmless,

29
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
but in reality,

30
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,110
they contain deadly poison.

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,930
Poisonous plants are potent

32
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,100
but predictable.

33
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,710
Meanwhile, the changes of human hearts

34
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,570
are as unfathomable as the abyss.

35
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,300
I've already destroyed
many poisonous flowers.

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,770
You just didn't notice.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,150
However, the poison still lingers.

38
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,750
I suggest you take

39
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,079
another antidote pill.

40
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,190
I almost forgot

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,150
that you know

42
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,140
Yique Yinyang's strange technique,

43
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,540
so you don't even need it.

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,480
It's Master Shao.

45
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,100
Finally,

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
he's here.

47
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,470
You mean

48
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,020
that we face the enemy directly

49
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,750
and win with surprise tactics?

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,480
Will Liu Yan comply?

51
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,170
He dared to issue a challenge,

52
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,000
which means he's fully prepared.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
And what we need to do

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
is to make him believe

55
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,890
everything is going according to his plan.

56
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,360
You bunch of idiots

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
really came to die.

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,660
Shen Langhun moves swiftly.

59
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,270
Working with the six Sword Masters,

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
they can handle Meihua Yishu

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,920
and Kuanglan Wuxing.

62
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,180
Master Cheng and Gu Xitan

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,090
can perfectly counter Fucui.

64
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,810
Eliminating evil
and defending righteousness...

65
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,180
Happens today.

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,760
Charge!

67
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,460
This way,

68
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
of Liu Yan's skilled fighters,

69
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,070
all that remain will be

70
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,950
Miss Hong,

71
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,770
Qingchan,

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,700
Hua Wuyan,

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
and Bai Suche.

74
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,780
What's your plan?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Liu Yan and I are evenly matched.

76
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,510
To avoid
a direct confrontation with me,

77
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,920
he'll certainly use Ms. Zhong as bait

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
to lure me away,

79
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,360
then use the curse bugs to set a trap

80
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
and slaughter
the Sword Alliance's disciples.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,250
Once Liu Yan leaves Bishang Pavilion,

82
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
you will need to intercept him.

83
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,000
We can't let him join the main battlefield

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,310
nor allow him to return.

85
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,270
Only then will I have a chance

86
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,400
to rescue Ms. Zhong.

87
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,310
Therefore...

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,480
Master Shao,

89
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,770
you must use yourself as bait.

90
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,360
Tang Lici,

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
what exactly is going on?

92
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,120
All the Sword Masters are fighting,

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,450
yet you chose this path.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
When Master Shao encountered enemies,

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,270
you still remained indifferent.

96
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,400
You're not planning

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,240
to weaken both sides in this chaos

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,970
and eventually kill everyone,

99
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,840
like Yique Yinyang, right?

100
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,200
Green Corpse Curse Bug.

101
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,680
If this thing burrowed into

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
your brain,

103
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,870
trying to remove it

104
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,550
would be quite troublesome.

105
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,010
Deputy Lord Yu,

106
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,310
I know you have
misunderstandings about me,

107
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,840
but I still want to tell you,

108
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,830
that I

109
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,390
am not Yique Yinyang.

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,570
Let's go.

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,800
Step back.

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,760
Tang Lici,

113
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,570
long time no see.

114
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,920
After you fought your way out,

115
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,450
did you encounter

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,540
anyone else?

117
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,470
Deputy Lord Yu,

118
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,340
so this is what you've been hiding.

119
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,580
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

120
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Such a commotion.

121
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,770
Something is definitely wrong here.

122
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,600
Chief,

123
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,890
I'm annoyed each time I come here.

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Coffins in cold water?

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,630
Only Gui Fusheng

126
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,390
would create

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,560
such cumbersome and tedious things.

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,680
As long as you can create

129
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,720
what I want,

130
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,390
the Floating Abyss is yours to use.

131
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,560
What you want

132
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,510
is almost ready.

133
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,669
Just give me a little more time.

134
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,080
Once the Leader delivers

135
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
the promised Sky-Fallen Stone fragments,

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,870
I will create

137
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,630
a true miracle.

138
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
The Inverted Dream

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,860
won't disappoint you, Chief.

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,870
What's this "inverted" nonsense?

141
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,030
What weird stuff is this weirdo

142
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,000
trying to do?

143
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,390
We have a visitor.

144
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,710
You want me to personally distract Liu Yan

145
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,520
to buy you time for the rescue?

146
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,490
This round, Liu Yan and I

147
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,810
are competing for
the preemptive advantage.

148
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,130
I am fully confident.

149
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,460
Master Shao, please rest assured.

150
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Just proceed according to the plan.

151
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Master Shao,

152
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,050
long time no see.

153
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,970
Dr. Liu,

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
thanks to your presence,

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
the people here

156
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,250
aren't left without medical care.

157
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,510
I, Shao,

158
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,200
truly failed to recognize your status.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,650
I didn't realize

160
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,600
you're the master of Fengliu Shop.

161
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,840
It seems that it's my honor

162
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,020
to have you lower yourself

163
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,100
to meet me in person.

164
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,670
May I ask,

165
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
as a descendant of Zhoudi Tower,

166
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,360
why have you gone astray

167
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,000
and committed such evil deeds?

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,610
Sword Master, stop wasting time.

169
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,330
I won't answer your question.

170
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,290
Let's see if Tang Lici comes
to save you first

171
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
or if you will

172
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,510
die in battle first?

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,750
I see now

174
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,960
that Sword King Yu
is guarding the pass for Liu Yan.

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,400
Master Shao is facing Liu Yan already.

176
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,660
I need to make it quick.

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,830
Go save Ms. Zhong first.

178
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Hurry!

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,340
Mofeng Black Fire.

180
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,150
Phoenix's Bloody Tears.

181
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,980
Ten Blazing Suns, Lotuses Bloom!

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,540
Neither truly dead nor alive,

183
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,600
why live such a miserable existence?

184
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,870
Don't tell me

185
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,250
that after the battle in Biluo Palace,

186
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,830
you actually believed his disguise.

187
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,160
Doing bad things

188
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,670
doesn't make you a bad person,

189
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,390
as long as you're not caught.

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,050
Don't let your life

191
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,770
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

192
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,100
become the price of your misplaced trust!

193
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,350
Tang Lici,

194
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,530
you're indeed a monster.

195
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,300
Yu Qifeng.

196
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,890
I can kill you right now.

197
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,540
Of course you can kill me.

198
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,720
Today,

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,480
I've already trapped
the Sword Alliance here.

200
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,390
Tomorrow, I'll storm into Sword King City,

201
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,590
invade Biluo Palace,

202
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,360
and turn the entire jianghu

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,080
into a river of blood!

204
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
and release

205
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,750
the followers who were imprisoned
on Camellia Island

206
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,550
They've waited for so many years

207
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,370
and can finally welcome back...

208
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,630
Yique Yinyang.

209
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,250
Follow and live, or resist and die,

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
just like over 10 years ago.

211
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,200
He is my enemy.

212
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,370
Since that's what you believe,

213
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
I'll help make your dream come true.

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,990
Yique Yinyang.

215
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,440
You really are Yique Yinyang.

216
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,480
Are Biluo Palace and the Sword Alliance

217
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,030
all just

218
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,160
your excuses to yield in order to gain?

219
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,030
Furen,

220
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,030
you're truly my good son.

221
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,080
I will kill Yique Yinyang right now

222
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,660
to honor your heroic sacrifice.

223
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,590
Father, you actually want to kill me?

224
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,090
Do you see now?

225
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,690
He's the one who's been
using you all along.

226
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,600
Draw your sword.

227
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,090
Tang Lici.

228
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,520
Draw your sword.

229
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,750
My son, why are you drawing your sword?

230
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
You believe Yique Yinyang

231
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,670
but not your own father?

232
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,240
You're not my father at all!

233
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
Die!

234
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,390
In our next life, we'll be enemies,
not father and son!

235
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,150
Acting on impulse

236
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,810
nearly ruined everything.

237
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,550
That voice...

238
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,150
How may I address you?

239
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,720
Ghostly Peony.

240
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,960
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,100
You should rest and recover here,

242
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,450
and await assistance.

243
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,920
Yu Qifeng has delayed me for too long.

244
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,650
I'll go rescue Ms. Zhong first.

245
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,030
I wonder how Mr. Tang

246
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,440
and the others are doing.

247
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,200
Stone!

248
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,000
Stone, are you alright?

249
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,170
I have a feeling

250
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,980
that Master

251
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,360
is in danger.

252
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,380
There are traps here.

253
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,089
There's poison!

254
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,480
This formation has been activated.

255
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,869
Everything within its reach

256
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,130
becomes territory for my Martial Realm.

257
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,590
Drawing boundaries to create a prison,

258
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,120
trapping oneself in a cage.

259
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,790
Is Liu Yan always

260
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,550
so self-pitying like this?

261
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,690
Master ordered me

262
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,340
to delay you for a moment.

263
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,680
You think you can trap me

264
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,550
with just this cage and smoke?

265
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,510
Mr. Tang,

266
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,630
don't underestimate this cage.

267
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
Once you leave

268
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
this cage,

269
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,170
Ms. Zhong will be in grave danger.

270
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Moreover,

271
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
Master has also

272
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,790
left something for me.

273
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,200
This item is called
the Moon in Water Mirror.

274
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,960
It not only reveals

275
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,890
all your actions

276
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
but also allows you to witness

277
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,370
how Fengliu Shop slaughters
the Sword Alliance.

278
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,510
However, Mr. Tang

279
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,040
and Ms. Zhong, don't worry.

280
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,750
The place where you are now
is perfectly safe.

281
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,610
Just wait until they're all dead,

282
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,970
then come out to collect their bodies.

283
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,350
Ms. Zhong,

284
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,790
hang in there.

285
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,490
How did you escape?

286
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,510
No self, no form.

287
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,330
The one you saw in the cage

288
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,010
was merely an illusion.

only then might you stand a slim chance

And you, Ms. Zhong,

418
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
are still putting on a facade.

419

If this thing burrowed into

439
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,650
your brain,

440
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,350
trying to remove it

441
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,190

Weren't you told to wait for assistance?

447
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,530
You should rest and recover here,

448
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,790
and await assistance.

449
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,300
Stop spacing out. Follow me.

450

Master Shao,

451
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
it seems you won't last

452
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,970
until Mr. Tang arrives.

453
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,270
Who says my body is failing?

454
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,510
Master Shao!

455
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,420
Master Shao!

456
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,330
Are you alright?

457
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,060
Master Shao!

458
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,100
A few more of you
won't make any difference.

459
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,420
Come on if you dare!

460
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,780
It's blood.

461
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,310
This is Hua Wuyan's blood.

462
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,040
He died,

463
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,750
but his death

464
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,930
will bring you all a great gift.

465
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,430
The formation eye mark left by Tang Lici.

466
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,580
Search for the mark.

467
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,440
-Hurry.
-Okay.

468
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,030
Pu,

469
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,960
your antidote pills
aren't working anymore.

470
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,840
How would I know

471
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,790
this thing could mutate?

472
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,810
Everyone, hold on!

473
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,920
The Peony Pavilion

474
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
means nothing to me.

475
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,560
It's no matter to abandon it.

476
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,240
But you nobodies...

477
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
None of you will escape

478
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,130
from under my watch!

479
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,720
If I release all the power

480
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,780
of the Tai'e Sword,

481
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,550
I can surely defeat Liu Yan.

482
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,240
Since the situation can't be reversed,

483
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,960
we should at least
make this demon die with us.

484
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,790
Stars in the vast cosmos,

485
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
the mystery of mysteries!

486
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,720
Illuminating the dark night,

487
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,390
bringing order to the heavens.

488
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,810
Reflecting upon mountains
and rivers as protection.

489
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,430
All living beings,

490

Biluo Palace returning to Luo River

492
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,940
was thanks to your assistance.

493
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,720
If trouble befalls the jianghu,

494
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,200
Biluo Palace

495
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,110
can lend the Celestial Thunder Technique

496
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,270
to help the Sword Alliance
achieve victory.

497

Palace Chief Wanyu

498
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,890
is counting on you.

499
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,710
Poison spreads everywhere.

500
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Heaven's virtue is lost.

501
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,200
I, who worship the stars,

502
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,850
Wanyu Yuedan...

503
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,390
Sincerely perform this dance
to ward off evil,

504
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,820
borrowing the spirits of heaven and earth.

505
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,810
May the Thunder God clear the path,

506
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,870
and bring rain to eliminate disaster!

507
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,260
Consecrate the sword!

508
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,950
Liu Yan,

509
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,540
you have already lost this battle.

510
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
You can abandon the Peony Pavilion.

511
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,520
You can abandon your comrades.

512
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,960
You can also easily abandon

513
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,510
the righteous path taught by Fang Zhou.

514
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,410
But I will never abandon

515
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
any disciple of the Sword Alliance.

516
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,680
I swore on the Tai'e Sword

517
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,800
to protect

518
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,350
the lives of all disciples.

519
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,000
I will personally cut off

520
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,240
your demonic head.

521
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,920
Even if I have to die for this,

522
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,320
fighting for justice...

523
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,750
What is there to fear?

524
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,730
If we were elsewhere,

525
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,880
I would probably

526
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,340
have died under that move.

527
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,930
But since I lured you here,

528
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,880
I'm obviously prepared.

529
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,480
This is

530
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,160
the Ice Flower curse bug
that I prepared

531
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,290
for the Tai'e Sword.

532
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,750
Combining the power of three,

533
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,110
I waited specifically
for the moment of sword consecration

534
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,030
to control you

535
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,420
and show you

536
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,370
what true despair really is.

537
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,130
Master Shao,

538
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,750
if there were
true righteousness in this world,

539
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,680
how could Fang Zhou have perished?

540
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,950
Master Shao!

541
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,750
Master!

542
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,870
Master!

543
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,750
Chunji,

544
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,550
I'm glad you're back.

545
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,370
I'm glad you're back.

546
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,120
Liu Yan,

547
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,310
Hua Wuyan died because of you.

548
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
How many more times

549
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,950
will you repeat such needless sacrifices?

550
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,080
Those words should be directed at you.

551
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,680
I'm curious to know

552
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,000
how many more heroes

553
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,560
you'll send to their deaths

554
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,950
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

555
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,470
You...

556
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,350
Chunji.

557
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,270
Chunji.

558
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,420
Chunji!

559
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Besides such clumsy provocations,

560
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,670
what else can you do?

561
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,480
Clumsy?

562
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,350
Could it be clumsier

563
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,000
than the lies you told me at Biluo Palace?

564
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,420
I've been to Zhoudi Tower.

565
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,280
There was clearly nothing there!

566
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
In that case,

567
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,820
I'll capture you first

568
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,170
and then explain everything clearly.

569
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,510
You often use that innocent face

570
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,760
to deceive people

571
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,659
who believe your nonsense.

572
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,909
None of you are innocent.

573
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,550
You always think

574
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,840
you can do anything.

575
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,110
The Sword Alliance

576
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,010
was ruined because of your confidence.

577
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,140
Master Jiang,

578
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,110
all the curse bugs

579
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,440
are attacking Mr. Tang.

580
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,520
Follow Mr. Tang's orders.

581
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,800
Notify the Mole Camp

582
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,960
to light the fire!

583
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,740
Liu Yan,

584
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
you've used all your backup plans

585
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,590
to attack me.

586
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,420
You've already used up
all your trump cards.

587
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,920
The endgame has arrived.

588
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,880
This is what I mean by...

589
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,270
"giving back in twofold"

590
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,550
Tang Lici,

591
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,590
the Peony Pavilion is yours now.

592
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,370
I wonder when we meet again,

593
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,920
what kind of person

594
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,070
you will become.

595
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,360
Great!

596
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,500
Look at what's written here.

597
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,060
Look!

598
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,640
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

599
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,370
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

600
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,360
We've won!

601
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,150
Victory!

602
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,000
Zhong Chunji, the heroine
and Chief of Shanfeng Branch,

603
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,710
all of this

604
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,230
was given to you by him.

605
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,960
Not a single thing

606
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,630
truly belongs to you.

607
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,000
That's why you fight so hard

608
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,880
to defend him.

609
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,190
It's because you know that, without him,

610
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,630
you are nothing.

611
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,180
If you think I'm so worthless,

612
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
then why waste your breath?

613
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,760
Kill me already!

614
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,800
In your heart,

615
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,070
there's also a monster.

616
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,070
This attack on Fengliu Shop

617
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,590
cost many lives.

618
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,280
It's because Senior Zhong
was too eager for merit

619
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,590
and acted without following orders.

620
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,500
Don't say that.

621
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,360
It was always the plan

622
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
to attack Fengliu Shop.

623
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,880
Sooner or later, we had to attack anyway.

624
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,140
It's not good if someone overhears this.

625
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,750
I really want to know

626
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,960
how many more heroes

627
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,860
you'll send to their deaths

628
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,090
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

629
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,590
Who is it?

630
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,400
Ms. Zhong,

631
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,280
it's me.

632
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,760
Where is Mr. Tang?

633
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,080
Where is my Master?

634
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,790
They're talking in Wanhua Hall.

635
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,230
Why are you up?

636
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,110
You need to rest more.

637
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,170
Ms. Zhong,

638
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,910
you've suffered so much.

639
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,730
It's alright now.

640
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,810
When I was in Yanxian,

641
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,590
I was also imprisoned and tortured.

642
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,500
You were the one who saved me.

643
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,090
That feeling of despair

644
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,670
was truly unbearable.

645
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,880
Thankfully,

646
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,760
we're both safe now.

647
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,440
By the way,

648
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,450
while you were unconscious,

649
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,510
Mr. Tang came to examine

650
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,590
your injuries.

651
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,250
They're just some surface wounds.

652
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,740
This is the medicine he provided.

653
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,950
As long as you take it regularly,

654
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,480
you'll recover soon.

655
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
Everything will be fine.

656
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,730
Thank you,

657
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,610
Shei.

658
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,150
Master Jiang,

659
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,840
you'll be responsible
for arranging guards to patrol

660
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,100
and secure the perimeter of Mount Cloud.

661
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,360
As for distributing medication

662
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,110
and taking care of the wounded,

663
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,560
Master Ji will be in charge of that.

664
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,670
-We will do our best.
-We will do our best.

665
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,280
Mr. Tang,

666
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,960
I had many misgivings
about you before.

667
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I feel ashamed.

668
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,220
This battle at Peony Pavilion...

669
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,290
I understand.

670
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,960
No need to worry, Master Jiang.

671
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,250
Hold it in.

672
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,470
It would be embarrassing
if we both coughed up blood here.

673
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,290
The Sword Alliance is a complex group.

674
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,950
Now, all branches are united.

675
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
It's truly a feat.

676
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,540
Thank you for your help,
Palace Chief Wanyu.

677
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,830
If it weren't for you,

678
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,030
the Sword Alliance would have
suffered greater losses.

679
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,960
As allies,

680
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,950
helping each other is expected.

681
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,190
It's a pity we couldn't

682
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,700
eliminate them completely.

683
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,630
We searched the entire Peony Pavilion

684
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,230
but couldn't find

685
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,000
the whereabouts

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
of Liu Yan and other key figures.

687
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,400
However, blowing up

688
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,130
the entire Peony Pavilion base

689
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,360
and forcing Liu Yan to abandon his hideout

690
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,440
has boosted morale,

691
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,550
so it wasn't a complete waste.

692
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,900
Indeed.

693
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,550
But Master Puzhu

694
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,410
still hasn't sent any news.

695
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,400
I wonder if he's safe.

696
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,840
Looking at it like this,

697
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,630
the world seems so small.

698
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,580
But after staring for a while,

699
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,840
this tiny night sky

700
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,330
feels like a vortex.

701
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,910
It keeps spinning,

702
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,710
pulling people in.

703
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,690
If we died here,

704
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,020
would it count as dying together?

705
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,330
Miss Tao,

706
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,790
why did you join Fengliu Shop?
