3
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,530
[Four years ago, in the peach blossom
forest of Zhoudi Tower]

4
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,070
A friend who would move heaven and earth

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,920
to kill me.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
A friend whom I would search

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,380
to the ends of the earth

8
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,030
just to find.

9
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,920
Yan,

10
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,840
for the past six months,

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
you've been avoiding me.

12
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,670
Actually, that day...

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Back then,

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,780
under the blossoms stretching for miles,

15
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,820
Senior Brother taught you,

16
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,570
me,

17
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,700
and Zhumei our craft.

18
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,370
It was warm in the spring.

19
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,460
What a beautiful time.

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,990
But now,
the flowers still bloom as they did,

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,130
yet the people are gone.

22
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,610
After Senior Brother left,

23
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,610
Zhumei vanished without a trace.

24
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,390
In the Zhoudi Tower,

25
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,510
only you and I remain.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,190
Lici,

27
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,770
you composed this melody back then.

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,650
Today, let's play it once more for him.

29
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,120
What do you say?

30
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,010
A childhood composition

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,090
could never compare
to

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,450
Senior Brother's masterpieces.

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,840
But I think

34
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,480
this melody

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,200
is the best I've ever heard.

36
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,250
Yan…

37
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,480
This is the only melody

38
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,250
worthy of sending you to your grave.

39
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
You used a curse bug on me?

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,690
If you hadn't come wounded,

41
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,040
I couldn't have
planted it in you so easily.

42
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,990
Tang Lici,

43
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,300
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

44
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,650
Yan…

45
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,390
Yan,

46
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,490
it's been four years

47
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,870
since we parted.

48
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,790
Killing me once wasn't enough for you.

49
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,430
Now,

50
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,190
you're using the Hao family massacre

51
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,480
to lure me into your trap

52
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,430
to kill me again.

53
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,650
Since that's the case,

54
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,049
I'll play along.

55
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,330
Let's see if after four years,

56
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,549
you can still manage to kill me.

57
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,150
It was him.

58
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,330
It was Tang Lici.

59
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,680
It was Tang Lici!

60
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,570
It was he

61
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,440
who told me to say this.

62
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,840
It wasn't me.

63
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
Please spare me.

64
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Let me go.

65
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,790
There's someone

66
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,960
so vicious in the jianghu.

67
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,300
How dangerous.

68
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,020
Stop playing dumb.

69
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,860
Why did you kill Lord Hao?

70
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,550
For money?

71
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,120
Or did he have something

72
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,750
on you?

73
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,670
It was because...

74
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,480
Who's there?

75
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,480
Chi Yun!

76
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,060
The Blood Ghost Pill?

77
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,290
Jianghu matters
should be settled in the jianghu.

78
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,350
Either you kill me,

79
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,650
or I kill you.

80
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,430
Masters and servants
can turn on each other for money.

81
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,070
Brothers can betray and kill each other.

82
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,720
In the end,

83
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,250
the heart is the hardest to see through.

84
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,730
Demons are everywhere.

85
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
Amitabha.

86
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,910
Right and wrong, good and evil—
they're just a thought apart.

87
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,000
What you can't let go of is obsession.

88
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,650
You're very wise, sir.

89
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,820
Salvation lies in your own hands.

90
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,000
I believe

91
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,150
you'll eventually reach the other shore.

92
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,910
Yan,

93
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,290
I'm coming for you.

94
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,170
When it comes to lightness skills,

95
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,870
who can compare to me, Chi Yun,

96
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,630
the Cloud?

97
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,910
Stop!

98
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,970
A messenger goose?

99
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,630
You're from the Yanmen Sect?

100
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,240
I forgot Yanmen had this trick.

101
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Had I known,

102
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,630
I'd have raised a hawk myself.

103
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,420
Where did Chi Yun go?

104
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,410
Miss Zhong!

105
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,390
Miss Zhong!

106
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,500
Miss Shei?

107
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,440
Where did this ship come from?

108
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,070
Miss Shei, why are you here?

109
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,350
Mr. Tang brought me here.

110
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,180
He said we'd meet you here.

111
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,520
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

112
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,700
You won't be able to catch up with him.

113
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,730
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

114
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,030
And why did Miss Shei come too?

115
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,700
Since we're hunting down the culprit,

116
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,890
it's natural to bring along the victim.

117
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,320
The person you're looking for

118
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,250
has already gone dozens of li west.

119
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,870
Taking the waterway would be faster.

120
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,530
You already know everything.

121
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,740
That man is incredibly agile.

122
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,250
He's no ordinary fighter.

123
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,510
With the Cloud,

124
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,390
we won't

125
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,760
lose him.

126
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
And we can

127
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,930
catch up with them.

128
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,590
I never expected

129
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,570
this pleasure ship
would have such mechanisms.

130
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,320
Wait.

131
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,480
Mr. Tang, why are you so certain

132
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,200
that Chi Yun will come this way?

133
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,270
I'm not certain

134
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,530
about Chi Yun's route.

135
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,030
I'm just certain
where the killer is headed.

136
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,390
You mean…

137
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,050
you already know
who the killer is?

138
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,480
Due to my personal affairs,

139
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,070
I have gathered much information.

140
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,510
And coincidentally, one clue

141
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,290
points right here.

142
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,720
Six months ago,

143
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,000
the Westwind Swordsman, Feng Chuanxiang,

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
vanished mysteriously
from Liulian Cottage.

145
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,790
Only his footsteps leading into

146
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,120
the cottage were found.

147
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,620
None leading out.

148
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,240
It is said that

149
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,910
in Liulian Cottage,

150
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,630
there were traces
of two people living there.

151
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,570
After Feng Chuanxiang disappeared,

152
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,090
his mysterious roommate

153
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,690
vanished too.

154
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,630
And the answer

155
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,670
lies in this very item.

156
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,960
A goose feather?

157
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,590
Long and resilient;

158
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,320
lustrous and smooth.

159
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,480
This is no ordinary goose feather.

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Messenger geese?

161
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,610
Yanmen's messenger geese?

162
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,180
100 li east of Yan County

163
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,300
is the Yanmen Sect.

164
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,440
This river flows from east to west.

165
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,370
If the killer wants
to avoid implicating Yanmen,

166
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,300
he'll head west.

167
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,690
Even if something happens
and he turns east midway,

168
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,290
he'll run right into us.

169
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
But...

170
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,570
that's impossible.

171
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,860
Why do you say that, Miss Zhong?

172
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,330
What kind of sect is the Yanmen Sect?

173
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,580
The Yanmen Sect began as a bandit clan

174
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,750
but was granted amnesty
by the former dynasty

175
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,150
and became

176
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,270
the military guards of the Yanmen Pass.

177
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,870
Their goose-training skills
are remarkable.

178
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,620
10 years ago,
when the world fell into chaos,

179
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,840
the Sword Sect led many great fighters

180
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,240
to hunt down Yique Yinyang.

181
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,750
Yanmen provided

182
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,870
crucial intelligence.

183
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,390
Its leader, Jiang Feiyu,

184
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,330
has a fiery temper,

185
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,390
but he's extremely

186
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,960
protective of his own people.

187
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,910
That's why Yanmen disciples

188
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,570
value loyalty above all else.

189
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,500
There's a saying in the jianghu:

190
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,310
"Better to offend the King of Hell's men

191
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,310
than to cross someone from Yanmen."

192
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,440
It sounds like

193
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,020
a righteous sect.

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
It doesn't just sound like it—

195
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,250
it is a righteous sect.

196
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,860
Yang Shangqing

197
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,000
was also from a righteous sect.

198
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:26,870
I found this

199
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,120
on Yang Shangqing.

200
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,500
To be honest,

201
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,410
my master sent me down the mountain

202
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,200
not only for the Hao family massacre

203
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
but also for this matter.

204
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,380
These evil pills

205
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,820
haven't been seen again

206
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,750
since the death of Yique Yinyang.

207
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,360
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

208
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,730
I've paid attention

209
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,730
to the Blood Ghost Pills too.

210
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
My leaving the temple

211
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,390
should tell you what I think.

212
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,520
Then…

213
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,520
Miss Zhong,

214
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,170
don't worry for now.

215
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,090
Come have some refreshments.

216
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,030
Talk.

217
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,630
Who are you?

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,680
Who sent you to kill that guy?

219
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,750
You think staying silent will save you?

220
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,480
Don't…

221
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
Don't push me.

222
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:35,970
Don't push you?

223
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,000
Then why do you think

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,310
I chased you for over 100 li?

225
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,880
For fun?

226
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Brat,

227
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,500
don't take poison!

228
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,869
Even an ant fights to stay alive.

229
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,329
Please don't take poison.

230
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,780
It's not poison.

231
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,230
What the hell is that?

232
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,190
This is getting difficult.

233
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,560
Chi Yun, you're not

234
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,960
as good as you used to be.

235
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,930
I haven't even gone all out yet.

236
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,440
Let's stop here.

237
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,820
He knelt right before you.

238
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,880
The assassin who killed Yang Shangqing

239
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,550
is actually

240
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,650
Jiang Cheng.

241
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,920
Miss Zhong, you know him?

242
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,560
Jiang Cheng is the young master of Yanmen.

243
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,270
He's upright and chivalrous,

244
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,860
a close friend
of the Westwind Swordsman.

245
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,030
They often went to the Huaxi region

246
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,160
in the Sword King City

247
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,520
to fight injustice and help the weak.

248
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,330
They're known

249
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,890
as the Twin Heroes of Huaxi.

250
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
Six months ago,

251
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,830
the Westwind Swordsman

252
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,240
vanished mysteriously at home,

253
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,080
and Young Master Jiang
also went missing.

254
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,610
How did he become like this?

255
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,530
What are you murmuring?

256
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,300
Foxy Tang, what are you murmuring?

257
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,440
I still need to ask him

258
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,100
why he killed Yang Shangqing.

259
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,310
Is anyone hurt?

260
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Drop the act.

261
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,570
I really don't remember anything.

262
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,520
Young Master Jiang.

263
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,350
You…

264
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,390
You've got the wrong person.

265
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm…

266
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm not Young Master Jiang.

267
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,310
Over a year ago,

268
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,160
I met you and Mr. Feng

269
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,710
at the Sword Sect in the Central Plains.

270
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
I'm not mistaken.

271
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,280
Now that we know who he is,

272
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,000
there's no need for questions.

273
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,960
I'll just take him

274
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
to the Yanmen Sect

275
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,200
and let his people

276
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,410
explain for him.

277
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,310
Watch out!

278
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
Mr. Tang.

279
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,970
You're injured.

280
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,240
You're injured.

281
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,190
Don't use this hand for now.

282
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,000
You wanted to take your own life

283
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,450
because you were worried that your actions

284
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,770
would disgrace Yanmen's name, right?

285
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,040
Foxy Tang,

286
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,660
you were right.

287
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,140
The so-called Yanmen Sect

288
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,850
is just a bunch of filth.

289
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,030
Watch your mouth!

290
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,350
You don't know anything!

291
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,510
What should I know?

292
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,430
The Blood Ghost Pills…

293
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,200
Those evil pills

294
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,540
have resurfaced in the jianghu.

295
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,990
I thought I had the wrong person,

296
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,600
but it seems I was right.

297
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,420
You do have the wrong person.

298
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,510
I'm not him.

299
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,070
The poison has spread within you.

300
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,240
Your energy flow is reversed.

301
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,370
You don't have long.

302
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,410
You're not afraid of death,

303
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,510
but you don't want to die now.

304
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,310
You still have unfinished business.

305
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,910
Am I right?

306
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,090
If you don't want to speak

307
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,190
with all these people here,

308
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,050
we can talk privately elsewhere.

309
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Hey!

310
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,310
What's so secret

311
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,110
that it
can't be said in front of us?

312
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,920
Foxy Tang

313
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,680
is being so mysterious.

314
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,140
Miss Shei,

315
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,510
how is

316
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Tang's injury from earlier?

317
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,810
Miss Zhong, don't worry.

318
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,680
Once we get back,

319
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,130
I'll apply some more medicine for him,

320
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,130
and he'll be fine.

321
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,990
But, Mr. Chi,

322
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,720
what exactly are

323
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,980
the Blood Ghost Pills?

324
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,600
Why does everyone

325
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,110
go pale

326
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,510
when they're mentioned?

327
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,920
They were created by Yique Yinyang,

328
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,110
the former dynasty's Imperial Preceptor
and leader of the Jile Sect,

329
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,270
to control people.

330
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,680
To control people?

331
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,610
In the jianghu,

332
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
power has always been respected above all.

333
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,640
Who doesn't want

334
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,370
to excel and rise above others?

335
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,370
But not everyone

336
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,000
has the ability and talent.

337
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,390
Greed knows no bounds.

338
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,480
The weak crave power,

339
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,190
and the strong

340
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,720
seek shortcuts
to become even stronger.

341
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,130
Those evil pills

342
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,070
can give your cultivation a huge boost.

343
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,070
So initially,

344
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,480
the Blood Ghost Pills

345
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,200
were treated

346
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
like a popular tonic.

347
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,350
But soon after,

348
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,200
people realized

349
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,260
they'd been duped.

350
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,830
Why?

351
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
Anyone who takes those pills

352
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,910
has to keep taking them for life.

353
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,260
If they stop,
they go mad and die.

354
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,090
So whoever has the Blood Ghost Pills

355
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,890
controls those people's lives.

356
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,300
Yique Yinyang

357
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,130
used this very method to seize control

358
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,520
of half the jianghu.

359
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,130
More than a year ago,

360
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,180
after arguing with my father,

361
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,100
I went to stay with Chuanxiang.

362
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,150
We lived together on Mount Huaxi,

363
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,550
practicing martial arts

364
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,830
and fighting for justice.

365
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
[Liulian Cottage]

366
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,970
During that time,

367
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,170
my martial skills improved dramatically.

368
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,030
I thought it was because

369
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,890
Chuanxiang was training with me.

370
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,170
But little did I know,

371
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,030
he was secretly taking evil pills

372
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,680
and mixing them into my food.

373
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
After I found out about this,

374
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,510
I confronted him
about why he spiked my food.

375
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,680
He wouldn't tell me.

376
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,130
He only told me to trust him,

377
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,370
saying he'd help me.

378
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,660
Jiang Cheng,

379
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
please trust me.

380
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
I will help you.

381
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,310
But I didn't want

382
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,310
that kind of help.

383
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,030
And I didn't need

384
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,960
to improve my skills

385
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,200
through such means.

386
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,350
After that,

387
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,840
I refused to take the pills again

388
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,030
and asked Chuanxiang

389
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,030
to help me suppress the poison in me.

390
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
But that process

391
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
was agonizing.

392
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,930
It was so painful
that just

393
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,330
thinking about it makes my mind go blank.

394
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,570
Then, six months ago,

395
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,360
Chuanxiang suddenly disappeared,

396
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
leaving me alone.

397
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,440
I searched everywhere

398
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,080
but couldn't find any trace of him.

399
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,860
So I carried
the remaining pills he had bought

400
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,440
and started

401
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,700
tracing their source,

402
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,990
which eventually led me

403
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,200
to Yang Shangqing.

404
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,470
So you feared

405
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,200
Yang Shangqing

406
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,530
might expose the truth,

407
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,790
ruining the reputation of Feng Chuanxiang,

408
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,790
the Westwind Swordsman.

409
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,440
That's why,

410
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,820
even at the risk of being

411
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,220
chased down by the Cloud,

412
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,780
you still killed him.

413
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,790
If I'd had

414
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,790
any other option,

415
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,920
I never would've taken the pill again.

416
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,350
Wind swept across the reed flowers;

417
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,790
moonlight shone on Mount Huaxi.

418
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,640
We...

419
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,580
we were such good friends.

420
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,680
Mr. Tang,

421
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,110
I want to find Chuanxiang

422
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,760
and ask him

423
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,920
why he did this to me.

424
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,990
We were friends who'd die for each other.

425
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,660
Why do we have to turn against each other?

426
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,910
Very well.

427
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,050
I understand.

428
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,740
You're fortunate.

429
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,640
Today,

430
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,030
I'm in a good mood.

431
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,010
I'll give you two choices.

432
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,860
Choice one:

433
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,420
you die now.

434
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,980
That way,

435
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,690
everyone in the jianghu

436
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,380
will immediately know

437
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,990
the Jiang family of Yanmen

438
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,640
colluded with the remnants
of the Jile Sect

439
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
and took evil pills.

440
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,790
Choice two:

441
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,840
I help you suppress the poison,

442
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,000
and you'll die in three months.

443
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,660
Then I'll consider

444
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,170
leaving Yanmen's reputation intact.

445
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,140
What's the condition?

446
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,380
That pipa player in black—

447
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,400
you've seen him, right?

448
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,610
He revealed clues

449
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,440
that led you to Yang Shangqing,

450
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,390
didn't he?

451
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,450
He looks exactly like you.

452
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,770
He killed a lot of people

453
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,560
and saved a lot of people too.

454
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,720
He's a madman.

455
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,360
Where is he?

456
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,950
He is nowhere

457
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,750
yet everywhere.

458
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,700
You won't find him.

459
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,030
He only appears

460
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,360
when he wants to see you.

461
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,600
Mr. Tang…

462
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,230
help me.

463
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,560
He can't help you.

464
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,230
Because he can barely protect himself.

465
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,070
Report!

466
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,080
Master Jiang,

467
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,030
we've spotted the young master

468
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,360
in the reed marsh ahead.

469
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,270
Foxy Tang!

470
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,470
Foxy Tang, what's going on?

471
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,680
Why is he dead?

472
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,470
Look.

473
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,890
What is that?

474
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,200
This is…

475
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,100
A curse bug.

476
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,680
Oh, no.

477
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,710
The Yanmen Sect

478
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,110
must think we killed him.

479
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,160
Mr. Tang,

480
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,790
we…

481
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,790
Foxy Tang,

482
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,120
Yanmen's goose formation

483
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,850
is quite famous in the jianghu.

484
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,910
Be careful. Don't…

485
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,750
Kill!

486
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,080
I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng.

487
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm willing to go with you for punishment.

488
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,310
I plead guilty

489
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,600
and surrender myself.

490
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,160
Master Jiang, please temporarily

491
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,510
uphold justice for the Sword Sect.

492
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,370
Are you insane?

493
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,720
What do you mean?

494
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,120
This guy

495
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,020
is my accomplice.

496
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:24,850
Master,

497
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,290
I've completed

498
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,120
almost

499
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,440
all the tasks you gave me.

500
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,070
Now, you are

501
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,390
the esteemed Master of Fengliu Shop.

502
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,710
Tang Lici is just a nobody

503
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,040
hiding in a ruined temple in Yan County.

504
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,710
You could even

505
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,310
kill Shao Yanping

506
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,510
from the Sword Sect

507
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,370
without breaking a sweat if you wish.

508
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,620
Forgive my ignorance,

509
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,400
but why don't you

510
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,060
just kill Tang Lici outright?

511
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,840
So why go through

512
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
all this trouble?

513
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,220
What's the point

514
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,680
in killing a monster like him?

515
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,400
He can't be killed,

516
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,010
and he has no humanity.

517
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,640
Tang Lici is certainly a monster.

518
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,230
Hua Wuyan, am I right?

519
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,900
Miss Hong.

520
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,989
Master,

521
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,989
you can't let him

522
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,420
die so easily.

523
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,070
If I can kill him once,

524
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,730
I can kill him a second time.

525
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,850
Hong,

526
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,670
tell me—

527
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,469
how should I kill him this time?

528
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:53,969
Naturally,

529
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,440
you should make him feel what you felt,

530
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,940
suffer what you suffered,

531
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,250
ensure he's condemned by all,

532
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,580
and completely ruin his name.

533
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,330
In the end,

534
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,630
let him die miserably

535
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,840
amid the curses of thousands.

536
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,690
Someone help!

537
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,630
I'm not his accomplice!

538
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,990
I'm just a passerby!

539
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,070
Let me out!

540
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,220
I'm innocent, I swear!

541
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,440
Look at the Yanmen Sect.

542
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,890
People are in cages

543
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,320
while birds are outside.

544
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,190
It's truly a sect

545
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,650
with no respect for rules.

546
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,650
This really has

547
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,960
opened my eyes.

548
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,470
Chi Yun,

549
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,720
be quiet.

550
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,840
What?

551
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,050
You have a plan?

552
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,590
My ears hurt.

553
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,110
You…

554
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,030
Following you

555
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,960
has brought me the worst luck ever!

556
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
"I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng."

557
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,990
Are you insane?

558
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,190
If you wanted to come in here,

559
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,550
you could've come alone.

560
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,010
Why did you bring me along?

561
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,930
I was afraid of being bored alone.

562
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,670
Why are you still carrying that thing?

563
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,870
This is his curse bug.

564
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,030
Your mortal enemy?

565
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,070
Besides him,

566
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,630
who else could have

567
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,090
used something like this?

568
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,360
Even if that's true,

569
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
you can't be at the end of your rope.

570
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,160
Why don't you think about

571
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,930
what his plan might be?

572
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,920
To frame you?

573
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,470
He first framed you

574
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,530
for killing Hao Wenhou and his family

575
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,090
and then pinned
Jiang Cheng's murder on you.

576
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
That's right.

577
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,600
What's right?

578
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,520
Now, unless the dead come back to life,

579
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,370
no one…

580
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,070
can prove

581
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,400
my innocence.

582
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,530
What are they doing?

583
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,110
That...

584
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,070
Foxy Tang,

585
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,470
they're about to boil us alive.

586
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,030
You're too noisy.

587
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,970
I'm starting
to regret bringing you in here.

588
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,050
Stop carving that wood!

589
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,920
Think of something!

590
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,530
They'll cook you in a bit

591
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,990
and eat you in 18 ways.

592
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,700
Neither of us will escape.

593
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,860
Think of something?

594
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,390
Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

595
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,150
Then you...

596
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,320
Because I never planned

597
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,380
to get out on my own.

598
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,000
Tang Lici,

599
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,260
you're insane, aren't you?

600
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,470
You truly are insane! I'm certain now.

601
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,800
You are insane!

602
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,630
You…

603
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,890
Mr. Jiang, please believe me.

604
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,920
I swear on my honor as a disciple

605
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,850
of the Sword Sect

606
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,670
that I'm telling the truth.

607
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,320
Enough!

608
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,630
Miss Zhong,

609
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,110
what you're saying is

610
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,910
simply too shocking to believe.

611
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,160
Cheng…

612
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,110
he was my elder brother's

613
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,150
only son.

614
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,670
I practically

615
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,800
watched him grow up.

616
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,260
I know his character well.

617
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,760
How could he possibly

618
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,620
have taken that kind of evil pill?

619
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,250
The evil pills have begun to spread again.

620
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,550
Mr. Tang was

621
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,280
actually helping him

622
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
suppress the poison.

623
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,520
Miss Shei can testify to this.

624
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,110
Yes.

625
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,310
Are you done talking?

626
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,420
I know,

627
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,910
Master Jiang,

628
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,760
after losing your son,

629
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,320
you're very…

630
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,650
Have you ever lost a son?

631
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,760
Then what do you know?

632
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,990
You know nothing!

633
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,750
Brother.

634
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,070
Brother.

635
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,870
Master Jiang.

636
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,910
Master Jiang!

637
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,830
Master Jiang.

638
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,000
There must be a reason

639
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,640
why Jiang Cheng took the pills.

640
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,020
It's up to you
to uncover the truth

641
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,110
and clear his name.

642
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,720
If you let grief blind you

643
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,840
to the truth and evidence,

644
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,960
aren't you just playing right into

645
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,360
the real killer's hands?

646
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,960
I saw with my own eyes

647
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,330
Cheng's body explode

648
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,550
in front of Tang Lici.

649
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,330
Tang Lici has admitted it herself!

650
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,630
What more proof

651
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,720
do you need?

652
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,800
Today, I'll make sure

653
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,190
that the murderer Tang Lici

654
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,760
will suffer Yanmen's

655
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,820
Three Cuts and Six Stabs Punishment.

656
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,840
If it turns out later that I killed

657
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,760
the wrong man,

658
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,960
I'll take my own life

659
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,840
to atone for it.

660
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,330
Light the fire!

661
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,630
If they

662
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,280
really put me on that burning stake,

663
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll fight my way out of here.

664
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,630
Chi Yun,

665
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,250
a lot of times,

666
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,780
only when you hit rock bottom

667
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,440
does a way out finally appear.

668
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,690
What's happening?

669
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,700
Such a nice fragrance.

670
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,440
The scent of magnolia.

671
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,630
No,

672
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,510
not flowers.

673
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,500
It's sword energy.

674
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,660
Only one person
has this kind of sword energy.

675
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,880
Who?

676
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,630
The one

677
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,180
who vanished long ago—

678
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,920
the Westwind Swordsman,

679
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,730
Feng Chuanxiang.

680
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,850
Mr. Feng?

681
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,190
I heard

682
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,190
you'd gone missing,

683
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,450
and I found it strange.

684
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,570
With such exceptional skills,

685
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,360
how could you

686
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,490
have just vanished?

687
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,720
I did encounter some problems.

688
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,320
Are you here today

689
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,470
to see Cheng?

690
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,450
Cheng has been killed.

691
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,850
I know.

692
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,550
Then why did you

693
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,750
extinguish the fire?

694
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,360
I was going to

695
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
make the murderer

696
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,390
suffer the Three Cuts
and Six Stabs Punishment

697
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,670
before burning him to ashes

698
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,760
to honor Cheng's spirit in heaven.

699
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,670
Understand?

700
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,150
I can say with certainty,

701
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,990
Master Jiang,

702
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,110
that Cheng's death
is part of

703
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,440
something much bigger.

704
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,940
Cheng and I were close friends.

705
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,200
I'd never
deceive you

706
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,730
about something like this.

707
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,170
You know something?

708
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,840
There is indeed something off.

709
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
If you're willing

710
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
to trust me,

711
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,520
would you allow me

712
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,880
to investigate it?

713
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,840
Brother,

714
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,610
isn't that Cheng's…

715
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,770
Master Jiang,

716
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,040
do you believe me now?

717
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,200
What do you want?

718
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,360
I want…

719
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,430
Mr. Tang.

720
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,360
I need

721
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,990
to think it over carefully.
