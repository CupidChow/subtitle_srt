[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,920
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,500
This is a trace of sword energy

4
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,350
left by Ancestor Xuanqing
and sealed within

5
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,479
the Yanhuang Sword.

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,130
With this sword energy nurturing you all,

7
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,460
your skills will surely advance further.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,860
The Westwind Slashing Wildfire

9
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,070
is too powerful and might hurt

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,400
my fellow cultivators.

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,360
So today, on the sword stage,

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,200
I shall use other techniques instead.

13
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,800
Victory or defeat doesn't matter.

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,259
Just a friendly exchange.

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,240
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,030
The Sword King reigns!

17
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,000
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

18
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
The Sword King reigns!

19
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,120
It's the Sword Duel Festival
in Sword King City.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
Aside from allied shipping guilds,

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,590
entry into the city

22
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,990
requires an invitation.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,540
Told you you were late.

24
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,870
The Sword Opening has started.

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,470
To enter Sword King City now,

26
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,800
you need an invitation.

27
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,750
Looks like

28
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,270
I'm still too early.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
Too early?

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,870
You're late.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,030
Watch and learn.

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,020
I am Chi Yun,

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,770
Chief of Huoyun Fortress.

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,750
I've come to pay my respects
to Sword King Yu.

35
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,420
However,

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
I left in a hurry and forgot

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,730
to bring my invitation.

38
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,520
Please,

39
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,810
do us a favor.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,310
Huoyun Fortress?

41
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,310
Never heard of it!

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Some no-name sect

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
trying to freeload

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,280
in Sword King City?

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,810
Get lost!

46
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,360
Chi Yun,

47
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,030
it seems Sword King City

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,400
doesn't care much for your reputation

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,360
as the Cloud.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,870
Foxy Tang,

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
how big a scene should I make?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
That depends on how capable

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,840
you are.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,750
No private fights

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,810
in Sword King City!

56
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,850
Commander,

57
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,410
they're trying to force their way in
without invitations.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,030
During the Sword Duel Festival,

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,400
no one enters the city

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
without an invitation,

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,950
not even the Cloud.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
I heard that

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,400
the Sword Duel Festival welcomes
heroes from all over the world.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,700
But now it seems there is

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,300
a clear hierarchy after all.

66
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,640
Go get your punishment.

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,190
Yes.

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,990
He acted recklessly.

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
Please forgive him.

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,790
However, this is the rule
of Sword King City.

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,640
If you don't have invitations,

72
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,750
I'm afraid

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,460
I cannot let you in.

74
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,630
What if I

75
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,950
insist on entering today?

76
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,970
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

77
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,560
Clear the way!

78
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,630
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,240
Clear the way!

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,160
The Master of Wanqiao Chamber

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,750
congratulates the Yu family
on the festival

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,310
and presents 10 baskets of pearls.

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,680
During the festival,

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,390
all purchases in the city's shops

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,600
are on the house.

86
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,000
What a show-off.

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,630
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship
has arrived.

88
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,510
Sir, I think

89
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,630
you should step aside for now.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,500
The winds are high,
and the waves are rough.

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,830
Perfect for traveling.

92
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,130
Your small boat is packed with people.

93
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,330
Beware of capsizing.

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,120
Watch out!

95
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,530
You're about to crash!

96
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,360
Stop!

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,600
Greetings, Master.

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,050
You're the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,390
Well,

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
since I can't enter Sword King City

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
as Tang Lici,

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,390
then I'll just have to

103
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,510
borrow the invitation

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,640
of Wanqiao Chamber.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Just now,

106
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,680
I didn't know
you were the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,010
I may have offended you.

108
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,000
I apologize.

109
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,320
But I don't understand.

110
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,200
Why would you, with an invitation in hand,

111
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,070
still make such a big scene?

112
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,600
If I hadn't made a scene,

113
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,480
how else could I see

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,810
where the problem lies?

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,260
Commander,

116
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,120
have we just offended

117
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,630
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

118
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,760
Go tell Sword King Yu

119
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,800
that I'm eccentric by nature

120
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,700
and dislike being seen,

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,930
so there's no need to blame anyone.

122
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,390
Guys,

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,050
please get on board.

124
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,670
He's showing off again.

125
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,370
Foxy Tang,

126
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,240
this is

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
way too…

128
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,400
luxurious.

129
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,300
H-How much money

130
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,480
do you actually have?

131
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,210
I don't know.

132
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Never counted it.

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I remember you were never

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
interested in business.

135
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,670
What's your plan for running

136
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,190
Wanqiao Chamber?

137
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,440
Does one have to live

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,610
only for what one's interested in?

139
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,090
Tang Sen.

140
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,480
Yes.

141
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,530
Help my friends settle in.

142
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,200
Make sure they feel

143
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,040
right at home.

144
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,490
Yes, Master.

145
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,480
This young man's talent

146
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,340
is impressive.

147
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,600
He's lasted 30 minutes

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,950
against Sword King Yu.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,250
Impressive!

150
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,070
The Sword King is formidable!

151
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,000
You're too kind.

152
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,730
You have great potential.

153
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,960
Work hard, and you will

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,500
achieve great things.

155
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,230
Look at him.

156
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,990
The Sword King gave him personal pointers,

157
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,800
yet he just walked away without a word.

158
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,710
How rude.

159
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,890
What's talent worth

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,060
if you don't have manners?

161
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,610
Zhong, did you see that?

162
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,150
Sword King Yu just aimed for

163
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,080
his vital point.

164
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,660
And his angle was extremely tricky.

165
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,670
Good thing we had a clear view

166
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,320
from here.

167
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,870
If Mr. Lin hadn't

168
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,330
dodged at the last second,

169
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
he'd be crippled—

170
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
if not dead.

171
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,290
The path of martial arts runs deep.

172
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,490
Talent is like a small boat.

173
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,730
It can carry you or sink you.

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,120
One can't

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
rely solely on talent

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,180
and lose humility.

177
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,390
There are

178
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,390
no shortcuts.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,440
But why did Sword King Yu

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
go that hard on him?

181
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,270
Perhaps out of jealousy.

182
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,270
Exactly.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,930
Does anyone else

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,730
wish to come up and compete?

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,580
Master,

186
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,320
here is the account book
for the six months

187
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
you've been away.

188
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,480
Any word from my foster father?

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,740
The imperial father-in-law says

190
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,970
everything in Wanqiao Chamber

191
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,100
is at your disposal.

192
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,470
By the way,

193
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,120
Miss Shei

194
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,720
seems interested in bookkeeping.

195
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,250
Got it.

196
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,400
Master,

197
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,160
Miss Shei requests to see you.

198
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,540
Now that you're in the city,

199
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,510
why not just visit Sword King Manor?

200
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,610
No need to visit in person.

201
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,720
The bigger the stir I made today,

202
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,200
the more attention I'd draw

203
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
to myself.

204
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,490
You don't just want the attention

205
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,220
of Sword King Yu, right?

206
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,360
Since I've come,

207
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,970
he'll definitely come too.

208
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,870
What's going on?

209
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,030
Yeah, it's so cold.

210
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,320
It suddenly got cold.

211
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,390
Indeed.

212
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,270
Why did it suddenly get cold?

213
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,910
Yeah.

214
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
It's snowing.

215
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,240
It's snowing.

216
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm Xue Xianzi.

217
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,510
I've long heard of your name, Sword King.

218
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,170
Please give me some guidance.

219
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Xue Xianzi?

220
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Is that really Xue Xianzi?

221
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,790
Is it an impostor?

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
He's acting mysteriously.

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,580
He must be an impostor.

224
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,800
What a surprise.

225
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,500
Xue Xianzi,
the Hermit of Snow, has come too.

226
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,630
You're a master of the sword.

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,090
I don't dare presume

228
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,500
to offer any guidance.

229
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,150
I can't say

230
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,280
you are wrong.

231
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,630
You flatter me, Sword King.

232
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,890
The Yu family has produced
ten generations of Sword Kings,

233
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,240
while I've only been known

234
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
for a few short decades.

235
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,870
How could my pale snow

236
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,190
ever compare to your blazing flame?

237
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,790
How arrogant!

238
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,910
Is he…

239
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,390
truly Xue Xianzi?

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,610
I've met him before—

241
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,550
once in the jianghu

242
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,720
with my senior.

243
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,320
That is

244
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,670
indeed him.

245
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Please,

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,240
do me the honor.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You flatter me.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,870
We both share a love for swordsmanship.

249
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,600
A friendly match

250
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,630
is all.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,510
Please.

252
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,750
Then, Sword King,

253
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,480
prepare yourself

254
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,410
for this strike.

255
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,270
The Hermit of Snow.

256
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,970
It really is him.

257
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,770
Sword King, let's see if you

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,270
can withstand this strike

259
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,080
from me.

260
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,440
It seems

261
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,140
everyone has seen

262
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,050
Sword King Yu's
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

263
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,040
Are you alright?

264
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,600
Oh, no.

265
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,840
He lost.

266
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,090
He lost?

267
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,310
What's happening?

268
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,590
You really are

269
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,550
the top swordsman of our time—

270
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,010
Yu Qifeng, the Sword King.

271
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,790
I've

272
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,270
lost.

273
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,110
Looks like Xue Xianzi

274
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,780
is here to stir up trouble.

275
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,520
Yu Qifeng's Westwind Slashing Wildfire

276
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,530
truly lives up to its reputation.

277
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,700
I am

278
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,890
so impressed.

279
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,070
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

280
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,400
Miss Shei, please go inside first.

281
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,200
I have some matters to attend to.

282
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,390
All right, Mr. Tang.

283
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,670
Shen.

284
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,510
It's time.

285
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,680
Let's go.

286
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,070
[Tianyan Sword Wall, Sword King City]

287
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,510
Tianyan Sword Wall.

288
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,910
So this is Yu Xuanqing's sword essence.

289
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
It's truly powerful.

290
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,510
What a pity.

291
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,880
This secret legacy exists,

292
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,440
yet there's no worthy successor.

293
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
The grand Sword King City

294
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,410
has long been blinded by greed.

295
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,680
Otherwise,

296
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
how could it have been tainted

297
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
by the Blood Ghost Pills?

298
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,109
Why did you

299
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,390
bring me here?

300
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,330
To rattle the grass…

301
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,450
and scare out the snake.

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
There's indeed more to it than it seems.

303
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,770
The essence of the Sword Phoenix?

304
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,890
You are not of this realm.

305
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,540
Why have you set foot in this realm?

306
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Only when one abandons the mortal flesh

307
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,130
and comes between reality and the void

308
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,060
can one glimpse the past and the future.

309
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
I am Tang Lici.

310
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,480
Please grant me your guidance,
Sword Phoenix.

311
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,710
A golden eye on the forehead…

312
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,920
Yique Yinyang,

313
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,140
it's you.

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,420
You're actually still alive.

315
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,310
Since that's the case,

316
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,770
I shall take your life here!

317
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,720
Such power…

318
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,520
That's the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

319
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,300
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

320
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,720
But

321
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,060
why is it different from the one

322
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Sword King Yu unleashed earlier?

323
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,550
Yeah, it looks different.

324
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,310
What's going on?

325
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,070
Indeed.

326
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
Sword King Yu's sword essence
is as dark as night.

327
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,000
Why is this one crimson red?

328
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,620
Who cares what color it is?

329
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,670
This sword essence

330
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,200
has heaven-shaking power.

331
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,200
Truly,

332
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,810
the young phoenix

333
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
outshines the old one.

334
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,970
Sword King!

335
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,820
Sword King,

336
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,780
an outsider breached
the Tianyan Sword Wall.

337
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,190
We're not powerful enough to get close

338
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,160
and don't know what to do.

339
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,360
We await your orders.

340
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,950
The Yu family's
most powerful sword technique

341
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,810
has been mastered by an outsider.

342
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,690
This is going to be interesting.

343
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,510
An outsider broke in.

344
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,550
Who was it?

345
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,510
Someone actually had the nerve

346
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,000
to break into Sword King City's
forbidden ground.

347
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,270
How audacious!

348
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,070
Sword King,

349
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,960
you must punish them

350
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,030
and teach that person

351
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,910
a good lesson.

352
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,700
The Yu family has
taken in disciples for a century—

353
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,630
all to pass on the way of the sword

354
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,060
and benefit the jianghu.

355
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,830
If someone

356
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,160
from outside

357
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,890
truly glimpsed its mysteries,

358
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,200
my ancestors' efforts

359
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,400
wouldn't be in vain.

360
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,920
However,

361
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,790
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire
is extremely profound.

362
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,640
Without years of diligent practice,

363
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,570
how could anyone

364
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,960
master it so easily?

365
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,690
To find out whether that person

366
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,220
has really mastered it,

367
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,440
we just need

368
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,570
to go and see for ourselves.

369
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,950
Exactly!

370
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,030
Sword King,

371
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,310
broaden our horizons.

372
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,200
Am I right?

373
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes.

374
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,480
That's right.

375
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,010
Please broaden our horizons.

376
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,960
Since you all are so interested,

377
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,680
then follow me

378
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,940
to meet

379
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,680
this brave trespasser.

380
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,550
-Great!
-Great!

381
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,790
-Thank you, Sword King.
-Thank you, Sword King.

382
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,990
You're magnanimous.

383
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,060
Zhong,

384
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,580
there's really someone up there.

385
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,440
Everyone,

386
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,410
the winds here are too strong.

387
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,560
Please wait here.

388
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,030
I'll go ask

389
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,830
the friend up there to come down.

390
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,350
Darn it. I'm stopped here again.

391
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,100
Why could that person go up?

392
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,480
Friend,

393
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,400
understanding the sword essence
is dangerous.

394
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
I shall not disturb you.

395
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,090
Please turn around.

396
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,070
You entered Sword King City

397
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,350
without announcing yourself

398
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,900
and trespassed into the forbidden ground.

399
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,560
That's quite disrespectful.

400
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,160
No matter how you went up

401
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,160
the Tianyan Sword Wall by luck,

402
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,170
now that the master is here,

403
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,510
you should at least
turn around for a talk.

404
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,240
Indeed. He's not even turning around.

405
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,070
So rude!

406
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,240
You're actually

407
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,500
also a disciple of Zhoudi Tower.

408
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,280
Head Fang was a man of great wisdom.

409
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,160
He must have had his reasons

410
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,960
for accepting you as a disciple.

411
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
This is the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

412
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,730
Watch it carefully.

413
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,750
Whether you can master it

414
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,510
is up to you.

415
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,600
Ignorant brat,

416
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,960

00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,780
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

451
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,920
I unleashed

452
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,880
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire just now.

453
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,370
What do you think of it, Sword King Yu?

454
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,840
It truly was
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

455
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,040
It was the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

456
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,730
Are you alright?

457
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,290
I spent 50,000 taels of gold

458
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,100
and fought my way into the tower
to get you.

459
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,430
I can't let you die here.

460
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,420
I thought I was mistaken.

461
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,570
It really is you, Mr. Tang.

462
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,770
Miss Zhong.

463
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,140
Zhong,

464
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,550
so this is Mr. Tang Lici,

465
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,960
the one you mentioned?

466
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,480
I recognize him.

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,070
He's the one who summoned

468
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,920
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship

469
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,240
outside the city just now.

470
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

471
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,790
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

472
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,590
He's so young.

473
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,510
It's him.

474
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

475
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,070
Turns out Mr. Tang is

476
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,510
none other than the famed

477
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,040
Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

478
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,720
Back in Yanmen,

479
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,410
when I captured Jiang Qingyu,

480
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
I didn't expect

481
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,910
our next meeting

482
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,370
would be like this.

483
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,540
Deliberately hiding your identity,

484
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,070
hiring a notorious

485
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,200
jianghu assassin,

486
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,350
and trespassing on
my family's forbidden ground—

487
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,920
was it

488
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,750
all to meddle in Jiang Qingyu's case?

489
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,280
Exactly.

490
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,290
The case will be judged fairly.

491
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,830
How could Mr. Tang abuse his power

492
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,030
and be so aggressive?

493
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Right.

494
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,830
He even brought an assassin.

495
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,230
Planning to use
both carrot and stick, huh?

496
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,550
Sword King Yu, in one statement,

497
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,350
you were wrong about two things.

498
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,200
First,

499
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,000
the one who captured Jiang Qingyu

500
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
was me.

501
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,120
Tang Lici captured him?

502
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:37,920
What?

503
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,240
Didn't Sword King Yu say

504
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,310
that he personally captured

505
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,110
Jiang Qingyu?

506
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,350
Second,

507
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,030
Jiang Qingyu was involved

508
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,530
in the Hao family massacre.

509
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm a victim.

510
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,620
How could you say I'm meddling?

511
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,090
Mr. Tang,

512
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,930
are you doubting my ability
to handle the case?

513
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,520
I have my own leads,

514
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,600
but one person's judgment alone

515
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,060
can't convince everyone.

516
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,930
Then Sword King,

517
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,100
why not hold a public trial
for Jiang Qingyu?

518
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,440
Yes, a public trial.

519
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,970
Yes, a public trial!

520
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,440
Since the Master of Wanqiao Chamber

521
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,770
is involved in the case,

522
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,200
a public trial is the only way
to convince everyone.

523
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,440
Yes, bring Jiang Qingyu to trial!

524
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,920
Public trial!

525
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Try him publicly!

526
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,070
That's right.

527
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,870
Public trial!

528
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,720
Public trial!

529
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,160
Public trial!

530
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,350
Put Jiang Qingyu on public trial.

531
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,640
You're all correct.

532
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,310
He should be

533
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,880
interrogated in front of

534
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
all martial artists.

535
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,110
It seems

536
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,480
I've arrived at the perfect time.

537
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,830
Those with purpose

538
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,170
always arrive at the right time.

539
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,890
At the Qiongtai Banquet
the day after tomorrow,

540
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,830
I will publicly try Jiang Qingyu

541
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,410
and give the martial arts world

542
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,850
a satisfactory answer.

543
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,640
Anyone in Sword King City
is welcome to attend.

544
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's try him together

545
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,830
and expose the mastermind behind him!

546
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,270
-Great!
-Great!

547
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,160
The Sword King is wise!

548
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,200
The Sword King is wise!

549
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,550
Mr. Tang,

550
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,830
do you dare to come?

551
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,170
If the Sword King dares,

552
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,130
why wouldn't I?

553
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,610
As a small punishment

554
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,360
for arriving late,

555
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,880
my friend.

556
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
The drizzle's just stopped.

557
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,580
The monk is tired of the journey.

558
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,510
The Go game is like the game of stars.

559
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,120
You always sought solitude.

560
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,750
I never thought

561
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,080
you'd be disturbed by worldly affairs

562
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,110
and go to Sword King City

563
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,710
for the Sword Duel Festival.

564
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,090
I'm no man of the mundane world.

565
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,770
With no attachments

566
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,720
or obstacles,

567
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,730
I come and go as I please.

568
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,100
You've been pondering for a long time.

569
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,860
Something's troubling you?

570
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,830
Three years ago,

571
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,840
we played our first game
at Wenqi Pavilion.

572
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,600
Since then,

573
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,070
we've bonded through Go,

574
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
meeting once a year.

575
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,640
Though I call you my friend,

576
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,100
I've never truly understood you.

577
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,400
The path you seek

578
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,510
is the path of salvation.

579
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,760
But tell me—

580
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,420
is the one you're trying to save

581
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,960
truly

582
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,430
worth saving?

583
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,860
The six realms and three lives

584
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,320
all have their own karma.

585
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,230
Those I encounter

586
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,430
are those I must save.

587
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,570
I simply do what I can to save others

588
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,110
with a clear conscience.

589
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,449
It seems

590
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,630
you once made some choices

591
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,570
that trouble your conscience.

592
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,409
Just making conversation.

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,800
My friend,

594
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,260
don't take offense.

595
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,760
You're right.

596
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,330
If there is someone...

597
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,940
I am not listening to that.

598
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,300
You only have two hours

599
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,130
to rest here.

600
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,929
You came to play Go with me, didn't you?

601
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,030
Friend,

602
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,940
are you deliberately letting me win?

603
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,920
Then I'll accept your kindness.

604
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,270
Every time we play,

605
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,650
you always use your power
to protect the flowers.

606
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,850
I just wonder

607
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,340
how many people like you
exist in this world.

608
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,020
I just hope

609
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,560
the one you never meant to harm

610
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,060
won't die

611
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,330
because of you.

612
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,480
What the hell

613
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,740
is Fengliu Shop doing?

614
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
With your vast connections,

615
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,630
how could you not know

616
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,560
Tang Lici is
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

617
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,280
That brat

618
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,550
just seized
the Sword Phoenix's essence just like that

619
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,950
and stole the spotlight!

620
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,360
Sword King, you rashly promised Tang Lici

621
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,960
a public trial,

622
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,120
and all you care about
is who stole the show.

623
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,250
The Fengliu Shop is so eager
to control me.

624
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,820
Sending Madam Bai wasn't enough?

625
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,990
Now they've sent you?

626
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,710
You only knew Tang Lici

627
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,370
went up the Tianyan Sword Wall

628
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,360
but didn't realize

629
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,230
he also sent Xue Xianzi

630
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,480
to test your limits.

631
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,950
Have you truly not noticed

632
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,590
that your secret—

633
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,760
using the divine pills
to improve your sword skills—

634
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,130
has already been exposed?

635
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,860
And instead of making amends,

636
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,140
you've walked right into his trap again.

637
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,950
He's likely already seen through

638
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,750
every one of your foolish moves.

639
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
Master is already on his way.

640
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,450
If you still can't think of something,

641
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,120
then prepare to die.

642
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,070
Sword King,

643
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,920
here is today's

644
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,150
guest registry.

645
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,590
[Puzhu, Tianjing Pavilion; Yin Sanxiao,
Dongfang Xu, Yinqi Alliance]

646
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,270
Tang Lici may be scheming,

647
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,720
but I'm not without a counter.

648
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,730
The one to stand trial the day
after tomorrow won't be Jiang Qingyu.

649
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,960
It will be Tang Lici.

650
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,720
All I need is for your master

651
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,550
to lend me an expert in disguise.

652
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,150
Master Puzhu, since you've been ordered

653
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,610
to investigate this case,

654
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,790
I'll speak plainly.

655
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,760
When I interrogated Jiang Qingyu,

656
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,710
he wouldn't reveal

657
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,710
who was behind him—

658
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,760
only that this person

659
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,690
held great power

660
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,760
and that revealing their identity

661
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,420
could doom his entire family.

662
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,590
Besides the imperial court,

663
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,850
who else could do that?

664
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,360
Second,

665
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,310
he said the Blood Ghost Pills

666
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,510
have already spread across the jianghu,

667
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,960
not just around Mount Tai.

668
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,560
Who else but Wanqiao Chamber

669
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,540
can have a merchant network

670
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,600
spanning the world

671
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,260
and also imperial backing

672
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,340
to sell the Evil Pills

673
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,900
everywhere?

674
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,690
You think Wanqiao Chamber

675
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,590
is secretly selling the Evil Pills?

676
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,360
Exactly.

677
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,840
I'm afraid I've fallen into the trap

678
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,630
set by the emperor's uncle,

679
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,360
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

680
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,860
He's been pressuring me nonstop,

681
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,660
trying to interfere
in Jiang Qingyu's trial.

682
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,480
Sword King Yu,

683
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,290
you're trying to mislead me.

684
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,580
I'm merely stating the facts.

685
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,690
I only

686
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,030
look at evidence.

687
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,770
On the day of the public trial,

688
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,370
the evidence you want

689
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,510
will be revealed.

690
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,630
No need to wait.

691
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,280
I will

692
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,120
question Jiang Qingyu now.

693
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,760
Now?

694
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,050
Some things

695
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,870
are best said
when fewer ears are listening.

696
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,770
After all,

697
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,260
aside from Tang Lici,

698
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,550
the other person

699
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,680
with such reach and resources

700
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
is you, Sword King Yu.

701
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,810
The innocent have nothing to fear.

702
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,100
Sir, please follow me.

703
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,510
Please come in.

704
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,610
The treasure ship of Wanqiao Chamber

705
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,670
is truly luxurious and magnificent.

706
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,930
If you get oil stains on my clothes,

707
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,240
you'll wash them yourself as always.

708
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,550
Miss Zhong.

709
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,000
Miss Shei.

710
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,720
You've also come to Sword King City.

711
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,450
I almost didn't recognize you.

712
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,690
Right?

713
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Shei looks prettier now, right?

714
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,620
I must thank you, Miss Zhong,

715
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,210
for saving me back in Yanxian.

716
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,290
Seeing you well now

717
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,040
puts my heart at ease.

718
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,230
Mr. Gu,

719
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,680
don't stand on ceremony.

720
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,700
This is Chi Yun, the Cloud.

721
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,890
This is Miss Shei.

722
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,760
This is

723
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,510
Mr. Gu from the Sword Alliance.

724
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,560
Nice to meet you.

725
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,280
So,

726
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,960
you're also here

727
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,690
for that so-called Sword King?

728
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,230
Yes.

729
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,840
But Master Puzhu

730
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,970
has already gone to meet Sword King Yu.

731
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,210
Please.

732
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,850
This way.

733
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,420
What's happening?

734
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,080
Shen Langhun,

735
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,850
it's you!

736
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,710
How dare you come here

737
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,910
to kill the criminal?

738
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,560
Put out the fire!

739
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,420
Protect Sword King Yu!

740
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,240
-Yes!
-Yes!

741
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,410
Why hasn't Shen come back yet?

742
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,880
The fire's already out.

743
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,160
Has something happened to him?

744
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,680
It was

745
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,360
a trap there.

746
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,250
As expected.

747
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,830
Did anyone see you?

748
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,360
No.
