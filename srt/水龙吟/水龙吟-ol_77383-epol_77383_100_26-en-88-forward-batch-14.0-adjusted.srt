[Episode 26]

3
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,039
Master Shao was initially

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,400
hesitant indeed,

5
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,590
but then

6
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,080
Mr. Tang gave a passionate speech,

7
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,070
saying that you are

8
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,710
a role model
for the Sword Alliance's disciples.

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,870
We support Mr. Tang

10
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,370
and will fight against the Fengliu Shop.

11
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,009
Chunji,

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,110
who told you

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,090
all that nonsense just now?

14
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,509
All of you, come here!

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
Master Jiang.

16
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
Uncle Master, please don't.

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,550
Chunji, don't be afraid.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,960
I'll stand up for you.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Will you dare

20
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,690
to speak nonsense again?

21
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,280
No.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,640
Apologize to Ms. Zhong.

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,250
Ms. Zhong, please be merciful

24
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,630
and forgive our ignorance.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,520
Get out.

26
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,780
Yes.

27
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,760
Master Uncle.

28
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,579
Why are you suddenly like this?

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
Chunji.

30
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,820
Master Jiang.

31
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,260
Chunji,

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,940
I heard from other disciples

33
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,340
that you've moved back to Shanfeng Branch.

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,630
What Master Shao means

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,100
is that Chunji can return

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,630
because she's the Branch Chief

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,870
of Shanfeng Branch.

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,000
Other than her,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,950
I won't allow anyone

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,200
to sit in this seat.

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,450
I see.

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,180
It seems you have something

43
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,520
to discuss with Chunji.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,180
I'll leave you two alone then.

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
Master.

46
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,550
What's going on here?

47
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,070
It seems the news has spread.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,600
What news?

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Chunji,

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,490
don't you know about

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,240
the tattoo on your body?

52
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,170
What tattoo?

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,490
I don't know anything about it.

54
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,290
See for yourself.

Recently,

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
I asked Master Shao

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,590
about the tattoo

59
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,800
on Miss Zhong's back.

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,780
To find the Princess of Lang Ya

61
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,620
is a matter of great importance.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,680
I've written to inform my godfather.

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,250
If someone from the palace comes,

64
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,329
Master Shao, don't be surprised.

65

If you're not dead in four days,

66

I'll give you a great gift.

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,280
A gift that will make you

68
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,520
truly valuable.

Minister Tang
and General Yuchi have arrived.

71
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,000
Invite them in.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Yes.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
Minister Tang?

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,510
Why would a court official

75

Miss Zhong,

please come with me
to the Empress's temporary palace,

81
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,860
so she can verify your identity.

What is it?

97
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,570
I suppose getting Shui Duopo's help

98
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
won't be easy.

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,110
It's easy.

100

She's right in there.

101
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,650
Just go knock on her door
and ask for treatment.

102
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,730
If she agrees to treat you, good.

103

If not, we'll think of something else.

104

It's not troublesome.

105
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,620
If it's not troublesome,

106
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,550
why are you running away?

Have you changed your mind?

112
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
Are you planning to hand
little Xue Fu over to me?

113
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,310
Don't even think about it.

Little Xue Fu staying with me

You want to go back on your words?

Not a chance.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
I should never have agreed

She's so young.

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

130
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
She's actually

131

Yique Yinyang is already dead.

He has nothing to do with me.

138
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,680
Let me check your pulse.

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,410
What kind of martial arts do you practice?

140
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,360
With an injury like yours,
you should be dead by now.

141
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,690
How are you still alive?

142
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,510
Are you interested, Senior?

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm not interested.

144
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,670
Just curious.

145
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,490
You, come here.

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,390
Me?

147
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,790
As I thought.

148
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,320
I see now.

149
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,870
There's no medicine for your injury.

150
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,940
Indeed, there's no medicine

151
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,340
for my injury.

152
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,230
It's understandable that you're at a loss.

153
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,580
Who are you underestimating, youngster?

154
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,810
I only said there's no medicine for it,

155
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,410
not that it can't be treated.

156
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,200
It's just that there's no medicine.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Besides,

158
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,910
it would only treat the symptoms,
not the cause.

159
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,500
Senior,

160
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,550
what do you mean?

161
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,610
Glowing Meteorite.

162
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,000
That's the medicinal catalyst

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,730
to treat your friend's injury.

164
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,670

a strange meteorite

fell onto Mount Baojing,

167
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,010
about three li southeast.

168
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,290
It looks like crystal,

169
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,850
shimmering like a rainbow.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's called the Glowing Meteorite.

171
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,240
It's found only in that one place,

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,420
but the terrain there is treacherous

173
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,600
and there are strange phenomena.

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,630
Over these decades,

175
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,630
many have tried

176
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,230
to climb the mountain
and retrieve this stone.

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,070
In the end,

178
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,310
they either died on the towering peaks,

179
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,790
or

180
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,650
simply disappeared without a trace.

181
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,790
Nothing hard about that.

182
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,720
With our martial arts skills,

183
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,950
surely we can retrieve it.

184
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,280
I'll go get it tomorrow.

185
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I'll go with Shen.

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
Don't think that you can
climb the mountain

187
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,670
just because
you have great martial skills.

188
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,600
It's a hundred times more dangerous

189
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,770
than you can imagine.

190
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,900
How dangerous is it?

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,940
I don't really want to say.

192
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,270
Unless this old man

193
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,270
hands over Xue Fu.

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,480
Dream on!

195
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,200
What's the relationship

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,750
between you and this Xue Fu?

197
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,920
It's not some magical treasure, is it?

198
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,790
Mr. Tang,

199
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,710
come with me.

200
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,140
The rest of you stay here.

201
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,170
What has happened these days?

202
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,880
Has the Sword Alliance attacked?

203
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,710
Since you're here,

204
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
hiding away

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,570
is not the style of the Sword Alliance.

206
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,910
West Palace Chief,

207
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,980
you are truly perceptive.

208
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,780
You have an extraordinary bearing,

209
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
quite different from

210
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,250
those of the Sword Alliance.

211
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,310
May I ask your name?

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,720
Why have you appeared

213
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

214
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,780
I am Dieban Chonghua,

215
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,020
Fang Pingzhai.

216
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,870
I would like to ask you

217
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
for a small favor.

218
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,910
So, you're the renowned

219
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,570
Chief of Fallen Shisan Tower.

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
But

221
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,440
with your abilities,

222
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,540
what can I

223
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,030
possibly help you with?

224
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm looking for someone.

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,930
Unfortunately,

226
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,380
Peony Pavilion was empty.

227
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,140
I could only wait here
for someone to come.

228
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,670
But fortunately,

229
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,680
patience has paid off.

230
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,780
I chanced upon you, West Palace Chief.

231
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,110
Who are you looking for, Chief?

232
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,540
The Master of a Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

233
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,710
I have some business to discuss with him.

234
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,800
Unfortunately,

235
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,370
I

236
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,740
also wish to know Master's whereabouts.

237
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,600
Don't you see that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
is now deserted?

239
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
It seems that I

240
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,910
will have to capture

241
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,260
an important figure from Fengliu Shop

242
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
to attract

243
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
Master Liu's attention.

244
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,580
Do you know

245
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,820
Master Liu's whereabouts now?

246
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,260
Chief Fang,

247
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,200
does an assassin who betrays Shisan Tower

248
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,800
have any chance of survival?

249
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,760
Of course not.

250
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,080
Then why do you think

251
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,000
Fengliu Shop

252
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,250
would treat its people
better than Shisan Tower?

253
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,270
Such a charming young lady.

254
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,220
Would Master Liu bear to let you go?

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
You really know how to jest.

256
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,140
How about this?

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,750
Let me leave.

258
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,410
Tomorrow night,

259
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,910
I will introduce you

260
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,340
to Master.

261
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,860
Can I trust your words?

262
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,960
Shisan Tower
has always been a place of trade.

263
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
It's a business.

264
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
If you set

265
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,030
a price buyers can't afford,

266
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,750
and since this is a marketplace,

267
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,100
then trust comes first.

268
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,020
Respect for customers is second.

269
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,630
If you want to do business,

270
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,840
how can you offend the customer?

271
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,270
Your eloquence

272
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,310
truly impresses me.

273
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,510
Very well.

274
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,100
Please inform your Master

275
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,270
that I

276
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,270
await his presence.

277
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,310
You have questions for me?

278
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,670
No.

279
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,070
You want to ask

280
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,220
who I really am

281
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,950
and why I have

282
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,610
such a special constitution.

283
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,190
So,

284
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,790
you've seen others

285
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,520
with a constitution like mine?

286
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,080
I'm a divine doctor.

287
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,620
One touch and I knew

288
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,220
you're different from ordinary people.

289
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,880
I come from the Tianren Realm.

290
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,860
Tianren Realm?

291
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,340
What place is that?

292
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,820
Never heard of it.

293
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
The Tianren Realm

294
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,750
originated from Shenzhou.

295
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,580
In our clan,

296
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,920
everyone practiced cultivation

297
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,380
and achieved great merit.

298
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,030
The leader at that time
promised us

299
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,820
eternal life.

300
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,910
Using secret techniques,

301
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,370
he forcibly lifted
the entire Tianren Realm

302
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,740
from the ground.

303
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,280
He foolishly

304
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,100
sought to ascend to godhood.

305
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,450
But such an act against nature

306
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
caused the entire Tianren Realm

307
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,910
to disappear

308
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,390
into the shattered void.

309
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,340
Thousands of years later,

310
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,430
after experiencing
Tianren's five declines,

311
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,890
our lives hung by a thread.

312
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,310
The later Gumu Kingdom

313
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,460
was built on the ruins

314
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,660
of the Tianren Realm.

315
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,460
It seems

316
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,390
you truly have no interest

317
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,940
in the Tianren Realm.

318
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,210
You want to examine me,

319
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,770
but you won't ask about my symptoms?

320
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,990
Of course I know your symptoms.

321
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,109
What's with that heart crystal

322
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,280
inside your body?

323
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,690
In all my years of practice,

324
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,810
I've never seen anything so strange.

325
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,770
It's the heart crystal of Fang Zhou,

326
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,230
the Chief of Zhoudi Tower.

327
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,130
Fang Zhou, the Seven‑String True Tune?

328
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,500
Why are you carrying his heart?

329
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,560
This heart crystal

330
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,030
is the key to Fang Zhou's resurrection.

331
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,320
Impossible.

332
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,430
You want to bring the dead back to life?

333
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,360
It can't be done.

334
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,430
But I particularly enjoy

335
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,830
doing what can't be done,

336
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,230
even if it means risking my life.

337
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,740
You're keeping this heart crystal
inside you,

338
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,630
nourishing it with your vital essence,

339
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,630
keeping it alive.

340
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,040
This heart crystal

341
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,220
is now

342
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,590
your most serious injury.

343
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,300
Your hair

344
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,870
must have changed overnight

345
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,050
as your vital essence
was critically depleted.

346
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,830
If it weren't for that girl

347
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,740
outside,

348
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,670
you would be dead by now.

349
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,180
Relying on a medicine person's blood
to survive

350
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,090
will only make you need more and more.

351
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,000
In the end,

352
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,370
you'll need to drain her completely.

353
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,110
It's precisely because this injury
is troublesome

354
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,040
that I need a divine doctor's help.

355
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,300
How long have you carried
this heart crystal for?

356
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,360
Nearly four years.

357
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,450
Then I'll be frank.

358
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,590
This heart crystal has been

359
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,630
in your body too long.

360
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,260
It has already connected

361
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,660
to your heart meridians.

362
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,500
Medicine made from the Glowing Meteorite

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
can indeed heal your injury.

364
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,160
But afterward,

365
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,260
your condition will rapidly deteriorate.

366
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,540
It'll be like drinking poison
to quench thirst.

367
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,470
Between you two,

368
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,090
only one can survive.

369
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,590
Think carefully.

370
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,930
If you want to live,

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,220
you must remove this heart crystal soon.

372
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,910
Even for a divine doctor

373
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,950
like yourself,

374
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,040
is there truly no other way?

375
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,300
In this world,

376
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,200
some impossible things

377
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,610
are truly impossible.

378
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,950
Think it through.

379
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
I understand.

380
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,630
Please allow me

381
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,710
to think about this carefully.

382
00:20:50,990 --> 00:21:00,780
♪ As spring wanes
in the eastern district of Pujun ♪

383
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,870
♪ The doors are shut tight ♪

384
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,330
♪ In the silent temple ♪

385
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,780
Leader.

386
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,500
Master.

387
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,310
You disappeared
after the fight with Puzhu.

388
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,170
Where have you been all this time?

389
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,350
I was wounded

390
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,870
and trapped in a cave

391
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,980
below a cliff.

392
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,910
I only returned after recovering.

393
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,910
What about Puzhu?

394
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,020
Is he dead?

395
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,710
We were both badly injured.

396
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,910
He managed to escape.

397
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,910
You are

398
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,590
lying to me.

399
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,600
Why would I have any reason

400
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,680
to deceive you, Master?

401
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,370
When I was returning just now,

402
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,590
I met Fang Pingzhai,

403
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,740
the Chief of Shisan Tower,
in the Peony Pavilion.

404
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,780
He wants to see you

405
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,020
and asked me

406
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
to relay the message.

407
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,510
He gave the map of Peony Pavilion

408
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,660
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

409
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,720
He should be avoiding me at all costs,

410
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,430
yet he wants to see me?

411
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,540
Xiaohong.

412
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,070
In the blink of an eye,

413
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,190
you killed them and devoured the bones.

414
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,990
As expected from Fengliu Shop's

415
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,350
Master Liu,

416
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,150
expert in medicine,
curse bugs, and martial arts.

417
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,110
Chief Fang,

418
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,950
do not test

419
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,190
my patience.

420
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,220
I, Fang Pingzhai...

421
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,910
Master,

422
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,300
since you've come to our meeting,

423
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,830
why are you leaving so soon?

424
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,590
Shisan Tower didn't show up
for the battle at Peony Pavilion,

425
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,590
which means you

426
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,200
have no sincere intention
to work together.

427
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,330
As for these people,

428
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,640
they are the price for you taking the map

429
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,870
as that person instructed.

430
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,950
Whether Shisan Tower

431
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,190
has an undeserved reputation,

432
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,020
or you deliberately disrespect me,

433
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
not killing you

434
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,780
is already my mercy.

435
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,670
Do these people represent

436
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,330
the strength of Shisan Tower?

437
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
I believe you have

438
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,670
misunderstood.

439
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,500
Before they attacked,

440
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,210
didn't they know they were attacking

441
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,390
the world-renowned

442
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,980
Master of Fengliu Shop?

443
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,540
How could they dare to imagine

444
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,670
they would succeed?

445
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,830
I came today

446
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,910
to make another deal with you.

447
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,280
The techniques of the Rebirth Scroll.

448
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,430
You can't afford the price

449
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,780
for what you want.

450
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,790
Is that so?

451
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,660
If you find out

452
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Tang Lici said the same thing,

453
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,490
would you be pleased or furious?

454
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,910
You have three final sentences.

455
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,670
So few?

456
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,150
Let me think.

457
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,150
I know Tang Lici

458
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,410
left the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

459
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,490
That's one.

460
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
I also know

461
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,220
where he went.

462
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,870
And finally...

463
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,700
Now is your best

464
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,190
chance

465
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,370
to kill him.

466
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,910
Senior,

467
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,630
I used to

468
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,960
look up to you as my idol.

469
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,040
I can't believe you're like this.

470
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,460
What am I like?

471
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,150
Sneaking around

472
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,220
and taking someone else's treasure.

473
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,870
I took...

474
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,830
Yes, yes.

475
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,150
You're making me worry all day,

476
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,980
being afraid you'd lose Xue Fu.

477
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,830
Better to return her
to her rightful owner,

478
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,830
so Xue Fu can have someone to rely on.

479
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,630
You...

480
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,150
Yes, Senior Xue Xianzi,

481
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,950
how could you do this?

482
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,780
I...

483
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,540
Fine.

484
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,490
Shui Duopo,

485
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,390
I guess

486
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,120
you've got something on me now.

487
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,120
Then promise me

488
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,060
you'll take good care
of the white-haired fox

489
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,590
and I'll bring Xue Fu to you.

490
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,110
Okay.

491
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,110
Bring

492
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,320
little Xue Fu back now.

493
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,420
I miss her so much.

494
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,910
Fang Zhou,

495
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,910
Liu Yan was right.

496
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,200
I've actually lied to you.

497
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,330
You still haven't told us

498
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,430
what your name is.

499
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,740
Tang.

500
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,430
Tang?

501
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,520
And your given name?

502
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,920
Perhaps you've forgotten?

503
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,300
Who your parents are,

504
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,100
and why you know martial arts...

505
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,540
Have you forgotten everything?

506
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Their sacrifice

507
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,040
made you perfect.

508
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,150
Killing

509
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,910
is your nature.

510
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,150
Is this

511
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,950
what you call kindness?

512
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,430
May I?

513
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,690
Shen, welcome.

514
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,460
What were you thinking about just now?

515
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,700
I was thinking about how to

516
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
solve the mystery of Mount Baojing.

517
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,590
You're scared, aren't you?

518
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,670
Sometimes,

519
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,500
your perceptiveness

520
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,190
is what frightens me.

521
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,700
Shen,

522
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,910
have you ever thought about death?

523
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,410
I think about it often.

524
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm still alive now

525
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,760
because I don't want to meet Huiniang
empty-handed.

526
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,180
But I've always believed

527
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,540
that people should do everything possible

528
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,390
to stay alive.

529
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,740
When you're alive,

530
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,540
there are many things you can do.

531
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,390
But if you die,

532
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,960
there's nothing left.

533
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,520
There are many reasons to risk one's life.

534
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,430
For Puzhu,

535
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,710
Master Cheng,

536
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,800
and Master Shao,

537
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,720
it's because of responsibility and belief.

538
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,870
Chi Yun and I

539
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,360
do it for love and righteousness.

540
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,210
But you're different.

541
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,040
You're quite talkative today, Shen.

542
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,510
It's because
you're saying too little today.

543
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,360
You've changed.

544
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,150
How so?

545
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,660
You're no longer afraid of Shei.

546
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,470
You use the word "afraid"...

547
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,700
You're not afraid of anyone

548
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
because you're powerful

549
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,150
and no one is worthy of your fear.

550
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,150
But no matter
what powerful enemy you face,

551
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,880
you've never been as guarded
as you are with Shei.

552
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,730
That's because

553
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,950
I once thought she was Liu Yan's

554
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,010
undercover agent.

555
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,240
Tang Lici, you know,

556
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,830
you've never explained

557
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,030
your inner feelings.

558
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,890
When you start explaining yourself,

559
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,420
you've already lost.

560
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,780
And what you lack

561
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,240
is someone like her.

562
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,430
At least she can express

563
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,890
her true feelings for you.

564
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,610
She lives more authentically than you do.

565
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,190
You see,

566
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
this is how she is.

567
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,840
She always tries to please others

568
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,920
and can't bear to see others
hungry or tired,

569
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,280
injured or suffering.

570
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,030
Her greatest ability

571
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,570
is that she can sense

572
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,770
other people's pain.

573
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,350
And she can find ways

574
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,410
to comfort others.

575
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,910
But living like that is exhausting

576
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,010
and is without a sense of self.

577
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,460
Don't presume to define

578
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,120
someone else's sense of self.

579
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,740
At least she finds happiness

580
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,320
in helping others.

581
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,580
She lives more happily than you.

582
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,430
She lives more happily than me.

583
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,830
This is self-sacrifice.

584
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
She's willing to.

585
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,020
But I'm not.

586
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,260
No one asked you.

587
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,270
Don't forget our agreement.

588
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,040
Liu Yan is still alive.

589
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,830
At least until he dies...

590
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,670
Rest assured, Shen.

591
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,410
I will keep my word.

592
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,570
Stone!

593
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,520
Stone!

594
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,460
Mr. Tang,

595
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,390
have you seen Stone?

596
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,230
What's wrong?

597
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,560
I got up this morning

598
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,430
to check if he had

599
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,290
kicked off his blanket,

600
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,690
but he wasn't in his room.

601
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,330
I can't find him anywhere.

602
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,060
Stone is missing?

603
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,980
He might have gone to Mount Baojing

604
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,710
to find medicine for Foxy Tang.

605
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,300
Oh no!

606
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,450
I'll go find him.

607
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,440
I'll go too.

608
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,060
Wait.

609
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,910
The secret of Mount Baojing

610
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,240
hasn't been solved yet.

611
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,300
Chi Yun,

612
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,500
you stay here and keep watch.

613
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,150
Shen,

614
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,740
you search nearby.

615
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,700
I'll go to Mount Baojing.

616
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,540
Mr. Tang.

617
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,470
Don't worry.

618
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,190
I'll definitely bring Stone back.

619
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,190
Stone!

620
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,460
Stone!

621
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,060
Stone!

622
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,750
This is Mount Baojing.

623
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,150
It doesn't look unusual.

624
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,659
But the wind here

625
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,199
is a bit strange.

626
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,750
Stone!

627
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,060
Stone.

628
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,100
Yan?

629
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,060
I never thought

630
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,389
we'd meet again so soon.

631
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,909
Tang Lici,

632
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:02,260
you've shown your weakness.

633
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,620
You seem nervous.

634
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:05,980
What's wrong?

635
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,830
Are you wondering

636
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,350
why I came here?

637
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,889
Or are you thinking

638
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,010
how to deal with me?

639
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,260
[Mount Baojing]

640
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,590
Infuriating.

641
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,230
This mountain path
is truly difficult to climb.

642
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,710
Master came alone to Mount Baojing

643
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,710
to find Tang Lici,

644
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,380
but Tang Lici is cunning as a fox.

645
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,810
And he has Shen Langhun
and Chi Yun as guards.

646
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,230
I must quickly

647
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,460
reunite with Master.

648
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,020
Mr. Shen is so domineering.

649
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,750
I heard Mount Baojing
has extraordinary scenery.

650
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,460
I just came here for a stroll.

651
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,180
Sir,

652
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,960
you won't allow even this?

653
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,670
I'll kill you

654
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,310
to weaken Liu Yan.

655
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,480
Sound Killing.

656
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,710
Gods crushed, ghosts wailing!

657
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,960
I know you're looking for him.

658
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,710
Why else would I be

659
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,910
waiting for you here?

660
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,390
If you want this boy to live,

661
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,140
just tell me

662
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,730
where Fang Zhou's body really is.

663
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,100
Fang Zhou's body is extremely important.

664
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,020
Of course I used

665
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,040
a special formation

666
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,050
to hide it.

667
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,180
Go back to Zhoudi Tower first.

668
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,310
I'll prove it to you.

669
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,050
You must come back with me now.

670
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Not now.

671
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,140
Is his life

672
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,620
more important than Fang Zhou's?

673
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,270
Master!

674
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,690
Master?

675
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,270
Tang Lici,

676
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,840
you don't deserve to be anyone's master.

677
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,660
Stone!

678
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,020
Let go.

679
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,230
Come back with me.

680
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,290
You have no choice!

681
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,100
Enough!

682
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,040
Liu Yan,

683
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,650
the strong winds here are strange.

684
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,310
If we keep fighting like this,

685
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,230
we'll both fall into the abyss

686
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,310
and be obliterated.

687
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,270
Are you afraid of falling into the abyss

688
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,530
or being obliterated?

689
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm not afraid.

690
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:26,910
Hey—

691
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,430
Liu Yan,

692
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,350
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

693
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,060
Otherwise,

694
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,710
both of us

695
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,510
will die here.

696
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,360
Until I find Fang Zhou,

697
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,280
I'll go wherever you go.

698
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,950
You're truly hopeless.

699
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,610
Enough nonsense.

700
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,270
Let's get up first, then talk!

701
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,290
Don't think you can fool me again.

702
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,950
Hey—

703
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,830
Liu Yan!

704
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,540
So,

705
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,830
this is why people disappear
when coming to Mount Baojing

706
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,790
to find medicine.

707
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,140
You're awake?

708
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,540
Coming all this way
to find a divine doctor,

709
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,100
only to end up like this.

710
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,500
What?

711
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,350
Couldn't trick me out of

712
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,350
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

713
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,410
so you're anxious?

714
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:04,820
What a pity

715
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,020
you've run into me again.

716
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,620
Once you meet me,

717
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,180
you can't escape.
