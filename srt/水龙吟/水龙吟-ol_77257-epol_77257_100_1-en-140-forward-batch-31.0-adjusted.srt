00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,790
and carves wood every day,

178
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,840
and the other only steals chickens
and sleeps in.

179
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,960
You're grown men,

180
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,670
yet you spend your days lazing around.

181
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,080
And you have the nerve to make me,

182
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,140
a child, serve you?

183
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,750
Sirs, what are you doing?

184
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,080
We're looking for someone.

185
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,440
May I ask who

186
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,570
you're looking for?

187
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:01,930
Tell us!

188
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,360
Where is that

189
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,690
young man in the temple?

190
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,630
Don't waste time with him.

191
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,560
Go in and search!

192
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,650
Yang Shangqing,

193
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,270
how could you be so brutal

194
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,470
to an innocent child?

195
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,400
Are you the city lord of Yanxian

196
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
or a gang leader?

197
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,120
Young monk,

198
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
are you all right?

199
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,030
I'm fine.

200
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Who are these people?

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,790
Are they the ones

202
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,050
who beat you like this?

203
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,120
Go now.

204
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Be careful, Miss.

205
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,960
Ms. Zhong, don't forget,

206
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,510
this case involves many parties.

207
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,200
Jinye Temple dares to harbor a suspect.

208
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,750
Everyone there

209
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,080
could be an accomplice.

210
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,370
Go in and search!

211
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,030
Yes!

212
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,200
I finally got

213
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,510
a chance to sleep,

214
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,880
and now
there's a pack of wild dogs barking.

215
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,090
I'll count to three.

216
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Anyone still here after that

217
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
will face the consequences.

218
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
Who are you?

219
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,030
One.

220
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,480
Where is he?

221
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,870
How did he disappear?

222
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,130
Insolent rogue!

223
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Search the place!

224
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,510
-Yes!
-Yes!

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
The Moon-crossing Ring?

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
You are Cloud,

227
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,790
Chi Yun?

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Where did you take Miss Shei?

229
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Judging by his lightness skill,

230
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,090
he must be that guy's henchman!

231
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,910
Three.

232
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,750
My Lord!

233
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,440
My Lord!

234
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,610
Whether I'm a gangster or not

235
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,360
isn't for a coward like you

236
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,000
to decide.

237
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,360
Chi Yun,

238
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,960
give Miss Shei back to us now.

239
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
So you can take her back

240
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,450
and keep torturing her?

241
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,390
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will investigate this thoroughly.

242
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,000
We will not wrong the innocent
nor let the guilty go unpunished.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,360
Forcibly taking someone

244
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,150
is a crime too.

245
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,640
Which stupid Central Plains Sword Alliance

246
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
thinks it can boss me around?

247
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,110
His name is Feng.

248
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,500
He just got woken up.

249
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,510
Would you mind

250
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,770
calming him down?

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,960
You...

252
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,890
It really is you.

253
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,000
Miss,

254
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,500
have we met before?

255
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,190
You look exactly like him,

256
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,170
but your gaze is completely different.

257
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,100
Sound Killing Technique?

258
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,070
Now,

259
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,100
does anyone else want to go in?

260
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
The expert in the inner courtyard

261
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,580
is formidable.

262
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,840
We are no match for him.

263
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,260
But I must see him in person

264
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,720
to clear him of suspicion.

265
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,090
Please lead the way.

266
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,200
Miss Zhong,

267
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,830
you...

268
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,120
Heroine,

269
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,870
you've got guts.

270
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,270
I admire that.

271
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,070
This way, please.

272
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,650
The rest of you,

273
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,350
go back and wait for news.

274
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,960
Move.

275
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,210
What did you say?

276
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,280
Miss Zhong!

277
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,400
If you dare to harm Miss Zhong

278
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,660
even a hair on her head,

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Master Shao
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

280
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,590
will not let you off!

281
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,960
Just now, what...

282
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,030
what did he say?

283
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,960
Miss, put this on.

284
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,270
Don't catch a cold.

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Tang Lici.

286
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,720
Miss Shei!

287
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,440
I just asked you to help me

288
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
look after this lady.

289
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I didn't ask you to steal my thunder.

290
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,670
Who asked for your help?

291
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,930
Did you lose the fight?

292
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,440
I, the mighty Cloud, I...

293
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,240
If you didn't lose,
it didn't really count as help.

294
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
That makes sense.

295
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,960
Is he the murderer?

296
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,480
The murderer...

297
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,570
looked like him.

298
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,930
Looked like?

299
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,110
Their build and appearance

300
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,310
are exactly the same.

301
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,400
But...

302
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,400
I just witnessed

303
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,070
your Sound Killing Technique.

304
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,790
Could you

305
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,530
be from Zhoudi Tower in Jiangnan?

306
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,830
I am Zhong Chunji
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

307
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,400
I request your cooperation

308
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,330
in investigating
the Hao family massacre 3 days ago.

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,480
Chi Yun.

310
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,310
Get up.

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,440
Me?

312
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,750
Get up.

313
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
Sir,

314
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,150
between 7 and 11 that evening, 3 days ago,

315
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,640
where were you,

316
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,800
what were you doing,

317
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
and who can vouch for you?

318
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,110
You know

319
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,830
you're no match for me.

320
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,030
Why did you come in to see me?

321
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,640
If I die,

322
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,150
it will prove your connection
to the massacre.

323
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,200
Exchanging my life

324
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,310
for the truth

325
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,230
is worth it.

326
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,380
You're Shao Yanping's disciple?

327
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,240
Shao Yanping is indeed my master.

328
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,270
Just as I thought.

329
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,160
Otherwise, how could you speak of

330
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
exchanging your life for the truth?

331
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
You know

332
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,110
you're no match for me.

333
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,300
Why did you come in to see me?

334
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,960
I am investigating this case
under the Sword Alliance's orders.

335
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,640
If you continue to evade my questions

336
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,830
and just seek to humiliate me,

337
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,110
then do not blame me

338
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,920
for arresting you as a suspect.

339
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,640
You know you're no match for me.

340
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,830
Why did you...

341
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,930
come in to see me?

342
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:28,830
You...

343
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,640
Foxy Tang,

344
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,640
Did you drink so much tea

345
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,300
that you damaged your throat?

346
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,860
Why do you keep repeating
this one sentence?

347
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,240
I see.

348
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,310
Mr. Tang,

349
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
I will come back.

350
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,160
Miss Shei,

351
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,320
I'll take you back.

352
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,010
Miss Shei will be safer

353
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
if she stays here.

354
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,000
Then I must trouble you

355
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,000
to take good care of Miss Ashui.

356
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,550
Miss Zhong.

357
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,400
Thank you.

358
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,750
You're welcome.

359
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,280
Foxy Tang.

360
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,030
What riddles

361
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,080
were you two playing at?

362
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,830
Miss Shei,

363
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,720
do you understand

364
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,180
the questions I asked her?

365
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,350
So I'm the only one

366
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,780
who doesn't get it?

367
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,440
Since you don't get it,

368
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,280
why didn't you ask?

369
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,110
Isn't that what I'm doing?

370
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,440
Asking me won't get you an answer.

371
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,360
I'll go ask Shao Yanping's disciple.

372
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,050
Chi Yun.

373
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,310
If you see Miss Zhong,

374
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,240
ask her one more question for me.

375
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,100
What question?

376
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,810
What is the one thing

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,110
everyone did

378
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,950
at the wedding banquet

379
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,830
except the bride?

380
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,000
Fine.

381
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,350
If you're not the murderer,

382
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,680
then why

383
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,610
do the two of you

384
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,870
look exactly the same?

385
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,190
Naturally, it's because

386
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,890
we once knew each other.

387
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,680
You know

388
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,510
who he is?

389
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,040
An enemy of mine.

390
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,490
He disguised himself as me

391
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,160
to take revenge on me.

392
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,920
Mr. Chi?

393
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,300
Where are your henchmen?

394
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,120
I told them
to go to the Hao Residence first.

395
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,110
I want to investigate alone for now.

396
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,750
Mr. Chi, did you rush here

397
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,530
for something urgent?

398
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,960
What exactly

399
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,250
did Foxy Tang say to you?

400
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,510
Mr. Tang just

401
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,710
asked me 3 questions.

402
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,790
Weren't you there

403
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,830
listening?

404
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
I didn't understand.

405
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,880
The 1st question

406
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,680
Mr. Tang asked

407
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,530
was why I wanted to see him.

408
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,550
I came because the Sword Alliance

409
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,810
sent me to investigate

410
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,110
the Hao family massacre.

411
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,440
As for the 2nd question,

412
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,340
it looks the same,

413
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
but it actually

414
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,600
has a different meaning.

415
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,110
It means that if Mr. Tang
were truly the murderer,

416
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,880
we'd clearly be no match for him.

417
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,740
So why didn't he

418
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,530
kill me and Miss Shei?

419
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,110
And...

420
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,140
why didn't he run away?

421
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,790
I see.

422
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,150
What about the 3rd question?

423
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,180
As for the third question,

424
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,110
what Mr. Tang really wanted to ask

425
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,310
was actually...

426
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,270
Why...

427
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,750
do you...

428
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,650
suspect me?

429
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,750
He wanted me to consider

430
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,550
why Miss Shei identified him.

431
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,510
Remember what I look like.

432
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,570
And that reason is,

433
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,310
of course, that Miss Shei

434
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,240
saw the murderer

435
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,600
and could point out that

436
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,680
Mr. Tang looks the same as him.

437
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,000
Got it.

438
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,960
Why didn't he just say so?

439
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,440
There's one more question—

440
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,590
one that Foxy Tang

441
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,920
later told me to ask you.

442
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,830
What is something everyone did

443
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,960
at the wedding banquet

444
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
except the bride?

445
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,550
This case is shrouded in mystery.

446
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,160
Among those we know,
the only suspicious one

447
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
is Yang Shangqing.

448
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,720
Why do you

449
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,960
suspect him?

450
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,030
Because Miss Shei

451
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,190
was clearly the victim,

452
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,400
yet Yang Shangqing tortured her severely.

453
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
He was obviously in a rush
to close the case.

454
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,480
That makes him

455
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,340
highly likely to be the murderer.

456
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,000
I've long suspected

457
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,530
that Yang was the murderer.

458
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,100
But the coroner said

459
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,510
the victims died
from the Sound Killing Technique—

460
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,270
no

461
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
external wounds,

462
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,960
only bleeding from the ears.

463
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,640
Well,

464
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,830
Miss Shei

465
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,720
really did see

466
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,850
the black-clad pipa player

467
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,970
who looks like

468
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,750
Mr. Tang.

469
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,480
But we can't find a single trace

470
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,640
of this pipa player.

471
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,640
So now,

472
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
let's think about

473
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,730
the other question from Mr. Tang.

474
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,640
What is something

475
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,110
everyone did at the wedding banquet

476
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,350
except the bride?

477
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,720
Tender black-bone chicken!

478
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,110
Fine osmanthus wine!

479
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,920
Sir!

480
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,920
Sir!

481
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,070
We just got some

482
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,400
especially tender black-bone chickens.

483
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,540
When paired with osmanthus wine,

484
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,790
it tastes simply divine.

485
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,720
How about it?

486
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,380
Would you like to give it a try?

487
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,520
Then let's go...

488
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,030
-have some chicken first!
-That's drinking!

489
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,720
What everyone at the wedding banquet
would do

490
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,960
except the bride

491
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,620
is drinking the wedding wine.

492
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,250
Let's go.

493
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,420
Examine the bodies.

494
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,370
Check, please.

495
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,920
A good banquet must come with fine wine.

496
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,800
Who would have thought the fine wine

497
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,860
would be poisoned?

498
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,350
No signs of poisoning?

499
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,830
Could we have guessed wrong?

500
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,630
That's right.

501
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,310
If they were really poisoned,

502
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,510
the coroner wouldn't have missed it.

503
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,590
Since Foxy Tang asked such a question,

504
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,160
it must be on the right track.

505
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,640
You trust Tang Lici that much?

506
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,770
Who says I trust him?

507
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,030
It's just that

508
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,750
he always looks

509
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,960
so confident.

510
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,640
He must have thought it through
before speaking.

511
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,230
So the direction must be correct.

512
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,700
The cause of death really does resemble
the Sound Killing Technique.

513
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,560
When falsehood stands for truth,

514
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,790
truth likewise becomes false.

515
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,680
Could it be...

516
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,590
Chi Yun,

517
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,570
is there a poison

518
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,270
that can make one's ears bleed,

519
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,640
making it look like
the Sound Killing Technique,

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
but is hard to detect?

521
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,490
There's no such poison.

522
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,530
There is.

523
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Baibusha.

524
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,310
Baibusha?

525
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,140
You're not in the underworld,

526
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,790
so you don't know

527
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,920
these dirty tricks.

528
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,490
This poison is colorless, odorless,

529
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,960
and has no medicinal properties.

530
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,220
When dissolved in water,

531
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,280
even the best doctor can't detect it.

532
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,720
But if consumed

533
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
with osmanthus wine within an hour,

534
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
it becomes deadly.

535
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,670
The symptom is

536
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,040
bleeding from both ears.

537
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,510
How can we prove it?

538
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,160
The well.

539
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,480
Water is needed for cooking,
boiling tea, everything.

540
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,510
And before the banquet,

541
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,840
guests would drink tea.

542
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,240
So the well

543
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,170
must hold clues.

544
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll go to the wine cellar
to find the osmanthus wine.

545
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,340
You take people

546
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,750
to find the leftover wine
and food from the banquet.

547
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,830
If I'm right,

548
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,570
they won't detect poison
in them separately.

549
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,170
Let's meet at the well later.

550
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,110
Just as you said,

551
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
we didn't detect poison

552
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,010
in the food and wine.

553
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,920
Now, let's mix

554
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
the wine and water

555
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
to see if my guess is correct.

556
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,030
Sure enough, it's poisoned.

557
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,070
Everyone in Yanxian knows

558
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,720
Hao Wenhou loves osmanthus wine.

559
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,650
For his wedding,

560
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,750
he would certainly serve

561
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,200
osmanthus wine to his guests.

562
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,310
When the host toasts,

563
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,440
everyone must drink

564
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,590
except the bride.

565
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,070
It's about time.

566
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,030
The coroner only tests for poison

567
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,350
by inserting
a silver needle into the throat

568
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,740
to see if it changes color.

569
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,540
But Baibusha and osmanthus wine

570
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,590
passed through

571
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,880
the victims' throat separately.

572
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,610
They must have thought of this.

573
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,590
That's why the coroner

574
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,050
didn't detect any poison.

575
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,680
This proves

576
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,010
they didn't die from the Sound Killing...

577
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,000
Technique.

578
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,000
Foxy Tang,

579
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,030
you didn't expect me

580
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,550
to figure it out

581
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,680
so quickly, did you?

582
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,330
It's only because I've seen so much

583
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,330
that I could clear your name so fast.

584
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,550
And you...

585
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,550
Wait.

586
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,590
I think I've been set up.

587
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
What's wrong?

588
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,300
Foxy Tang worried
you wouldn't find the truth

589
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,240
since you know nothing about poisons,

590
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,110
so he said all those things

591
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,960
I couldn't understand

592
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,090
to spark my curiosity.

593
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,880
That's how he got me
to help you solve the mystery...

594
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,140
and uncover the truth.

595
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,470
This...

596
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,860
Damn that Foxy Tang!

597
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,530
He tricked me again!

598
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,830
Your Sound Killing move yesterday

599
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,060
was powerful.

600
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,010
Looks like your injuries
are no longer serious.

601
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,580
But if you want to stay alive,

602
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,840
it's best not to use your martial arts.

603
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,510
Forget it.

604
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,570
You've been recovering here for 6 months.

605
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,320
No one has come looking for you,

606
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,790
and you have never left the temple.

607
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,430
Yet worldly matters

608
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,000
still found their way to you.

609
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,130
Abbot, are you displeased with me

610
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
for the trouble I brought yesterday?

611
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
You didn't bring trouble.

612
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,940
Mr. Chi has been eating chicken secretly

613
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,530
in the temple—that's trouble.

614
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,190
What you brought was karma.

615
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,640
Abbot,

616
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,070
what exactly is karma?

617
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,780
The doer is the cause,

618
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,920
and the receiver is the effect.

619
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,990
If someone

620
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,890
kills because of me,

621
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,590
or if an innocent

622
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,300
suffers because of me,

623
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,730
is that my karma?

624
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,160
It depends on whether you know

625
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,070
and whether you tried to stop it.

626
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,370
If trying to stop it

627
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,510
causes more deaths,

628
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,440
does that still count as compassion?

629
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
The wind blows the tiles on the roof,

630
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,600
and a tile falls and hits my head.

631
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't blame the tile,

632
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,960
for it is not free.

633
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,000
Is it the wind's fault,

634
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,310
the tile's fault,

635
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,400
or mine

636
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,830
for standing beneath the roof?

637
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,250
It's your mistake, Master.

638
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,610
You made a mistake.

639
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,020
You lost 3.5 points in this round.

640
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,440
Amitabha.

641
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,520
How interesting.

642
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,160
Your question

643
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,610
is both false and true.

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,960
True and false, false and true—

645
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,270
perhaps you even deceived

646
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,350
yourself.

647
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,090
My surname is Fang,

648
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,590
my courtesy name is Pingzhai,

649
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,450
and my nickname

650
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
is Carefree.

651
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,750
I rarely do good deeds in my life.

652
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,030
Delivering a letter for someone

653
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,490
is actually a first for me.

654
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,200
I bought

655
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,110
a piece of news

656
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,370
in a mysterious tower,

657
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,920
yet forgot to tell them.

658
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,980
You'd better send someone discreet.

659
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,090
[To Tang Lici]

660
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,600
Oh, right.

661
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,070
The message has been delivered.

662
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,199
What a coincidence.

663
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Someone else also asked

664
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,670
the same tower

665
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,230
you entrusted

666
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,760
to deliver that thing here.

667
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,960
I just don't know
if it's a real coincidence...

668
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,190
or not.

669
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:15,540
A half jade flute?

670
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,159
Sir,

671
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,710
could this

672
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,429
be your karma?

673
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,430
Sir.

674
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,280
Sir?

675
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,610
Does it hurt?

676
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,240
How could someone like me

677
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,730
even know what pain feels like?

678
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,190
I'll go check on Miss Shei.

679
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,800
Chi Yun,

680
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,840
I still feel something's off.

681
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,440
What's off?

682
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,690
What's Mr. Yang's motive?

683
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,190
We don't need to guess.

684
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,190
It all comes down to profit.

685
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,670
If it's really

686
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,400
such a simple, shallow reason,

687
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,840
it proves

688
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,920
Mr. Yang

689
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,250
isn't a man of great wit.

690
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,530
Then how could he

691
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
think of using the Sound Killing Technique

692
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
to cover up his crime?

693
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,600
What do you mean?

694
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,260
Hao Wenhou and his guests died horribly,

695
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,880
and Miss Shei didn't clearly see

696
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
the black‑clad pipa player

697
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
who resembled Mr. Tang.

698
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,190
But we've proven

699
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,510
Hao Wenhou and the guests

700
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,570
died of poisoning.

701
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,800
So where did that black-clad pipa player
come from?

702
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,660
Four years ago,

703
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,750
Zhoudi Tower was wiped out overnight.

704
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,510
And the Sound Killing Technique
has long vanished from jianghu.

705
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,840
If Mr. Yang really could

706
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,710
find a successor

707
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,320
of the Sound Killing Technique

708
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,920
to cover up

709
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,360
his crime,

710
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,440
he wouldn't have chosen

711
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,320
such a despicable method

712
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,760
as poisoning in the first place.

713
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,480
And he did it so secretively,

714
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,890
as if he was hiding something.

715
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,440
Are you saying

716
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,050
someone wants to frame Foxy Tang?

717
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,250
What do you want?

718
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,650
Beat Yang Shangqing

719
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,630
for 3 days,

720
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,840
and he'll confess to

721
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,350
even stealing the dog lost
in the next city.

722
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:25,950
Just wait!

723
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Chi Yun!

724
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,670
You can't do that!

725
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,270
That's a forced confession.

726
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,590
Hurry!

727
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,880
Hurry up!

728
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,150
Be careful!

729
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,960
That's my family heirloom vase!

730
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,990
My vase!

731
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,000
My Lord?

732
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,430
What are you doing?

733
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,880
The silver's all on the ground.

734
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,280
Are you trying to run away

735
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,370
now that you can't hide it anymore?

736
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,380
Everyone, listen!

737
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,230
I'll give half my gold

738
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,260
to whoever kills this man!

739
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,880
Kill him!

740
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,800
Kill!

741
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,440
Kill him!

742
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,150
Hero,
your martial skills are truly impressive.

743
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,400
All this silver is yours.

744
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Servants!

745
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,230
Take it to this hero.

746
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,030
Tell me.

747
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,450
Why did you try to frame Foxy Tang?

748
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,080
Please come in, sir.

749
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,320
You just got out of prison

750
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,880
and are already in the mood

751
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
to play with these trinkets?

752
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,510
Today I saw Feng

753
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,050
and took a liking to him.

754
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,120
Besides,

755
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,190
after all the ups and downs
I've experienced recently,

756
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,480
I always want to find something to do

757
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,610
to distract my mind.

758
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,920
What I did was improper.

759
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,340
Mr. Tang, I hope you and your wife
won't take offense.

760
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,400
I don't have a wife.

761
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,790
I just picked him up on a whim.

762
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,670
How pitiful.

763
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,630
Luckily, he met you,

764
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,100
and you kindly took him in
and have been taking care of him.

765
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,260
It must be fate.

766
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,600
You're wrong.

767
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,760
I just did it on a whim

768
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
to see what it felt like

769
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,930
to adopt a child.

770
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,960
But didn't you

771
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,070
give him a name?

772
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,030
A name

773
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,840
creates a bond.

774
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,190
One of a kind in a millennium,

775
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,600
break with old words.

776
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,440
So I'll call you

777
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Tang Lici.

778
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,110
Now I see

779
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,840
that no matter what,

780
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,400
I am not him.

781
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,550
Man on earth...

782
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,760
Man on earth...

783
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,030
Good at birth.

784
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,030
Good at birth.

785
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,200
The same nature...

786
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,150
The same nature...

787
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,440
Miss,

788
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,650
you married into the Hao family

789
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,000
to get the money
to pay for your father's funeral.

790
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,960
Now that you've gone through
such a calamity,

791
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,410
if you feel uneasy,

792
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,360
you might seek the Abbot

793
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,100
for a talisman of peace.

794
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,840
It's quite effective.

795
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,070
I have no way to repay

796
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,000
Lord Hao's kindness.

797
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,400
Miss Shei,

798
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,580
you confuse me.

799
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,040
You're a part of the scheme,

800
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,310
yet you know nothing

801
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,590
about it.

802
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,320
I...

803
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,760
It seems

804
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,880
you're just a pawn

805
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,840
he used and discarded,

806
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,360
a catalyst to start his game.

807
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,920
But what did I do wrong

808
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,070
to become this discarded pawn?

809
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,400
If I'm a discarded pawn,

810
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,200
what role are you playing

811
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
in this game?

812
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,280
Chi Yun!

813
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,250
What are you doing?

814
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,360
Miss Zhong!

815
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,440
Miss Zhong, please save me!

816
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,890
He's trying to kill me!

817
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,980
Give me 30 minutes,

818
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,630
and he'll confess everything.

819
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,190
Chi Yun,

820
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,320
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

821
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,800
never forces confessions through torture.

822
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,130
Truth comes from careful investigation.

823
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,390
All the evidence is laid out on the floor.

824
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,320
Can't you see it?

825
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,480
He sent someone

826
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,110
to secretly follow us,

827
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,380
and when he was exposed,

828
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,070
he tried to run off with the money.

829
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,590
Run off with the money?

830
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm just...

831
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,710
Mr. Yang!

832
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,360
Moving!

833
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,590
Please explain

834
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,110
where all this money and these treasures
you're moving

835
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,880
came from.

836
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,150
I earned them!

837
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,710
I'm at least a city lord.

838
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,770
This is just my small savings.

839
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,510
Is that not allowed?

840
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,510
Stop pretending!

841
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,630
Fine!

842
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,590
I'll tell you!

843
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,480
I killed them.

844
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,510
I'm the one
who killed those over 100 people

845
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,710
in the Hao Residence.

846
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,010
I killed them all.

847
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,710
It was my doing.

848
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,070
Then why

849
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,730
did you try to frame Tang Lici?

850
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,590
You're still denying it
when death is near!

851
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,880
No.

852
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,950
I never intended to frame Tang Lici.

853
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,040
It wasn't me.

854
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,500
It was that person.

855
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,140
He forced me to do it.

856
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,930
It was him.

857
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,620
That black-clad pipa player!

858
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,100
What black-clad pipa player?

859
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,840
When?

860
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:07,710
Where?

861
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,260
He's not human.

862
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,280
He's a ghost.

863
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,140
That night,

864
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,290
when I left the Hao Residence,

865
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,440
I was full of regret and fear.

866
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,880
You poisoned everyone in the residence

867
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,340
and betrayed their trust.

868
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,230
Well done.

869
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,570
A miserable death
is the reward you deserve.

870
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,430
Don't kill me!

871
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,510
I'll give you

872
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,940
whatever you want!

873
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,350
Please don't kill me!

874
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,360
You poisoned

875
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,300
over 100 people in the Hao Residence.

876
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,410
They should have died in utter misery,

877
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,960
but I killed them
with the Sound Killing Technique,

878
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,000
letting them die

879
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,400
in beautiful illusions.

880
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,110
If you want to keep your position
as city lord,

881
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,670
take
the Central Plains Sword Alliance people

882
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,140
to the old temple outside the city

883
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,980
to find me.

884
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Remember my face.

885
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,910
This is your only chance to survive.

886
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,480
It was him.

887
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,770
It was Tang Lici.

888
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,080
It was Tang Lici!

889
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,710
You said

890
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,560
the murderer was your enemy.

891
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,270
But if what you said is true—

892
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,050
that he framed you like this—

893
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,150
why didn't you take revenge on him,

894
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,070
eye for an eye?

895
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,240
Or perhaps,

896
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,510
he's not your enemy,

897
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,880
but...

898
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,800
He is my enemy,

899
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,250
and was once my friend.

900
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,480
Forgive my boldness,

901
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,440
but what kind of friend

902
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,550
was he?

903
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,370
What kind of friend?

904
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
What's the rush?

905
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,750
We haven't seen each other for so long.

906
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,190
I hope you haven't forgotten

907
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,190
all those memories we shared.
