[Episode 11]

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,950
I admire your ambition.

4
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,630
That is why tomorrow,

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,050
you will kill for me.

6
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,039
Master,

7
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,160
who do you want me to kill?

8
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,970
Everyone.

9
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,100
Wuhu Fortress.

10
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,310
Renwu Sect.

11
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Golden Leopard Gang?

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,160
Miss Shei,

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,790
why don't you take a rest first?

14
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,510
You may go now.

15
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,960
Let's go.

16
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,500
Oh no!

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,500
The ledger!

18
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
Miss Shei, be careful!

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,150
Sister!

20
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,410
Be careful!

21
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,330
Pull her back!

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,200
Watch out!

23
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,590
Fire! Help!

24
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,290
Who are you?

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
Bafeng Flame Scripture?

26
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,700
Don't run!

27
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,360
Want to leave?

28
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,720
Did you ask me first?

29
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,310
Miss Shei!

30
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,630
Step back.Grab your sister!

31
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,400
Be careful, Sister!

32
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,829
Help!

33
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,630
Fire!

34
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,630
Help!

35
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,630
Mr. Sen!

36
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,560
Sen!

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,530
Hurry up!

38
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,680
Fire!

39
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,540
There's a fire!

40
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,270
Hurry!

41
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,070
Help!

42
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,600
Over there!

43
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,670
Hurry!

44
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,430
You demon from Fengliu Shop,

45
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,310
put Shei down!

46
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,180
As expected of Cloud.

47
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,430
It's a pity that...

48
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,070
Bai Suche?

49
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,550
Stop chasing!

50
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,480
Unless you can get past me first.

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,930
You're not Yu Qifeng's concubine.

52
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,580
You're from Fengliu Shop!

53
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,920
So what?

54
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,270
How could you do this?

55
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,720
Was the Bai family's massacre a year ago

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
orchestrated

57
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,600
by Fengliu Shop?

58
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you alright?

59
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,780
I...

60
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,470
You knew I was your enemy,

61
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,840
yet you still held back.

62
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,750
The fact that you're still alive

63
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,870
is pure luck.

64
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,790
As long as you step aside,

65
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,680
I'll pretend

66
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
this never happened.

67
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,430
Besides,

68
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
I just don't want to lose my wife

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,560
at such a young age.

70
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,820
Who said I'm your wife?

71
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,510
Mr. Chi,

72
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,600
look carefully.

73
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,950
Bai Suche,
the "Moonlight Garment" back then,

74
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,800
is already dead.

75
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,750
The person standing before you

76
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,550
is just the Master's attendant.

77
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,750
For the sake of the time

78
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,880
you saved my father,

79
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
this is my final warning to you.

80
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
If you dare stand in Fengliu Shop's way,

81
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll make sure

82
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,409
you die without a burial place.

83
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,240
You know better than I do

84
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,700
what kind of man Liu Yan is.

85
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,830
Did you join Fengliu Shop

86
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,830
to seek revenge?

87
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,870
Who are you

88
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,040
to speak the Master's name?

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,550
In the battle of Sword King City,

90
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,260
Tang Lici is doomed to die.

91
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,760
What did you say?

92
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,250
If you want to live,

93
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,310
get lost now.

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,700
Otherwise, you'll be the next

95
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,680
to die.

96
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,000
Bai Suche!

97
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,190
Why did you leave before finishing

98
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,390
what you were saying?

99
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,550
What scheme is Liu Yan plotting?

100
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,950
Tell me, Bai Suche!

101
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,510
Bai Suche!

102
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,830
Bai Suche!

103
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
No wonder I searched for her for so long

104
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
with no trace.

105
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,120
So she's been hiding
in Fengliu Shop all along.

106
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,150
Foxy Tang, you're so clever.

107
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,150
Help me analyzeâ€”

108
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,480
why did she join

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Fengliu Shop?

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
And there's Shei.

111
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,750
What exactly are those demons

112
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,350
in Fengliu Shop up to anyway?

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,320
How was it?

114
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,320
Did you find her?

115
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,580
There's only one place

116
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,250
where Shei could be hidden.

117
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,750
After fighting with Chi Yun, Bai Suche

118
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,880
never returned to Sword King Mansion.

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,700
It seems, just as she said,

120
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,050
Yu Qifeng is planning something big.

121
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
You go over there.

122
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,600
Okay.

123
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,390
There's no one in the guest quarters.

124
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,390
Could it be that those sect leaders,

125
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,840
knowing they were exposed yesterday,

126
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,370
fled with their disciples?

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,750
How are we going to investigate then?

128
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,150
Perhaps that's the case.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,510
Wait.

130
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,870
Yu Qifeng wouldn't

131
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,730
let them leave at a time like this.

132
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,120
Could they have been...

133
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Zhong, don't panic.

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,720
Perhaps
there's still someone in this house.

135
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,850
Let's keep looking.

136
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,310
Now Shei was taken away,

137
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,040
the ledger was burned,

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
and Bai Suche said

139
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
you would die in Sword King City.

140
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,540
Fengliu Shop
must be planning something big.

141
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,150
Foxy Tang,

142
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,350
what should we do now?

143
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,860
Say something.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,780
You want to go rescue Shei?

145
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,720
No matter what he's planning,

146
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,520
both of us have been waiting

147
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,940
for this moment

148
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,200
since Jinye Temple.

149
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,000
Going alone

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
is too dangerous.

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's go together.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,660
I'll go too.

153
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,810
I'm also responsible for this.

154
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,790
No need.

155
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,310
This is between him and me.

156
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,370
I don't want anyone to interfere.

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,870
You two

158
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,380
have something else to attend to.

159
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,930
What do we need to do?

160
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,990
Last night at the Qiongtai Banquet,

161
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,150
Liu Yan took advantage of me
being off guard

162
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,680
to attack Wanqiao Chamber.

163
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,790
He let Shen go

164
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,550
just to

165
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,950
reveal his hiding place.

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,680
Yu Qifeng is now in a dead end.

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,580
He hates me to the bone.

168
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,310
To defeat me,

169
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,270
he will certainly use any means necessary.

170
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,360
And Liu Yan

171
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,030
will definitely do something for him.

172
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,160
I'll leave Yu Qifeng

173
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,260
to you two.

174
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,490
Leave him to me.

175
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,000
I absolutely won't

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,590
let that old bastard Yu Qifeng

177
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,650
cause any trouble.

178
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,350
This is the last room.

179
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,610
Where is everyone?

180
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,790
Oh no.

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,830
Yu Qifeng will definitely
kill them to silence them.

182
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,890
Let's follow them.

183
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,790
Stop!

184
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:01,960
Zhong,

185
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,740
watch out!

186
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,120
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,580
are you alright?

188
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,170
Commander Yu,

189
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,050
don't put on a fake act.

190
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,360
You just intervened

191
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,670
to help them escape, didn't you?

192
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,400
How dare you!

193
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,940
Who were those people just now?

194
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,630
Everyone,

195
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,750
we discovered that

196
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,720
the disciples from various sects
in the west wing

197
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,670
were all taken away,

198
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,930
so we chased them here.

199
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,550
Suddenly losing track of them

200
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,120
naturally put us in a bad mood.

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,980
Please forgive us, Commander Yu.

202
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,740
Ms. Zhong,

203
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,000
from what you just said,

204
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,670
do you think those villains are connected

205
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,860
to Sword King City?

206
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,650
Whether they are or not,

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,080
we'll know soon.

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,870
Mr. Yu,

209
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,030
those villains couldn't have gone far.

210
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,320
Let's investigate ahead together.

211
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,720
We might find something.

212
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Very well.

213
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
The city's security

214
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,250
is also my responsibility.

215
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,450
Sword King,

216
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,550
the Blood Ghost Pill

217
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,120
has been discovered by Tang Lici.

218
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,580
And Puzhu probably has...

219
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,870
Sword King City

220
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,390
might not be safe for us anymore.

221
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,960
Yes.

222
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,920
This is the Master's reward

223
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,420
for everyoneâ€”

224
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,240
the newly made divine pills,

225
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,640
even better than before.

226
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,120
Today,

227
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,800
let's have the divine pills together.

228
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,170
Here.

229
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,240
Here.

230
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,150
Here.

231
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,060
Is this the power of the divine pill?

232
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,080
My strength

233
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,540
keeps flowing endlessly.

234
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,550
My strength keeps flowing endlessly too.

235
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,150
Mine too.

236
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,080
Sword King,

237
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
the Blood Ghost Pill

238
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
has already been intercepted by Tang Lici.

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,050
Puzhu will eventually report this

240
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,720
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

241
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
So what?

242
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,240
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

243
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,300
has long been wary of Sword King City.

244
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,790
I've had enough

245
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,520
of those incompetent cowards.

246
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,960
And Fengliu Shop is now
at the height of its power.

247
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,480
If we

248
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
can eliminate Tang Lici,

249
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,750
we'll be doing Fengliu Shop a great favor.

250
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,440
One day when power shifts in jianghu

251
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,960
and Fengliu Shop
replaces the Sword Alliance,

252
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,550
I won't be

253
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,480
the only Sword King.

254
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,150
You,

255
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,880
you'll be Sword King Shi.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
You'll be Sword King Li.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
Each one of you

258
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,210
will be a Sword King!

259
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,410
-Sword King Zhao!
Sword King!

260
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,370
Sword King Zhou.

261
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,810
Sword King, since you said so,

262
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm willing to give my life

263
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
to serve you!

264
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,480
We are willing to serve you!

265
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,390
We're willing

266
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,630
to die for you

267
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,960
without hesitation!

268
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,320
What's going on?

269
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,200
Let's go take a closer look.

270
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,030
Sword King,

271
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,150
what are you doing?

272
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm not breaking my promise to you.

273
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,610
I'm letting you all become a part of me.

274
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
After today,

275
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,940
you'll all be Sword Kings!

276
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
It serves you right.

277
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,840
More!

278
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,440
More!

279
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,240
More! More!

280
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,840
Not enough!

281
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,790
Not enough!

282
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,589
Pale,

283
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
fragile,

284
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,550
and such beautiful legs.

285
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,680
With a slight twist, they'd snap.

286
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,430
Aren't you scared?

287
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,589
Of course I am.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,650
Then why aren't you screaming,

289
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,720
hoping Mr. Tang will come save you?

290
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Help!

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,240
Help!

292
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,880
Save me!

293
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Shouldn't that be what you do?

294
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,560
Mr. Tang

295
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,060
won't come.

296
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,070
He won't?

297
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,350
Mr. Tang cares deeply for you,

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,860
with such passionate affection.

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,070
How would he not come?

300
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,790
He...

301
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,400
won't come for me.

302
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,550
Even if he comes,

303
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,230
it'll be for Liu Yan,

304
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,270
not to save me.

305
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,310
Well,

306
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,210
does that mean I can kill you

307
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,970
right now?

308
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,950
Master said

309
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,110
someone like Tang Lici

310
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,110
would never

311
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,550
keep unimportant people

312
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,750
by his side every day.

313
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,880
I guess...

314
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,590
he must be deeply in love with you.

315
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,260
You just don't dare to believe it.

316
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,200
Whether you believe it or not,

317
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,720
to Mr. Tang.

318
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,000
I am insignificant.

319
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,670
Whether you're important or not,

320
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,200
we'll see.

321
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,810
I like your legs.

322
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,480
Why don't you...

323
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,600
give them to me?

324
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,750
Shei.

325
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,430
Shei!

326
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,790
Miss, you are so beautifulâ€”

327
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
why do you need someone else's legs?

328
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Mr. Tang, you care for this beauty

329
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,400
and are so devoted

330
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,750
that you came to save her.

331
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
You should be glad

332
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,680
you didn't truly act just now.

333
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,750
So you do care about that lady.

334
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,880
Do I?

335
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
You're wrong.

336
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,720
She means...

337
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
nothing to me.

338
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,010
You say one thing but mean another.

339
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,270
Then listen

340
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
to the piece

341
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
I prepared especially for you.

342
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,490
The Six Paths of Descent...

343
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,530
and Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance!

344
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,310
Combined

345
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,040
with my Mist Flower Pollen,

346
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,920
this move will trap a person

347
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,580
in their deepest inner demon.

348
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,690
If one stays in it for too long,

349
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,140
they will sink into the depths
of their obsession

350
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,830
and never be able to wake up.

351
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,200
Tang Lici,

352
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,110
what is your inner demon?

353
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,710
What is the sin you're hiding?

354
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,310
What is your sin?

355
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,490
The great cause remains unfinished.

356
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,210
How dare you sleep?

357
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,480
Tang Lici,

358
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
you were born

359
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,400
to kill.

360
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,290
This is your purpose.

361
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,770
Why did you kill us?

362
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Why?

363
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,110
Why?

364
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Their sacrifice

365
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,830
was to make you perfect.

366
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,790
And your perfection

367
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,590
is meant to allow more people

368
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,920
to survive.

369
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,790
This is your destiny.

370
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,590
You all defied destiny.

371
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,590
You're nothing but a monster!

372
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
Who are you to abandon us?

373
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,920
No! I don't want this!

374
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,110
If I really am him,

375
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,880
will they fear me?

376
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,890
I can't drag them down with me.

377
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,410
Come take a look!

378
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Oiled paper umbrellas! Take a look!

379
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,360
Oiled paper umbrellas!

380
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,880
Lici!

381
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,960
Lici, stop.

382
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,280
Seven years have passed,

383
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,040
and you still want to leave?

384
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,810
I don't belong here.

385
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm different from you guys.

386
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,680
Enough.

387
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,170
Don't be trapped by your past.

388
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,160
A place you have forgotten
is not your home.

389
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,490
We all see you as family.

390
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,160
Come back to Zhoudi Tower with me

391
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,820
and continue your life there.

392
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,070
Jile Sect?

393
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,790
They are Yique Yinyang's subordinates,

394
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,990
a group that knows nothing but killing.

395
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,510
See?

396
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,680
Everyone fears people

397
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,880
-who know nothing but killing.
-Lici!

398
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,740
Hide behind me!

399
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,890
Take a good look.

400
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,350
How are you any different from them?

401
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,480
If they ever find out

402
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,610
you're the same kind of person as them,

403
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
they will surely fear you,

404
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,070
stay away from you,

405
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,200
and even...

406
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,200
kill you.

407
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,070
Fang Zhou,

408
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,790
the wound Chief left on your heart crystal

409
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,310
is acting up, isn't it?

410
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,130
No one will come to save you.

411
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
If my death

412
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,440
can save everyone,

413
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,790
then why not?

414
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,920
One life...

415
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,790
for all lives?

416
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,130
I did lie to you,

417
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,200
but if your sacrifice

418
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
can make everyone survive,

419
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,210
isn't that a good thing?

420
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
But I don't want to die!

421
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,400
If it weren't to save everyone,

422
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,800
you wouldn't have been born
in the first place.

423
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,400
Lici,

424
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,340
go now!

425
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,370
Go!

426
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
I need to save him.

427
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
The golden eyes and forehead mark?

428
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,750
The Chief is back!

429
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,680
-Chief.
-Chief.

430
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,400
This is...

431
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,920
your true power.

432
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,590
This is...

433
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,350
your true nature.

434
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,030
Lici.

435
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,920
You...

436
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,160
Mr. Tang?

437
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,510
Mr. Tang?

438
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,440
He's trapped in his inner demon.

439
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,150
You can't wake him up.

440
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,030
Dying in his inner demons

441
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,570
is better than losing everything
bit by bit.

442
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,030
Chi Yun,

443
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,880
Shen Langhun,

444
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,720
Zhong Chunji,

445
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,480
Gu Xitan,

446
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
and Miss Shei

447
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,680
in your armsâ€”

448
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,550
all your friends

449
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,050
will soon die with you.

450
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,180
My...

451
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,030
final mercy to you...

452
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,480
is...

453
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,070
No.

454
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I need to save him.

455
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,960
Lici,

456
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,640
who are you?

457
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,350
He found your identity.

458
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,210
He found your identity.

459
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,030
No! I don't want to!

460
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,720
No! I don't want to!

461
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,340
you saw me get injured

462
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,960
and you saw it heal
right before your eyes.

463
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
I just think

464
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,350
everyone

465
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,510
might have secrets

466
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,160
they don't want others to know.

467
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
I only know

468
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,360
that even if wounds heal,

469
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,890
they still hurt.

470
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,120
Mr. Tang,

471
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,400
wake up.

472
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
The Sevenâ€‘String True Tune.

473
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,900
The Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

474
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,690
Trying to control me with my inner demon?

475
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,680
When did Liu Yan become so naive?

476
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,960
Didn't he tell you

477
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,200
that in his eyes, Tang Lici

478
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,690
is a ruthless, heartless demon

479
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,960
with no feelings?

480
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,510
How can a demon have inner demons?

481
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,960
Mr. Tang,

482
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,440
are you alright?

483
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,070
I'm fine.

484
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,639
Let me take you back.

485
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,010
No need.

486
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,630
But you're injured.

487
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,030
Shei, listen to me.

488
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,020
Chi Yun still needs me there.

489
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,840
Go back to Wanqiao Chamber
and wait for my news.

490
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
What is that

491
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,760
black crystal?

492
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,320
Yu Qifeng

493
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,780
is absorbing their power.

494
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,160
We need to stop him now.

495
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,400
Are you okay?

496
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,800
I won't die.

497
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,360
Black Tuli?

498
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,480
I saw it once in Dieban Chonghua's

499
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
collection room.

500
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,070
Legend has it that Yique Yinyang

501
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,800
was unbeatable

502
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,060
because of that thing.

503
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
Unorthodox.

504
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
I don't buy that crap.

505
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,060
Let's fight him first!

506
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,060
You know quite a lot.

507
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,630
Come on!

508
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,360
Impervious to weapons?

509
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,000
Shen,

510
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,590
why don't we use spells like Foxy Tang?

511
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,320
You know how?

512
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,610
I heard him use one once.

513
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What was it again?

514
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,440
How did his power

515
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
become so strong?

516
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,880
Let's kill him quickly!

517
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,810
Let's go all out!

518
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,360
You two have been fighting me

519
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,230
for so long,

520
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,270
yet your master hasn't shown up.

521
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,070
The Number one assassin?

522
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,580
The overlord of the underworld?

523
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,540
You're just his dogs.

524
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,590
I don't have time to waste on you anymore.

525
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,320
Go to hell

526
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,880
and meet Tang Lici!

527
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,000
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

528
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,850
Invincible!

529
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,670
Snake Fang!

530
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,700
Soul Breaker!

531
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,210
How dare a firefly
compete with the bright moon?

532
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,840
My nickname is Cloud.

533
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
You're the firefly!

534
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
You're asking for death!

535
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,760
Tang Lici?

536
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,070
Yu Qifeng,

537
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,960
were you waiting for me?

538
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,150
Tang Lici,

539
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,790
I will repay the humiliation
you've caused me

540
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,500
a hundredfold.

541
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,240
Master.

542
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,310
Tang Lici is fighting the Sword King.

543
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,710
We need to set off some fireworks

544
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,920
to liven things up.

545
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,910
The Tianyan Sword Wall?

546
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,090
Isn't Liu Yan here?

547
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,650
The Tianyan Sword Wall is collapsing?

548
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,990
Tang Lici!

549
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,880
This is Liu Yan's doing.

550
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,090
The mountain wall collapsing

551
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,000
will surely kill

552
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
many people at the foot of the mountain.

553
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,840
Shen,

554
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,840
go to Wanqiao Chamber and find Shei.

555
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,110
She knows who to seek.

556
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,110
Chi Yun.

557
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,220
I'll stay here!

558
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,000
Yu has absorbed a lot of people's power.

559
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,900
He's not easy to deal with.

560
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,340
No.

561
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,320
Go meet Zhong Chunji

562
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,360
and Gu Xitan

563
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,640
to evacuate the civilians.

564
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,290
This is my wager with Puzhu.

565
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,860
Help me hold it.

566
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,920
Okay.

567
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,210
Be careful.

568
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,150
It's just us now.

569
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,400
Tang Lici,

570
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,590
to defeat you,

571
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,030
Master

572
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,320
gave me a gift!

573
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,110
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual!

574
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,670
Puzhu forbade me to kill you.

575
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,550
If he knew

576
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,190
you've killed so many people,

577
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,550
he might regret

578
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,550
having shown you mercy.

579
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,020
What is that?

580
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,550
Chi Yun!

581
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,070
Chi!

582
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,480
What happened to the Tianyan Sword Wall?

583
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Where is Mr. Tang?

584
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,920
He's up there dueling with Yu Qifeng.

585
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,880
They caused the mountain to collapse!

586
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,810
Save the people!

587
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,660
Be careful!

588
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,670
Master?

589
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,320
Everyone, listen!

590
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,780
Follow me up the mountain!

591
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:08,690
Commander Yu!

592
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,360
If you leave,

593
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,620
what about the people of Sword King City?

594
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,110
Hurry!

595
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,190
Quickly!

596
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,480
It's dangerous here!

597
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,730
Disciples of Sword King City!

598
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,030
Follow me to evacuate the civilians!

599
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,550
Yes!

600
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,410
Such an explosion...

601
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,150
If it's really Mr. Tang...

602
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,760
Foxy Tang,

603
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,150
please be safe.
