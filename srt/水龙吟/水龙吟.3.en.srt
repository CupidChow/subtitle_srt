3
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,759
Cheng is already gone.

4
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,340
Why are you still lingering here?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,400
You're free now.

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,120
Go wherever

7
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,509
you want to go.

8
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,710
Off you go.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,570
Go!

10
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,060
Father,

11
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,290
this Yan Whistle is so hard to pick up.

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Then I'll give you this wooden whistle.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,220
Before you learn
how to use the Yan Whistle,

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,139
just try this wooden one instead, alright?

15
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,200
Thank you, Father.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,450
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,860
Get lost!

18
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,710
I've just lost my son.

19
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,440
I only want some time by myself.

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,520
I've been sickly since childhood.

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,760
When I was busking with my father
to make a living,

22
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,750
I once saw two wild geese that got lost.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,079
They looked like a father and his son.

24
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,440
The northern land was freezing cold.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,840
The old goose froze to death
on the mudflat.

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,340
The young goose

27
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,890
hovered around the old one's body,

28
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,079
over and over again,

29
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,970
until my father

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,610
dug a hole and buried the old goose.

31
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,160
We people of Yanmen all know

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
that wild geese are
the most affectionate creatures.

33
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Yeah,

34
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
wild geese are truly affectionate.

35
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,510
When I saw those two geese,

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
it was already the last month of winter.

37
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,130
The young goose was too weak to fly south.

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,430
A few days later,

39
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,570
a cold wave suddenly swept in,

40
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,990
and it followed the old goose's path
and passed away.

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
That was just foolish filial piety.

Before Mr. Jiang passed away,

67
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,150
he was so concerned
about the Yanmen Sect's reputation

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,600
that he even sacrificed his own life
to protect it.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
He cared about everything

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,800
that his father cared about

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,120
more than his own life.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,520
Silly boy.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Why couldn't he understand

74
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,260
that his life

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,430
was actually what mattered most to me?

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,940
We all do what we believe is right

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,750
for the sake of our family.

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,320
But is that really good?

79
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,860
You also don't want to leave Yanmen

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,830
and me, right?

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,750

82
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680

86
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,300
nice to meet you.

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

88
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,430
Mr. Tang,

89
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,320
what's wrong?

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

91
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,240
Isn't it?

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,210
My friend just passed away.

94
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm not in the mood

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,330
to appreciate the scenery yet.

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Mr. Tang, I heard that you

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,990
were the last person

98
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,810
to see Jiang Cheng before his death.

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,240
Before Jiang Cheng passed away,

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,950
I was indeed

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,450
the only one by his side.

102
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,480
Master Jiang is suffering
from the sudden loss of his son.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,540
He had you arrested

104
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,230
and put you through all this.

105
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,510
I hope you won't mind.

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Mr. Feng, that's so kind of you.

107
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,480
Haven't they told you

108
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,830
that I've already confessed

109
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,160
to killing Jiang Cheng?

110
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,510
I brought this upon myself.

111
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,860
It's just fair.

112
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,080
I don't know

113
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,240
why you would take

114
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,500
such blame upon yourself,

115
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,980
but...

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,400
Judging by what you said,

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,950
you're so sure

118
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,520
that I'm not the killer?

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,310
Yes.

120
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,700
Because you were not

121
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,909
the one who poisoned him.

122
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,159
Why did they

123
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,820
release us?

124
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,970
What happened?

125
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,270
Because Mr. Feng

126
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,540
vouched for Mr. Tang.

127
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,760
Master Jiang's got no trust in us,

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
but plenty in Mr. Feng.

129
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,430
You mean

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Feng Chuanxiang, the one who went missing?

131
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,630
Yes.

132
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,000
I suppose the news of his disappearance

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
was just a rumor.

134
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,830
But thankfully, he arrived in time.

135
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
Things turned out fine.

136
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,180
I came here

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,040
to catch the real culprit

138
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,090
and avenge my friend's death.

139
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,580
Please help me, Mr. Tang.

140
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,400
What's in it for me?

141
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,110
If we catch the real culprit,

142
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,510
you'll naturally be cleared of suspicion.

143
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,490
That's not a benefit.

144
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,360
Indeed.

145
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,300
Even if I hadn't appeared,

146
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,720
you'd still find a way to escape for sure.

147
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,060
But from what I know,

148
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,909
Mr. Tang,

149
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,320
you were first involved

150
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,200
in the massacre of Hao Wenhou's family.

151
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,510
After leaving the temple,

152
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,120
you soon became

153
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,179
the prime suspect in Cheng's murder.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,970
Mr. Tang,

155
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,740
even if you escape from Yanmen,

156
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,720
how can you be sure it won't happen again?

157
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,360
Do you really want

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,750
to leave a trail of false accusations

159
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,720
wherever you go

160
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,870
and end up
as an enemy of the whole jianghu?

161
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,960
Mr. Feng,

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
you sure are well-informed.

163
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,400
After all these years in the jianghu,

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,720
I've made quite a few friends.

165
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,250
If you have so many friends,

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,680
why do you specifically ask for my help?

167
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,540
Because this time, the enemy is

168
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,750
way more powerful than we thought.

169
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,470
"We"?

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,300
Yes,

171
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,300
we.

172
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,630
I believe

173
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,960
we have a common enemy.

174
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,850
Chi.

175
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,980
You're awake.

176
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,640
Where are

177
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,620
those damn brutes from the Yanmen Sect?

178
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,880
Master Jiang's taken the Yanmen disciples

179
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
back already.

180
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,980
They just left?

181
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,750
So easily?

182
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,750
Before Master Jiang left,

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,810
he set a condition.

184
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,260
Within seven days,

185
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,790
Mr. Tang must help Mr. Feng

186
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,000
investigate how Young Master Jiang

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,150
ended up taking the Blood Ghost Pill

188
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,960
and figure out the truth

189
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,090
for the Yanmen Sect.

190
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,050
I'll go ask him about it.

191
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I can only drink this much today.

192
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
If Jiang Cheng were still alive,

193
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,890
we would definitely
share another pot of wine with you

194
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,750
and drink to our hearts' content.

195
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,010
I didn't expect

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
you to hold

197
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,370
your liquor so well.

198
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm not much of a drinker.

199
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,790
It's just that when drinking
with a kindred spirit,

200
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,190
even a thousand cups of wine are
not enough.

201
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,580
Really?

202
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,760
You two just met each other,

203
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,050
and now you're already kindred spirits?

204
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
I never knew that you, Foxy Tang,

205
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,970
were so passionate about making friends.

206
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,640
Mr. Chi.

207
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,020
Don't call me that.

208
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,700
Just call me Chi Yun.

209
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,800
Or

210
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,490
Master Chi,

211
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,350
Chief Chi,

212
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,510
any of those will do.

213
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,630
Alright.

214
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,400
We still have things to do today.

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,620
We need some good tea

216
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,430
to sober up.

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,080
Indeed, you're right.

218
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,030
But I

219
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,610
don't have any tea with me.

220
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,470
Now

221
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,010
it's not appropriate
to ask Master Jiang for some.

222
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,070
Don't worry, Feng.

223
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,190
I have some.

224
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,280
Chi Yun,

225
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,440
serve the tea.

226
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,170
You want me

227
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,150
to pour tea for him?

228
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,010
Are you reluctant to do it?

229
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,250
I refuse.

230
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,380
Fine.

231
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,830
It hurts again?

232
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,740
Then why did you drink so much?

233
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,870
Why did you act

234
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,910
all buddy-buddy with a stranger

235
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,360
who came out of nowhere?

236
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,550
So

237
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,200
I want some good tea

238
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,240
to sober up.

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,260
You sly fox.

240
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,330
Just a minute.

241
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,650
I'm just that petty.

242
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,510
In the jianghu,

243
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,390
kindred spirits are rare to meet,

244
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,250
and true friends are hard to find.

245
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,170
You two...

246
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,130
Feng, you're mistaken.

247
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,670
He's not my friend,

248
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,910
but my servant.

249
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,940
Servant?

250
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,840
This is his contract of servitude.

251
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,760
Mr. Feng,

252
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,360
I'm merely a lowly servant.

253
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,460
How could I possibly deserve
to befriend Foxy Tang?

254
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,320
Drink it.

255
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,630
This is the private joke

256
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,160
between Cloud and Mr. Tang.

257
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,950
I shall not comment on it.

258
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,310
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

259
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,070
Thank you,

260
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,510
Cloud.

261
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,100
This is yours.

262
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,720
Sorry for that, Feng.

263
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,630
Miss Shei,

264
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,230
you've fitted in quite well.

265
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,910
These are just some chores
within my ability.

266
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,290
Now that things have settled down,

267
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,290
we should sit down

268
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,320
and have a good, hearty meal.

269
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
You're right.

270
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
That's what we should do.

271
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,910
Then let me help out, too.

272
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,650
Miss Zhong.

273
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,580
Your nose.

274
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,780
Let me help you.

275
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,680
There, done.

276
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,380
Thank you, Miss Shei.

277
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,490
I'd better not get in the way.

278
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,550
It's fine.

279
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,670
Miss Zhong, I'm already so happy

280
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,320
that you're willing to stay here with me.

281
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,410
Your hands

282
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,150
are meant to fight evil.

283
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,270
Just let me do these things.

284
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,760
In just a few days,

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,660
so many things have happened.

286
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,960
You, a lone orphan girl,
have wandered so far.

287
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,020
You must've suffered a lot.

288
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,720
I used to travel with my father,
busking for a living.

289
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,080
We've endured countless hardships.

290
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,200
Now I can

291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,670
stay in such a safe place

292
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,510
with warm clothes and abundant food.

293
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm already very fortunate.

294
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,620
Besides,

295
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,990
I can experience things

296
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,910
that I've never

297
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,910
seen before.

298
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,570
Yes.

299
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,370
I once thought

300
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,390
my trip down the mountain

301
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,300
representing
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

302
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,210
would be easy.

303
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,620
It turned out that I was too naive.

304
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,740
Speaking of which,

305
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,170
I'm grateful to have met all of you.

306
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,740
Thanks to you guys,

307
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,500
all these tangled clues

308
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
have gradually come to light.

309
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,470
And Master Tang.

310
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,260
Although his way
of doing things is quite wild,

311
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,320
it often yields remarkable results.

312
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,560
It's truly admirable.

313
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,330
Indeed.

314
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,380
Mr. Tang

315
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,080
is a very special person.

316
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
If you asked me a few days ago,

317
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,590
I couldn't imagine

318
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,000
that instead of being trapped

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
in seclusion in the Hao Residence forever,

320
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,960
I'd be with a crew of wandering heroes,

321
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
going on adventures in the jianghu.

322
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,670
Miss Zhong,

323
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,320
I owe all this to you

324
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,120
for saving me.

325
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,070
Don't mention it.

326
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,910
Actually,

327
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,390
I've seen

328
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,630
a lot in the Jianghu.

329
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,270
But I've never had

330
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,400
such a special experience as this one.

331
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,730
It's thrilling

332
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,140
with twists and turns.

333
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
I hope to uncover the truth soon

334
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,630
and return to the Sword Alliance
with credits,

335
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,700
living up to my master's expectations.

336
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,550
Yet I also wish

337
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,480
to delay our parting.

338
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,240
Feng, you just mentioned

339
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,940
a beautiful scenic spot

340
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,750
where you and Jiang Cheng

341
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,760
live in seclusion. Where is it?

342
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,750
At the end of Huaxi Stream,

343
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,810
beside Feng Cliff,

344
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,310
it's the Liulian Cottage.

345
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,320
After we fulfill

346
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,540
our seven-day agreement with Master Jiang,

347
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,970
you can feel free to visit

348
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,480
my humble abode anytime

349
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,540
with your friends.

350
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,760
Liulian Cottage.

351
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,240
Feng,

352
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
I have never seen

353
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
the morning view of Yan River.

354
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Would you like

355
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,000
to accompany me to the bow for a look?

356
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,210
With pleasure.

357
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,260
The warm and gentle morning light.

358
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,870
What an amazing view.

359
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,580
Such a beautiful scene

360
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,530
is perfect...

361
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,300
It's perfect to wake people up.

362
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,310
Mr. Tang, what are you doing?

363
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,820
Breaking my promise.

364
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,550
Foxy Tang,

365
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,420
what's happening?

366
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,360
Mr. Feng,

367
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,230
I've heard your story.

368
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,900
I'm somewhat interested,

369
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,630
but not much.

370
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,060
It's not worth the effort
I have to put in.

371
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,750
I thought

372
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,540
you were someone

373
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,950
who cared about friends, Mr. Tang.

374
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,290
I have no friends,

375
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,040
so how would I care about them?

376
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,550
Mr. Feng,

377
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,890
you got me wrong.

378
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,790
But Mr. Tang...

379
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,790
No buts.

380
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,960
He already told you

381
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
he has no friends.

382
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,310
You want to be friends

383
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,140
with this heartless fox?

384
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,510
You'll be eaten down to the bones

385
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,110
and die without knowing why!

386
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,710
Mr. Tang!

387
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,310
Just say whatever you want.

388
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,040
What was that just now?

389
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,510
Weren't you two
getting along well last night?

390
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,440
Why did things suddenly turn sour?

391
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
That day, Jiang Cheng told me

392
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,640
that the first person

393
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,700
who made him take the Blood Ghost Pill

394
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
was Feng Chuanxiang.

395
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,280
No way!

396
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,770
Weren't they sworn brothers?

397
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,400
Chi Yun,

398
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,520
you've always hated evil guys.

399
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,320
I was afraid you couldn't hold back.

400
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah, I can't stand someone

401
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,740
who betrayed his friend.

402
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm going after him to check it out.

403
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,100
If he really poisoned Jiang Cheng,

404
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,500
I'll kill him right away!

405
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,140
Where is Chi Yun going?

406
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,110
Miss Shei,

407
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,200
I need to follow him and take a look.

408
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,230
I believe

409
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,260
we have a common enemy.

410
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,690
What do you want to ask?

411
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,130
Sir, if you wanted Chi

412
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
to follow Mr. Feng,

413
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,640
why didn't you say it directly?

414
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,270
Being instructed by others
and taking initiative on one's own

415
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,230
might seem the same to others.

416
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,030
But for Chi Yun,

417
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,490
there's a big difference.

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Most of the time,

419
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,340
I prefer to let him maintain

420
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,690
a pleasant mood.

421
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,780
I thought

422
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
you would ask another question.

423
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,290
What?

424
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,780
The hand.

425
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,210
Yesterday,

426
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,550
you saw me get injured

427
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,420
and saw the wound heal with your own eyes.

428
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,490
Aren't you curious?

429
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,820
I just think

430
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,680
that maybe

431
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,550
everyone has

432
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,680
secrets they want to keep from others.

433
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,570
You're very clever, miss,

434
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,030
but unfortunately,

435
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
you've overlooked

436
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,190
a very important fact.

437
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,720
Chi Yun and Ms. Zhong

438
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,980
have both left the ship to track someone.

439
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,990
Now, there are

440
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,770
only you and me left on this ship.

441
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,090
Miss Shei,

442
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,920
didn't the person

443
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,320
who sent you ever tell you

444
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,110
how dangerous Tang Lici is?

445
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,440
Miss Shei,

446
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,030
you are

447
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,930
the only survivor from the Hao Residence,

448
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,670
as well as the witness chosen by Liu Yan.

449
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,190
Tell me

450
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,930
why my friend Liu Yan

451
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,670
chose you?

452
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't know,

453
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,350
Mr. Tang.

454
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,340
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,210
I was being rude.

456
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,920
Mr. Tang,

457
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,880
your apology

458
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,270
isn't sincere at all.

459
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,310
Because you don't care

460
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,910
whether I forgive you or not.

461
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,090
To get the truth you want,

462
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,110
you even

463
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,440
tested me in the most brutal way

464
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,410
without a care

465
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,700
for others' feelings.

466
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,160
Yet someone like you

467
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,720
is willing to meddle

468
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,920
in the affairs of Mr. Feng and Mr. Jiang.

469
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,770
Could you tell me

470
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,190
why?

471
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,660
Liu Yan did leave you by my side

472
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,110
for some reason.

473
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,340
What?

474
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,010
Come with me.

475
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,200
Where is he?

476
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,050
He should be around here.

477
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,880
Mr. Feng!

478
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,980
Mr. Jiang.

479
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,240
Mr. Feng,

480
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,140
how did you fall into the water?

481
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,580
Come on,

482
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
sit down quickly.

483
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,490
Here you are.

484
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,200
Put this on.

485
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Jiang Qingyu?

486
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,960
Why is he here?

487
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,630
Mr. Feng,

488
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,620
how did you end up in the water?

489
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,010
Also,

490
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,930
where's Mr. Tang?

491
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,960
Mr. Tang suddenly turned against me

492
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,090
and backed out of our cooperation.

493
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,550
So

494
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,020
he used you and then abandoned you?

495
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,980
Mr. Jiang,

496
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,130
what brings you here?

497
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm here

498
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,790
for Cheng's case.

499
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,340
Given what you said yesterday,

500
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,160
there's more behind Cheng's taking

501
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,070
that evil pill?

502
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,970
That's right.

503
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,930
I suspect

504
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,660
that he was poisoned.

505
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,010
What?

506
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Darn it.

507
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,700
How despicable!

508
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,090
What do you plan to do next, Mr. Feng?

509
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,650
Jiang Cheng was my best friend.

510
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,170
I will definitely

511
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,150
bring the poisoner to justice

512
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,420
and make him pay with his life.

513
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Cheng was fortunate to have a friend

514
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,720
like you, Mr. Feng.

515
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,440
Would you allow me to come along

516
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,200
with you?

517
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,650
Our Yanmen Sect

518
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
has some connections

519
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,850
in both legal and underworld communities.

520
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,050
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

521
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,120
That would be perfect.

522
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,580
Let's go then.

523
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,730
We should hurry and find a place

524
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,310
to dry your clothes first.

525
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:55,800
Let's go.

526
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,200
Okay.

527
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,350
Forget about whether Feng Chuanxiang

528
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,610
is suspicious for now.

529
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,310
Why is Mr. Jiang Qingyu
even more dedicated to it

530
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,840
than Jiang Cheng's father?

531
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,410
Something's off.

532
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
I need to look into it.

533
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,660
What are you doing? Are you going bonkers?

534
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,650
Keep up.

535
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,370
Where are we?

536
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,490
Huaxi.

537
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,720
The place where Young Mr. Jiang

538
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,270
and Mr. Feng once lived.

539
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,640
Mr. Tang,

540
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,200
didn't you say

541
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,730
you wouldn't help Mr. Feng?

542
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
Or are you planning

543
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,280
to split up with Chi Yun

544
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,480
and investigate the case

545
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
about Young Master Jiang together?

546
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,270
You were right about the beginning,

547
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,800
but wrong about the ending.

548
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,270
I did break

549
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,000
my promise to Feng Chuanxiang.

550
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,750
However,

551
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,140
I came here

552
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,310
because Shisan Tower

553
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,640
revealed the clues leading to this place.

554
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,360
[Jin Hua Yin]

555
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,270
Sorry for the delay.

556
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,720
Sirs,

557
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,610
here's your tea.

558
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Since we know

559
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,220
he's the poisoner,

560
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,700
why don't we arrest him?

561
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
I am impatient,

562
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,710
but I'm not a fool.

563
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,460
My keen instincts

564
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,170
tell me

565
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,510
that something fishy is going on here.

566
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,680
Mr. Feng,

567
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,680
my big brother is hot-tempered.

568
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,440
If he finds out

569
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,590
that you let Tang Lici escape...

570
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,000
Sir!

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,550
He might

572
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,550
do crazy things.

573
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,720
Alright!

574
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,100
Mr. Jiang, have you figured out

575
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,900
a better plan?

576
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,320
Shisan Tower? What kind of place is that?

577
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,970
A place
where you can find answers to everything.

578
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,790
Shisan Tower has the world's

579
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,320
most formidable assassins

580
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,160
and the most comprehensive intelligence
in the jianghu.

581
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,960
But you need to afford the price.

582
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Then where is this tower?

583
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,440
Shisan Tower's location is so mysterious

584
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,170
that few in the jianghu know it.

585
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,720
But if you wish to make a deal with them,

586
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,450
you should go to their outpost,

587
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,270
Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

588
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,300
[Floating Abyss]

589
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,410
If you still want to keep
these eyes of yours,

590
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,030
I suggest you stop looking
where you shouldn't.

591
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,230
I've heard that the Fallen Shisan Tower

592
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,530
has the most skilled assassins
in the world

593
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,270
and the most comprehensive information.

594
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,830
So this must be

595
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,490
the Floating Abyss of Buhuan Tower.

596
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,920
Then where is the Fallen Shisan Tower?

597
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,720
Ms. Zhong,

598
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
do you know why

599
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,850
it's called the Floating Abyss
of Buhuan Tower?

600
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,310
That's because this place

601
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,850
really floats.

602
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,620
What does that mean?

603
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,590
On the fifteenth of every month,

604
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,050
which happens to be today,

605
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,890
which happens to be right now.

606
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,380
[Floating Abyss, Buhuan Tower]

607
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,410
It will rise from this part of the river.

608
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,030
That's when

609
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,690
you can go up this Buhuan Tower

610
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,220
to make a deal
with the Fallen Shisan Tower.

611
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,930
As for seeing

612
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,220
the real Shisan Tower,

613
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,010
your qualifications

614
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,100
are not enough yet.

615
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,780
Come on,

616
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,980
why must I lie in a coffin?

617
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,910
I don't understand.

618
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,390
If that's the case,

619
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,270
Mr. Tang,

620
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,060
why don't you go directly to Shisan Tower

621
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,960
to buy the truth about Young Master Jiang

622
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,200
and Mr. Feng?

623
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,870
Liu Yan arranged all these incidents

624
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,210
just to make me, while being pushed

625
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,070
by the Yanmen Sect relentlessly,

626
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,030
have no choice

627
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,600
but to go to Shisan Tower again
to buy information

628
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,930
and prove my innocence.

629
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,460
But I surrendered willingly.

630
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,860
This disrupted his plan.

631
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,940
So

632
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,170
he sent Feng Chuanxiang.

633
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,270
As long as I don't play along

634
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,550
with his plan,

635
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,890
he just can't win this round.

636
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,510
So that's why you

637
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,240
kicked Mr. Feng into the water.

638
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,590
But why would Mr. Feng

639
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,480
take orders from Liu Yan?

640
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,440
That's

641
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,970
the purpose of our journey.

642
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,890
The affairs in the jianghu

643
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,510
are truly bewildering

644
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,480
and creepy.

645
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,280
Sorry for the interruption.

646
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,080
When entering someone's home,

647
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,460
it's only polite to announce yourself.

648
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,220
[The flowers and the moon
decorate the river with breezes]

649
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,610
In your opinion,

650
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,110
between Jiang Cheng and Feng Chuanxiang,

651
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,940
which one was telling the truth?

652
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Jiang Cheng said

653
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,480
Feng Chuanxiang poisoned him.

654
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,240
A person might lie

655
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,310
at any time,

656
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,080
but they would never lie at death's door,

657
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,600
especially about their unfulfilled wishes.

658
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,360
Mr. Tang...

659
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,310
Therefore,

660
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,500
Jiang Cheng's words must be true.

661
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,920
As for Feng Chuanxiang,

662
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,030
he can lie,

663
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,240
and he can hide

664
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,350
hatred and murderous intent

665
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,110
in a clever way

666
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,240
to go undetected.

667
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,020
But a place where someone has lived

668
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
for a long time

669
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,110
will leave traces,
and those traces tell the truth.

670
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,850
Especially when it comes to friendship.

671
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,660
Even if one can fake it for a day

672
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,070
or for ten days,

673
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,140
how could he possibly pretend

674
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
every single day?

675
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,000
The flowers and the moon decorate
the river (Jiang) with breezes (Feng).

676
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,810
They both

677
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,590
told the truth.

678
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,650
But what kind of misunderstanding

679
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,260
could make such good friends

680
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,400
unable to talk it over face-to-face?

681
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,110
Since they both

682
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,970
told the truth,

683
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,140
there must be a misunderstanding

684
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,750
they couldn't talk about,

685
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,090
nor was there a chance to explain.

686
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,970
When suppressing the poison
for Jiang Cheng,

687
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,820
I found that the toxins
had accumulated in his body

688
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,120
for possibly more than a year.

689
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,760
Therefore, over six months ago,

690
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,290
when Jiang Cheng came
to see Feng Chuanxiang,

691
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,510
he was already poisoned

692
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,970
with the Blood Ghost Pill.

693
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,920
But he himself

694
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
was completely unaware of this.

695
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,120
In order to help

696
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,780
delay the poison's outbreak,

697
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,810
Feng Chuanxiang

698
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,250
had to make him
keep taking the evil pills

699
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,850
by mixing them into his food in secret.

700
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,190
Unfortunately,

701
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,870
Jiang Cheng happened to witness this.

702
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,030
So

703
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,080
a misunderstanding arose.

704
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,510
I was already wondering

705
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,960
why Shisan Tower sent clues

706
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,570
about Liulian Cottage's murder

707
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,300
after the Hao family massacre.

708
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,140
Now I'm even more convinced

709
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,530
that from the very beginning,

710
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,590
not a single thing was coincidental.

711
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,310
But

712
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,200
you already knew

713
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,670
that everything they said was true.

714
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,310
You also knew
that your getting involved in this

715
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,770
was part of Liu Yan's plan.

716
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,510
Why

717
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,840
did you still come here?

718
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,410
All of this is merely

719
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,370
my speculation.

720
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,950
As for whether it's true or not,

721
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,350
and whether to join the game
or overturn it,

722
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,390
I'll find out once I investigate.

723
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,850
Tang Lici,

724
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,010
you're doing very well.

725
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,890
Tonight's guests of Buhuan Tower

726
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,290
have all arrived, right?

727
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,890
You know what to do.

728
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,670
Trade for hands!

729
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,540
Sell one of your hands

730
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,680
for whatever information you want.

731
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,740
What is this place?

732
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,640
Why is there a market here?

733
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,070
This is

734
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,990
the black market
in Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

735
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,600
If ordinary people want help
from Shisan Tower,

736
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
they must first come to the Floating Abyss

737
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,130
and find the Porter.

738
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,200
But not everyone is qualified

739
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,270
to meet the Porter.

740
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
Over time,

741
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,970
a black market has formed here.

742
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,400
Those who aren't qualified

743
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
to meet the Porter

744
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,640
can still

745
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,990
buy what they want here.

746
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,780
It's way too crowded here.

747
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,210
And they're all wearing
the same black cloaks.

748
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,410
Chi Yun, walk faster.

749
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,530
Don't lose them.

750
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,070
Oh, no, they really disappeared.

751
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:19,690
Calm down.

752
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,990
When the time comes,

753
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,310
we'll meet them

754
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,240
near the Porter.

755
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,270
Wait,

756
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,050
didn't you just say

757
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,830
not everyone is qualified

758
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,890
to meet the Porter?

759
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,400
Feng Chuanxiang had been missing
for so long.

760
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,590
Is it weird that Shisan Tower is

761
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,570
interested in him?

762
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,370
What about us?

763
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,720
Why would the Porter

764
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
choose us as well?

765
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,090
At this point,

766
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,490
I might as well tell you.

767
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,060
What?

768
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,410
Fiancée?

769
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,480
I am the handsome and charming Cloud.

770
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,660
Is it weird that a woman likes me?

771
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,790
Then may I ask who

772
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,920
your fiancée is?

773
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,870
Bai Suche.

774
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,570
Bai Suche?

775
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,920
You mean the one
known as the most beautiful woman

776
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
in Jiangnan, the elegant Bai Suche?

777
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,370
What's with that look?

778
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:11,989
Nothing.

779
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,060
Your expression clearly says,

780
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,840
"How would that elegant beauty

781
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,440
marry someone like you?"

782
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,969
Exactly!

783
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,679
How would she ever agree to marry you?

784
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,110
A few years ago, I

785
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,550
went to Jiangnan, performing heroic deeds

786
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,350
and saving Bai Yuming's family.

787
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,179
He liked me so much

788
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,909
that he insisted on marrying off
his daughter to me.

789
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,130
What's wrong with this?

790
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,520
Wait.

791
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:33,969
Are you saying

792
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,080
that Master Bai

793
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,820
insisted on betrothing his daughter
to you?

794
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,520
Instead of me desperately asking

795
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,449
to marry into their family, right?

796
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,239
That's not what I meant.

797
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
I just think

798
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,360
that since Master Bai is a descendant
of the Calligraphy Saint,

799
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,110
if you're

800
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,920
Master Bai's son-in-law,

801
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,190
you should at least share his interests.

802
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,280
But I'm just

803
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,679
an underworld gangster.

804
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,429
So what?

805
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,699
Yeah,

806
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,870
you're right.

807
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,550
You, Cloud, are the hope
of the underworld.

808
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,810
Just eat your cake.

809
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,430
The Bai's Estate

810
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,530
suffered a massacre a year ago, right?

811
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,280
Indeed, they were massacred.

812
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,150
But no one's found

813
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,420
my fiancée's body in the estate.

814
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
I've always believed

815
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,770
that she's still alive somewhere.

816
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,050
But

817
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,330
that doesn't make sense.

818
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,460
After all you've said,

819
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,580
you still haven't explained why

820
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,540
we'll definitely be chosen by the Porter.

821
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,040
Because I came to look for my fiancée,

822
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,810
who hadn't

823
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,700
married me yet,

824
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,700
and bought information from Shisan Tower.

825
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,670
Who knew this Shisan Tower

826
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,800
was all about scams?

827
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,390
They saw how desperate I was
to find my wife

828
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,880
and demanded

829
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,340
a price I couldn't afford.

830
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,630
In the end, I didn't find my wife

831
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,760
and even got myself sold
to the Shisan Tower.

832
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,150
If that damn Foxy Tang hadn't

833
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,210
happened to pass by

834
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,970
with a contract claiming ownership of me,

835
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,490
saying that I was already sold to him

836
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,030
and couldn't be sold
to Shisan Tower again.

837
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,370
Between getting sold
to the Fallen Shisan Tower

838
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,490
or to Foxy Tang,

839
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,920
it was quite obvious

840
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,380
which one I'd pick, right?

841
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,760
When the Porter sees me

842
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,690
back here again,

843
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,440
he definitely won't let me go.

844
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,050
Mr. Tang,

845
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,540
the road ends here.

846
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,710
We've searched everywhere possible.

847
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,710
If we've already searched

848
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,870
all possible places,

849
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,330
then it must be right here.

850
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,930
Shei,

851
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,360
are there really

852
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,590
friends in this world

853
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,360
you can trust with your life?

854
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,090
You go to Yanmen
with the messenger goose first.

855
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,860
I will

856
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,790
go there for a thorough investigation.

857
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Mr. Tang!

858
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,110
[Floating Red Worm Silk]

859
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,450
Please feel free to take a look.

860
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,520
It's just one year of your lifespan.

861
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,120
What are you hesitating for?

862
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,450
The porter carries weight on both ends.

863
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,280
One end succeeds, one end fails.

864
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,050
Welcome, everyone, to Buhuan Tower.

865
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,970
May I ask which guest

866
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,600
will make the first bid?

867
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,710
Me.

868
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,550
What is your offer?

869
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,730
A pair of sorrowful eyes.

870
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,670
Three fingers filled with hatred.

871
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,720
Five drops of blood from my heart.

872
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,120
Ten years of freedom.

873
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,850
What are you trying to exchange for?

874
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,750
The real culprit.

875
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,590
Carrying pole,

876
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,210
what do you think?

877
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,600
Sir.

878
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,580
Your chips aren't enough, I'm afraid.

879
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,460
Unless...

880
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,030
Unless what?

881
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,520
Unless you exchange your life for it!

882
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,010
Mr. Jiang, what are you doing?

883
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,790
I'm trying to kill you.

884
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,440
You're the one

885
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,100
bringing it upon yourself.

886
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,850
According to my plan,

887
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,090
after Cheng died
and the murderer confessed,

888
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,800
my brother's furious actions

889
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,660
would offend
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

890
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,000
And then I would rightfully

891
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,490
become the master of the Yanmen Sect.

892
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,230
This wonderful

893
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,960
dream-come-true moment

894
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,250
was ruined

895
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,810
by your sudden appearance.

896
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,790
I paid a hefty price

897
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,360
to Shisan Tower's Master

898
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,960
for a chance to kill you.

899
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,110
Here and now,

900
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,510
no one will

901
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,800
step in and help you.

902
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,970
Today,

903
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,770
you're doomed to die.

904
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,240
Mr. Tang,

905
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,650
I want to find Chuanxiang

906
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,480
and ask him

907
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,690
why he wanted to kill me.

908
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,920
We used to be best friends
who would die for each other.

909
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,720
Why are we turning on each other?

910
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
If someone kills people because of me,

911
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,110
if innocents suffer because of me,

912
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,280
does that make it my karma?

913
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,450
Tang Lici, do you see now?

914
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,550
Such a tiny pill

915
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,480
can turn the best friends

916
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,640
into bitter enemies

917
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,440
and make family members
betray and kill each other.

918
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,480
Who can resist the temptation

919
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,960
of overnight wealth, glory,

920
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
and unparalleled martial arts?

921
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,030
I have already spread it

922
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,800
throughout the martial arts world.

923
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,280
It has returned to this world

924
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,550
all because of you,

925
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,070
Tang Lici.

926
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:49,960
This time,

927
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,620
I'll make you wish you were dead.

928
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,110
Let your friends be your warning.

929
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,170
It's their fault
for trusting the wrong person.

930
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:03,730
You

931
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,070
can't save them.

932
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,670
Liu Yan's curse bug?

933
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,980
I can't save them?

934
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,820
But Liu Yan,

935
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,810
I'm looking for you.

936
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,750
Yanmen.
