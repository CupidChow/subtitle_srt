Indeed.

8
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,920

Fang Zhou

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,190
asked me

14
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,079
to write the name.

15
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,120
He meant for you to write

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
your own name.

17
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,370

You can't trick me out of

the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

38
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,270
so you're anxious?

39
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,680
What a pity

40

that you've run into me again.

41

Once I'm here,

you just can't escape.

43
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,000
There's a barrier here.

44
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,680
We both have our strength

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
reduced to less than 30 percent.

Just now,

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,800
it was because you

fell into this barrier

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,070
that the Floating Red Worm Silk

50
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,550
slipped off you.

51
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,310
You can't kill me now.

52
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,810
You can only stay here and listen to me.

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,540
Listen to your gibberish?

54
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,090
You'll have to listen anyway.

55
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,480
Were it not for you,

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,000
I wouldn't have fallen down here.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,870
Are you saying

58
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,550
that I got you into danger?

59
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,159
Liu Yan,

60
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,920
do you really think

61
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,600
that our seven years of friendship were

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,830
something I faked

63
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,250
day after day?

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,310
For others,

65
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,680
it might be impossible.

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,160
But for you,

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,870
Tang Lici,

68
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,970
it might not be so difficult.

69
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,510
Perhaps I could pull it off now,

70
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,100
but the old me

71
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,150
definitely couldn't.

72
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,430
Given the ceaseless strong winds here,

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
there must be a vortex

74
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,880
below the abyss.

75
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,990
With just one person's strength,

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,430
neither of us can

77
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,310
get out of here.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,560
So...

79
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,810
What trick are you playing this time?

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,550
I'll dive into the vortex

81
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,950
and block it
with sound waves from my flute.

82
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,170
The strong winds will stop temporarily.

83
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,360
If we're lucky,

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,780
this pulling force

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,950
will cease.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,850
And you can go up.

87
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,390
Can this really work?

88
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,480
Not sure.

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,510
But we can only try this way.

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
I can only block the vortex for a moment.

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,940
When it's done,

92
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,540
we both need to move quickly.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,080
Infused with inner strength,
the Floating Red Worm Silk

94
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,710
can extend

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,320
to 166 meters at most.

96
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,350
After I block the vortex,

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,810
I'll shake the red silk.

98
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,690
At that moment,

99
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,390
you should use the same force

100
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,000
to shake the other end of the silk.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,630
Our combined forces will hit
the bottom of the cliff.

102
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,950
Then, with the counterforce
of the Sound Killing Technique,

103
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,280
you can escape from here

104
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,130
and pull me out as well.

105
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,600
Should I repeat that?

106
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,909
Do you even know what you're saying?

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't bother.

108
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm injured

109
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,070
and can only use Sound Killing once.

110
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,670
Seize the chance on your own.

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,310
Wait!

112
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,430
Found it.

White Dragon Dance of Supreme Energy.

114
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,520
The flute sound is weak.

115

He's more severely injured than I thought.

116

117
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,000
Zhoudi Tower once had a duet

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,680

119
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,010
the powers of both players temporarily.

Trust.

121
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,700
As long as there's mutual trust,

122
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,620
the melody
can just greatly boost our powers.

123

It seems

147

that I'm at the ruins of Gumo State.

148

But why do these murals

149
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,890
give off a vibe of the Tianren Realm?

150
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,990
Over five decades ago,

151
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,670
I broke through the Void

152

and left the Tianren Realm.

153
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,310
But I was attacked

154

by a Tuo Dragon
surviving at the Void's edge,

155

00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,030
Ye Mo?

178
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,890
The King of Gumo State believed
my appearance

179
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,910
meant he had received

180
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,170
the gods' protection.

181
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,630
He begged me to stay.

182
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,030
Princess Xi Ya
stayed by my side all the time

183
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,790
and told me

184
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,750
many things about Shenzhou.

185
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,320
Those were

186
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,520
my happiest moments.

187
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,870
I was so happy

188
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,440
that I almost forgot

189
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,000
why I came here.

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,270
This is Gumo State's sacred relic

191
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,960
passed down through generations.

192
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,820
They say it also fell from heaven.

193
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,530
I'll give it to you as a token.

194
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,160
But the good times didn't last.

195
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,320
Gumo State was struck

196
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,120
by a once-in-a-century plague.

197
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,190
Countless people suffered and died.

198
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,670
State Deity, please use your magic
to save our people.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
What can I do to eliminate the plague?

200
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
State Deity,

201
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
the Ancestor of Gumo State

202
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
built this altar here

203
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,790
because this place

204
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,990
connects to the state's every ley line.

205
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,670
The Ancestor's prophecy said

206
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,180
that after the altar was completed,

207
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,380
an immortal would descend from heaven.

208
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,370
If the state faced danger,

209
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,990
he would use the Heaven-Halo Technique

210
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,550
to absorb all the miasma

211
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,350
hidden in the state's ley lines.

212
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,070
Heaven-Halo Technique?

213
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,960
With this altar,

214
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,950
you can guide the ley line energy

215
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,950
through your self-healing body

216
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,210
to purify the miasma.

217
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,300
I was a bit confused back then.

218
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,670
How did the King know

219
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,070
the secret technique of the Tianren Realm?

220
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,200
But I was so focused on saving people

221
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,260
that I didn't think too much about it.

222
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,480
I only realized later

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
that he was

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,480
up to something else.

225
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,670
He's invaded my mind?

226
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,840
The secret scroll does tell the truth.

227
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,460
The Heaven-Halo Technique can
make energy channels vibrate,

228
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,300
allowing

229
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,330
the casters' minds to be exchanged.

230
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,860
This is a way to obtain the divine body
to become a god.

231
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
The Tianren Realm had taken

232
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,870
so many people's luck

233
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,910
to ascend to heaven from Gumo State.

234
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,870
Now it's just karma coming full circle.

235
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,200
The plague is raging now.

236
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
If you do this,

237
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
what about those common people?

238
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,750
You're too naive.

239
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,670
The plague isn't real.

240
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,440
Everyone's been lying to you.

241
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,640
I've broken free from control?

242
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,750
The remaining Tianren Realm power

243
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,610
in the bracelet

244
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,330
helped stabilize my energy channels.

245
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,260
Get out!

246
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,270
The State Deity killed the King!

247
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,360
Catch him quickly!

248
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,600
Get him!

249
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,730
Our ascension plan failed!

250
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,510
He's trying to prevent us all

251
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,720
from ascending to heaven.

252
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,440
He's the one who made us

253
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,700
unable to become gods!

254
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,030
Only by burning him to death

255
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,830
can we prevent his revenge on us!

256
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
The fire burned for three whole days.

257
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,440
My body festered and healed
over and over again.

258
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,800
At that moment, I realized

259
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,270
that places outside the Tianren Realm are

260
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,000
crawling with worthless,

261
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,790
inferior, and foolish beings.

262
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,069
They shouldn't exist.

263
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:41,880
Only through slaughter

264
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,170
can they be completely purified.

265
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,310
This is true compassion.

266
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
Ye Mo! Ye Mo!

267
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,680
I came too late.

268
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,680
How hypocritical.

269
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,130
You're just utilizing me,

270
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,750
like your father did.

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,930
That's not true.

272
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,070
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,720
I really didn't know

274
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
this was my father's scheme.

275
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,780
You wanted me
to open the Heaven Halo

276
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,110
to purify the ley lines.

277
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,920
Fine then.

278
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,920
I know what to do now.

279
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,600
What needs
to be purified isn't the plague,

280
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,350
but their sins.

281
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,570
Heaven being centered,

282
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,120
stars align.

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,260
Earth being centered,

284
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,810
yin and yang harmonize.

285
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,530
From now on, I shall be called

286
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,180
Yique Yinyang.

287
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,380
Holy Son of the Tianren Realm,

288
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,030
have you

289
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
seen clearly?

290
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,880
Someday,

291
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,020
you'll also need to make a choice,

292
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,470
just like I did back then.

293
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,870
He deliberately

294
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,460
left these things for me

295
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,430
to see.

296
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,200
But how did he know

297
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,070
that I would come to Shenzhou

298
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,470
and that I'm the Holy Son?

299
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,920
Could it be

300
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,370
that Yique Yinyang is still alive?

301
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,830
He's been watching me all along?

302
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,320
Didn't expect this child

303
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,270
to actually

304
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,200
bring back the Glowing Meteorite.

305
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,920
We've got the medicine,

306
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
but the patient is missing.

307
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,370
Where on earth did Foxy Tang go?

308
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,450
Never mind,

309
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,490
I'll go find him.

310
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,880
Mr. Tang.

311
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,180
Chi Yun,

312
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,680
when will you learn

313
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,720
to be patient?

314
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,960
I was worried about you.

315
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm fine.

316
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,310
Senior,

317
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,300
may I have a word with you?

318
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,590
Senior, may I ask

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,530
about your relationship
with Yique Yinyang?

320
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,880
In a time-space rift

321
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
at Mount Baojing,

322
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,550
I saw a memory fragment

323
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,550
of Yique Yinyang.

324
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,020
You've met Yique Yinyang before.

325
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,350
I am a personal maid

326
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,350
of Princess Xi Ya.

327
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,200
Let me guess.

328
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,000
Earlier, you were

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,260
hiding things from me,

330
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,960
but now you're being frank.

331
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,260
Tianren Realm?

332
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,830
What place is that?

333
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,910
I've never heard of it.

334
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,050
It's because

335
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,740
you once planned to trap me

336
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,380
in the time-space rift at Mount Baojing,

337
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,440
but unexpectedly,

338
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,300
I made it back.

339
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,640
You're quite smart.

340
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,960
And perceptive too.

341
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,240
Not only did you make it back alive,

342
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,410
but you even managed

343
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,310
to get the Glowing Meteorite.

344
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,160
Then, Senior, you can

345
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,290
start saving me now.

346
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,000
I

347
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
won't save you.

348
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,030
I only said this could

349
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,920
serve as an ingredient for your medicine.

350
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,650
Never did I say I would save you.

351
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,260
I saw with my own eyes

352
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,370
how the Princess's compassion

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,110
allowed Yique Yinyang

354
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,680
to bring disaster upon the world.

355
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,350
You and he share the same origin.

356
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,270
Even if right now,

357
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,860
you still have some good intentions,

358
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,520
there's no guarantee that you won't be

359
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,210
consumed by evil thoughts someday,

360
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,270
turning into a second Yique Yinyang.

361
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,190
I won't let this happen.

362
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,850
Moreover,

363
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,970
you did hesitate between saving others

364
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
and saving yourself,

365
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,510
didn't you?

366
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
Can't believe

367
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,880
the world is so absurd

368
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,110
that it is even wrong for a person to try

369
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,240
to save his own life.

370
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
As the Physician of Miracle,

371
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,270
you must've seen countless beings

372
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,130
struggling on the brink of death.

373
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,810
I believe

374
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,750
the desire to survive is

375
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,120
a human instinct.

376
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,030
Or is it

377
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,060
that everyone has the right to live

378
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,590
except for me?

379
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,160
Not just you,

380
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,260
even I have asked myself

381
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,740
whether I deserve

382
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,940
to live in this world.

383
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,960
But not until I saw

384
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,440
those memory fragments

385
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,510
did I realize

386
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,290
how terribly wrong I was.

387
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
I should survive.

388
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,090
Even

389
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,750
Ye Mo back then

390
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,020
deserved to survive, too.

391
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,610
Yique Yinyang summoned heavenly fire

392
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,450
and slaughtered the Gumo State.

393
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,130
Are you trying to defend him?

394
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,850
I'm just thinking

395
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,120
how lucky I am compared to Ye Mo.

396
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,270
Ye Mo

397
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,800
descended upon Gumo State,

398
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,270
so Yique Yinyang

399
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,930
came into being in this world.

400
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,070
And I was fortunate enough

401
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,330
that Fang Zhou took me in at Zhoudi Tower.

402
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,940
That's why even now,

403
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,350
I can still be Tang Lici.

404
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,830
You're simply trying to say

405
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,720
that you're not like him.

406
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,570
But they didn't deserve to die, right?

407
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,490
Yet they were indeed

408
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,070
the ones who created Yique Yinyang.

409
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,930
But you feel compassion for them.

410
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,390
What about Fang Zhou?

411
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,440
What do you mean?

412
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,760
Senior,

413
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,160
even if you still think

414
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,960
that I deserve to die,

415
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
Fang Zhou's heart crystal is

416
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,840
inside my body now.

417
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
If you kill me,

418
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,000
you'll be killing

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,200
the world's most honorable gentleman,

420
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,050
the Seven‑String True Tune,

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,050
Fang Zhou.

422
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,870
Come here in three days

423
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
for the medicine.

424
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,190
Ms. Zhong, this way,

425
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,720
please.

426
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,640
What's this?

427
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,360
The Princess's swaddling clothes
from when she was little.

428
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
Her Highness has kept them all these years

429
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,700
to comfort her longing for her child.

430
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,200
Her Highness misses her daughter dearly

431
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,550
and has already come here.

432
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,280
Ms. Zhong, please get changed.

433
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,120
Miss,

434
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,530
these ornaments...

435
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Are they all

436
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,680
for me to wear?

437
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,970
Ms. Zhong, compared to your noble status,

438
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,350
these items to be used on you are

439
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,410
nothing precious.

440
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,370
Let me dress your hair.

441
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,670
Your Highness.

442
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,860
My child!

443
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,200
My child.

444
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,780
Your Highness.

445
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,590
My child!

446
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,210
I've finally found you.

447
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,970
I've missed you so much.

448
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,400
My child.

449
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,240
You've suffered so much.

450
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
Your father and I have failed you.

451
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,380
Don't worry.

452
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,350
From now on, I will

453
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,480
do everything to protect you,

454
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,230
love you,

455
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,640
and give you everything you want.

456
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,150
Mother.

457
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Good girl.

458
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
The medicine is ready.

459
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,110
There are three pills in total.

460
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,070
Each one can extend your life once.

461
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
Take it,

462
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,000
and your martial powers will be restored

463
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,140
as if nothing happened.

464
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,200
Your hair will also turn black again.

465
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,070
But there are only three pills.

466
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,150
Once you consume them all,

467
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,680
no one can save you anymore.

468
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,510
I understand.

469
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,610
I have one more condition.

470
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,850
Please go ahead, Senior.

471
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,440
I want to go with you
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

472
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,130
I must

473
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,870
keep an eye on my patient.

474
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,880
That's great.

475
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,760
The Sword Alliance

476
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,060
will give you the warmest welcome.

477
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,440
I'm back!

478
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,270
Come on,

479
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,240
come welcome me.

480
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,180
Where is everyone?

481
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,480
Where are they?

482
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,850
Senior, this way.

483
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,710
Here they come.

484
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,840
Master Shao,

485
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,750
Mr. Tang has brought

486
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,480
the Physician of Miracle back.

487
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,890
So you're that...

488
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,960
This is the Physician of Miracle,

489
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,680
Shui Duopo.

490
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,030
So you're the renowned Senior Shui Duopo.

491
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,030
My apologies.

492
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,870
Look at yourself.

493
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,710
How can you call me "Senior"?

494
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,950
It's okay.

495
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,460
With your leg in such a terrible state,

496
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,920
just skip the formalities

497
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,790
and sit down.

498
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,010
Sit down, please.

499
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,750
Is Mr. Tang fully recovered?

500
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,950
He's doing very well.

501
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,830
Then, Miss Shui,

502
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,820
please check on Master Puzhu.

503
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,650
Don't worry.

504
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,640
As long as his leg is still attached,

505
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,700
I can fix it anyway.

506
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,630
Thank you, Senior Shui.

507
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,150
By the way, Master Shao,

508
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,310
Mr. Tang has already set off

509
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,240
for Wanhua Hall.

510
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,280
Then let's go to Wanhua Hall

511
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,430
and leave Miss Shui to the treatment.

512
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,060
Please.

513
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,690
Liu Yan,

514
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,670
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

515
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,330
Otherwise,

516
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,310
both of us

517
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,350
will die here.

518
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,530
Do you really think

519
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,030
that our seven years of friendship were

520
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,310
something I faked

521
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
day after day?

522
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,240
If what Tang Lici said is true,

523
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,880
then what's the point

524
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,280
of everything I've done?

525
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,880
Master!

526
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,030
Master!

527
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,550
I've been refining
these Thousand Curse Needles every day,

528
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,880
but what's the point?

529
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,660
Master, what are you saying?

530
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,460
What's wrong?

531
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,000
While you were

532
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,760
looking for Senior Shui Duopo,

533
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,470
we found out

534
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,730
that the person behind the Fengliu Shop is

535
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,990
called Ghostly Peony.

536
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,720
What?

537
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,980
You know him?

538
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,780
I once ran into him

539
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,890
in Sanqin.

540
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,640
How may I address you?

541
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,610
Ghostly Peony.

542
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,970
When I was trying to kill Yu Qifeng

543
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,380
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

544
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,790
a teenage boy

545
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,700
came out of nowhere and rescued Yu Qifeng.

546
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,810
You acted on impulse

547
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,540
and nearly ruined everything.

548
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,770
He sounded

549
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,680
exactly like Ghostly Peony,

550
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,200
yet his physique

551
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,090
didn't seem human.

552
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,310
Perhaps

553
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
it was a puppet.

554
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,710
When Chi Yun chased Fang Pingzhai

555
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,780
to Buhuan Tower,

556
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,480
he also found a puppet

557
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,360
giving orders to Qiaoyi Qiankun.

558
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,000
According to the captured disciples
of Fengliu Shop,

559
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,190
they often saw Liu Yan

560
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,440
having secret talks
with an opera performer.

561
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,320
They heard Liu Yan call this person

562
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,030
Leader.

563
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,520
An opera performer?

564
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,670
Godfather,

565
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,840
Liu Yan's been
acting weird since he returned

566
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,969
from Mount Baojing.

567
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,620
Judging by his expression,

568
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
something's off.

569
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,770
Did I scare you?

570
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,710
No.

571
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,100
This isn't fun.

572
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,489
Is Liu Yan

573
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,739
going to leave?

574
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,560
Why is he leaving all of a sudden?

575
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,050
He wants to get rid of my surveillance.

576
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,320
Why does he want to get rid

577
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,580
of your surveillance?

578
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,360
What is he planning?

579
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,290
Every time he meets with Tang Lici,

580
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,760
he gets a bit weirder.

581
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
It seems

582
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,940
that I need to move up my plan.

583
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,260
Fang Pingzhai!

584
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,520
I've finished making the things

585
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,180
that Fang Pingzhai asked for.

586
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,560
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

587
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,290
and Guest of Honor, Tang Lici,
please receive the imperial decree.

588
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,740
I, Tang Lici...

589
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,350
-I, Shao Yanping, receive the decree.
-Receive the decree.

590
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,910
By heaven's will

591
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,440
and sacred rites,

592
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
here's the imperial decree.

593
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,280
His Majesty's daughter,
Princess Lang Ya, was

594
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,610
lost in chaos
like a pearl covered in dust.

595
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,900
Fortunately, with heaven's blessing

596
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,700
and the help
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

597
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,720
we were reunited.

598
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,140
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

599
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,740
nurtured the Princess
with great dedication.

600
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,750
He is hereby granted 500 taels of gold,

601
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,980
a bushel of pearls,

602
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,940
and the right to enter court
without bowing

603
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,270
or handing in his sword.

604
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,060
He is bestowed the title,
"Imperial Princess's Preceptor."

605
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,190
Tang Lici, Master of Wanqiao Chamber,

606
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,930
saved the Princess.

607
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,460
He is appointed
as the Court Gentleman for Consultation.

608
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,330
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

609
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,190
Master Shao.

610
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,220
Everyone, please rise.

611
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:44,780
Master Shao.

612
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,330
Yes.

613
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,140
This time,

614
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,960
His Majesty is so pleased to have

615
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,490
his beloved daughter back.

616
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,770
These are exceptional rewards
for the Sword Alliance.

617
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,430
As you know,

618
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,370
according to our agreement,

619
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,880
the court and jianghu
do not interfere with each other.

620
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,340
So in the future, it will still be that

621
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,550
jianghu matters are
only settled in the jianghu.

622
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,550
But rest assured.

623
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,900
This time, the court

624
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,830
will send more forces to assist you

625
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,710
in destroying the Fengliu Shop.

626
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,240
However,

627
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,060
we still need to rely

628
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,470
on the power
of your Central Plains Sword Alliance.

629
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,400
I understand.

630
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,990
Everyone,

631
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,970
out of deep concern about the Princess,

632
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,970
His Majesty has specially sent
the imperial palace's top martial artist,

633
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,040
General Yuchi, to assist you.

634
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,330
I've met with you all before.

635
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,460
My mission is to protect the Princess.

636
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,370
Though I'm in the Sword Alliance,

637
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,160
I only obey

638
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,650
the Princess's commands.

639
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,700
That won't do.

640
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,140
You also need to listen
to my master and Mr. Tang.

641
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,610
Master.

642
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,030
I have something to tell you.

643
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,140
Mind the etiquette.

644
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,880
I almost forgot

645
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
that you're a princess now.

646
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,460
So, would you like

647
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,980
to find a better master?

648
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,580
How could I ever
think of changing my master?

649
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
Look at you.

650
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,010
Don't be shy.

651
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,000
You used to be so unruly and carefree.

652
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm just teasing you.

653
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,540
Can't you tell that?

654
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,760
Your joke isn't

655
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,510
funny at all.

656
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,840
By the way, Master,

657
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,280
I've already informed His Majesty

658
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,880
that I'll continue serving

659
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,960
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief

660
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
to assist you at the Sword Alliance.

661
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,670
Why?

662
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,870
I won't forget your kindness

663
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,030
in raising me.

664
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,200
The Sword Alliance needs people now.

665
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,440
How could I leave?

666
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,150
Great.

667
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,740
I'm so happy.

668
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,800
I can finally be

669
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,060
of help to you, Master.

670
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,820
Come here.

671
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,010
Godfather.

672
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,450
Where is Palace Chief Wanyu?

673
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,310
He has already returned to Biluo Palace.

674
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
His Majesty heard

675
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,220
that Biluo Palace

676
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,450
played a crucial role

677
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,220
in rescuing the Princess.

678
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,880
Therefore,

679
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,180
he's been appointed as Chief Diviner
of the Imperial Observatory

680
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,610
and summoned to the capital
to meet His Majesty immediately.

681
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,610
Lici, you know,

682
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,010
I originally planned
to slack off and deliver

683
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,900
all the imperial decrees

684
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,160
at the Sword Alliance.

685
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,410
Now I'll have to ask you to pass on

686
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,430
the message to him.

687
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,910
Okay.

688
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,700
Lici.

689
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,700
The person
you asked me to investigate last time is

690
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,410
a prince from the previous dynasty.

691
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,530
If you know them,

692
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,380
don't get too deeply involved.

693
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,690
I see, Godfather.

694
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,930
You've always been prudent
in handling things.

695
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,740
I'm just giving you a small heads-up.

696
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,670
I can rest at ease

697
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,340
so long as you're aware of it.

698
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,970
Okay.

699
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,130
Mr. Tang.

700
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,180
Thank you.

701
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,010
If you hadn't written
to the Empress's father,

702
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,660
I couldn't have been

703
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,270
found by my mother

704
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,160
and become a princess.

705
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,460
Princess,

706
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,330
please don't mention it.

707
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,150
No need for formalities, Mr. Tang.

708
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,300
To be honest,

709
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,450
finding the lost imperial scion was

710
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,340
what I should do.

711
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,050
I feel

712
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,030
so happy for you.

713
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,530
It's been a while

714
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,590
since I had your dumplings last time.

715
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,970
You must be tired from your journey.

716
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,500
You're looking better now.

717
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,930
You too.

718
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,000
By the way,

719
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,190
where is Mr. Tang?

720
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,820
Mr. Tang is escorting Minister Tang
down the mountain.

721
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,750
Long time no see.

722
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,180
I've missed you all so much.

723
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,380
I've missed you, too.

724
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,220
Chi, Shen,

725
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,050
look who's here.

726
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,740
Seeing you in this outfit,

727
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,840
I'm really not used to it.

728
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,740
Not just you,

729
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,180
even I'm not quite used to it myself.

730
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,090
These clothes look really beautiful.

731
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,700
From now on,

732
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,090
you should always dress like this.

733
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,700
Really?

734
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,340
Beautiful.

735
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Thank you, Stone.

736
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,570
By the way,

737
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,490
during your visit to the imperial palace,

738
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,180
didn't the Emperor give you

739
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,700
any rewards?

740
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,990
Now that you mention it...

741
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,320
I have a gift

742
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
for Shen.

743
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,610
Me?

744
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,530
Violet Jade?

745
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,580
What's that?

746
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,960
The jade
from the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin.

747
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,220
I know Shen

748
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,260
has been looking for it all these years.

749
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,180
As it happens,

750
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,180
I heard it was taken back

751
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,570
to the imperial palace two years ago.

752
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,090
So

753
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,820
I asked my father for it.

754
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,530
Thank you.

755
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,610
It's so sweet of you, Princess.

756
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,610
Don't mention it.

757
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,740
Shen, you're so lucky.

758
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,440
Such a treasure...

759
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,830
Such a treasure is too good

760
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,210
for someone like you.

761
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,090
While someone like me is

762
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,380
still empty-handed. It's not good, is it?

763
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,380
What do you think?

764
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,940
What should I say?

765
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,900
I mean,

766
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,610
Princess, you've come from afar

767
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,570
and must be very tired.

768
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:04,740
Is there more?

769
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,660
Well,

770
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,610
I brought you a bolt

771
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,010
of deep red celestial silk,

772
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,860
plus a pair of matching bracelets.

773
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,650
Don't say I'm playing favorites.

774
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,850
I'm not a princess.

775
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,110
Why did you bring these for me?

776
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,220
The celestial silk is

777
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,900
made by the imperial palace's craftsmen.

778
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,070
Embroidered with gold thread,

779
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,990
it'll make

780
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,850
the most amazing wedding dress
in the world.

781
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,290
As for these matching bracelets,

782
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,820
if worn by a married couple,

783
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,460
they respond to each other
when they're close.

784
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,130
Give one of them to Miss Bai.

785
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,660
She'll definitely like it.

786
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,780
You truly are

787
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,670
my best friend.

788
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,730
I forgot you're a princess now.

789
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,870
I also brought gifts for Miss Shei,

790
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,090
Stone, Mr. Tang,

791
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,210
and Gu Xitan.

792
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,540
Thank you, Princess.

793
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Where is Gu Xitan?

794
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,740
What are you doing?

795
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,030
Why don't you go in?

796
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,860
Senior.

797
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,390
Why do I feel

798
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,960
that Zhong has changed

799
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,780
since she came back?

800
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,650
She's now a princess.

801
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Aren't you happy?

802
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,740
No.

803
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,510
Of course I'm happy.

804
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,570
Before Zhong joined the Sword Alliance,

805
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,630
she suffered a lot.

806
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,740
Now she has not only found

807
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,570
her parents

808
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,340
but also become a princess

809
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,400
loved by everyone.

810
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,490
Someone as strong-willed as her

811
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,820
has finally stepped into a bright future.

812
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,550
How could I not be happy for her?

813
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,020
But

814
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,100
she's drifting away from me.
