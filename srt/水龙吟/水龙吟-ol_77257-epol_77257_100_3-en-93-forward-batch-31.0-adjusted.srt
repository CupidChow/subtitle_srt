3
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,759
Cheng is already gone.

4
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,340
Why are you still lingering here?

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
You're free now.

6
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,120
Go wherever

7
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,509
you want to go.

8
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:20,710
Off you go.

9
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,570
Go!

10
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,060
Father,

11
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,290
this Yan Whistle is so hard to pick up.

12
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,560
Then I'll give you this wooden whistle.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,220
Before you learn
how to use the Yan Whistle,

14
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,139
just try this wooden one instead, alright?

15
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,200
Thank you, Father.

16
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,450
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,860
Get lost!

18
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,710
I've just lost my son.

19
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,440
I only want some time by myself.

20
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,520
I've been sickly since childhood.

21
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,760
When I was busking with my father
to make a living,

22
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,750
I once saw two wild geese that got lost.

23
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,079
They looked like a father and his son.

24
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,440
The northern land was freezing cold.

25
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
The old goose froze to death
on the mudflat.

26
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,340
The young goose

27
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,890
hovered around the old one's body,

28
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,079
over and over again,

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,970
until my father

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,610
dug a hole and buried the old goose.

31
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,160
We people of Yanmen all know

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,360
that wild geese are
the most affectionate creatures.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Yeah,

34
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,710
wild geese are truly affectionate.

35
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,510
When I saw those two geese,

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,760
it was already the last month of winter.

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,130
The young goose was too weak to fly south.

38
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,430
A few days later,

39
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,570
a cold wave suddenly swept in,

40
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,990
and it followed the old goose's path
and passed away.

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,680
That was just foolish filial piety.

Before Mr. Jiang passed away,

67
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,150
he was so concerned
about the Yanmen Sect's reputation

68
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,600
that he even sacrificed his own life
to protect it.

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,720
He cared about everything

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
that his father cared about

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,120
more than his own life.

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
Silly boy.

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,720
Why couldn't he understand

74
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,260
that his life

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,430
was actually what mattered most to me?

76
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,940
We all do what we believe is right

77
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,750
for the sake of our family.

78
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,320
But is that really good?

79
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,860
You also don't want to leave Yanmen

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,830
and me, right?

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,750

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680

86
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,300
nice to meet you.

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

88
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,430
Mr. Tang,

89
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,320
what's wrong?

90
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

91
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,240
Isn't it?

92
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,210
My friend just passed away.

94
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm not in the mood

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,330
to appreciate the scenery yet.

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,760
Mr. Tang, I heard that you

97
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,990
were the last person

98
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,810
to see Jiang Cheng before his death.

99
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,240
Before Jiang Cheng passed away,

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,950
I was indeed

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,450
the only one by his side.

102
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,480
Master Jiang is suffering
from the sudden loss of his son.

103
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,540
He had you arrested

104
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,230
and put you through all this.

105
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,510
I hope you won't mind.

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Mr. Feng, that's so kind of you.

107
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,480
Haven't they told you

108
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,830
that I've already confessed

109
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,160
to killing Jiang Cheng?

110
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,510
I brought this upon myself.

111
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,860
It's just fair.

112
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,080
I don't know

113
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,240
why you would take

114
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,500
such blame upon yourself,

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,980
but...

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Judging by what you said,

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,950
you're so sure

118
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,520
that I'm not the killer?

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,310
Yes.

120
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,700
Because you were not

121
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,909
the one who poisoned him.

122
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,159
Why did they

123
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,820
release us?

124
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,970
What happened?

125
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,270
Because Mr. Feng

126
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,540
vouched for Mr. Tang.

127
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,760
Master Jiang's got no trust in us,

128
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,240
but plenty in Mr. Feng.

129
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,430
You mean

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Feng Chuanxiang, the one who went missing?

131
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,630
Yes.

132
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,000
I suppose the news of his disappearance

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
was just a rumor.

134
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,830
But thankfully, he arrived in time.

135
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,160
Things turned out fine.

136
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,180
I came here

137
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,040
to catch the real culprit

138
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,090
and avenge my friend's death.

139
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,580
Please help me, Mr. Tang.

140
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,400
What's in it for me?

141
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,110
If we catch the real culprit,

142
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,510
you'll naturally be cleared of suspicion.

143
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,490
That's not a benefit.

144
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,360
Indeed.

145
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,300
Even if I hadn't appeared,

146
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,720
you'd still find a way to escape for sure.

147
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,060
But from what I know,

148
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,909
Mr. Tang,

149
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,320
you were first involved

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,200
in the massacre of Hao Wenhou's family.

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,510
After leaving the temple,

152
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,120
you soon became

153
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,179
the prime suspect in Cheng's murder.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,970
Mr. Tang,

155
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,740
even if you escape from Yanmen,

156
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,720
how can you be sure it won't happen again?

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Do you really want

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,750
to leave a trail of false accusations

159
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,720
wherever you go

160
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,870
and end up
as an enemy of the whole jianghu?

161
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,960
Mr. Feng,

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
you sure are well-informed.

163
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,400
After all these years in the jianghu,

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,720
I've made quite a few friends.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,250
If you have so many friends,

166
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,680
why do you specifically ask for my help?

167
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,540
Because this time, the enemy is

168
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,750
way more powerful than we thought.

169
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,470
"We"?

170
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,300
Yes,

171
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,300
we.

172
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,630
I believe

173
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,960
we have a common enemy.

174
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,850
Chi.

175
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,980
You're awake.

176
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,640
Where are

177
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,620
those damn brutes from the Yanmen Sect?

178
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,880
Master Jiang's taken the Yanmen disciples

179
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
back already.

180
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,980
They just left?

181
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,750
So easily?

182
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,750
Before Master Jiang left,

183
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,810
he set a condition.

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,260
Within seven days,

185
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,790
Mr. Tang must help Mr. Feng

186
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,000
investigate how Young Master Jiang

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,150
ended up taking the Blood Ghost Pill

188
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,960
and figure out the truth

189
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,090
for the Yanmen Sect.

190
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,050
I'll go ask him about it.

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I can only drink this much today.

192
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,120
If Jiang Cheng were still alive,

193
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,890
we would definitely
share another pot of wine with you

194
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,750
and drink to our hearts' content.

195
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,010
I didn't expect

196
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
you to hold

197
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,370
your liquor so well.

198
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,260
I'm not much of a drinker.

199
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,790
It's just that when drinking
with a kindred spirit,

200
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,190
even a thousand cups of wine are
not enough.

201
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,580
Really?

202
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,760
You two just met each other,

203
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,050
and now you're already kindred spirits?

204
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,030
I never knew that you, Foxy Tang,

205
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,970
were so passionate about making friends.

206
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,640
Mr. Chi.

207
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,020
Don't call me that.

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,700
Just call me Chi Yun.

209
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,800
Or

210
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,490
Master Chi,

211
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,350
Chief Chi,

212
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,510
any of those will do.

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,630
Alright.

214
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,400
We still have things to do today.

215
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,620
We need some good tea

216
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,430
to sober up.

217
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,080
Indeed, you're right.

218
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,030
But I

219
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,610
don't have any tea with me.

220
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,470
Now

221
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,010
it's not appropriate
to ask Master Jiang for some.

222
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,070
Don't worry, Feng.

223
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,190
I have some.

224
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,280
Chi Yun,

225
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
serve the tea.

226
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,170
You want me

227
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,150
to pour tea for him?

228
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,010
Are you reluctant to do it?

229
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,250
I refuse.

230
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,380
Fine.

231
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,830
It hurts again?

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,740
Then why did you drink so much?

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,870
Why did you act

234
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,910
all buddy-buddy with a stranger

235
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,360
who came out of nowhere?

236
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,550
So

237
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,200
I want some good tea

238
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,240
to sober up.

239
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,260
You sly fox.

240
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,330
Just a minute.

241
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,650
I'm just that petty.

242
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,510
In the jianghu,

243
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,390
kindred spirits are rare to meet,

244
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,250
and true friends are hard to find.

245
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,170
You two...

246
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,130
Feng, you're mistaken.

247
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,670
He's not my friend,

248
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,910
but my servant.

249
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,940
Servant?

250
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,840
This is his contract of servitude.

251
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,760
Mr. Feng,

252
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm merely a lowly servant.

253
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,460
How could I possibly deserve
to befriend Foxy Tang?

254
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,320
Drink it.

255
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,630
This is the private joke

256
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,160
between Cloud and Mr. Tang.

257
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,950
I shall not comment on it.

258
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,310
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

259
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,070
Thank you,

260
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,510
Cloud.

261
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,100
This is yours.

262
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
Sorry for that, Feng.

263
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,630
Miss Shei,

264
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,230
you've fitted in quite well.

265
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,910
These are just some chores
within my ability.

266
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,290
Now that things have settled down,

267
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,290
we should sit down

268
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,320
and have a good, hearty meal.

269
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,720
You're right.

270
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
That's what we should do.

271
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,910
Then let me help out, too.

272
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,650
Miss Zhong.

273
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,580
Your nose.

274
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,780
Let me help you.

275
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,680
There, done.

276
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,380
Thank you, Miss Shei.

277
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,490
I'd better not get in the way.

278
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,550
It's fine.

279
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,670
Miss Zhong, I'm already so happy

280
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,320
that you're willing to stay here with me.

281
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,410
Your hands

282
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,150
are meant to fight evil.

283
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,270
Just let me do these things.

284
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,760
In just a few days,

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,660
so many things have happened.

286
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,960
You, a lone orphan girl,
have wandered so far.

287
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,020
You must've suffered a lot.

288
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,720
I used to travel with my father,
busking for a living.

289
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,080
We've endured countless hardships.

290
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,200
Now I can

291
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,670
stay in such a safe place

292
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,510
with warm clothes and abundant food.

293
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,980
I'm already very fortunate.

294
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,620
Besides,

295
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,990
I can experience things

296
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,910
that I've never

297
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,910
seen before.

298
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,570
Yes.

299
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,370
I once thought

300
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,390
my trip down the mountain

301
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,300
representing
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

302
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,210
would be easy.

303
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,620
It turned out that I was too naive.

304
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,740
Speaking of which,

305
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm grateful to have met all of you.

306
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,740
Thanks to you guys,

307
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,500
all these tangled clues

308
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,240
have gradually come to light.

309
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,470
And Master Tang.

310
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,260
Although his way
of doing things is quite wild,

311
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,320
it often yields remarkable results.

312
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
It's truly admirable.

313
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,330
Indeed.

314
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,380
Mr. Tang

315
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,080
is a very special person.

316
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
If you asked me a few days ago,

317
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,590
I couldn't imagine

318
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,000
that instead of being trapped

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
in seclusion in the Hao Residence forever,

320
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
I'd be with a crew of wandering heroes,

321
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
going on adventures in the jianghu.

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,670
Miss Zhong,

323
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,320
I owe all this to you

324
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
for saving me.

325
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,070
Don't mention it.

326
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,910
Actually,

327
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,390
I've seen

328
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,630
a lot in the Jianghu.

329
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,270
But I've never had

330
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,400
such a special experience as this one.

331
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,730
It's thrilling

332
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,140
with twists and turns.

333
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
I hope to uncover the truth soon

334
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,630
and return to the Sword Alliance
with credits,

335
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,700
living up to my master's expectations.

336
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,550
Yet I also wish

337
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,480
to delay our parting.

338
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Feng, you just mentioned

339
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,940
a beautiful scenic spot

340
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,750
where you and Jiang Cheng

341
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,760
live in seclusion. Where is it?

342
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,750
At the end of Huaxi Stream,

343
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,810
beside Feng Cliff,

344
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,310
it's the Liulian Cottage.

345
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,320
After we fulfill

346
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,540
our seven-day agreement with Master Jiang,

347
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,970
you can feel free to visit

348
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,480
my humble abode anytime

349
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,540
with your friends.

350
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,760
Liulian Cottage.

351
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,240
Feng,

352
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
I have never seen

353
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,840
the morning view of Yan River.

354
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,640
Would you like

355
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,000
to accompany me to the bow for a look?

356
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,210
With pleasure.

357
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,260
The warm and gentle morning light.

358
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,870
What an amazing view.

359
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,580
Such a beautiful scene

360
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,530
is perfect...

361
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,300
It's perfect to wake people up.

362
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,310
Mr. Tang, what are you doing?

363
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,820
Breaking my promise.

364
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,550
Foxy Tang,

365
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,420
what's happening?

366
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,360
Mr. Feng,

367
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,230
I've heard your story.

368
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,900
I'm somewhat interested,

369
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,630
but not much.

370
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,060
It's not worth the effort
I have to put in.

371
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,750
I thought

372
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,540
you were someone

373
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,950
who cared about friends, Mr. Tang.

374
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,290
I have no friends,

375
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,040
so how would I care about them?

376
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,550
Mr. Feng,

377
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,890
you got me wrong.

378
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,790
But Mr. Tang...

379
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,790
No buts.

380
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,960
He already told you

381
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
he has no friends.

382
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,310
You want to be friends

383
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,140
with this heartless fox?

384
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,510
You'll be eaten down to the bones

385
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,110
and die without knowing why!

386
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,710
Mr. Tang!

387
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,310
Just say whatever you want.

388
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,040
What was that just now?

389
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,510
Weren't you two
getting along well last night?

390
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,440
Why did things suddenly turn sour?

391
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,240
That day, Jiang Cheng told me

392
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,640
that the first person

393
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,700
who made him take the Blood Ghost Pill

394
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,560
was Feng Chuanxiang.

395
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,280
No way!

396
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,770
Weren't they sworn brothers?

397
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,400
Chi Yun,

398
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,520
you've always hated evil guys.

399
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,320
I was afraid you couldn't hold back.

400
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,340
Yeah, I can't stand someone

401
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,740
who betrayed his friend.

402
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm going after him to check it out.

403
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,100
If he really poisoned Jiang Cheng,

404
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
I'll kill him right away!

405
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,140
Where is Chi Yun going?

406
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,110
Miss Shei,

407
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,200
I need to follow him and take a look.

408
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,230
I believe

409
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,260
we have a common enemy.

410
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,690
What do you want to ask?

411
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,130
Sir, if you wanted Chi

412
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,240
to follow Mr. Feng,

413
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,640
why didn't you say it directly?

414
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,270
Being instructed by others
and taking initiative on one's own

415
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,230
might seem the same to others.

416
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,030
But for Chi Yun,

417
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,490
there's a big difference.

418
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Most of the time,

419
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,340
I prefer to let him maintain

420
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,690
a pleasant mood.

421
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,780
I thought

422
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
you would ask another question.

423
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,290
What?

424
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,780
The hand.

425
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,210
Yesterday,

426
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,550
you saw me get injured

427
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,420
and saw the wound heal with your own eyes.

428
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,490
Aren't you curious?

429
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,820
I just think

430
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,680
that maybe

431
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,550
everyone has

432
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,680
secrets they want to keep from others.

433
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,570
You're very clever, miss,

434
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,030
but unfortunately,

435
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
you've overlooked

436
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,190
a very important fact.

437
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
Chi Yun and Ms. Zhong

438
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,980
have both left the ship to track someone.

439
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,990
Now, there are

440
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,770
only you and me left on this ship.

441
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,090
Miss Shei,

442
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,920
didn't the person

443
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,320
who sent you ever tell you

444
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,110
how dangerous Tang Lici is?

445
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,440
Miss Shei,

446
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,030
you are

447
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,930
the only survivor from the Hao Residence,

448
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,670
as well as the witness chosen by Liu Yan.

449
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,190
Tell me

450
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,930
why my friend Liu Yan

451
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,670
chose you?

452
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,400
I don't know,

453
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,350
Mr. Tang.

454
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,210
I was being rude.

456
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,920
Mr. Tang,

457
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,880
your apology

458
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,270
isn't sincere at all.

459
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,310
Because you don't care

460
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,910
whether I forgive you or not.

461
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,090
To get the truth you want,

462
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,110
you even

463
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,440
tested me in the most brutal way

464
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,410
without a care

465
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,700
for others' feelings.

466
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,160
Yet someone like you

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,720
is willing to meddle

468
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,920
in the affairs of Mr. Feng and Mr. Jiang.

469
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,770
Could you tell me

470
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,190
why?

471
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,660
Liu Yan did leave you by my side

472
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,110
for some reason.

473
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,340
What?

474
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,010
Come with me.

475
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,200
Where is he?

476
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,050
He should be around here.

477
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,880
Mr. Feng!

478
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,980
Mr. Jiang.

479
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,240
Mr. Feng,

480
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,140
how did you fall into the water?

481
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:08,580
Come on,

482
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
sit down quickly.

483
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,490
Here you are.

484
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,200
Put this on.

485
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Jiang Qingyu?

486
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,960
Why is he here?

487
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,630
Mr. Feng,

488
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,620
how did you end up in the water?

489
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,010
Also,

490
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,930
where's Mr. Tang?

491
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,960
Mr. Tang suddenly turned against me

492
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,090
and backed out of our cooperation.

493
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,550
So

494
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,020
he used you and then abandoned you?

495
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,980
Mr. Jiang,

496
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,130
what brings you here?

497
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm here

498
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,790
for Cheng's case.

499
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,340
Given what you said yesterday,

500
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,160
there's more behind Cheng's taking

501
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,070
that evil pill?

502
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,970
That's right.

503
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,930
I suspect

504
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,660
that he was poisoned.

505
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,010
What?

506
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Darn it.

507
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,700
How despicable!

508
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,090
What do you plan to do next, Mr. Feng?

509
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,650
Jiang Cheng was my best friend.

510
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,170
I will definitely

511
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,150
bring the poisoner to justice

512
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,420
and make him pay with his life.

513
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Cheng was fortunate to have a friend

514
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,720
like you, Mr. Feng.

515
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,440
Would you allow me to come along

516
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,200
with you?

517
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,650
Our Yanmen Sect

518
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,110
has some connections

519
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,850
in both legal and underworld communities.

520
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,050
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

521
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,120
That would be perfect.

522
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,580
Let's go then.

523
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,730
We should hurry and find a place

524
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,310
to dry your clothes first.

525
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:26,800
Let's go.

526
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,200
Okay.

527
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,350
Forget about whether Feng Chuanxiang

528
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,610
is suspicious for now.

529
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,310
Why is Mr. Jiang Qingyu
even more dedicated to it

530
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,840
than Jiang Cheng's father?

531
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,410
Something's off.

532
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
I need to look into it.

533
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,660
What are you doing? Are you going bonkers?

534
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,650
Keep up.

535
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,370
Where are we?

536
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,490
Huaxi.

537
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,720
The place where Young Mr. Jiang

538
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,270
and Mr. Feng once lived.

539
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,640
Mr. Tang,

540
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,200
didn't you say

541
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,730
you wouldn't help Mr. Feng?

542
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
Or are you planning

543
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,280
to split up with Chi Yun

544
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,480
and investigate the case

545
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
about Young Master Jiang together?

546
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,270
You were right about the beginning,

547
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,800
but wrong about the ending.

548
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,270
I did break

549
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,000
my promise to Feng Chuanxiang.

550
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,750
However,

551
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,140
I came here

552
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,310
because Shisan Tower

553
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,640
revealed the clues leading to this place.

554
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,360
[Jin Hua Yin]

555
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,270
Sorry for the delay.

556
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,720
Sirs,

557
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,610
here's your tea.

558
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,160
Since we know

559
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,220
he's the poisoner,

560
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,700
why don't we arrest him?

561
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I am impatient,

562
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,710
but I'm not a fool.

563
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,460
My keen instincts

564
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,170
tell me

565
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,510
that something fishy is going on here.

566
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,680
Mr. Feng,

567
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,680
my big brother is hot-tempered.

568
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,440
If he finds out

569
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,590
that you let Tang Lici escape...

570
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,000
Sir!

571
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,550
He might

572
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,550
do crazy things.

573
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,720
Alright!

574
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,100
Mr. Jiang, have you figured out

575
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,900
a better plan?

576
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,320
Shisan Tower? What kind of place is that?

577
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,970
A place
where you can find answers to everything.

578
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,790
Shisan Tower has the world's

579
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,320
most formidable assassins

580
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,160
and the most comprehensive intelligence
in the jianghu.

581
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
But you need to afford the price.

582
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
Then where is this tower?

583
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,440
Shisan Tower's location is so mysterious

584
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,170
that few in the jianghu know it.

585
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,720
But if you wish to make a deal with them,

586
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,450
you should go to their outpost,

587
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,270
Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

588
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,300
[Floating Abyss]

589
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,410
If you still want to keep
these eyes of yours,

590
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,030
I suggest you stop looking
where you shouldn't.

591
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,230
I've heard that the Fallen Shisan Tower

592
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,530
has the most skilled assassins
in the world

593
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,270
and the most comprehensive information.

594
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,830
So this must be

595
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,490
the Floating Abyss of Buhuan Tower.

596
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,920
Then where is the Fallen Shisan Tower?

597
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Ms. Zhong,

598
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
do you know why

599
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,850
it's called the Floating Abyss
of Buhuan Tower?

600
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,310
That's because this place

601
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,850
really floats.

602
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,620
What does that mean?

603
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,590
On the fifteenth of every month,

604
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,050
which happens to be today,

605
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,890
which happens to be right now.

606
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,380
[Floating Abyss, Buhuan Tower]

607
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,410
It will rise from this part of the river.

608
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,030
That's when

609
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,690
you can go up this Buhuan Tower

610
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,220
to make a deal
with the Fallen Shisan Tower.

611
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,930
As for seeing

612
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,220
the real Shisan Tower,

613
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,010
your qualifications

614
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,100
are not enough yet.

615
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,780
Come on,

616
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,980
why must I lie in a coffin?

617
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,910
I don't understand.

618
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,390
If that's the case,

619
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,270
Mr. Tang,

620
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,060
why don't you go directly to Shisan Tower

621
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,960
to buy the truth about Young Master Jiang

622
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,200
and Mr. Feng?

623
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,870
Liu Yan arranged all these incidents

624
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,210
just to make me, while being pushed

625
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,070
by the Yanmen Sect relentlessly,

626
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,030
have no choice

627
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,600
but to go to Shisan Tower again
to buy information

628
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,930
and prove my innocence.

629
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,460
But I surrendered willingly.

630
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,860
This disrupted his plan.

631
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:20,940
So

632
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,170
he sent Feng Chuanxiang.

633
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,270
As long as I don't play along

634
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,550
with his plan,

635
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,890
he just can't win this round.

636
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
So that's why you

637
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,240
kicked Mr. Feng into the water.

638
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,590
But why would Mr. Feng

639
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,480
take orders from Liu Yan?

640
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,440
That's

641
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,970
the purpose of our journey.

642
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,890
The affairs in the jianghu

643
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,510
are truly bewildering

644
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,480
and creepy.

645
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,280
Sorry for the interruption.

646
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,080
When entering someone's home,

647
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,460
it's only polite to announce yourself.

648
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,220
[The flowers and the moon
decorate the river with breezes]

649
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,610
In your opinion,

650
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,110
between Jiang Cheng and Feng Chuanxiang,

651
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,940
which one was telling the truth?

652
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Jiang Cheng said

653
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,480
Feng Chuanxiang poisoned him.

654
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,240
A person might lie

655
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,310
at any time,

656
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,080
but they would never lie at death's door,

657
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,600
especially about their unfulfilled wishes.

658
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,360
Mr. Tang...

659
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,310
Therefore,

660
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,500
Jiang Cheng's words must be true.

661
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,920
As for Feng Chuanxiang,

662
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,030
he can lie,

663
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,240
and he can hide

664
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,350
hatred and murderous intent

665
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,110
in a clever way

666
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,240
to go undetected.

667
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,020
But a place where someone has lived

668
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
for a long time

669
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,110
will leave traces,
and those traces tell the truth.

670
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,850
Especially when it comes to friendship.

671
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,660
Even if one can fake it for a day

672
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,070
or for ten days,

673
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,140
how could he possibly pretend

674
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
every single day?

675
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,000
The flowers and the moon decorate
the river (Jiang) with breezes (Feng).

676
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,810
They both

677
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,590
told the truth.

678
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,650
But what kind of misunderstanding

679
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,260
could make such good friends

680
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,400
unable to talk it over face-to-face?

681
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,110
Since they both

682
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,970
told the truth,

683
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,140
there must be a misunderstanding

684
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,750
they couldn't talk about,

685
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,090
nor was there a chance to explain.

686
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,970
When suppressing the poison
for Jiang Cheng,

687
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,820
I found that the toxins
had accumulated in his body

688
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,120
for possibly more than a year.

689
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,760
Therefore, over six months ago,

690
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,290
when Jiang Cheng came
to see Feng Chuanxiang,

691
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,510
he was already poisoned

692
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,970
with the Blood Ghost Pill.

693
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,920
But he himself

694
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,720
was completely unaware of this.

695
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,120
In order to help

696
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,780
delay the poison's outbreak,

697
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,810
Feng Chuanxiang

698
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,250
had to make him
keep taking the evil pills

699
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,850
by mixing them into his food in secret.

700
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,190
Unfortunately,

701
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,870
Jiang Cheng happened to witness this.

702
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,030
So

703
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,080
a misunderstanding arose.

704
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,510
I was already wondering

705
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,960
why Shisan Tower sent clues

706
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,570
about Liulian Cottage's murder

707
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,300
after the Hao family massacre.

708
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,140
Now I'm even more convinced

709
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,530
that from the very beginning,

710
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,590
not a single thing was coincidental.

711
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,310
But

712
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,200
you already knew

713
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,670
that everything they said was true.

714
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,310
You also knew
that your getting involved in this

715
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
was part of Liu Yan's plan.

716
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,510
Why

717
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,840
did you still come here?

718
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,410
All of this is merely

719
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,370
my speculation.

720
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,950
As for whether it's true or not,

721
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,350
and whether to join the game
or overturn it,

722
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,390
I'll find out once I investigate.

723
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,850
Tang Lici,

724
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,010
you're doing very well.

725
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,890
Tonight's guests of Buhuan Tower

726
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,290
have all arrived, right?

727
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,890
You know what to do.

728
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,670
Trade for hands!

729
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,540
Sell one of your hands

730
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,680
for whatever information you want.

731
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,740
What is this place?

732
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,640
Why is there a market here?

733
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,070
This is

734
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,990
the black market
in Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

735
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,600
If ordinary people want help
from Shisan Tower,

736
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
they must first come to the Floating Abyss

737
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,130
and find the Porter.

738
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,200
But not everyone is qualified

739
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,270
to meet the Porter.

740
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Over time,

741
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,970
a black market has formed here.

742
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,400
Those who aren't qualified

743
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
to meet the Porter

744
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,640
can still

745
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,990
buy what they want here.

746
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,780
It's way too crowded here.

747
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,210
And they're all wearing
the same black cloaks.

748
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,410
Chi Yun, walk faster.

749
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,530
Don't lose them.

750
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,070
Oh, no, they really disappeared.

751
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,690
Calm down.

752
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,990
When the time comes,

753
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,310
we'll meet them

754
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,240
near the Porter.

755
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,270
Wait,

756
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,050
didn't you just say

757
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,830
not everyone is qualified

758
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,890
to meet the Porter?

759
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,400
Feng Chuanxiang had been missing
for so long.

760
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,590
Is it weird that Shisan Tower is

761
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,570
interested in him?

762
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,370
What about us?

763
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,720
Why would the Porter

764
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
choose us as well?

765
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,090
At this point,

766
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,490
I might as well tell you.

767
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,060
What?

768
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,410
Fiancée?

769
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,480
I am the handsome and charming Cloud.

770
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,660
Is it weird that a woman likes me?

771
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,790
Then may I ask who

772
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,920
your fiancée is?

773
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,870
Bai Suche.

774
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,570
Bai Suche?

775
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,920
You mean the one
known as the most beautiful woman

776
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
in Jiangnan, the elegant Bai Suche?

777
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,370
What's with that look?

778
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,989
Nothing.

779
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,060
Your expression clearly says,

780
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,840
"How would that elegant beauty

781
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,440
marry someone like you?"

782
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,969
Exactly!

783
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,679
How would she ever agree to marry you?

784
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,110
A few years ago, I

785
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,550
went to Jiangnan, performing heroic deeds

786
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,350
and saving Bai Yuming's family.

787
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,179
He liked me so much

788
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,909
that he insisted on marrying off
his daughter to me.

789
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,130
What's wrong with this?

790
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,520
Wait.

791
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,969
Are you saying

792
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
that Master Bai

793
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,820
insisted on betrothing his daughter
to you?

794
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,520
Instead of me desperately asking

795
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,449
to marry into their family, right?

796
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,239
That's not what I meant.

797
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,520
I just think

798
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:17,360
that since Master Bai is a descendant
of the Calligraphy Saint,

799
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,110
if you're

800
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,920
Master Bai's son-in-law,

801
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,190
you should at least share his interests.

802
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,280
But I'm just

803
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,679
an underworld gangster.

804
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,429
So what?

805
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,699
Yeah,

806
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,870
you're right.

807
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,550
You, Cloud, are the hope
of the underworld.

808
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,810
Just eat your cake.

809
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,430
The Bai's Estate

810
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,530
suffered a massacre a year ago, right?

811
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,280
Indeed, they were massacred.

812
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,150
But no one's found

813
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,420
my fiancée's body in the estate.

814
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,720
I've always believed

815
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,770
that she's still alive somewhere.

816
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,050
But

817
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,330
that doesn't make sense.

818
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,460
After all you've said,

819
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,580
you still haven't explained why

820
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,540
we'll definitely be chosen by the Porter.

821
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,040
Because I came to look for my fiancée,

822
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,810
who hadn't

823
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,700
married me yet,

824
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,700
and bought information from Shisan Tower.

825
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,670
Who knew this Shisan Tower

826
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,800
was all about scams?

827
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,390
They saw how desperate I was
to find my wife

828
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,880
and demanded

829
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,340
a price I couldn't afford.

830
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,630
In the end, I didn't find my wife

831
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,760
and even got myself sold
to the Shisan Tower.

832
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,150
If that damn Foxy Tang hadn't

833
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,210
happened to pass by

834
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,970
with a contract claiming ownership of me,

835
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,490
saying that I was already sold to him

836
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,030
and couldn't be sold
to Shisan Tower again.

837
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,370
Between getting sold
to the Fallen Shisan Tower

838
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,490
or to Foxy Tang,

839
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,920
it was quite obvious

840
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,380
which one I'd pick, right?

841
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,760
When the Porter sees me

842
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,690
back here again,

843
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,440
he definitely won't let me go.

844
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,050
Mr. Tang,

845
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,540
the road ends here.

846
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,710
We've searched everywhere possible.

847
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,710
If we've already searched

848
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,870
all possible places,

849
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,330
then it must be right here.

850
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,930
Shei,

851
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
are there really

852
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,590
friends in this world

853
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,360
you can trust with your life?

854
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,090
You go to Yanmen
with the messenger goose first.

855
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,860
I will

856
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,790
go there for a thorough investigation.

857
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Mr. Tang!

858
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,110
[Floating Red Worm Silk]

859
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,450
Please feel free to take a look.

860
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,520
It's just one year of your lifespan.

861
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,120
What are you hesitating for?

862
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,450
The porter carries weight on both ends.

863
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,280
One end succeeds, one end fails.

864
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,050
Welcome, everyone, to Buhuan Tower.

865
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,970
May I ask which guest

866
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,600
will make the first bid?

867
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,710
Me.

868
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,550
What is your offer?

869
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,730
A pair of sorrowful eyes.

870
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,670
Three fingers filled with hatred.

871
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,720
Five drops of blood from my heart.

872
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,120
Ten years of freedom.

873
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,850
What are you trying to exchange for?

874
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,750
The real culprit.

875
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,590
Carrying pole,

876
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,210
what do you think?

877
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,600
Sir.

878
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,580
Your chips aren't enough, I'm afraid.

879
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,460
Unless...

880
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,030
Unless what?

881
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,520
Unless you exchange your life for it!

882
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,010
Mr. Jiang, what are you doing?

883
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,790
I'm trying to kill you.

884
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,440
You're the one

885
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,100
bringing it upon yourself.

886
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,850
According to my plan,

887
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,090
after Cheng died
and the murderer confessed,

888
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,800
my brother's furious actions

889
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,660
would offend
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

890
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,000
And then I would rightfully

891
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,490
become the master of the Yanmen Sect.

892
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,230
This wonderful

893
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,960
dream-come-true moment

894
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,250
was ruined

895
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,810
by your sudden appearance.

896
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,790
I paid a hefty price

897
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,360
to Shisan Tower's Master

898
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,960
for a chance to kill you.

899
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,110
Here and now,

900
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,510
no one will

901
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,800
step in and help you.

902
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,970
Today,

903
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,770
you're doomed to die.

904
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,240
Mr. Tang,

905
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,650
I want to find Chuanxiang

906
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,480
and ask him

907
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,690
why he wanted to kill me.

908
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,920
We used to be best friends
who would die for each other.

909
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,720
Why are we turning on each other?

910
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,960
If someone kills people because of me,

911
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,110
if innocents suffer because of me,

912
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,280
does that make it my karma?

913
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,450
Tang Lici, do you see now?

914
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,550
Such a tiny pill

915
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,480
can turn the best friends

916
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,640
into bitter enemies

917
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,440
and make family members
betray and kill each other.

918
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,480
Who can resist the temptation

919
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,960
of overnight wealth, glory,

920
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,880
and unparalleled martial arts?

921
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,030
I have already spread it

922
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,800
throughout the martial arts world.

923
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,280
It has returned to this world

924
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,550
all because of you,

925
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,070
Tang Lici.

926
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,960
This time,

927
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
I'll make you wish you were dead.

928
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,110
Let your friends be your warning.

929
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,170
It's their fault
for trusting the wrong person.

930
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:34,730
You

931
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,070
can't save them.

932
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,670
Liu Yan's curse bug?

933
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,980
I can't save them?

934
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,820
But Liu Yan,

935
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,810
I'm looking for you.

936
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,750
Yanmen.
