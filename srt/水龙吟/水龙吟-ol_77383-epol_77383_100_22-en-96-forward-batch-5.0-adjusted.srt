I'm too old to be reading

175
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,220
this now?

176
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,420
No, no.

177
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,800
He who reflects on the past
and gains insight from it is fit to teach.

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,860
Didn't you take Stone

179
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
as your disciple?

180
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,550
Teaching him the Three Character Classic

181
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,230
is perfect.

182
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm just teaching him a few characters.

183
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
He's hardly my disciple.

184
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
If you say so,

185
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,570
then he's not.

186
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,550
Master Shao, you look

187
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,060
so worried and gloomy again.

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,150
Is something important troubling you?

189
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,150
I received a message from Master Ji.

190
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,460
He said it's been rather unsettled
out there recently.

191
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,630
Several of our disciples

192
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,030
who were away on missions

193
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,430
were brutally killed by the Fengliu Shop.

194
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,090
More than 10 have been killed.

195
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,430
I'll go back and practice as well.

196
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,060
Alright.

197
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,910
This killing method

198
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,280
doesn't seem like Fengliu Shop's work,

199
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,420
but more like an assassin's technique.

200
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,020
Sixth Sword Master, well...

201
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,790
Unable to confront us directly,

202
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,760
they've resorted to assassination.

203
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,930
This is outrageous.

204
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,650
Send a message to Master Shao immediately.

205
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,180
Yes!

206
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,780
It's a trap.

207
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,320
Exactly.

208
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,970
They deliberately chose
this moment to strike—

209
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,180
it's a trap meant

210
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,100
to provoke us.

211
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,630
I'm afraid their hidden agenda

212
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,050
is more complex than it seems.

213
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,520
Also,

214
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,860
there are some rumors

215
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,120
circulating within the Sword Alliance.

216
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,580
However,

217
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,270
I'm already tracking down

218
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,800
the source of those rumors.

219
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,210
Master Shao, do you know...

220
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,510
a fortune-teller has joined

221
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,770
the alliance recently, and he's

222
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,470
-doing odd jobs in the Service Hall?
-After Mr. Tang came here,

223
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,200
though your basic needs
are well provided for...

224
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,200
have your lives...

225
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,460
truly gotten better?

226
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,580
Fengliu Shop keeps attacking

227
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,590
you alliance disciples.

228
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,920
Are you just going to swallow this insult?

229
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,880
Perhaps Mr. Tang is

230
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,310
making careful plans.

231
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,220
Plans?

232
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,390
What kind of plans?

233
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,940
That we don't know.

234
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
But I believe Mr. Tang

235
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,080
certainly won't stand by and do nothing.

236
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,780
Indeed.

237
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,310
Since he keeps saying

238
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,550
he wants to eliminate Fengliu Shop,

239
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,980
why does he only teach you

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
lightness skills for escape

241
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,330
and sword formations
that merely delay enemies?

242
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,890
No matter how well-coordinated
your sword formations are,

243
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,860
can they allow you to take the initiative

244
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,460
and eliminate Fengliu Shop?

245
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Or can they protect you

246
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,230
from enemy ambushes when you're alone?

247
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,180
That makes some sense.

248
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,640
Indeed.

249
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,730
I can't dispute that.

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,570
I've heard about it.

251
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,910
What?

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,210
Is there something wrong with him?

253
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,050
A serious one.

254
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,910
Then...

255
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
I'll have someone

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,170
bring him to see you?

257
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,370
No rush.

258
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,300
When Chi Yun returns,

259
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,710
I'll find him myself.

260
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,270
I hear it.

261
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,810
Someone is calling my name.

262
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,650
Are you

263
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,740
really

264
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,080
desperately

265
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,710
in need of me right now?

266
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,550
The capable bear more work.

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,630
I guess I'll have to do you a favor

268
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,230
and run this errand for you, Foxy Tang.

269
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,890
You seem quite happy about it.

270
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,220
I just find it strange—

271
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,220
since Mr. Tang has
unmatched martial arts skills,

272
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,750
why doesn't he teach those skills

273
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,060
to each one of us?

274
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,220
If we all improve even a little,

275
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,100
when the final battle
with Fengliu Shop comes,

276
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,180
each of us could

277
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,580
contribute more, right?

278
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,980
Mr. Tang probably

279
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,310
wouldn't need that extra help, would he?

280
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,390
Am I right?

281
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,060
-Yes.
-Yeah.

282
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,460
That's right.

283
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,180
Indeed.

284
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,440
Well, Mr. Tang is so confident

285
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,910
that he's staking everything

286
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,910
on himself alone.

287
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,580
What if

288
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,630
he never actually intended to

289
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,350
destroy Fengliu Shop in the first place?

290
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,080
Wouldn't we all be doomed then?

291
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,670
Use your brains, guys.

292
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,550
How impressive

293
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,810
that you possess such insight, Mr. Fang.

294
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,070
Mr. Tang.

295
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,100
-Mr. Tang
-Mr. Tang.

296
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,820
Mr. Tang.

297
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,700
Mr. Tang.

298
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,150
With everyone watching,

299
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,700
surely you wouldn't kill me

300
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,940
over a few unpleasant words,

301
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,270
would you?

302
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,460
Let's go. Let's go.

303
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,860
-Let's go.
-We should go.

304
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,870
Here to greet me?

305
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,770
[Master of Fate; Divine Fortune Teller]

306
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,340
Mr. Fang, it seems

307
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,670
you still don't enjoy

308
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,600
your duties at the Sword Alliance.

309
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,450
Not at all.

310
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,450
I love the Sword Alliance,

311
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,380
and the disciples here love me too.

312
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,200
Mr. Tang, though you appear calm
on the surface,

313
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,100
you must be

314
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,630
seething inside.

315
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,110
But if those disciples

316
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,370
were to see you kill me in rage,

317
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,950
how would you resolve that situation?

318
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,010
What are they talking about?

319
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,730
Mr. Fang, you're so good at
fortune-telling,

320
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,700
yet you can't divine

321
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,360
whether I will kill you or not?

322
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,710
How interesting, Mr. Tang.

323
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,030
The last time

324
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,430
you came to Shisan Tower,

325
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
you were indifferent to everything.

326
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,480
I never expected
that in such a short time,

327
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,610
everything would change completely.

328
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,060
It seems that when people have something

329
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,310
to protect,

330
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,620
they become like dogs

331
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,940
on a leash.

332
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,830
Don't you...

333
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,150
have something

334
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,340
you want to protect,

335
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,700
Chai Xijin?

336
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,340
Lici,

337
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,220
the person you inquired about,

338
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,030
is the sixth prince
of the former dynasty, Chai Xijin.

339
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,290
He was still young when the kingdom fell.

340
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,030
Fortunately, with the help of
loyal ministers,

341
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,040
he became the master
of Fallen Shisan Tower,

342
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,770
rising to power in the jianghu.

343
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,740
The sixth prince of the former dynasty,

344
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,700
Chai Xijin.

345
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,460
Back then,

346
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,980
when I exchanged the Jeweled Relic Stupa

347
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,150
for Chi Yun,

348
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,180
I'd already taken notice.

349
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Plus, with Shen's

350
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,590
Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

351
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,120
the items you requested

352
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,870
were both palace treasures.

353
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,750
Ordinary folks

354
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,430
in the jianghu

355
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,790
wouldn't even know what they are.

356
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,030
However,

357
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,430
I am...

358
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,630
the godson of Minister Tang,

359
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,940
so I can access

360
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,940
some secret palace documents.

361
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,460
I didn't expect to slip up so soon

362
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,630
and give you leverage

363
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,670
against me.

364
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,030
Chai Xijin...

365
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,589
Such a nostalgic name.

366
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,599
Only what is lost...

367
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,970
can truly stir nostalgia.

368
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,780
From the Fallen Shisan Tower

369
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,390
to here,
at the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

370
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,940
your desire for and pursuit of

371
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,200
the Rebirth Scroll...

372
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,340
have been extraordinary.

373
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,390
Is the Rebirth Scroll

374
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,120
really so important

375
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,640
to you

376
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,470
that it's worth obtaining

377
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,840
by any means necessary?

378
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,810
Of course.

379
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,190
The Rebirth Scroll is now

380
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,510
the ultimate martial art,

381
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,170
transcending all other arts.

382
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,050
You yourself have relied on it

383
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,640
to become nearly invincible in the world.

384
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,970
Who wouldn't desire it?

385
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,900
But that's also

386
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,560
Yique Yinyang's martial art.

387
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,500
Yique Yinyang caused
your dynasty's downfall.

388
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,110
Why would you want to learn
his martial art?

389
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,690
You're such a nag.

390
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,780
Master Liu from Fengliu Shop

391
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,760
wouldn't ask so many questions.

392
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,800
Imagine if people knew

393
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,300
that Shisan Tower actually

394
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,120
belongs to a prince of the former dynasty

395
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,250
and that this prince

396
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,310
is colluding with Fengliu Shop,

397
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,310
which holds the Blood Ghost Pill...

398
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,200
they...

399
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,190
What are they talking about?

400
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't know.

401
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,250
I can't hear either.

402
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,620
They'd rather leave Fengliu Shop alone

403
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,730
and wipe out your Shisan Tower first.

404
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,690
Chief Fang,

405
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,640
you should understand

406
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,710
that you're only safe

407
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,350
in the darkness.

408
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,140
Mr. Tang.

409
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,540
You just said the most dangerous thing.

410
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,820
Dangerous?

411
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,710
Your methods against me

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
are no different.

413
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,510
But

414
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,710
judging from your expression now,

415
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,860
it seems my threat

416
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,660
carries more weight.

417
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,270
Chief Fang,

418
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,470
you've had your fun.

419
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,030
Won't you leave now?

420
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,030
But if I obtain

421
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,820
the eternal Rebirth Scroll,

422
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,140
I'll gain

423
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,230
a mysterious

424
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,100
and powerful body like yours.

425
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,680
I'll obtain the path

426
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,110
from human to god.

427
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,620
I want to obtain

428
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,590
the path

429
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
from human to god.

430
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Work with me.

431
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,240
You want to become a god?

432
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,060
If you don't,

433
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,300
that's your problem.

434
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,750
Fang Pingzhai, Chief of

435
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,410
Fallen Shisan Tower, is here.

436
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,310
He's the Chief of Shisan Tower?

437
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,250
The Chief has another identity,

438
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,310
which is...

439
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,030
Fine.

440
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,420
You win.

441
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,520
I'll leave.

442
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,100
Sorry to have troubled you
these past few days,

443
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,210
and thanks for your hospitality.

444
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,210
I, Fang Pingzhai, never owe favors.

445
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,860
Before I leave,

446
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,420
I'll give you all a special gift

447
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,820
to express my gratitude!

448
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,310
Is he for real?

449
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,380
Follow him.

450
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,270
For how long?

451
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,950
Until you feel that
if you don't come back,

452
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,740
he'll bring disaster upon the world.

453
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,910
The key is to find out

454
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,650
what his true purpose is.

455
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,940
That important?

456
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,010
You can count on me.

457
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,660
The Peony Pavilion!

458
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,520
The one we've been searching for!

459
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,550
It really is.

460
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,140
Isn't Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

461
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,070
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop?

462
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,190
This map is so detailed.

463
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,390
It doesn't look fake.

464
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
It even shows the corridors.

465
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
Is this real or fake?

466
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,740
Now wiping them out will be child's play!

467
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,790
When was this map put up?

468
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,860
Turns out the headquarters of Fengliu Shop

469
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,230
has been hidden
in the misty marshlands all along.

470
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,910
Jiangnan's waters are
full of isolated islands.

471
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,110
No wonder we couldn't find it anywhere.

472
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,580
Sword Master, please

473
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,750
send orders to all disciples immediately

474
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,150
to attack the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion
at once.

475
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,080
Since the Peony Pavilion is

476
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,270
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop,

477
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,340
it must be full of traps and mechanisms.

478
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,550
Whether we can trust this map

479
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,610
remains to be seen.

480
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,900
We should first send someone

481
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,370
to infiltrate and investigate

482
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,510
to avoid falling into the enemy's trap.

483
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,710
Traps and mechanisms are mere trickery.

484
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,580
Once our forces are assembled,

485
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,550
brute force will overcome any trick!

486
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,750
Whatever traps they set,

487
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,620
we'll crush them all!

488
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,550
With Mr. Tang

489
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,980
and so many experts from our alliance,

490
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,950
plus backing from the imperial court

491
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,950
and Biluo Palace,

492
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,140
there's no need to hold back!

493
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,710
Our alliance is at its strongest

494
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,710
with high morale.

495
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,440
If not now, when?

496
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,750
Master Cheng,

497
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,750
what do you think?

498
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,060
Evil must be thoroughly eliminated
sooner rather than later.

499
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,190
I have no objection.

500
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,260
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.

501
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Relay my command:

502
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,360
assemble the disciples from all halls

503
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,940
and prepare for battle!

504
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,740
Mr. Tang,

505
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,140
what do you think about that map?

506
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,820
How much can it be trusted?

507
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,240
At this point,

508
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,380
with everyone's blood running hot,

509
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,620
does it even matter
whether it's real or fake?

510
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,420
That's true.

511
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,030
But the alliance still needs time to
come together.

512
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,520
Whoever posted this map

513
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,550
deliberately wants to deny us that time.

514
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,750
I'm worried another faction

515
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,420
is entering the game,

516
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,240
determined to disrupt
the peace of the jianghu.

517
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
What matters most now

518
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,780
is how to win the battle
against the Peony Pavilion.

519
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
After the battle,

520
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,510
I'll

521
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,140
personally resolve

522
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,010
this matter.

523
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,900
Master,

524
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,420
I have some thoughts

525
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,340
about the coming battle

526
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,200
that I'd like to discuss with you.

527
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,720
Chunji,

528
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,720
didn't I tell you to go back?

529
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,640
When will we attack Fengliu Shop?

530
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,040
I want to be in the vanguard,

531
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,700
charging into battle for you!

532
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,550
I'm already asleep.

533
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,390
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

534
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,270
Master Shao,

535
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,510
I'll

536
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,510
take my leave now.

537
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,660
Mr. Tang,

538
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,380
please help me talk some sense into

539
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
that troublesome disciple of mine.

540
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
Earlier, Mr. Tang,

541
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,530
you told me to wait
until the final battle.

542
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,080
I can't wait any longer.

543
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,820
Ms. Zhong,

544
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,580
you've always been a strong-willed person.

545
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,100
Yes.

546
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm very strong-willed.

547
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
Why should anyone admit defeat?

548
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,360
But strong-willed people

549
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,550
often have...

550
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
fragile hearts.

551
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,320
The most strong-willed person I know

552
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,070
seems to be you, Mr. Tang.

553
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,000
Therefore,

554
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,320
I

555
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
can understand how you feel.

556
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,950
I

557
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,360
just want to remind you:

558
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,650
the closer you are to your goal,

559
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,090
the calmer you must stay.

560
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,850
To lose patience

561
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,080
is often to lose one's way,

562
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,240
and you may

563
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,490
be exploited by enemies

564
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,860
or even

565
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,270
fall into their traps.

566
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,660
I understand.

567
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,710
Then I'll...

568
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,580
go back and think carefully about

569
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,510
the battle plan.

570
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,140
Goodbye.

571
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,640
Goodbye.

572
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,070
What's wrong, Master Puzhu?

573
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,750
We're approaching the outpost.

574
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,410
We must proceed with caution.

575
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,340
I'll scout ahead first.

576
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,790
You all remain here for now.

577
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,190
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

578
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,230
Before I return,

579
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,300
don't make any rash moves.

580
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,390
Understood.

581
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,620
Rest in place!

582
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,230
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

583
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,780
Come on, let's go sit over there.

584
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,440
Alright, let's go.

585
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,100
Come on, let's sit over there.

586
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,230
My friend,

587
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,910
it's been a long time.

588
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,970
You...

589
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm not wearing a veil,

590
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,930
and you don't recognize me anymore?

591
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,530
My friend,

592
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,750
I

593
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,340
came to play chess with you.

594
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,050
Whether you wear a veil or not,

595
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,020
I've

596
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,390
never truly seen you clearly.

597
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,910
For instance, right now,

598
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,220
should I address you as Miss Tao

599
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,260
or as "The Peach of Three Hues,"

600
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,230
Xifang Tao?

601
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,430
The Peach of Three Hues

602
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,630
is me.

603
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,340
Miss Tao

604
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,330
is also me.

605
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,550
Isn't it said

606
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,470
that all that has form is false?

607
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,500
Sir, you've studied
the Buddhist scriptures deeply,

608
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
so why cling to forms?

609
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,840
Sir,

610
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,960
please.

611
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,030
For today's game,

612
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,760
let's play blindfolded chess
with this endgame.

613
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,990
What do you think?

614
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,350
Let it be so.

615
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,140
This string of beads of mine

616
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,340
has exactly 13 beads.

617
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,660
So, Sir,

618
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,720
I shall play only 13 moves.

619
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,850
In that case...

620
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,670
I'll make the first move.

621
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,870
Let me borrow your prayer bead.

622
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,030
All this time, I've been wondering

623
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,090
whether I should consider you
a chess companion

624
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,090
or an opponent.

625
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,320
It's time to decide now.

626
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,670
Light Technique—

627
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,640
Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

628
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,350
I've played chess with you
for three years.

629
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,640
I remember every move

630
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,510
you ever made.

631
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,420
There are several positions

632
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,140
where you never placed your pieces,

633
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,420
even though, according to chess theory,

634
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,350
you should have.

635
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,500
My friend,

636
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,150
are you deliberately letting me win?

637
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,660
I guess

638
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,930
those positions

639
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,550
are the formation cores

640
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,280
that trigger
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

641
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,030
Oh no.

642
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,440
Deputy Lord Yu,

643
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,510
what should we do now?

644
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,470
To force Master Puzhu to use

645
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,950
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky,

646
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,240
that person must be an expert.

647
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,560
Master Puzhu is in danger.

648
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,580
Follow me to aid him!

649
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,780
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

650
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,290
You're trying to lure them

651
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,760
into coming to the rescue?

652
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,140
That's right.

653
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,110
I can't be certain I'll defeat you,

654
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,780
but severely wounding the elites
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

655
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
is much easier.

656
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,460
Oh no, it's a trap.

657
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,760
This is Fengliu Shop's poisonous mist.

658
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,020
Everyone, be careful!

659
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,690
Because of your one careless move,

660
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
an entire squad will be sacrificed.

661
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,740
Do you feel any remorse?

662
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,310
This poisonous mist suppresses
inner strength.

663
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,770
I must get them out of here.

664
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,850
Light Technique—

665
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,740
Verbal Dharma.

666
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,240
You'd give up your protective prayer beads

667
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,370
just to save others.

668
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,890
You're still as compassionate as ever.

669
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,230
These are Master Puzhu's prayer beads.

670
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,270
They can guide us

671
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,200
out of this mist!

672
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,900
Then...

673
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,200
let's retreat now.

674
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,180
Master Puzhu,

675
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,250
please be careful!

676
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,470
Stay alert

677
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,790
and retreat immediately!

678
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,450
-Yes!
-Yes!

679
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,260
Your Fengliu Shop is doomed,

680
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,520
and you've got nowhere to run.

681
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,050
Why create more bloodshed?

682
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,800
The Peach of Three Hues—

683
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,990
Boundless Peach Blossoms!

684
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,350
Lion's Roar.

685
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,810
Not only will I create bloodshed,

686
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,630
but I'll also make you

687
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,340
create bloodshed.

688
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,140
I

689
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,490
will never let you die.

690
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,820
You are truly interesting, Sir.

691
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,100
We've been walking from dawn till dusk.

692
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,360
We finally made it out.

693
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,030
Indeed.

694
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,950
If it weren't for

695
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,380
Master Puzhu's prayer beads,

696
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,060
our losses

697
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,590
would have been much worse.

698
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,140
You all head back to camp first.

699
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,580
I'm going back for Master Puzhu.

700
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,310
You mustn't.

701
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,420
Deputy Lord Yu,

702
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,640
it's too dangerous to go back now.

703
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,310
-Yes.
-Yes!

704
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,660
You mustn't.

705
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,140
It's far too dangerous!

706
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,870
Listen to me!

707
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,560
Not repaying kindness

708
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,990
violates the ancestral teachings
of Sword King City.

709
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,230
You should go back quickly.

710
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,690
Well...

711
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,880
This is an order.

712
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,860
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

713
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,140
Yu Furen,

714
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,470
you've truly disappointed me.

715
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,239
Who's there?

716
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,389
Is it really you?

717
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,050
You're not dead?

718
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,739
Yes, I died.

719
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,540
But Fengliu Shop has turned me into
a human puppet.

720
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,460
So...

721
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,860
I came back to life.

722
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,790
So

723
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,230
it's true that you've been

724
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,430
working for Fengliu Shop all this time.

725
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,150
Then

726
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,660
you don't deserve to
return to Sword King City now.

727
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,460
Don't be so harsh.

728
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,820
Fengliu Shop and I

729
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,280
are just using each other.

730
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,670
When did you

731
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,400
start taking those Evil Pills?

732
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,960
Who cares about something like that?

733
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,310
I care!

734
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,230
I want to know—

735
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,340
when did

736
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,340
the hero of Sword King City

737
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,500
become a monster?

738
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:38,940
And when

739
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,710
did I

740
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,490
start stubbornly believing in you

741
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,550
and miss the chance to bring you back?

742
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,380
You're still as naive as ever.

743
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,930
There are no heroes who don't pay a price.

744
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,940
As for you,

745
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,270
you trusted the wrong person before,

746
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,270
and you're still doing the same now!

747
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,520
Come back to the Sword Alliance with me
to face justice!

748
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,310
You're no match for me.

749
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,900
Why risk your life fighting me?

750
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,080
It's a worthless life anyway.

751
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,540
Risking it...

752
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,310
What's there to regret?

753
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,540
Come on!

754
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,590
You shouldn't die here.

755
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,630
Go back to Sword King City and learn

756
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,230
how to be a good city lord

757
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,820
to protect Sword King City's
century-old legacy.

758
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,220
Don't you find your words

759
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,310
laughable?

760
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,710
If Sword King City

761
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,190
truly mattered to you,

762
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,560
how could you have ended up
where you are today?

763
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,000
I just wanted to be a hero.

764
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,900
But when ordinary people try to be heroes,

765
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,230
they must pay a price.

766
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,930
This price is something

767
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
you'll have to bear sooner or later.

768
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,230
A hero?

769
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,090
A hero who risks his life
for Fengliu Shop?

770
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,020
Yu Qifeng,

771
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,360
I won't believe

772
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,770
a single word you say anymore.

773
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,640
Whether you believe it or not
doesn't matter.

774
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,790
But your price

775
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,990
is already on its way.

776
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,460
The person you trust now

777
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,590
has already decided that fate for you.

778
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,860
Who?

779
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,590
Tang Lici?

780
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,170
I never trusted him.

781
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,500
You don't trust him, yet you

782
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,630
obey his every word,

783
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,670
allowing him to command you.

784
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,380
You lead the people of Sword King City

785
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,710
to fight his battles!

786
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,910
I never did it for him.

787
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,240
I did it to destroy Fengliu Shop!

788
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,860
His methods may be questionable,

789
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,990
but they often work.

790
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,230
With him in the Sword Alliance,

791
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,660
we can eliminate evil forces sooner.

792
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,980
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

793
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,210
don't destroy each other,

794
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,990
how could he, as Yique Yinyang,

795
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,830
reap the benefits?

796
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,530
Yique Yinyang is dead.

797
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,940
Fengliu Shop

798
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,460
deliberately framed him

799
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,460
to provoke conflict in the jianghu...

800
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,230
Is Fengliu Shop intentionally framing him,

801
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,520
or are you people from the Sword Alliance
deceiving yourselves?

802
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,950
Do you know how he obtained

803
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,080
his Rebirth Scroll?

804
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,460
Have you seen
his golden eyes and forehead mark?

805
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,860
He has so many secrets,

806
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,440
yet why does everyone
in the Sword Alliance

807
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,050
choose to turn a blind eye?

808
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,230
I haven't!

809
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,110
I just...

810
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,990
I just...

811
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,420
Everyone has

812
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,480
their own secrets.

813
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,670
I'm also waiting for an opportunity.

814
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,190
I'm afraid some secrets

815
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,720
are too much for you to bear.

816
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,600
Shao Yanping has grown senile.

817
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,820
If he wants to stake the fate
of the entire alliance,

818
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,690
I can't stop him.

819
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,950
But you're different.

820
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,230
You're the next lord of Sword King City.

821
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,110
Who you trust

822
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,050
determines the city's fate.

823
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,940
Furen,

824
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,520
my life is already ruined,

825
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,160
but your life has just begun.

826
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,820
Don't let your life

827
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,590
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

828
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,920
become the price of your misplaced trust!

829
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,800
No matter what,

830
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,060
you must provide evidence.

831
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,630
Come back to the alliance with me

832
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,760
and confront Tang Lici face-to-face.

833
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,390
So you're saying

834
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,380
that Master Puzhu

835
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,750
fell into the trap set by

836
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,830
the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop.

837
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,760
After getting separated from you
in the mist,

838
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,460
there's been no trace of him since?

839
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:31,940
Yes.

840
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
It's all my fault.

841
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,760
Before Master Puzhu left,

842
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,020
he clearly instructed me

843
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,070
not to act rashly.

844
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,270
But I still acted recklessly.

845
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
That enchantress is full of tricks.

846
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,540
It's no surprise

847
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,090
that you fell into her trap.

848
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,270
Unfortunately, after we entered the mist,

849
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,310
we couldn't tell which way to go

850
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,390
and didn't know

851
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,630
where Master Puzhu had gone
while chasing Xifang Tao.

852
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,090
But I imagine Master Puzhu

853
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,980
must have had some other method

854
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,020
to find his way.

855
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,890
Otherwise,

856
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,070
he wouldn't have given this prayer bead

857
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,590
to us.

858
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,210
Let me see this prayer bead.

859
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,120
After you fought your way out,

860
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,270
did you encounter

861
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,000
anyone else?

862
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,740
No.

863
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,010
I can tell

864
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,690
he's hiding something.

865
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,420
Indeed.

866
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,710
Then, who do you think

867
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,640
he encountered?

868
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,540
It takes the one who started it to end it.

869
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,450
To unravel Commander Yu's inner conflict,

870
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,780
we can only wait and see.

871
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,190
The same goes

872
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,820
for Master Puzhu.

873
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,330
What do you mean?

874
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,340
There was a note

875
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,000
at Master Puzhu's place

876
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,310
saying

877
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,650
that his chess companion of many years

878
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,750
is the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop,

879
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,820
Xifang Tao.

880
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,020
Master Puzhu

881
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,680
is not a gullible man.

882
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,150
For them to become friends,

883
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,410
there must be a reason.

884
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,810
Perhaps...

885
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,360
because they've known each other
for a long time...

886
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,460
things

887
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,630
won't reach

888
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,940
the worst outcome.

889
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,580
On the contrary...

890
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,880
it may help Puzhu overcome
his karmic obstacles.

891
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,050
You actually used your remaining strength
to save me.

892
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,760
Master Puzhu,

893
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,440
what are you really thinking?

894
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,310
I said

895
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,430
I'd never let you die because of me.

896
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,590
You won't kill me,

897
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,340
but I'll kill you.

898
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,200
You're badly injured now.

899
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,120
Don't act recklessly.

900
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,980
I know how badly I'm injured.

901
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,900
Messenger geese.

902
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,870
Master Puzhu,

903
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,940
why don't you ask

904
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,340
the Yanmen Sect for help?

905
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,440
They can't hear us.

906
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,690
The terrain here is unique—

907
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,260
wide at the bottom, narrow at the top,

908
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,810
and surrounded by steep cliffs.

909
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,470
It wouldn't be easy to find us.

910
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,230
You're injured now.

911
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,280
It's impossible for you to leave.

912
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,820
It seems I

913
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,670
have fallen into your hands.

914
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,540
Master Puzhu,

915
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,540
the fact that you still had strength left
to save me...

916
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,150
means that this place

917
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,500
can't trap you at all.

918
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,550
Sir,

919
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,510
why don't you leave?

920
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,830
West Palace Chief, since you're awake,

921
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,670
please get up.

922
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,530
"West Palace Chief"?

923
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,770
Sir, you're sweating.

924
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,610
Is it because you're exhausted,

925
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,860
or because...

926
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,790
you're nervous?

927
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,410
You're pressing on my legs.
