[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 24]

3
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,640
Not a single step back?

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Master Shao, you're truly skilled.

5
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,580
But if the Tai'e Sword were sealed,

6
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,240
would you still be so relaxed?

7
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,070
With your amateur skills,

8
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,420
you think you can seal the Tai'e Sword?

9
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,759
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword,

10
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,680
you can win?

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,870
You really underestimate

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,070
the Sword Master of the Sword Alliance.

13
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,870
Master Shao,

14
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,079
I've missed you since we parted
at Sword King City.

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,430
He's walking so casually.

16
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,670
Is he really here to save someone?

17
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,970
I've been walking with you for so long

18
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,050
and haven't encountered any danger.

19
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,300
Isn't this a bit strange?

20
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,740
Do you think

21
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,240
we're unharmed

22
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,710
because

23
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,160
I'm in cahoots with the Fengliu Shop?

24
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,400
Liu Yan specializes
in curse bugs and poisons.

25
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,030
The plants and trees here,

26
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,520
like the Bone-Soaking Lotus

27
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,980
we saw on the lake earlier,

28
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,390
appear harmless,

29
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,430
but in reality,

30
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,110
they contain deadly poison.

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,930
Poisonous plants are potent

32
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,100
but predictable.

33
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,710
Meanwhile, the changes of human hearts

34
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,570
are as unfathomable as the abyss.

35
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,300
I've already destroyed
many poisonous flowers.

36
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,770
You just didn't notice.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,150
However, the poison still lingers.

38
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,750
I suggest you take

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,079
another antidote pill.

40
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,190
I almost forgot

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,150
that you know

42
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,140
Yique Yinyang's strange technique,

43
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,540
so you don't even need it.

44
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,480
It's Master Shao.

45
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,100
Finally,

46
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
he's here.

47
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,470
You mean

48
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,020
that we face the enemy directly

49
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,750
and win with surprise tactics?

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,480
Will Liu Yan comply?

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,170
He dared to issue a challenge,

52
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,000
which means he's fully prepared.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
And what we need to do

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
is to make him believe

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,890
everything is going according to his plan.

56
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,360
You bunch of idiots

57
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
really came to die.

58
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,660
Shen Langhun moves swiftly.

59
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,270
Working with the six Sword Masters,

60
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,720
they can handle Meihua Yishu

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
and Kuanglan Wuxing.

62
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,180
Master Cheng and Gu Xitan

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,090
can perfectly counter Fucui.

64
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,810
Eliminating evil
and defending righteousness...

65
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,180
Happens today.

66
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,760
Charge!

67
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,460
This way,

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,680
of Liu Yan's skilled fighters,

69
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,070
all that remain will be

70
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,950
Miss Hong,

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,770
Qingchan,

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,700
Hua Wuyan,

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,720
and Bai Suche.

74
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,780
What's your plan?

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Liu Yan and I are evenly matched.

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,510
To avoid
a direct confrontation with me,

77
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,920
he'll certainly use Ms. Zhong as bait

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
to lure me away,

79
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,360
then use the curse bugs to set a trap

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,120
and slaughter
the Sword Alliance's disciples.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,250
Once Liu Yan leaves Bishang Pavilion,

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,480
you will need to intercept him.

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,000
We can't let him join the main battlefield

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,310
nor allow him to return.

85
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,270
Only then will I have a chance

86
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,400
to rescue Ms. Zhong.

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,310
Therefore...

88
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,480
Master Shao,

89
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,770
you must use yourself as bait.

90
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,360
Tang Lici,

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,760
what exactly is going on?

92
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,120
All the Sword Masters are fighting,

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,450
yet you chose this path.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,920
When Master Shao encountered enemies,

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,270
you still remained indifferent.

96
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,400
You're not planning

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,240
to weaken both sides in this chaos

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,970
and eventually kill everyone,

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,840
like Yique Yinyang, right?

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,200
Green Corpse Curse Bug.

101
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,680
If this thing burrowed into

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
your brain,

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,870
trying to remove it

104
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,550
would be quite troublesome.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,010
Deputy Lord Yu,

106
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,310
I know you have
misunderstandings about me,

107
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,840
but I still want to tell you,

108
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,830
that I

109
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,390
am not Yique Yinyang.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,570
Let's go.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,800
Step back.

112
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,760
Tang Lici,

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,570
long time no see.

114
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,920
After you fought your way out,

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,450
did you encounter

116
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,540
anyone else?

117
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,470
Deputy Lord Yu,

118
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,340
so this is what you've been hiding.

119
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,580
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

120
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Such a commotion.

121
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,770
Something is definitely wrong here.

122
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,600
Chief,

123
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,890
I'm annoyed each time I come here.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
Coffins in cold water?

125
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,630
Only Gui Fusheng

126
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,390
would create

127
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,560
such cumbersome and tedious things.

128
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,680
As long as you can create

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
what I want,

130
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,390
the Floating Abyss is yours to use.

131
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,560
What you want

132
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,510
is almost ready.

133
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,669
Just give me a little more time.

134
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,080
Once the Leader delivers

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
the promised Sky-Fallen Stone fragments,

136
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,870
I will create

137
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,630
a true miracle.

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
The Inverted Dream

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,860
won't disappoint you, Chief.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,870
What's this "inverted" nonsense?

141
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,030
What weird stuff is this weirdo

142
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,000
trying to do?

143
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,390
We have a visitor.

144
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,710
You want me to personally distract Liu Yan

145
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,520
to buy you time for the rescue?

146
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,490
This round, Liu Yan and I

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,810
are competing for
the preemptive advantage.

148
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,130
I am fully confident.

149
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,460
Master Shao, please rest assured.

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Just proceed according to the plan.

151
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Master Shao,

152
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,050
long time no see.

153
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,970
Dr. Liu,

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
thanks to your presence,

155
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,320
the people here

156
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,250
aren't left without medical care.

157
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,510
I, Shao,

158
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,200
truly failed to recognize your status.

159
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,650
I didn't realize

160
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,600
you're the master of Fengliu Shop.

161
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,840
It seems that it's my honor

162
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,020
to have you lower yourself

163
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,100
to meet me in person.

164
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,670
May I ask,

165
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
as a descendant of Zhoudi Tower,

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,360
why have you gone astray

167
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,000
and committed such evil deeds?

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,610
Sword Master, stop wasting time.

169
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,330
I won't answer your question.

170
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,290
Let's see if Tang Lici comes
to save you first

171
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
or if you will

172
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,510
die in battle first?

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,750
I see now

174
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,960
that Sword King Yu
is guarding the pass for Liu Yan.

175
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,400
Master Shao is facing Liu Yan already.

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,660
I need to make it quick.

177
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,830
Go save Ms. Zhong first.

178
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Hurry!

179
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
Mofeng Black Fire.

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,150
Phoenix's Bloody Tears.

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,980
Ten Blazing Suns, Lotuses Bloom!

182
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,540
Neither truly dead nor alive,

183
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,600
why live such a miserable existence?

184
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,870
Don't tell me

185
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,250
that after the battle in Biluo Palace,

186
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,830
you actually believed his disguise.

187
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,160
Doing bad things

188
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,670
doesn't make you a bad person,

189
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,390
as long as you're not caught.

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,050
Don't let your life

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,770
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

192
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,100
become the price of your misplaced trust!

193
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,350
Tang Lici,

194
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,530
you're indeed a monster.

195
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,300
Yu Qifeng.

196
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,890
I can kill you right now.

197
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,540
Of course you can kill me.

198
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,720
Today,

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
I've already trapped
the Sword Alliance here.

200
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,390
Tomorrow, I'll storm into Sword King City,

201
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,590
invade Biluo Palace,

202
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,360
and turn the entire jianghu

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,080
into a river of blood!

204
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,240
and release

205
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,750
the followers who were imprisoned
on Camellia Island

206
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,550
They've waited for so many years

207
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,370
and can finally welcome back...

208
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,630
Yique Yinyang.

209
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,250
Follow and live, or resist and die,

210
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
just like over 10 years ago.

211
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,200
He is my enemy.

212
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,370
Since that's what you believe,

213
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,380
I'll help make your dream come true.

214
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,990
Yique Yinyang.

215
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,440
You really are Yique Yinyang.

216
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,480
Are Biluo Palace and the Sword Alliance

217
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,030
all just

218
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,160
your excuses to yield in order to gain?

219
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,030
Furen,

220
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,030
you're truly my good son.

221
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,080
I will kill Yique Yinyang right now

222
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,660
to honor your heroic sacrifice.

223
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,590
Father, you actually want to kill me?

224
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,090
Do you see now?

225
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,690
He's the one who's been
using you all along.

226
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,600
Draw your sword.

227
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,090
Tang Lici.

228
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,520
Draw your sword.

229
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,750
My son, why are you drawing your sword?

230
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,320
You believe Yique Yinyang

231
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,670
but not your own father?

232
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,240
You're not my father at all!

233
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
Die!

234
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,390
In our next life, we'll be enemies,
not father and son!

235
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,150
Acting on impulse

236
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,810
nearly ruined everything.

237
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,550
That voice...

238
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,150
How may I address you?

239
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,720
Ghostly Peony.

240
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,100
You should rest and recover here,

242
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,450
and await assistance.

243
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,920
Yu Qifeng has delayed me for too long.

244
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,650
I'll go rescue Ms. Zhong first.

245
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,030
I wonder how Mr. Tang

246
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,440
and the others are doing.

247
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,200
Stone!

248
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,000
Stone, are you alright?

249
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,170
I have a feeling

250
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,980
that Master

251
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,360
is in danger.

252
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,380
There are traps here.

253
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,089
There's poison!

254
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,480
This formation has been activated.

255
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,869
Everything within its reach

256
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,130
becomes territory for my Martial Realm.

257
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,590
Drawing boundaries to create a prison,

258
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,120
trapping oneself in a cage.

259
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,790
Is Liu Yan always

260
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,550
so self-pitying like this?

261
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,690
Master ordered me

262
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,340
to delay you for a moment.

263
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,680
You think you can trap me

264
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,550
with just this cage and smoke?

265
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,510
Mr. Tang,

266
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,630
don't underestimate this cage.

267
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
Once you leave

268
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,960
this cage,

269
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,170
Ms. Zhong will be in grave danger.

270
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Moreover,

271
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,480
Master has also

272
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,790
left something for me.

273
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,200
This item is called
the Moon in Water Mirror.

274
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,960
It not only reveals

275
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,890
all your actions

276
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,640
but also allows you to witness

277
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,370
how Fengliu Shop slaughters
the Sword Alliance.

278
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,510
However, Mr. Tang

279
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,040
and Ms. Zhong, don't worry.

280
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,750
The place where you are now
is perfectly safe.

281
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,610
Just wait until they're all dead,

282
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,970
then come out to collect their bodies.

283
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,350
Ms. Zhong,

284
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,790
hang in there.

285
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,490
How did you escape?

286
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,510
No self, no form.

287
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,330
The one you saw in the cage

288
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,010
was merely an illusion.

only then might you stand a slim chance

And you, Ms. Zhong,

418
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,400
are still putting on a facade.

419

If this thing burrowed into

439
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,650
your brain,

440
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,350
trying to remove it

441
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,190
would be quite troublesome.

Weren't you told to wait for assistance?

447
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,530
You should rest and recover here,

448
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,790
and await assistance.

449
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,300
Stop spacing out. Follow me.

450

Master Shao,

451
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,640
it seems you won't last

452
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,970
until Mr. Tang arrives.

453
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,270
Who says my body is failing?

454
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,510
Master Shao!

455
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,420
Master Shao!

456
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,330
Are you alright?

457
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,060
Master Shao!

458
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,100
A few more of you
won't make any difference.

459
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,420
Come on if you dare!

460
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,780
It's blood.

461
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,310
This is Hua Wuyan's blood.

462
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,040
He died,

463
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,750
but his death

464
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,930
will bring you all a great gift.

465
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,430
The formation eye mark left by Tang Lici.

466
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,580
Search for the mark.

467
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,440
-Hurry.
-Okay.

468
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,030
Pu,

469
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,960
your antidote pills
aren't working anymore.

470
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,840
How would I know

471
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,790
this thing could mutate?

472
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,810
Everyone, hold on!

473
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,920
The Peony Pavilion

474
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,960
means nothing to me.

475
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,560
It's no matter to abandon it.

476
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
But you nobodies...

477
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
None of you will escape

478
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,130
from under my watch!

479
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
If I release all the power

480
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,780
of the Tai'e Sword,

481
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,550
I can surely defeat Liu Yan.

482
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,240
Since the situation can't be reversed,

483
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,960
we should at least
make this demon die with us.

484
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,790
Stars in the vast cosmos,

485
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,760
the mystery of mysteries!

486
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Illuminating the dark night,

487
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,390
bringing order to the heavens.

488
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,810
Reflecting upon mountains
and rivers as protection.

489
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,430
All living beings,

490

Biluo Palace returning to Luo River

492
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,940
was thanks to your assistance.

493
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,720
If trouble befalls the jianghu,

494
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,200
Biluo Palace

495
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,110
can lend the Celestial Thunder Technique

496
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,270
to help the Sword Alliance
achieve victory.

497

Palace Chief Wanyu

498
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,890
is counting on you.

499
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,710
Poison spreads everywhere.

500
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Heaven's virtue is lost.

501
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,200
I, who worship the stars,

502
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,850
Wanyu Yuedan...

503
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,390
Sincerely perform this dance
to ward off evil,

504
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,820
borrowing the spirits of heaven and earth.

505
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,810
May the Thunder God clear the path,

506
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,870
and bring rain to eliminate disaster!

507
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,260
Consecrate the sword!

508
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,950
Liu Yan,

509
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,540
you have already lost this battle.

510
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
You can abandon the Peony Pavilion.

511
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,520
You can abandon your comrades.

512
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,960
You can also easily abandon

513
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,510
the righteous path taught by Fang Zhou.

514
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,410
But I will never abandon

515
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
any disciple of the Sword Alliance.

516
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,680
I swore on the Tai'e Sword

517
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
to protect

518
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,350
the lives of all disciples.

519
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,000
I will personally cut off

520
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,240
your demonic head.

521
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,920
Even if I have to die for this,

522
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,320
fighting for justice...

523
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,750
What is there to fear?

524
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,730
If we were elsewhere,

525
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,880
I would probably

526
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,340
have died under that move.

527
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,930
But since I lured you here,

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm obviously prepared.

529
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,480
This is

530
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,160
the Ice Flower curse bug
that I prepared

531
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,290
for the Tai'e Sword.

532
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,750
Combining the power of three,

533
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,110
I waited specifically
for the moment of sword consecration

534
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,030
to control you

535
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,420
and show you

536
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,370
what true despair really is.

537
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,130
Master Shao,

538
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,750
if there were
true righteousness in this world,

539
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,680
how could Fang Zhou have perished?

540
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,950
Master Shao!

541
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,750
Master!

542
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,870
Master!

543
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,750
Chunji,

544
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,550
I'm glad you're back.

545
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,370
I'm glad you're back.

546
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,120
Liu Yan,

547
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,310
Hua Wuyan died because of you.

548
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,720
How many more times

549
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,950
will you repeat such needless sacrifices?

550
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,080
Those words should be directed at you.

551
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,680
I'm curious to know

552
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
how many more heroes

553
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,560
you'll send to their deaths

554
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,950
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

555
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,470
You...

556
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,350
Chunji.

557
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,270
Chunji.

558
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,420
Chunji!

559
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Besides such clumsy provocations,

560
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,670
what else can you do?

561
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,480
Clumsy?

562
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,350
Could it be clumsier

563
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,000
than the lies you told me at Biluo Palace?

564
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,420
I've been to Zhoudi Tower.

565
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,280
There was clearly nothing there!

566
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
In that case,

567
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,820
I'll capture you first

568
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,170
and then explain everything clearly.

569
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,510
You often use that innocent face

570
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,760
to deceive people

571
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,659
who believe your nonsense.

572
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,909
None of you are innocent.

573
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,550
You always think

574
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,840
you can do anything.

575
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,110
The Sword Alliance

576
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,010
was ruined because of your confidence.

577
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,140
Master Jiang,

578
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,110
all the curse bugs

579
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
are attacking Mr. Tang.

580
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,520
Follow Mr. Tang's orders.

581
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,800
Notify the Mole Camp

582
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,960
to light the fire!

583
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,740
Liu Yan,

584
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
you've used all your backup plans

585
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,590
to attack me.

586
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,420
You've already used up
all your trump cards.

587
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,920
The endgame has arrived.

588
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,880
This is what I mean by...

589
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,270
"giving back in twofold"

590
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,550
Tang Lici,

591
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,590
the Peony Pavilion is yours now.

592
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,370
I wonder when we meet again,

593
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,920
what kind of person

594
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,070
you will become.

595
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,360
Great!

596
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,500
Look at what's written here.

597
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,060
Look!

598
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,640
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

599
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,370
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

600
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,360
We've won!

601
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,150
Victory!

602
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,000
Zhong Chunji, the heroine
and Chief of Shanfeng Branch,

603
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,710
all of this

604
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,230
was given to you by him.

605
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,960
Not a single thing

606
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,630
truly belongs to you.

607
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,000
That's why you fight so hard

608
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
to defend him.

609
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,190
It's because you know that, without him,

610
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,630
you are nothing.

611
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,180
If you think I'm so worthless,

612
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
then why waste your breath?

613
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,760
Kill me already!

614
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,800
In your heart,

615
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,070
there's also a monster.

616
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,070
This attack on Fengliu Shop

617
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,590
cost many lives.

618
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,280
It's because Senior Zhong
was too eager for merit

619
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,590
and acted without following orders.

620
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,500
Don't say that.

621
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,360
It was always the plan

622
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
to attack Fengliu Shop.

623
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,880
Sooner or later, we had to attack anyway.

624
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,140
It's not good if someone overhears this.

625
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,750
I really want to know

626
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,960
how many more heroes

627
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,860
you'll send to their deaths

628
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,090
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

629
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,590
Who is it?

630
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,400
Ms. Zhong,

631
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,280
it's me.

632
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,760
Where is Mr. Tang?

633
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
Where is my Master?

634
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,790
They're talking in Wanhua Hall.

635
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,230
Why are you up?

636
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,110
You need to rest more.

637
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,170
Ms. Zhong,

638
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,910
you've suffered so much.

639
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,730
It's alright now.

640
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,810
When I was in Yanxian,

641
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,590
I was also imprisoned and tortured.

642
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
You were the one who saved me.

643
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,090
That feeling of despair

644
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,670
was truly unbearable.

645
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,880
Thankfully,

646
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,760
we're both safe now.

647
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,440
By the way,

648
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,450
while you were unconscious,

649
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,510
Mr. Tang came to examine

650
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,590
your injuries.

651
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,250
They're just some surface wounds.

652
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,740
This is the medicine he provided.

653
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,950
As long as you take it regularly,

654
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,480
you'll recover soon.

655
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,800
Everything will be fine.

656
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,730
Thank you,

657
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,610
Shei.

658
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,150
Master Jiang,

659
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,840
you'll be responsible
for arranging guards to patrol

660
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,100
and secure the perimeter of Mount Cloud.

661
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,360
As for distributing medication

662
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,110
and taking care of the wounded,

663
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,560
Master Ji will be in charge of that.

664
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,670
-We will do our best.
-We will do our best.

665
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,280
Mr. Tang,

666
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,960
I had many misgivings
about you before.

667
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
I feel ashamed.

668
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,220
This battle at Peony Pavilion...

669
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,290
I understand.

670
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,960
No need to worry, Master Jiang.

671
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,250
Hold it in.

672
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,470
It would be embarrassing
if we both coughed up blood here.

673
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,290
The Sword Alliance is a complex group.

674
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,950
Now, all branches are united.

675
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
It's truly a feat.

676
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,540
Thank you for your help,
Palace Chief Wanyu.

677
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,830
If it weren't for you,

678
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,030
the Sword Alliance would have
suffered greater losses.

679
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,960
As allies,

680
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,950
helping each other is expected.

681
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,190
It's a pity we couldn't

682
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,700
eliminate them completely.

683
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,630
We searched the entire Peony Pavilion

684
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,230
but couldn't find

685
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,000
the whereabouts

686
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,600
of Liu Yan and other key figures.

687
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,400
However, blowing up

688
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,130
the entire Peony Pavilion base

689
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,360
and forcing Liu Yan to abandon his hideout

690
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
has boosted morale,

691
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,550
so it wasn't a complete waste.

692
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,900
Indeed.

693
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,550
But Master Puzhu

694
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,410
still hasn't sent any news.

695
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,400
I wonder if he's safe.

696
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,840
Looking at it like this,

697
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,630
the world seems so small.

698
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,580
But after staring for a while,

699
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,840
this tiny night sky

700
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,330
feels like a vortex.

701
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,910
It keeps spinning,

702
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,710
pulling people in.

703
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,690
If we died here,

704
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,020
would it count as dying together?

705
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,330
Miss Tao,

706
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,790
why did you join Fengliu Shop?
