[Episode 34]

3
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,670
What about Shei?

4
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,020
Shouldn't you be angry about that?

5
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,950
Before I answer,

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,950
I also want to ask you
a question.

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
What's the relationship

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,170
between Shei and Fang Zhou?

9
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,229
Why do you ask?

10
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,530
These 4 years,

11
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,149
I've been wandering around jianghu.

12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,870
Many people like me,

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,920
and many dislike me,

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
but hatred...

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,359
I've only seen it in Liu Yan's eyes

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
and in Shei's.

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,430
I'm not a good man,

18
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,350
but I've done nothing

19
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,630
to deserve such hatred

20
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,650
from a stranger.

21
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,670
The only explanation

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,660
is Fang Zhou.

23
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,400
She's Fang Zhou's younger sister.

24
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,150
I see.

25
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,680
So this time,

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,370
you should be angry, right?

27
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,870
No.

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
You're laughing?

29
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,370
Is...

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,790
Is this joy?

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
No.

32
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,290
Then what is it?

33
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,320
Among all these masks of yours,

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,660
none...

35
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,730
show my feelings.

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,580
It's...

37
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,000
It's impossible.

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,250
These are all the expressions I recorded.

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,930
Then tell me,

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,960
is there one

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
that can hold joy

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
and anger,

43
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,360
sorrow

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,590
and happiness,

45
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,150
love

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,079
and hate all at once?

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Is there...

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,540
such an expression in this world?

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Mr. Tang,

50
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,340
are you teasing me?

51
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,670
Knowing that Fang Zhou has family alive

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,310
brings joy.

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,980
Knowing that his family is being used

54
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,310
brings anger.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,880
Knowing that they will never be reunited

56
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,070
brings sorrow.

57
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,790
And knowing that this person

58
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,210
is Shei...

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,460
brings happiness.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,530
As for love and hate...

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,240
I don't know what to say.

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
What kind of feeling is this?

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Leader.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
This is relief.

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,630
Let me think about it.

66
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,190
Leader, take your time.

67
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,990
Shen, what should we do?

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,269
Everyone thinks

69
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,720
it's not the right time to save Foxy Tang.

[Tingyun Pavilion]

71
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,190
And that Xifang Tao...

72
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,590
She refuses to say
where the Plum Garden is.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
There's someone

74
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,070
who might know.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Who?

76
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,480
Bai Suche?

77
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,480
Once she tells you,

78
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,179
send me a message immediately.

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
And let's

80
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,350
set out together.

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
How does it feel?

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Does avenging

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
bring you joy?

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,229
People's emotions are really unpredictable.

85
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,479
Tomorrow will be Tang Lici's

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
last day.

87
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,760
Aren't you staying with Tang Lici?

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,850
These last two days,

89
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,070
I don't want to see him.

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,650
Leader, you don't understand.

91
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,650
I don't.

92
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,870
I hate him,

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I love him,

94
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,310
and I resent him.

95
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,860
I'm afraid I won't bear to do it,

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,230
and I hate myself for that.

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,160
The closer his death comes,

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,390
the stronger

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,260
this feeling becomes.

100
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,749
Leader, tomorrow you will take

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,950
Tang Lici's body?

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
Actually,

103
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,950
it's Yique Yinyang's.

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,870
I'm just an executor.

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,130
If Yique Yinyang descends,

106
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,679
you will be replaced by him,

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,870
just like Tang Lici.

108
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,240
So tomorrow will be

109
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,560
your last day too.

110
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,550
I feel sorry for you.

111
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,940
It's meaningless

112
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,310
to pity me.

113
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,390
You have curiosity,

114
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,960
but unfortunately,

115
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,270
you have no feelings.

116
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,040
You know neither love nor hate,

117
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,750
neither joy nor anger,

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
and neither fear

119
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,390
nor excitement.

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,190
It's a pity,

121
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,360
but puppets cannot feel it.

122
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,269
All your short life,

123
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,739
you've been trying to experience,

124
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,239
desperately trying to grasp
what human emotions are.

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,830
I suppose all of this

126
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,980
wasn't Yique Yinyang's command.

127
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,830
If you were only a puppet,

128
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,919
how could you have thoughts

129
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,780
beyond what your master ordered?

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,039
It's not that you can't think of

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
a name for the cat...

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,680
You just don't dare
to have anything

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
truly your own in this world.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,559
A puppet found itself

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
when dying.

136
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I guess now

137
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,300
you finally understand

138
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,119
what human regret

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
feels like.

140
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm going to deliver food to Mr. Tang.

141
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
Leader asked you to eat.

142
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,090
I've tidied up after you so many times.

143
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,530
After you finish today,

144
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,210
clean up yourself.

145
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,480
Miss Shui,

146
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,909
why did you ask to see me

147
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,240
at this hour?

148
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,510
Is the Sword Alliance really not going to
save Tang Lici?

149
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,840
We will, but right now...

150
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,319
Bad news. Something bad happened.

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,999
Shen Langhun and Chi Yun are both missing.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
They must have gone

153
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,960
to find the Plum Garden on their own.

154
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,900
Then I'll go look for them.

155
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,689
We need to find them,

156
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,269
but you need to stay in charge of the rear.

157
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,509
There's something suspicious

158
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,370
about Little Fox's injury this time.

159
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:20,960
I need you to investigate.

160
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,870
Your Highness,

161
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,840
Master Shao requests an audience.

162
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,990
Invite him in.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Chunji.

164
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Master.

165
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,439
You don't look well.

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
What happened?

167
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm a bit tired.

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,319
Master, please have a seat.

169
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Okay.

170
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,840
Just in time,

171
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,170
I made your favorite tea today.

172
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,030
Really?

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,030
Master, what did you

174
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,390
want to see me for?

175
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,619
I had something to discuss,

176
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,629
but now that I see you,

177
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,630
it's nothing.

178
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,390
After I went back,

179
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,149
I thought about what really happened

180
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,550
the day Mr. Tang got hurt.

181
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,790
Didn't I tell you

182
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,410
I was controlled by Liu Yan?

183
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,650
I don't know why

184
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,270
I ended up stabbing Mr. Tang.

185
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
Why did you have that needle?

186
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,600
Liu Yan controlled me.

187
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,910
I don't even know

188
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,990
how the needle ended up on me.

189
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Master,

190
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,100
you suspect me?

191
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,550
Chunji,

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,550
you like Mr. Tang?

193
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Yes.

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,150
Since you like him,

195
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,360
why did you do that?

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Master, why do you still not believe me?

197
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,570
With your personality,

198
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,829
if you really had a clear conscience,

199
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,790
you wouldn't feel guilty

200
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,270
or tormented over this.

201
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,789
Making a mistake in a
moment isn't a problem.

202
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,240
But you have to admit it.

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,130
I did nothing wrong.

204
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Chunji.

205
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,549
You don't understand Mr. Tang at all.

206
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,510
You have no idea

207
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,910
how exhausted he is.

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
He's doing something

209
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,550
that's impossible.

210
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,869
No one is protecting him,

211
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,959
no one ever stopped him,

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,019
and no one has told him

213
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,799
he doesn't have to live so heavily.

214
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,160
Everyone is using him,

215
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
using him to get revenge,

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
to destroy Fengliu Shop.

217
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,680
Have you ever thought about

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,859
how heavy the burden on his shoulders

219
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
really is?

220
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,270
Only I understand him.

221
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,729
If you really think you did nothing wrong,

222
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,319
why didn't you go save him?

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,909
I know that with your personality,

224
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,239
if you know Mr. Tang is in danger,

225
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,439
you will do everything possible

226
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,200
to bring him back.

227
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,549
The reason you didn't

228
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,366
isn't that you don't want to.
It's that you don't know

229
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,080
how to face Mr. Tang.

230
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
But I'm trying to make up for it.

231
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,240
If I hadn't requested reinforcements

232
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,360
from the court,

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,079
how could we have
achieved a complete victory

234
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,680
in the Battle of Mount Cloud?

235
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,130
Master.

236
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,010
Please help me keep this a secret.

237
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,660
You want me to keep it a secret?

238
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,060
If others find out,

239
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,770
no one will understand me.

240
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,810
You're such a silly disciple.

241
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,170
Silly disciple.

242
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Master.

243
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,380
Why is it that when others make mistakes,

244
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,160
they don't always get punished,

245
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
but when I make a mistake,

246
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,550
I have to suffer?

247
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
You are a princess.

248
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,450
Apart from His Majesty,

249
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,510
no one dares make you suffer.

250
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,030
What about before I became a princess?

251
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,270
The Sword Alliance

252
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,720
was never fair to me.

253
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Chunji,

254
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,790
do you remember

255
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,050
what I told you before?

256
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,650
Be a good person and do good deeds...

257
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,330
Even if it costs you something,

258
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,550
you can still be at peace.

259
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
There's nothing unfair about that,

260
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,090
because I want you

261
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
to always be a good person.

262
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,510
Your Highness.

263
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
What is it now?

264
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,319
It concerns the dignity
of the royal family.

265
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Your reputation is very important.

266
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,360
If someone wants to

267
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,960
to tarnish your reputation,

268
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
that is treason.

269
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
What do you mean?

270
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,629
My family has been
generals for generations,

271
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,830
guarding the palace.

272
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,389
The emperor of the previous
dynasty was incompetent,

273
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,909
and now His Majesty has taken the throne.

274
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,029
I've heard many things

275
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,490
that shouldn't be spoken,

276
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,270
but in the end,

277
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,350
none of them were actually said.

278
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,749
I will not allow anyone

279
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
to hurt my master!

280
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,580
I will go apologize to him.

281
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,760
If you dare harm my master,

282
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll cut your head off.

283
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Yes.

284
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,549
These past few days, apart from eating,

285
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,669
the Ghostly Peony has kept

286
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,800
putting me to sleep.

287
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,270
Waking me now

288
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,480
must mean he's ready.

289
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,840
I said I wouldn't see him tonight,

290
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,390
but somehow

291
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,590
I still wound up here.

292
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,320
You are a cat in the Plum Garden.

293
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,800
You should be smart.

294
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,999
Why do you eat

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,530
whatever anyone gives you?

296
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
Because it's you.

297
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,000
Even if it's poison,

298
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,270
it would eat it.

299
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
You and Fang Zhou

300
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,290
have the same talent.

301
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,010
You already know?

302
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Shei,

303
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,510
I'm dying.

304
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
You're not an orphan.

305
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,879
You have an older brother

306
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,270
still alive.

307
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,040
He's Fang Zhou, Chief of Zhoudi Tower

308
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,069
in Jiangnan.

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,549
After I'm gone,

310
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,270
go find him.

311
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,070
Madam,

312
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,240
could you tell me

313
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,730
how to get to Zhoudi Tower?

314
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
You asked the right person.

315
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,400
Let me tell you.
Head that way

316
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
toward Mount Li.

317
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,270
The place you're looking for

318
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,530
is up on that mountain.

319
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,720
Thank you, Madam.
You're welcome.

320
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,350
Miss.

321
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,590
Are you going to Zhoudi Tower

322
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
for something

323
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,590
or to look for someone?

324
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
No.

325
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,930
Who are you?

326
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm Fang Zhou.

327
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
Miss?

328
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,190
Are you okay?

329
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,110
Luckily,

330
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,570
it's just a sprain,
nothing serious.

331
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,559
But you should be careful when walking

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,690
these next few days.

333
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,989
You were asking about Zhoudi Tower earlier.

334
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,450
Why do you want to go there?

335
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I just...

336
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,240
read about it in a book

337
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
and got curious,

338
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,510
so I asked a few questions.

339
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,070
Is that so?

340
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,590
Thank you.

341
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
I'll be going now.

342
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Wait.

343
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Miss,

344
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,000
may I know your name?

345
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,850
I...

346
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Shei?

347
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,350
You're Shei?

348
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,610
Brother.

349
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
It's really you?

350
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Brother,

351
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
it's me.

352
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm Shei.

353
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,580
Now that we've finally reunited,

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
that's the greatest joy.

355
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,930
Being able to see you again,

356
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,570
I have no more regrets.

357
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,479
I have a lot

358
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
to tell you,

359
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,200
but there is something

360
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,220
that is at a critical point right now.

361
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Shei,

362
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,070
stay nearby for now.

363
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,580
After half a month,

364
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,750
come find me in Zhoudi Tower.

365
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,700
If I'm still there by then...

366
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
What do you mean?

367
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,090
If I happen to be away

368
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,790
by then,

369
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,800
go find Lici and the others.

370
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,310
Tell them

371
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
you're my sister,

372
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,090
and they'll let you in.

373
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Okay.

374
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm so happy to see you.

375
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,680
You know,

376
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,959
[Half a month later]

377
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
I have two juniors

378
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
I'd like to introduce you to.

379
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
I'm happy too.

380
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,490
What happened

381
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,120
in the past half a month?

382
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,180
I lost my family again.

383
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,010
Instead of listening to my story here,

384
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,399
shouldn't you be figuring out

385
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
how to get out of the Plum Garden?

386
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,530
Why should I escape?

387
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,550
What I need to do

388
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,070
isn't finished yet.

389
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,269
The time for Yique Yinyang's resurrection

390
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,270
is coming.

391
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr. Tang, do you have any last wishes?

392
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,940
I'll try my best to fulfill them.

393
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,760
I've been thinking...

394
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,879
Tuo Dragon relies on
the power of Tianren Realm

395
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
to survive.

396
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,710
When it came to Shenzhou,

397
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,590
it was like a fish out of water.

398
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,480
So why is it still able to use its power?

399
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,850
Now I finally understand.

400
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
It's you

401
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
who has been continuously

402
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:15,060
feeding energy into the bronze tree.

403
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
It's those black crystals.

404
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,960
What a pity, Mr. Tang.

405
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,399
If it weren't for the fact that the timing

406
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,719
of Yique Yinyang's
resurrection cannot be missed,

407
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,350
I would have learned more

408
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,720
from you.

409
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,069
Those who take the Blood Ghost Pill

410
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,639
will produce a black crystal

411
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,840
called Black Tuli inside their bodies.

412
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,879
It's the best nourishment
for the bronze tree.

413
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
Now there's enough of it.

414
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,460
As long as we get your body,

415
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,590
Yique Yinyang

416
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,000
can be resurrected.

417
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,750
Well, since it's my body,

418
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,640
who will survive in the end...

419
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,070
Me,

420
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
you,

421
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,880
or Yique Yinyang?

422
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,120
It will be

423
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,159
a combination of me and Yique Yinyang.

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,490
He'll have my memories,

425
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,250
and your consciousness

426
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
will be erased.

427
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,440
Why is your consciousness
not the one being erased?

428
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,159
You don't know how to appreciate
the delicacies of the human world,

429
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,759
nor do you know what you live for.

430
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,890
How do you like them?

431
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,570
All these dishes are good.

432
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,679
But I don't understand
what makes them good.

433
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,310
Your memories

434
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:26,790
are useless to him,

435
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,440
because

436
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,200
you're just a puppet.

437
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,830
Therefore,

438
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,930
once he awakens,

439
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,400
you will end up

440
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,810
vanishing into nothing.

441
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,720
You are right.

442
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,469
Since you don't want to lose your body,

443
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,639
and I don't want to lose my consciousness,

444
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
we can work together.

445
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,399
Inside the bronze tree,

446
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
there's a Sky-Fallen Stone

447
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,160
that traveled here with you.

448
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,340
Through it,

449
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,270
we can trace back through time.

450
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,660
Let's go back to the world's origin

451
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,350
and kill Yique Yinyang.

452
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,710
You really are

453
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,400
a presumptuous puppet.

454
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
However,

455
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,309
once I reach Tianren Realm,

456
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,770
my power will be restored.

457
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,800
Aren't you afraid I'll turn around
and kill you?

458
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,310
Also,

459
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,900
why don't you go yourself?

460
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,620
That's a good question.

461
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,029
I've thought about it

462
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,030
before.

463
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,029
But that's Tianren Realm.

464
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,290
It's heavily guarded.

465
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,509
If we work together,

466
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,310
nothing can go wrong.

467
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,550
Is this reason

468
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
good enough?

469
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,830
I'll trust you this once.

470
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,939
I'll send you back to the moment

471
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,200
before Ye Mo escaped from Tianren Realm.

472
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,360
Are you ready?

473
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,520
You'd better not play tricks.

474
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,590
[Tianren Realm]

475
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
Tianren Realm?

476
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,550
I'm back.

477
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,920
The power of the Rebirth Scroll

478
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,010
has also returned.

479
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,580
The bone-washing silver bracelet is gone?

480
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Ye Mo,

481
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
where are you?

482
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,410
Holy Son!

483
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
This child

484
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,639
is a miracle created with the power

485
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,700
of the entire realm

486
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,110
and also our last chance.

487
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,650
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

488
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,000
and save everyone.

489
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,230
She is Ye Mo's mother?

490
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,320
The Holy Son is about to be born.

491
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,820
I will guard the Qi-gathering Formation

492
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,640
and will not leave the tower.

493
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,829
Holy Son!

494
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,960
Goddess, take care.

495
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,110
So

496
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,350
Ye Mo is not born yet.

497
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,150
Escort the Goddess back to Guanxing Tower.

498
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
What's...

499
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,060
wrong with me?

500
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,670
Greetings, Goddess.

501
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,010
Goddess, thank you for
carrying the Holy Fetus.

502
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,830
She is so respected.

503
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,470
Why is there no record of her

504
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,350
in the Tianren Realm's

505
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:10,480
scripture scrolls?

506
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,589
Could it be that after Ye Mo was born,

507
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,590
she disappeared?

508
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,959
And even traces of her existence

509
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
were erased?

510
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Wait.

511
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,029
The medicines for the Goddess

512
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,229
must be handled with care.

513
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,990
I'll check them first.

514
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,180
You've got some nerve.

515
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,170
As a General of Guanxing Tower,

516
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,980
how dare you steal while on duty?

517
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,300
Don't act smart in front of me.

518
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,270
Or I'll strip you of your powers.

519
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Got it?

520
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,790
What are you talking about?

521
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,030
Still acting?

522
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,160
Stop pretending.

523
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,960
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

524
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,610
What...

525
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,510
What are you talking about?

526
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
Please spare my life.

527
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,999
I am the leader of the Garuda Clan.

528
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,639
I was ordered to guard Guanxing Tower.

529
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
I was wrong

530
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,050
to steal the offerings.

531
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,350
I'm really sorry.

532
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,090
Then why did you steal the offerings?

533
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,589
Since the Tianren Five Declines began,

534
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,850
everyone has changed.

535
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,410
People can actually grow old.

536
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,210
I am the leader of Jinyu Tribe,

537
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,790
only 300 years old,

538
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,950
yet I already look like this.

539
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,110
Many of my people have died.

540
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,349
Now we can only wait for
the Holy Son to be born

541
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,439
and end the Tianren Five Declines

542
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,570
so we can stop aging.

543
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,550
Until then,

544
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,199
we can only sustain ourselves
by secretly eating offerings.

545
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,830
Outside the Tianren Realm,

546
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,680
humans

547
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,400
naturally grow old.

548
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,960
My Lord, have you been to Shenzhou?

549
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,829
I heard the people there

550
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,490
live in peace and prosperity.

551
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
Is that true?

552
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,310
Yes.

553
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,589
Now, Shenzhou

554
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,790
is still full of life.

555
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,269
The Yique Yinyang
Rebellion hasn't happened.

556
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,070
If I can

557
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,470
kill Yique Yinyang here,

558
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,880
everyone will survive,

559
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
including Fang Zhou.

560
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,309
I am the divine official

561
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,770
in charge of criminal law.

562
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,029
I was ordered by the Asura King

563
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,230
to investigate the missing offerings.

564
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,640
I tracked the fugitive Ghostly Peony here

565
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,199
to investigate his whereabouts.

566
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,309
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

567
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,349
If you don't want to die of old age

568
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,330
in the heavenly prison,

569
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:59,440
then listen to me.

570
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Give me the golden elixir first.

571
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Yes.

572
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,270
Go to the library now

573
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,900
and look something up for me.

574
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,320
I have other arrangements.

575
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,250
My Lord,

576
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,239
I'll use our secret method to talk to you.

577
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,570
It won't cause trouble.

578
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,439
The current Goddess

579
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
was chosen from the Dragon Clan.

580
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,010
They can control the dragons.

581
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,439
Every day at midnight, the
Goddess begins meditating

582
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,099
to absorb the Tianren Realm's energy

583
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,900
in order to nurture the Holy Son.

584
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,199
After giving birth to the Holy Son,

585
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,399
the Goddess will die

586
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,260
due to the depletion of her power.

587
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,850
So the birth of the Holy Son

588
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,749
is actually his mother's calamity,

589
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,790
whether he is me or Ye Mo.

590
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Do you suspect

591
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,999
that Ghostly Peony has
sneaked into Guanxing Tower

592
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,499
and that the Goddess might be in danger?

593
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,980
Focus on your task.

594
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Find out the truth

595
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
about that.

596
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,870
I was sent by Lord Garuda

597
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,830
to deliver the missing offerings.

598
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,150
Are you worried?

599
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,790
Am I the only one

600
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,630
who can hear this voice?

601
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,110
Take it.

602
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,870
Don't be so nervous.

603
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
Could she

604
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,719
have sensed

605
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,180
my emotional disturbance

606
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,080
and thought I intended
to seize the offerings?

607
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,920
You can leave now.

608
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,790
Wait.

609
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
You stay here.

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Guardian goddesses,

611
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,460
I don't need your protection right now.

612
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,590
You may leave now.

613
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,270
Yes.

614
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
You shouldn't be here.

615
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,790
It gets cold at night.

616
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,530
What about you?

617
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Aren't you cold?

618
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
I...

619
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm used to it.

620
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,919
This is where the
heavenly wall is thinnest.

621
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,669
It's the only place in Tianren Realm

622
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,320
where one can see the stars.

623
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I like it here.

624
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Look.

625
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,790
Stars

626
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,699
can see everyone's fate.

627
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,630
Even your child's?

628
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,199
I never looked at him.

629
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,989
If I do,

630
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,260
I'll become obsessed.

631
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,590
Kid,

632
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,230
come here.

633
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,959
This is the swaddling cloth

634
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,420
I made for my unborn child.

635
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,050
It can keep you warm.

636
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,699
It gets very cold here at night.

637
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,880
Put it on.

638
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,630
I'm not cold.

639
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm not a kid either.

640
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
It's time.

641
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,170
I'll begin my meditation.

642
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,889
The Dragon Goddess is about
to begin her meditation.

643
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,319
Call the guards at once

644
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,380
to join us in guarding the formation.

645
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,590
I didn't expect

646
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,800
Ye Mo's mother

647
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,190
to be so kind.

648
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,030
Why do I feel

649
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,740
something strange when I see her?

650
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
My Lord.

651
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,350
Did you find it?

652
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,570
Yes.

653
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,879
This secret scroll records

654
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,999
a hidden cultivation art of Tianren Realm,

655
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,880
the Soul Transfer Technique.

656
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,210
It sounds just like the one you described.

657
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,930
I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

658
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,419
Open the Heaven Halo,

659
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,159
channel the energy of the earth veins,

660
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,409
and use the power of the Rebirth Scroll

661
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,670
to cleanse the miasma.

662
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,230
As expected,

663
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,879
the Heaven-Halo Technique is
the Soul Transfer Technique.

664
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,549
When cast upon heaven and earth,

665
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,350
it can purify the world's filth.

666
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,600
When used on a person,

667
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,190
it can disrupt

668
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,090
or stabilize their energy flow

669
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,880
and even process their body

670
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,030
when their energy

671
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
is in chaos.

672
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,049
Heaven-Halo Technique

673
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,910
is the key to restarting the soul.

674
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,210
What will happen

675
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,550
if I use it

676
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
on Ghostly Peony?

677
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Come out.

678
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,610
Don't worry.

679
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,210
I've sent them all away.

680
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,629
You knew I would come again?

681
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,560
Aren't you afraid I might hurt you?

682
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,670
I don't know why,

683
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
but I feel

684
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,720
a strange familiarity with you.

685
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,710
And I can sense

686
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,880
that you mean me no harm.

687
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you want to see the stars tonight?

688
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
Since yesterday,

689
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
I've been regretting

690
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,620
that you didn't see

691
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,100
this beautiful sky.

692
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,710
It's only as wide as a well opening here,

693
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,670
but the starry sky I've seen before

694
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,030
filled the whole world.

695
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Really?

696
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,440
I'm so happy for you,

697
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,470
kid.

698
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
I told you.

699
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm not a kid.

700
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,760
Stop calling me kid.

701
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,890
I was wrong.

702
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,850
You're no longer a kid.

703
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,020
I shouldn't call you that.

704
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,280
Then your mother

705
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,229
must have been happy

706
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,400
to watch you grow up.

707
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,479
Not everyone has their mother by their side

708
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
as they grow,

709
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,030
and not everyone

710
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,010
is meant to become a mother.

711
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,149
As the leader of the Dragon Clan,

712
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,350
your cultivation is a path of solitude.

713
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Yet now,

714
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,839
you've formed a bond

715
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,900
with another life.

716
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,960
Because of this child,

717
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
every time the midnight bell tolls,

718
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,630
you're frozen in ice,

719
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,110
becoming

720
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,520
the most fragile person in this world.

721
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,440
He...

722
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,070
is harming you.

723
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
I don't think so.

724
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
On the contrary, it's because of him

725
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,010
that I've seen a greater

726
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,130
and more beautiful sky.

727
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,630
How ridiculous.

728
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,879
The starry sky you speak of

729
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,439
is no bigger than the opening of a well.

730
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,300
For that tiny patch of starry sky,

731
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,879
you've destroyed countless others' chance

732
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,110
to see it.

733
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,710
You all think

734
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
he's the savior.

735
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
But you don't know

736
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,480
that once he's born,

737
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,709
he'll fall into darkness
and become a devil.

738
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,150
Not only will he kill you,

739
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,060
erasing you from the world's memory,

740
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,799
but he'll also cause chaos in Shenzhou

741
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,349
and bring endless calamities

742
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,140
to the people there.

743
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,920
Let me tell you,

744
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
your child's name

745
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,230
is Ye Mo.

746
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,630
The reason I came here...

747
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,190
is...

748
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,030
Wait.

749
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,220
Ye Mo isn't my child.

750
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,280
Didn't he...

751
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,589
leave the Tianren Realm

752
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,590
years ago?

753
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,070
The name

754
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,150
I gave my child

755
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,300
is Ajibanr Tang Jia.

756
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,320
Holy Son.

757
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,880
This child

758
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,440
is a miracle

759
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,509
created with the power of the entire realm.

760
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,590
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

761
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,850
and save everyone!

762
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,480
I don't know why,

763
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
but I feel

764
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,090
a strange familiarity with you.

765
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,790
Kid.

766
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,110
What's your name?

767
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Ajibanr

768
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Tang Jia.

769
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,550
We meet again,

770
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,190
Ajibanr Tang Jia.

771
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,510
It looks like

772
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,060
I'm not the person you're looking for.

773
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,650
Because Ye Mo left,

774
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,210
I was chosen as the Goddess.

775
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,030
And my child

776
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,110
will become the new Holy Son.

777
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,310
The moment he's born,

778
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,170
he must leave the tower to cultivate.

779
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,590
And I

780
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,540
will never be able to leave this prison.

781
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,540
I'm destined never to meet him

782
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,070
or watch him grow.

783
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,170
And I will never have the chance

784
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,210
to know

785
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,610
what kind of person

786
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,480
my child will become.

787
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,110
I hope he knows

788
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,000
that his birth

789
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,190
is not a calamity.

790
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,030
He'll be born

791
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,440
with his mother's love,

792
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,710
coming into the world

793
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,970
through decay and decline.

794
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,189
This is a magical artifact

795
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,990
nurtured with the Dragon Pearl,

796
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,999
the bone-washing silver bracelet,

797
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,810
kept for my unborn child.

798
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,760
If you ever meet him,

799
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,230
please give it to him.

800
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,450
Are you okay?

801
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,839
The Goddess got attacked!

802
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,100
Capture the assassin!

803
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,330
Go!

804
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,520
The energy of Tianren
Realm is about to overflow.

805
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,970
Come with me.

806
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,250
I can save you.

807
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,610
Go.

808
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,180
Catch the assassin!

809
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,320
Tang Lici, are you crazy?

810
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,550
I'm trying to kill Yique Yinyang.

811
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,510
A few pieces of wood

812
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,840
want to be human?

813
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Die!

814
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,030
Mother.
