00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,570
Sir, you're sweating.

4
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,450
Is it because you're exhausted,

5
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,810
or because...

6
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,720
you're nervous?

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,610
You're pressing on my legs.

8
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
You broke your leg?

9
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,170
Why didn't you push me away?

10
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,639
You're injured.

11
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,010
I was afraid of hurting you again.

12
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,290
You don't have to force yourself.

13
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,090
Are we going to starve to death here?

14
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,520
Or...

15
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,980
Master Puzhu, do you think

16
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,150
dying together with me,
the West Palace Chief

17
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,120
of Fengliu Shop,

18
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,600
would stain your reputation?

19
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,750
I won't die.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
And neither will you.

21
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,570
I'll go find something to eat.

22
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,280
Master Puzhu,

23
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,170
do you eat meat?

24
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,820
Master Puzhu hasn't returned yet.

25
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,160
The Sword Alliance has lost a major force.

26
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,030
Not just that.

27
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,910
Aside from this map,

28
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,560
which might not even be real,

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,710
we know nothing

30
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,610
about this Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

31
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,360
And they know nothing

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
about us either.

33
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,400
They also want to know

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
how many weapons,

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
how many supplies,

36
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,840
and

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,760
how many experts we have.

38
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,310
Tomorrow,

39
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
send disciples good at lightness skill

40
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,030
to scout

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,530
and pretend to be alone.

42
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,060
Then have Master Shangguan

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,590
lead a team to lie in ambush from behind,

44
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,310
draw out the people of Fengliu Shop,

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,840
and capture them for questioning.

46
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,640
Leave it to me.

47
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,710
Master Pu,

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
how's the antidote

49
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,430
I asked you to prepare?

50
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,160
Don't worry.

51
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,190
If I can't make it, I'll never call myself

52
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,520
the Poison Saint again.

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,890
Master Shao,

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,190
Sword Masters...

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Mr. Tang.

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,670
Our ship from Sword King City has arrived.

57
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,840
Everyone,

58
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,920
in this operation against Fengliu Shop,

59
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,630
everyone

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,600
must follow the plan.

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,510
No unauthorized actions.

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,870
No going in alone.

63
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes!

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,310
Mr. Yu,

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,300
do you have any questions?

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,390
No.

67
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,930
Mr. Tang, bad news.

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,050
Something's wrong.

69
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,310
Senior Zhong,

70
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,830
can we really do this?

71
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,870
Mr. Tang said

72
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,430
we must not leave the group
without authorization.

73
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,560
But Master also said

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,280
someone needs to scout ahead

75
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,040
to verify whether the map is real.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,830
If we can find

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,030
useful information,

78
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,310
it will help the Sword Alliance.

79
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,040
Back at Shanfeng Branch,

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,390
it was always you leading us.

81
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,250
After you left,

82
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,680
no one ever gave us
important assignments again.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,140
We were almost reduced to doing chores.

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,000
When I return to Shanfeng Branch,

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,190
I won't let

86
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,250
this happen again.

87
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,040
Let me tell you.

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
Last time I led a team,

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,510
-Hide!
-and caught several of them.

90
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,000
Really?

91
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,659
That's impressive.

92
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,270
We got several boxes of treasures.

93
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll take you along next time.

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Great.

95
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,610
No problem.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,310
Let's go!

97
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,040
Follow them!

98
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,570
Let's go!

99
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,070
Hurry!

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Strange.

101
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,470
They're not moving fast.

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,330
Why can't we catch up with them?

103
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,640
Something's wrong.

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,050
Everyone, retreat!

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,650
Since you're here already,

106
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,020
why retreat?

107
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,070
It's him?

108
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,780
Everyone, run!

109
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,200
Split up and run in different directions!

110
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,310
Blood Begonias,

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,200
bloom.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,420
There's no escape.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,190
He's toying with us.

114
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,510
This has nothing to do with them.

115
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,710
You didn't kill them,

116
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,560
which proves your target is me!

117
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,240
Let them go!

118
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,880
Dr. Liu!

119
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,750
Master,

120
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,040
this is Dr. Liu.

121
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm in a good mood today.

122
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,159
If you come over yourself,

123
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,310
I'll let them go.

124
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,480
You, the mighty head of Fengliu Shop,

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,890
actually don't keep your word?

126
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,010
Unlike Tang Lici,

127
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,430
I always keep my word.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,070
Seven days after the flowers wither,

129
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,020
the poison will wear off,

130
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,820
and they'll wake up on their own.

131
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,820
However,

132
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,190
you...

133
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,870
know me?

134
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,799
Let me formally introduce myself.

135
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,700
My name is Liu Yan.

136
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,360
Senior Zhong!

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,360
Senior Zhong!

138
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Senior Zhong!

139
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,390
Zhong!

140
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,360
-Heroine!
-Senior Zhong!

141
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Zhong!

142
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
-Ms. Zhong!
-Senior Zhong!

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,480
-Search carefully!
-Zhong!

144
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Gu.

145
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,510
Earlier,

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
a strange thick fog appeared here.

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,650
The wild geese wouldn't come near.

148
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,690
One of my disciples

149
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,240
saw from a distance,
riding on a wild goose,

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
that Ms. Zhong

151
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,470
was coming this way with people.

152
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,080
Gu!

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,670
Yu!

154
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,750
Yu.

155
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,920
Master Jiang.

156
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,550
Yu, you're finally here.

157
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,150
We still

158
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,350
haven't found Zhong.

159
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,080
I'm afraid something happened to her.

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,950
Don't worry yet.

161
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,270
We'll definitely find her.

162
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's split up and search.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,530
Alright.

164
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,200
Let's go!

165
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,630
Everyone, spread out

166
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,360
and search carefully!

167
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
-Look carefully!
-Zhong!

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
Senior Zhong!

169
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,200
Follow me this way!

170
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
-Senior Zhong! Senior Zhong!
-Zhong!

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,630
Senior Zhong!

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Senior Zhong!

173
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,150
Senior Zhong!

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,550
Senior Zhong!

175
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,630
Senior Zhong!

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,030
Zhong!

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,790
Zhong!

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Zhong!

179
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,910
Not her.

180
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,080
Zhong!

181
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,390
Zhong!

182
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,070
There are drag marks here.

183
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,120
-It looks like Fengliu Shop
-Zhong!

184
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,180
dragged them here.

185
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,480
Zhong!

186
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,120
Gu!

187
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,670
Gu!

188
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,440
Zhong!

189
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,150
Zhong's not here!

190
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,050
Don't panic.

191
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,550
Master Jiang.

192
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,810
Look at this.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't touch it.

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,770
It should be a curse bug.

195
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,810
Take it back

196
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,170
and have Mr. Tang identify it.

197
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,690
It's Liu Yan!

198
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,260
Liu Yan is skilled at using curse bugs!

199
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,810
So,

200
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,920
Ms. Zhong

201
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,920
might have been taken by Liu Yan?

202
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Tang,

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,590
what should we do now?

204
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,190
[Man on earth, good at birth.]

205
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,030
First, call back the search team.

206
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,320
Then how are we supposed
to rescue Ms. Zhong?

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,030
Liu Yan only took Ms. Zhong

208
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,200
as a hostage.

209
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,670
He won't kill her now.

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
Liu Yan uses curse bugs
with deadly precision.

211
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Disciples affected by the Blood Begonias

212
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,270
need 7 days to wake;

213
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,600
if forced awake,

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
they'll die.

215
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,310
This is a challenge from Liu Yan.

216
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,390
What does it mean?

217
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,800
A life for a life.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,390
Seven days is the deadline.

219
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,720
If we can't rescue Ms. Zhong
within 7 days,

220
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,440
the disciples will survive,

221
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,600
and she will die.

222
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,760
That's right.

223
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,740
Seven days—

224
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,670
that's the challenge I set for them.

225
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,480
I don't understand.

226
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
Master, why did you

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,930
give them 7 days?

228
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,900
If we attack first,

229
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,010
the initiative is in their hands.

230
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,830
But by setting a challenge

231
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,860
with a deadline,

232
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,720
people get anxious,

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,790
afraid,

234
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,720
and they stall.

235
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,780
For life-and-death matters,

236
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,960
people will wait
until the last moment to decide,

237
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
and the initiative will swing back to us.

238
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,790
Seven days

239
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,490
is enough to create cracks among them.

240
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,510
I see.

241
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,360
Whether they decide in the end

242
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,670
to save her or not,

243
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,910
the unity Tang Lici wants

244
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,780
will be broken.

245
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,330
The Sword Alliance's biggest problem

246
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,990
is its internal instability,

247
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,030
with no binding interests
and only empty talk of justice.

248
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,960
We'll start

249
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,360
with their disagreements,

250
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,220
pry them apart,

251
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,450
and let the alliance

252
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,820
collapse from within.

253
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:44,870
Master,

254
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm back.

255
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Chunji, you're back.

256
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,760
You did a great job on this recon

257
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,360
of Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

258
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,030
You made a great contribution
to the Sword Alliance.

259
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,390
Even Mr. Tang says

260
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
that without Ms. Zhong,

261
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,150
we'd have had no chance
of winning this battle.

262
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,620
This is simply my duty.

263
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,550
Those 6 Sword Masters,

264
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,790
hearing you faced Liu Yan's brutal torture

265
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,080
with unflinching courage

266
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
and defended the Sword Alliance's honor,

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,670
were utterly

268
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,840
impressed.

269
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
They all begged me

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,390
to immediately restore you

271
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,190
as the Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

272
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,280
Looks like this time,

273
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,150
you finally made it through.

274
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,160
It's been 3 days.

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
How long can you hold out?

276
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,440
Just...

277
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,480
kill me.

278
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,220
This time,

279
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,510
are you serious?

280
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,040
I don't want to kill you.

281
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,420
I deliberately set a trap to catch you.

282
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
If I let you die easily,

283
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,660
what would be the point?

284
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,830
Think about it—

285
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,630
the top heroine among the righteous sects,

286
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,430
Zhong Chunji,

287
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,230
the beloved disciple of Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

288
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,080
out of selfishness and recklessness,

289
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,920
drags everyone to their deaths

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,340
and ends up
the target of the world's scorn.

291
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,270
What a splendid drama.

292
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,270
No.

293
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,300
You won't succeed.

294
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
My master

295
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,010
will surely see through your plot.

296
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
He won't...

297
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,440
What?

298
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,670
He won't come to save you?

299
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,510
Wouldn't that be even sadder?

300
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,480
Ms. Zhong,

301
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,330
you truly are
Master Shao's beloved disciple.

302
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,730
You know him well.

303
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,670
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will surely attack

304
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,930
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

305
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,730
but a well-prepared attack

306
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,510
is completely different

307
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,870
from a rash one

308
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,700
launched just to save you.

309
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,970
Shao Yanping is a smart man.

310
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,800
Sacrificing your life

311
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,120
to save the Sword Alliance
from major losses

312
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
is too good a deal for him.

313
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,910
Anyway,

314
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,800
it's simply because
you're not worth enough.

315
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,320
Tang Lici is involved
in the Zhoudi Tower case,

316
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,390
yet Shao Yanping

317
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,200
showed him mercy

318
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,490
and even honored him as the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance.

319
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,550
But what about you?

320
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,510
The great heroine Zhong Chunji,

321
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,000
Chief of Shanfeng Branch—

322
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,440
all of these titles

323
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,470
are his reward to you.

324
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,480
None of them

325
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
truly belongs to you.

326
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,200
That's why you fight so hard

327
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
to defend him,

328
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,150
because you know, without him,

329
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,600
you are nothing.

330
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,750
You...

331
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,730
are too weak.

332
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,200
If you think I'm so worthless,

333
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,920
then why waste your breath?

334
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,030
Kill me already!

335
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm standing up for you.

336
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,100
After all you've done
for the Sword Alliance,

337
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,360
they still won't make a single sacrifice

338
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,600
for you.

339
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,830
Who am I, Zhong Chunji,

340
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,270
to make a monster like you

341
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,030
pity me, Master?

342
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,320
In your heart,

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
there's also a monster.

344
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,280
Otherwise, how would you

345
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,480
have acted on your own

346
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,570
and fallen right into my trap?

347
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,270
I have one as well.

348
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,440
But I've already

349
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,670
let mine out without shame.

350
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,870
While you, Ms. Zhong,

351
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,050
are still putting on a facade.

352
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,270
Ms. Zhong,

353
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,950
you are just an ordinary person.

354
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,510
Why do you hold yourself

355
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,040
to the standards of a saint?

356
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,080
Cry when you want to cry.

357
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,720
Laugh when you want to laugh.

358
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,520
When you're afraid,

359
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,630
allow yourself to be afraid.

360
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,100
And when you want something,

361
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,120
reach out and take it.

362
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,600
No rush.

363
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,120
There are still 4 days.

364
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,630
Ms. Zhong, if you want to die,

365
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,770
waiting for 4 more days
won't make a difference,

366
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,240
right?

367
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,570
If you survive these 4 days,

368
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll give you a great gift,

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
a gift that allows you to cast aside

370
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,030
your identity as Shao Yanping's disciple

371
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,920
and still

372
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,960
command respect.

373
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,670
You can take a gamble.

Master Shao,

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,340
it's time to go to Wanhua Hall.

424
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,890
Third Brother,

425
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,590
of course we have to fight,

426
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,550
but if we fight now,

427
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,720
we'll fall right into his trap.

428
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,880
Since we're going to fight anyway,

429
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,510
isn't it the same
whether we fight now or later?

430
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,270
If you ask me,

431
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,020
it's all that girl's fault

432
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,490
for acting on her own.

433
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,110
At a time like this,

434
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,110
you're still blaming Ms. Zhong?

435
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,510
Everyone, please calm down.

436
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,770
Let's talk patiently.

437
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,590
Besides,

438
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,680
isn't Ms. Zhong's life

439
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,400
a life?

440
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,330
We still have 4 days.

441
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,410
There's still time to vote.

442
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,050
Right?

443
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,510
We've been arguing for 3 days.

444
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,780
Have we reached an agreement?

445
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,420
Master Shao,

446
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,070
Mr. Tang,

447
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,820
you're here.

448
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,410
It's been 3 days.

449
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,110
Three days of waiting—

450
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,180
I understand how you feel.

451
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,360
Chunji was captured,

452
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,960
Master Puzhu is missing,

453
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,550
and the map of the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion—

454
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,110
all show that Fengliu Shop

455
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,310
has already set a trap

456
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,370
and is just waiting for us to fall in.

457
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,640
Zhong Chunji

458
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,720
is my beloved disciple.

459
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,700
But every life

460
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,590
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance

461
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,790
is equally precious.

462
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,830
I...

463
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,830
cannot put everyone at risk

464
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,090
in this circumstance.

465
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,220
Therefore,

466
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,830
I have decided

467
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,930
to postpone our attack
on the Peony Pavilion.

468
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,350
What?

469
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,170
Master Shao,

470
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,850
while we're thinking

471
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,880
how we won't fall into

472
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,110
Liu Yan's trap,

473
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,360
actually,

474
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,920
we are already in it.

475
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,720
Liu Yan

476
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,480
wants to put us in a dilemma;

477
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,030
he wants us...

478
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,930
Isn't that enough?

479
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,160
-To argue endlessly...
-At a time like this,

480
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,960
you are still blaming Ms. Zhong?

481
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,680
And...

482
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,730
tear ourselves apart.

483
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,640
I consider myself the best in the world.

484
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,270
The harder something looks

485
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,400
to have it both ways,

486
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,670
the more determined I am to achieve it.

487
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,950
I will not only attack
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

488
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,510
but also rescue Ms. Zhong.

489
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,400
Tang Lici,

490
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,030
now is not the time

491
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,360
for you to play the hero.

492
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
Don't act impulsively,

493
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,750
Mr. Tang.

494
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,240
I'm not playing the hero

495
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,640
nor acting impulsively.

496
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,800
Master Shao,

497
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,400
since we've decided
to attack Fengliu Shop,

498
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,160
if we allow delays

499
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,590
simply because

500
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,370
the plan is disrupted,

501
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,830
the longer we stall,

502
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,590
the deeper the unrest and suspicion

503
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,590
within the Sword Alliance

504
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,480
will grow.

505
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,310
They seized one chance

506
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,160
against us,

507
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,160
so they'll certainly seize

508
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
a second.

509
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,260
This is my first point.

510
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,880
Second,

511
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,650
Ms. Zhong is Master Shao's disciple.

512
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,140
Master Shao worries that if he

513
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,000
lets everyone risk themselves
to rescue her,

514
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,440
he'll put other disciples in danger.

515
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,840
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

516
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,070
Ms. Zhong is also a disciple
of the Sword Alliance

517
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,600
and a major force within it.

518
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,680
If Master Shao won't even rescue

519
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,510
his own disciple,

520
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,240
what kind of a heartless leader

521
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,400
will he appear to be

522
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,270
in the eyes

523
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,800
of the other disciples
in the Sword Alliance?

524
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,200
Third,

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
even if Liu Yan
has set an inescapable trap,

526
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,160
whether the Sword Alliance takes action
or not,

527
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,760
my friends

528
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,110
and I

529
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,090
will go to Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

530
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,550
to rescue Ms. Zhong—

531
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,550
because

532
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,590
she's one of us.

533
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,830
We are willing to go with you!

534
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,590
Mr. Tang,

535
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,160
thank you.

536
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,920
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,590
That woman is really tough.

538
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,360
I'll work myself to death

539
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,920
before I kill her.

540
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,280
Thank you for your help,
East Palace Chief.

541
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,790
Congratulations, Ms. Zhong.

542
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,930
Master sent me to bring you a gift.

543
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,520
Thank you.

544
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,780
How many days have we been trapped here?

545
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,480
Today is the 6th day.

546
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,070
It's been six days already,

547
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,530
and no one has found us yet.

548
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,890
Let me help you.

549
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,630
Sir, don't be so formal.

550
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,680
Is it good?

551
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,070
That's the last fruit

552
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,550
I could pick.

553
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,000
I can't use my inner strength,

554
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,260
and your leg's broken.

555
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,100
I want to support you
so we can go look for food together.

556
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,750
Please.

557
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,680
These fruits

558
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,030
aren't enough for us.

559
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,550
Besides,

560
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,940
I've grown sick
of eating them these past few days.

561
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,530
Catch a couple of fish.

562
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
We can grill them.

563
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,090
I won't eat them.

564
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,140
Miss Tao, please go ahead.

565
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,110
You...

566
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,060
Fish are lives.

567
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,960
So am I.

568
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,270
If I starve to death

569
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,880
because you don't want to kill them,

570
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,940
wouldn't that mean

571
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,750
I die because of you?

572
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,710
Happy now?

573
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,630
Sir, you're really amusing.

574
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,110
Much more amusing than

575
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,040
when we were chess partners.

576
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,510
Amusing?

577
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,240
You know once I recover,

578
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,570
you'll be the one to die.

579
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,200
You're truly...

580
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,920
amusingly stupid.

581
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
You never actually wanted

582
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,240
to kill me.

583
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,180
Instead,
you've been forcing me to kill you.

584
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
Why?

585
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,350
Do you know what I like, Sir?

586
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,440
I like watching people fall.

587
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,990
All it takes is a moment's hesitation,

588
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,160
a fleeting thought.

589
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,480
They could've said no,

590
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,500
but they couldn't resist temptation.

591
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,170
And just like that,

592
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,550
they walk to

593
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,110
the cliff's edge,

594
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,090
lose their footing,

595
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,370
and fall into an endless abyss,

596
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,240
never to climb back up,

597
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,590
never to see the sky again.

598
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,030
Don't you think

599
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,480
that's amusing?

600
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Captivating.

601
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,890
Miss Tao, you find this amusing?

602
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,830
Sir, do you think

603
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,490
I deserve to die even more now?

604
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,030
I don't think that

605
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,110
once someone takes a wrong path,

606
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,670
they can't turn back.

607
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Sir, are you saying

608
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,790
I should turn back

609
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,510
before it's too late?

610
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,770
Everyone has desires,

611
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,250
just as the Evil Pill
awakens people's cravings.

612
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,510
It's never too late

613
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
to find your way back.

614
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,170
Just turn back,

615
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,230
and you'll see the shore.

616
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,950
Everyone,

617
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,870
this attack on Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

618
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,620
will be extremely difficult.

619
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,000
Everyone must hold their positions

620
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,060
and follow orders.

621
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,510
We'll infiltrate

622
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,310
through the northern waterway,

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,670
relying primarily
on Master Jiang's Falcon Unit

624
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,130
for overall observation and early warning.

625
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,880
Master Shao,

626
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,860
Deputy Lord Yu,

627
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,420
you'll lead the Leopard Unit
as the vanguard,

628
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,310
breaching enemy lines
and clearing obstacles.

629
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,560
Master Cheng, Mr. Gu,

630
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
you'll lead the Black Tortoise Unit

631
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,860
forward steadily.

632
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,040
Stay alert.

633
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,910
The six Sword Masters will guard the rear

634
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,110
to prevent ambushes.

635
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
All units, keep pace.

636
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,260
If you're blocked, call for support.

637
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,560
Lici,

638
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,280
you're always trying to prove

639
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,540
you can do everything,

640
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,120
right?

641
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,540
There's thick fog?

642
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,350
Why is there miasma all of a sudden?

643
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,560
Send the signal.

644
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,520
There's miasma spreading from the north.

645
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,780
All ships, stay close.

646
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,690
Beware of ambushes.

647
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,800
Message from the Falcon Unit.

648
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,060
There's poisonous miasma approaching.

649
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,520
Pass down the order.

650
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,670
All disciples, take your antidote.

651
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes.

652
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,130
Did Foxy Tang lie to me?

653
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,040
Is this mission

654
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,370
really that important?

655
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,040
Why do I always feel like

656
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,830
he's doing

657
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,890
something more important than this?

658
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,750
The mission is complete.

659
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Where's my stuff?

660
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,960
As long as you give it to me,

661
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,160
reversing fate

662
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,450
or turning back time won't be a problem.

663
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,520
Qiaoyi Qiankun?

664
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,300
How about this?

665
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,030
I'll give you another mission.

666
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,040
Okay.

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Why is he here?

668
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,630
And why is he running errands for a kid?

669
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,720
Everyone, be careful.

670
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,580
We've entered the Burial Forest.

671
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,210
What kind of flower is this?

672
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,190
It's Bone-Soaking Lotus,

673
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,650
grown in poisonous water.

674
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,050
Deputy Lord Yu,

675
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,440
tell everyone in the fleet to stay alert

676
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,300
and avoid falling into the water.

677
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,720
What's that?

678
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,930
The lotuses contain Man-eating Curse Bugs.

679
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,980
Stay alert!

680
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,449
Twin Sabers front the precious shrine;

681
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,110
Dragon gleam makes galaxies decline!

682
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,790
The poisonous miasma has cleared.

683
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,840
Form up and scout!

684
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,330
Send the signal!

685
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Fucui,

686
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,790
Meihua Yishu,

687
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,040
and Kuanglan Wuxing
are stationed in the east.

688
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
Three rows, five columns?

689
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Fucui?

690
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,440
There are two human puppets to the east
of the Burial Forest.

691
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,920
Send word to the fleet behind us—

692
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,400
we'll advance on two fronts.

693
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,100
Leopard Unit and I will continue forward.

694
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,840
The six Sword Masters
will land with the Black Tortoise Unit

695
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
from the east

696
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,430
to engage Fucui's forces

697
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,360
and hold his troops.

698
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,400
The waterway ahead is blocked.

699
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,010
I'll handle it.

700
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,180
Is that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

701
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,790
Thanks to Mr. Tang.

702
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,920
We finally found it.

703
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,520
Yes, thanks to him.

704
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,420
Indeed.

705
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,040
I didn't expect

706
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,320
we'd find it so smoothly.

707
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,710
Yes.

708
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,000
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

709
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
don't weaken each other,

710
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,820
how can he, Yique Yinyang,

711
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,480
profit from the chaos?

712
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,140
Deputy Lord Yu,

713
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,080
we are now deep in enemy territory.

714
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,890
Stay focused.

715
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,670
Master,

716
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,560
Tang Lici and the others

717
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,690
have passed the gate

718
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,200
and are about to land.

719
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,070
This is...

720
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,190
a trap waiting for you.

721
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,040
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion?

722
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,230
Nineshot Arbalest?

723
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,110
Dodge!

724
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,200
Master, we can't get close!

725
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,320
Spread out!

726
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,190
Keep the geese low!

727
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,440
Yes!

728
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,920
Circle around the city!

729
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,300
Follow my command!

730
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,840
Signalers, come with me!

731
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,960
Master Jiang and his people encountered

732
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,360
the Nineshot Arbalests.

733
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,730
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion.

734
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,190
He's heading to the Six Sword Masters.

735
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,920
Master Shao,

736
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,910
lead the disciples to intercept Liu Yan.

737
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,870
I will act alone.

738
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,240
Yes!

739
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Why does he want to act alone?

740
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,410
Everyone, stay close later.

741
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,480
Stay fully alert.

742
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,600
I'm going alone.

743
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,010
What do you mean by that?

744
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,960
Why are you going alone?

745
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,340
To save her, of course.

746
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,590
I'm afraid you won't come back.

747
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,260
Deputy Lord Yu,

748
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,220
this path is full of traps.

749
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,250
If you're not afraid of your men

750
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,880
dying,

751
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,440
feel free to follow me.

752
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,930
Disciples of Sword King City!

753
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,880
Go quickly

754
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,340
to reinforce Master Shao!

755
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,880
Yes!

756
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,540
Be careful!

757
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,960
Tai'e Sword!

758
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,760
The wind sweeps over the grass!

759
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,130
Sound Killing Technique?

760
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,830
Lotuses and duckweeds in full bloom;

761
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,420
through shrieks and howls,
moss veils the gloom.

762
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,180
I am Qingchan.

763
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,860
I am Xiaohong.

764
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,320
We're here to welcome the guest

765
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,750
for the Master.

766
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,230
Miss,

767
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,040
I'm afraid you're not qualified

768
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,000
to stop me.

769
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,370
Kill.

770
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,330
Not a step back?

771
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,320
Master Shao, you really are capable.

772
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,120
But if the Tai'e Sword is sealed,

773
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,780
will you still be so relaxed?

774
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,270
You really think you can seal
the Tai'e Sword

775
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,730
with your amateur skills?

776
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,360
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword

777
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,270
you can win?

778
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,520
You really underestimated the Masters

779
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,920
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance!
