I'm too old to be reading

175
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,220
this now?

176
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,420
No, no.

177
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,800
He who reflects on the past
and gains insight from it is fit to teach.

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,860
Didn't you take Stone

179
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
as your disciple?

180
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,550
Teaching him the Three Character Classic

181
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,230
is perfect.

182
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm just teaching him a few characters.

183
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,840
He's hardly my disciple.

184
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
If you say so,

185
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,570
then he's not.

186
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,550
Master Shao, you look

187
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,060
so worried and gloomy again.

188
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,150
Is something important troubling you?

189
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,150
I received a message from Master Ji.

190
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,460
He said it's been rather unsettled
out there recently.

191
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,630
Several of our disciples

192
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,030
who were away on missions

193
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,430
were brutally killed by the Fengliu Shop.

194
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,090
More than 10 have been killed.

195
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,430
I'll go back and practice as well.

196
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,060
Alright.

197
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,910
This killing method

198
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,280
doesn't seem like Fengliu Shop's work,

199
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,420
but more like an assassin's technique.

200
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,020
Sixth Sword Master, well...

201
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,790
Unable to confront us directly,

202
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,760
they've resorted to assassination.

203
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,930
This is outrageous.

204
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,650
Send a message to Master Shao immediately.

205
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,180
Yes!

206
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,780
It's a trap.

207
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,320
Exactly.

208
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,970
They deliberately chose
this moment to strike—

209
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,180
it's a trap meant

210
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,100
to provoke us.

211
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,630
I'm afraid their hidden agenda

212
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,050
is more complex than it seems.

213
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,520
Also,

214
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,860
there are some rumors

215
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,120
circulating within the Sword Alliance.

216
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,580
However,

217
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,270
I'm already tracking down

218
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,800
the source of those rumors.

219
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,210
Master Shao, do you know...

220
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,510
a fortune-teller has joined

221
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,770
the alliance recently, and he's

222
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,470
-doing odd jobs in the Service Hall?
-After Mr. Tang came here,

223
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,200
though your basic needs
are well provided for...

224
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,200
have your lives...

225
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,460
truly gotten better?

226
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,580
Fengliu Shop keeps attacking

227
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,590
you alliance disciples.

228
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,920
Are you just going to swallow this insult?

229
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,880
Perhaps Mr. Tang is

230
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,310
making careful plans.

231
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,220
Plans?

232
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,390
What kind of plans?

233
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,940
That we don't know.

234
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
But I believe Mr. Tang

235
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,080
certainly won't stand by and do nothing.

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,780
Indeed.

237
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,310
Since he keeps saying

238
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,550
he wants to eliminate Fengliu Shop,

239
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,980
why does he only teach you

240
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,580
lightness skills for escape

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,330
and sword formations
that merely delay enemies?

242
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,890
No matter how well-coordinated
your sword formations are,

243
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,860
can they allow you to take the initiative

244
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,460
and eliminate Fengliu Shop?

245
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Or can they protect you

246
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,230
from enemy ambushes when you're alone?

247
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,180
That makes some sense.

248
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,640
Indeed.

249
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,730
I can't dispute that.

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,570
I've heard about it.

251
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,910
What?

252
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,210
Is there something wrong with him?

253
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,050
A serious one.

254
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,910
Then...

255
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,040
I'll have someone

256
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,170
bring him to see you?

257
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,370
No rush.

258
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,300
When Chi Yun returns,

259
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,710
I'll find him myself.

260
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,270
I hear it.

261
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,810
Someone is calling my name.

262
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,650
Are you

263
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,740
really

264
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,080
desperately

265
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,710
in need of me right now?

266
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,550
The capable bear more work.

267
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,630
I guess I'll have to do you a favor

268
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,230
and run this errand for you, Foxy Tang.

269
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,890
You seem quite happy about it.

270
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
I just find it strange—

271
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,220
since Mr. Tang has
unmatched martial arts skills,

272
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,750
why doesn't he teach those skills

273
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,060
to each one of us?

274
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,220
If we all improve even a little,

275
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,100
when the final battle
with Fengliu Shop comes,

276
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,180
each of us could

277
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,580
contribute more, right?

278
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,980
Mr. Tang probably

279
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,310
wouldn't need that extra help, would he?

280
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,390
Am I right?

281
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,060
-Yes.
-Yeah.

282
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,460
That's right.

283
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,180
Indeed.

284
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,440
Well, Mr. Tang is so confident

285
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,910
that he's staking everything

286
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
on himself alone.

287
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,580
What if

288
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,630
he never actually intended to

289
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,350
destroy Fengliu Shop in the first place?

290
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,080
Wouldn't we all be doomed then?

291
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,670
Use your brains, guys.

292
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,550
How impressive

293
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,810
that you possess such insight, Mr. Fang.

294
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,070
Mr. Tang.

295
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,100
-Mr. Tang
-Mr. Tang.

296
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,820
Mr. Tang.

297
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,700
Mr. Tang.

298
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,150
With everyone watching,

299
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,700
surely you wouldn't kill me

300
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,940
over a few unpleasant words,

301
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,270
would you?

302
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,460
Let's go. Let's go.

303
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,860
-Let's go.
-We should go.

304
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,870
Here to greet me?

305
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,770
[Master of Fate; Divine Fortune Teller]

306
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,340
Mr. Fang, it seems

307
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,670
you still don't enjoy

308
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,600
your duties at the Sword Alliance.

309
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,450
Not at all.

310
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,450
I love the Sword Alliance,

311
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,380
and the disciples here love me too.

312
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,200
Mr. Tang, though you appear calm
on the surface,

313
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,100
you must be

314
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,630
seething inside.

315
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,110
But if those disciples

316
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,370
were to see you kill me in rage,

317
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,950
how would you resolve that situation?

318
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,010
What are they talking about?

319
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,730
Mr. Fang, you're so good at
fortune-telling,

320
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,700
yet you can't divine

321
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,360
whether I will kill you or not?

322
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,710
How interesting, Mr. Tang.

323
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,030
The last time

324
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,430
you came to Shisan Tower,

325
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,820
you were indifferent to everything.

326
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,480
I never expected
that in such a short time,

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,610
everything would change completely.

328
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,060
It seems that when people have something

329
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,310
to protect,

330
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,620
they become like dogs

331
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,940
on a leash.

332
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,830
Don't you...

333
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,150
have something

334
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,340
you want to protect,

335
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,700
Chai Xijin?

336
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,340
Lici,

337
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,220
the person you inquired about,

338
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,030
is the sixth prince
of the former dynasty, Chai Xijin.

339
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,290
He was still young when the kingdom fell.

340
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,030
Fortunately, with the help of
loyal ministers,

341
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,040
he became the master
of Fallen Shisan Tower,

342
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,770
rising to power in the jianghu.

343
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,740
The sixth prince of the former dynasty,

344
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,700
Chai Xijin.

345
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,460
Back then,

346
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,980
when I exchanged the Jeweled Relic Stupa

347
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,150
for Chi Yun,

348
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,180
I'd already taken notice.

349
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Plus, with Shen's

350
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,590
Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

351
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,120
the items you requested

352
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,870
were both palace treasures.

353
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,750
Ordinary folks

354
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,430
in the jianghu

355
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,790
wouldn't even know what they are.

356
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,030
However,

357
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,430
I am...

358
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,630
the godson of Minister Tang,

359
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,940
so I can access

360
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,940
some secret palace documents.

361
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,460
I didn't expect to slip up so soon

362
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,630
and give you leverage

363
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,670
against me.

364
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,030
Chai Xijin...

365
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,589
Such a nostalgic name.

366
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,599
Only what is lost...

367
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,970
can truly stir nostalgia.

368
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,780
From the Fallen Shisan Tower

369
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,390
to here,
at the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

370
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,940
your desire for and pursuit of

371
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,200
the Rebirth Scroll...

372
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,340
have been extraordinary.

373
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,390
Is the Rebirth Scroll

374
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,120
really so important

375
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,640
to you

376
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,470
that it's worth obtaining

377
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,840
by any means necessary?

378
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,810
Of course.

379
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,190
The Rebirth Scroll is now

380
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,510
the ultimate martial art,

381
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,170
transcending all other arts.

382
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,050
You yourself have relied on it

383
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,640
to become nearly invincible in the world.

384
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,970
Who wouldn't desire it?

385
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,900
But that's also

386
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,560
Yique Yinyang's martial art.

387
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,500
Yique Yinyang caused
your dynasty's downfall.

388
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,110
Why would you want to learn
his martial art?

389
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,690
You're such a nag.

390
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,780
Master Liu from Fengliu Shop

391
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,760
wouldn't ask so many questions.

392
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,800
Imagine if people knew

393
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,300
that Shisan Tower actually

394
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,120
belongs to a prince of the former dynasty

395
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,250
and that this prince

396
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,310
is colluding with Fengliu Shop,

397
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,310
which holds the Blood Ghost Pill...

398
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,200
they...

399
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,190
What are they talking about?

400
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,920
I don't know.

401
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,250
I can't hear either.

402
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,620
They'd rather leave Fengliu Shop alone

403
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,730
and wipe out your Shisan Tower first.

404
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,690
Chief Fang,

405
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,640
you should understand

406
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,710
that you're only safe

407
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,350
in the darkness.

408
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,140
Mr. Tang.

409
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,540
You just said the most dangerous thing.

410
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,820
Dangerous?

411
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,710
Your methods against me

412
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
are no different.

413
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,510
But

414
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,710
judging from your expression now,

415
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,860
it seems my threat

416
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,660
carries more weight.

417
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,270
Chief Fang,

418
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,470
you've had your fun.

419
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,030
Won't you leave now?

420
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,030
But if I obtain

421
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,820
the eternal Rebirth Scroll,

422
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,140
I'll gain

423
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,230
a mysterious

424
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,100
and powerful body like yours.

425
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,680
I'll obtain the path

426
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,110
from human to god.

427
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,620
I want to obtain

428
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,590
the path

429
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
from human to god.

430
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,550
Work with me.

431
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,240
You want to become a god?

432
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,060
If you don't,

433
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
that's your problem.

434
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,750
Fang Pingzhai, Chief of

435
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,410
Fallen Shisan Tower, is here.

436
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,310
He's the Chief of Shisan Tower?

437
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,250
The Chief has another identity,

438
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,310
which is...

439
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,030
Fine.

440
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,420
You win.

441
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,520
I'll leave.

442
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Sorry to have troubled you
these past few days,

443
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,210
and thanks for your hospitality.

444
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,210
I, Fang Pingzhai, never owe favors.

445
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,860
Before I leave,

446
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,420
I'll give you all a special gift

447
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,820
to express my gratitude!

448
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,310
Is he for real?

449
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,380
Follow him.

450
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,270
For how long?

451
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,950
Until you feel that
if you don't come back,

452
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,740
he'll bring disaster upon the world.

453
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,910
The key is to find out

454
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,650
what his true purpose is.

455
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,940
That important?

456
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,010
You can count on me.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,660
The Peony Pavilion!

458
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,520
The one we've been searching for!

459
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,550
It really is.

460
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,140
Isn't Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

461
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,070
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop?

462
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,190
This map is so detailed.

463
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,390
It doesn't look fake.

464
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,360
It even shows the corridors.

465
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,480
Is this real or fake?

466
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,740
Now wiping them out will be child's play!

467
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,790
When was this map put up?

468
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,860
Turns out the headquarters of Fengliu Shop

469
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,230
has been hidden
in the misty marshlands all along.

470
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,910
Jiangnan's waters are
full of isolated islands.

471
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,110
No wonder we couldn't find it anywhere.

472
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,580
Sword Master, please

473
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,750
send orders to all disciples immediately

474
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,150
to attack the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion
at once.

475
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,080
Since the Peony Pavilion is

476
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,270
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop,

477
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,340
it must be full of traps and mechanisms.

478
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,550
Whether we can trust this map

479
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,610
remains to be seen.

480
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,900
We should first send someone

481
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,370
to infiltrate and investigate

482
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,510
to avoid falling into the enemy's trap.

483
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,710
Traps and mechanisms are mere trickery.

484
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,580
Once our forces are assembled,

485
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,550
brute force will overcome any trick!

486
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,750
Whatever traps they set,

487
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,620
we'll crush them all!

488
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,550
With Mr. Tang

489
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,980
and so many experts from our alliance,

490
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,950
plus backing from the imperial court

491
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,950
and Biluo Palace,

492
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,140
there's no need to hold back!

493
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,710
Our alliance is at its strongest

494
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,710
with high morale.

495
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,440
If not now, when?

496
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,750
Master Cheng,

497
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,750
what do you think?

498
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,060
Evil must be thoroughly eliminated
sooner rather than later.

499
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,190
I have no objection.

500
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,260
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.

501
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
Relay my command:

502
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,360
assemble the disciples from all halls

503
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,940
and prepare for battle!

504
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,740
Mr. Tang,

505
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,140
what do you think about that map?

506
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,820
How much can it be trusted?

507
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,240
At this point,

508
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,380
with everyone's blood running hot,

509
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,620
does it even matter
whether it's real or fake?

510
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,420
That's true.

511
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,030
But the alliance still needs time to
come together.

512
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,520
Whoever posted this map

513
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,550
deliberately wants to deny us that time.

514
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm worried another faction

515
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,420
is entering the game,

516
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,240
determined to disrupt
the peace of the jianghu.

517
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
What matters most now

518
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,780
is how to win the battle
against the Peony Pavilion.

519
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
After the battle,

520
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,510
I'll

521
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,140
personally resolve

522
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,010
this matter.

523
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,900
Master,

524
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,420
I have some thoughts

525
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,340
about the coming battle

526
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,200
that I'd like to discuss with you.

527
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,720
Chunji,

528
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,720
didn't I tell you to go back?

529
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,640
When will we attack Fengliu Shop?

530
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,040
I want to be in the vanguard,

531
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,700
charging into battle for you!

532
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,550
I'm already asleep.

533
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,390
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

534
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,270
Master Shao,

535
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,510
I'll

536
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,510
take my leave now.

537
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
Mr. Tang,

538
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,380
please help me talk some sense into

539
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
that troublesome disciple of mine.

540
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,680
Earlier, Mr. Tang,

541
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,530
you told me to wait
until the final battle.

542
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,080
I can't wait any longer.

543
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,820
Ms. Zhong,

544
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,580
you've always been a strong-willed person.

545
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,100
Yes.

546
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,340
I'm very strong-willed.

547
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
Why should anyone admit defeat?

548
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,360
But strong-willed people

549
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,550
often have...

550
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
fragile hearts.

551
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,320
The most strong-willed person I know

552
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,070
seems to be you, Mr. Tang.

553
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,000
Therefore,

554
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,320
I

555
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,480
can understand how you feel.

556
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,950
I

557
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,360
just want to remind you:

558
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,650
the closer you are to your goal,

559
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,090
the calmer you must stay.

560
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,850
To lose patience

561
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,080
is often to lose one's way,

562
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,240
and you may

563
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,490
be exploited by enemies

564
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,860
or even

565
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,270
fall into their traps.

566
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,660
I understand.

567
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,710
Then I'll...

568
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,580
go back and think carefully about

569
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,510
the battle plan.

570
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,140
Goodbye.

571
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,640
Goodbye.

572
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,070
What's wrong, Master Puzhu?

573
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,750
We're approaching the outpost.

574
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,410
We must proceed with caution.

575
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,340
I'll scout ahead first.

576
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,790
You all remain here for now.

577
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,190
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

578
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,230
Before I return,

579
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,300
don't make any rash moves.

580
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,390
Understood.

581
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,620
Rest in place!

582
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,230
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

583
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,780
Come on, let's go sit over there.

584
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,440
Alright, let's go.

585
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,100
Come on, let's sit over there.

586
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,230
My friend,

587
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,910
it's been a long time.

588
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,970
You...

589
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,100
I'm not wearing a veil,

590
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,930
and you don't recognize me anymore?

591
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,530
My friend,

592
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,750
I

593
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,340
came to play chess with you.

594
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,050
Whether you wear a veil or not,

595
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,020
I've

596
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,390
never truly seen you clearly.

597
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,910
For instance, right now,

598
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,220
should I address you as Miss Tao

599
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,260
or as "The Peach of Three Hues,"

600
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,230
Xifang Tao?

601
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,430
The Peach of Three Hues

602
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,630
is me.

603
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,340
Miss Tao

604
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,330
is also me.

605
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,550
Isn't it said

606
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,470
that all that has form is false?

607
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,500
Sir, you've studied
the Buddhist scriptures deeply,

608
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
so why cling to forms?

609
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:43,840
Sir,

610
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,960
please.

611
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,030
For today's game,

612
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,760
let's play blindfolded chess
with this endgame.

613
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,990
What do you think?

614
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,350
Let it be so.

615
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,140
This string of beads of mine

616
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,340
has exactly 13 beads.

617
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,660
So, Sir,

618
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,720
I shall play only 13 moves.

619
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,850
In that case...

620
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,670
I'll make the first move.

621
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,870
Let me borrow your prayer bead.

622
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,030
All this time, I've been wondering

623
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,090
whether I should consider you
a chess companion

624
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,090
or an opponent.

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
It's time to decide now.

626
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,670
Light Technique—

627
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,640
Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

628
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,350
I've played chess with you
for three years.

629
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,640
I remember every move

630
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,510
you ever made.

631
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,420
There are several positions

632
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,140
where you never placed your pieces,

633
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,420
even though, according to chess theory,

634
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,350
you should have.

635
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,500
My friend,

636
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,150
are you deliberately letting me win?

637
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,660
I guess

638
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,930
those positions

639
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,550
are the formation cores

640
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,280
that trigger
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

641
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,030
Oh no.

642
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,440
Deputy Lord Yu,

643
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,510
what should we do now?

644
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,470
To force Master Puzhu to use

645
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,950
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky,

646
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,240
that person must be an expert.

647
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,560
Master Puzhu is in danger.

648
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,580
Follow me to aid him!

649
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,780
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

650
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,290
You're trying to lure them

651
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,760
into coming to the rescue?

652
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,140
That's right.

653
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,110
I can't be certain I'll defeat you,

654
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,780
but severely wounding the elites
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

655
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
is much easier.

656
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,460
Oh no, it's a trap.

657
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,760
This is Fengliu Shop's poisonous mist.

658
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,020
Everyone, be careful!

659
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,690
Because of your one careless move,

660
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
an entire squad will be sacrificed.

661
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,740
Do you feel any remorse?

662
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,310
This poisonous mist suppresses
inner strength.

663
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,770
I must get them out of here.

664
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,850
Light Technique—

665
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,740
Verbal Dharma.

666
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,240
You'd give up your protective prayer beads

667
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,370
just to save others.

668
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,890
You're still as compassionate as ever.

669
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,230
These are Master Puzhu's prayer beads.

670
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,270
They can guide us

671
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,200
out of this mist!

672
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,900
Then...

673
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,200
let's retreat now.

674
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,180
Master Puzhu,

675
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,250
please be careful!

676
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,470
Stay alert

677
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,790
and retreat immediately!

678
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,450
-Yes!
-Yes!

679
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,260
Your Fengliu Shop is doomed,

680
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,520
and you've got nowhere to run.

681
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,050
Why create more bloodshed?

682
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,800
The Peach of Three Hues—

683
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,990
Boundless Peach Blossoms!

684
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,350
Lion's Roar.

685
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,810
Not only will I create bloodshed,

686
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,630
but I'll also make you

687
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,340
create bloodshed.

688
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,140
I

689
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,490
will never let you die.

690
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,820
You are truly interesting, Sir.

691
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,100
We've been walking from dawn till dusk.

692
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,360
We finally made it out.

693
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,030
Indeed.

694
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,950
If it weren't for

695
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,380
Master Puzhu's prayer beads,

696
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,060
our losses

697
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,590
would have been much worse.

698
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,140
You all head back to camp first.

699
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,580
I'm going back for Master Puzhu.

700
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,310
You mustn't.

701
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,420
Deputy Lord Yu,

702
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,640
it's too dangerous to go back now.

703
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,310
-Yes.
-Yes!

704
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,660
You mustn't.

705
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,140
It's far too dangerous!

706
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,870
Listen to me!

707
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,560
Not repaying kindness

708
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,990
violates the ancestral teachings
of Sword King City.

709
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,230
You should go back quickly.

710
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,690
Well...

711
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,880
This is an order.

712
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,860
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

713
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,140
Yu Furen,

714
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,470
you've truly disappointed me.

715
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,239
Who's there?

716
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,389
Is it really you?

717
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,050
You're not dead?

718
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,739
Yes, I died.

719
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:02,540
But Fengliu Shop has turned me into
a human puppet.

720
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,460
So...

721
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,860
I came back to life.

722
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,790
So

723
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,230
it's true that you've been

724
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,430
working for Fengliu Shop all this time.

725
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,150
Then

726
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,660
you don't deserve to
return to Sword King City now.

727
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,460
Don't be so harsh.

728
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,820
Fengliu Shop and I

729
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,280
are just using each other.

730
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,670
When did you

731
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,400
start taking those Evil Pills?

732
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,960
Who cares about something like that?

733
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,310
I care!

734
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,230
I want to know—

735
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,340
when did

736
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,340
the hero of Sword King City

737
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,500
become a monster?

738
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,940
And when

739
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,710
did I

740
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,490
start stubbornly believing in you

741
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,550
and miss the chance to bring you back?

742
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,380
You're still as naive as ever.

743
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,930
There are no heroes who don't pay a price.

744
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,940
As for you,

745
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,270
you trusted the wrong person before,

746
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,270
and you're still doing the same now!

747
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,520
Come back to the Sword Alliance with me
to face justice!

748
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,310
You're no match for me.

749
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,900
Why risk your life fighting me?

750
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,080
It's a worthless life anyway.

751
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,540
Risking it...

752
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,310
What's there to regret?

753
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,540
Come on!

754
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,590
You shouldn't die here.

755
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,630
Go back to Sword King City and learn

756
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,230
how to be a good city lord

757
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,820
to protect Sword King City's
century-old legacy.

758
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,220
Don't you find your words

759
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,310
laughable?

760
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,710
If Sword King City

761
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,190
truly mattered to you,

762
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,560
how could you have ended up
where you are today?

763
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,000
I just wanted to be a hero.

764
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,900
But when ordinary people try to be heroes,

765
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,230
they must pay a price.

766
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,930
This price is something

767
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
you'll have to bear sooner or later.

768
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,230
A hero?

769
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,090
A hero who risks his life
for Fengliu Shop?

770
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,020
Yu Qifeng,

771
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,360
I won't believe

772
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,770
a single word you say anymore.

773
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,640
Whether you believe it or not
doesn't matter.

774
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,790
But your price

775
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,990
is already on its way.

776
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,460
The person you trust now

777
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,590
has already decided that fate for you.

778
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:54,860
Who?

779
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,590
Tang Lici?

780
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,170
I never trusted him.

781
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,500
You don't trust him, yet you

782
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,630
obey his every word,

783
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,670
allowing him to command you.

784
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,380
You lead the people of Sword King City

785
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,710
to fight his battles!

786
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,910
I never did it for him.

787
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
I did it to destroy Fengliu Shop!

788
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,860
His methods may be questionable,

789
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,990
but they often work.

790
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,230
With him in the Sword Alliance,

791
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,660
we can eliminate evil forces sooner.

792
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,980
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

793
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,210
don't destroy each other,

794
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,990
how could he, as Yique Yinyang,

795
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,830
reap the benefits?

796
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,530
Yique Yinyang is dead.

797
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:25,940
Fengliu Shop

798
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,460
deliberately framed him

799
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,460
to provoke conflict in the jianghu...

800
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,230
Is Fengliu Shop intentionally framing him,

801
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,520
or are you people from the Sword Alliance
deceiving yourselves?

802
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,950
Do you know how he obtained

803
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
his Rebirth Scroll?

804
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,460
Have you seen
his golden eyes and forehead mark?

805
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,860
He has so many secrets,

806
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
yet why does everyone
in the Sword Alliance

807
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,050
choose to turn a blind eye?

808
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,230
I haven't!

809
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,110
I just...

810
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:46,990
I just...

811
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,420
Everyone has

812
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,480
their own secrets.

813
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,670
I'm also waiting for an opportunity.

814
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,190
I'm afraid some secrets

815
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,720
are too much for you to bear.

816
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,600
Shao Yanping has grown senile.

817
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,820
If he wants to stake the fate
of the entire alliance,

818
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,690
I can't stop him.

819
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,950
But you're different.

820
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,230
You're the next lord of Sword King City.

821
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,110
Who you trust

822
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,050
determines the city's fate.

823
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,940
Furen,

824
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,520
my life is already ruined,

825
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,160
but your life has just begun.

826
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,820
Don't let your life

827
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,590
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

828
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,920
become the price of your misplaced trust!

829
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,800
No matter what,

830
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,060
you must provide evidence.

831
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,630
Come back to the alliance with me

832
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,760
and confront Tang Lici face-to-face.

833
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,390
So you're saying

834
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
that Master Puzhu

835
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,750
fell into the trap set by

836
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,830
the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop.

837
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,760
After getting separated from you
in the mist,

838
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,460
there's been no trace of him since?

839
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:40,940
Yes.

840
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
It's all my fault.

841
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,760
Before Master Puzhu left,

842
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,020
he clearly instructed me

843
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,070
not to act rashly.

844
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,270
But I still acted recklessly.

845
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
That enchantress is full of tricks.

846
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,540
It's no surprise

847
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,090
that you fell into her trap.

848
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,270
Unfortunately, after we entered the mist,

849
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,310
we couldn't tell which way to go

850
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,390
and didn't know

851
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,630
where Master Puzhu had gone
while chasing Xifang Tao.

852
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,090
But I imagine Master Puzhu

853
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,980
must have had some other method

854
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,020
to find his way.

855
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,890
Otherwise,

856
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,070
he wouldn't have given this prayer bead

857
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,590
to us.

858
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,210
Let me see this prayer bead.

859
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,120
After you fought your way out,

860
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,270
did you encounter

861
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,000
anyone else?

862
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,740
No.

863
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,010
I can tell

864
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,690
he's hiding something.

865
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,420
Indeed.

866
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,710
Then, who do you think

867
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,640
he encountered?

868
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,540
It takes the one who started it to end it.

869
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,450
To unravel Commander Yu's inner conflict,

870
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,780
we can only wait and see.

871
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,190
The same goes

872
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,820
for Master Puzhu.

873
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,330
What do you mean?

874
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,340
There was a note

875
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,000
at Master Puzhu's place

876
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,310
saying

877
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,650
that his chess companion of many years

878
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,750
is the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop,

879
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,820
Xifang Tao.

880
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Master Puzhu

881
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,680
is not a gullible man.

882
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,150
For them to become friends,

883
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,410
there must be a reason.

884
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,810
Perhaps...

885
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,360
because they've known each other
for a long time...

886
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,460
things

887
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,630
won't reach

888
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,940
the worst outcome.

889
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,580
On the contrary...

890
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,880
it may help Puzhu overcome
his karmic obstacles.

891
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,050
You actually used your remaining strength
to save me.

892
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,760
Master Puzhu,

893
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,440
what are you really thinking?

894
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,310
I said

895
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,430
I'd never let you die because of me.

896
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,590
You won't kill me,

897
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,340
but I'll kill you.

898
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,200
You're badly injured now.

899
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,120
Don't act recklessly.

900
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,980
I know how badly I'm injured.

901
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
Messenger geese.

902
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:44,870
Master Puzhu,

903
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,940
why don't you ask

904
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,340
the Yanmen Sect for help?

905
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,440
They can't hear us.

906
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,690
The terrain here is unique—

907
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,260
wide at the bottom, narrow at the top,

908
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,810
and surrounded by steep cliffs.

909
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,470
It wouldn't be easy to find us.

910
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,230
You're injured now.

911
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,280
It's impossible for you to leave.

912
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,820
It seems I

913
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,670
have fallen into your hands.

914
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,540
Master Puzhu,

915
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,540
the fact that you still had strength left
to save me...

916
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,150
means that this place

917
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,500
can't trap you at all.

918
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,550
Sir,

919
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,510
why don't you leave?

920
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,830
West Palace Chief, since you're awake,

921
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,670
please get up.

922
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,530
"West Palace Chief"?

923
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,770
Sir, you're sweating.

924
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,610
Is it because you're exhausted,

925
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,860
or because...

926
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,790
you're nervous?

927
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,410
You're pressing on my legs.
