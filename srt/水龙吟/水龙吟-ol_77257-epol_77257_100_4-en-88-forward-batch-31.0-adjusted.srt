[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,950
[Episode 4]

3
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,920
Here and now,

4
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,310
no one

5
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,910
will meddle in your affairs.

6
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,840
You

7
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,070
will die today. There's no doubt about it.

8
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm making this my business today,

9
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,000
like it or not!

10
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,720
A traitor of Yanmen.

11
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,070
How dare you silence a witness
right before my eyes.

12
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,850
When those noble clans play dirty,

13
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,979
they make my den of thieves look clean.

14
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,300
Don't worry, Mr. Feng—

15
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,930
I've got your back.

16
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,450
Cloud?

17
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,770
Well, well. It's your choice,

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,590
but you're just

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,400
choosing your own poison.

20
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,120
Since

21
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,120
you're all so eager to die,

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
I'll make sure

23
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,580
you perish together today.

24
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Kill them all!

25
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,560
Are you alright?

26
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,560
What's going on?

27
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,400
Clearly, Jiang Qingyu

28
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
has long since bribed everyone here

29
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
to ensure Mr. Feng's demise.

30
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,360
Our priority now

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,810
is to get out of here.

32
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,560
Thinking of leaving?

33
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,590
I've gambled everything

34
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,990
to get this opportunity.

35
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,470
Vice-Chief Jiang,
are you certain about this?

36
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,750
Once this deal is done,

37
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,650
you'll have nothing left.

38
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,480
You're mistaken, Chief.

39
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,079
If this deal succeeds,

40
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,900
I will have everything.

41
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,750
But this place is shrouded in thick mist—

42
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,810
I can't locate the gate of life at all.

43
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Indeed, the Mist Formation of Buhuan Tower

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,280
makes it

45
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,360
difficult to spot the gate of life
with the naked eye.

46
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,430
However, after years

47
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,230
of cultivating the Yulan Sword,

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,000
I can trace the flow of air

49
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,120
to find the gate of life—

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,520
it shouldn't be too hard.

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,590
You really are both reliable and sharp.

52
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,590
Which way do we go?

53
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,410
Over there.

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,380
Let's move.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,480
One,

56
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,800
two,

57
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,159
three.

58
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,040
Soon, you'll

59
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,890
all die here.

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
Once that happens,

61
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,050
no one will ever trace the truth
behind Cheng's death again.

62
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,520
Judging by the sound of the wind,

63
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
the Floating Abyss

64
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,130
must be sinking into the depths
of the sea.

65
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,000
Follow me—

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll lead you out.

67
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,870
It's you!

68
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,060
Jiang Qingyu,

69
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
you poisoned Jiang Cheng,

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,490
all because Liu Yan manipulated you.

71
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,890
Greed led you to invite evil
upon yourself.

72
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,120
How pathetic.

73
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,470
In this jianghu, power reigns supreme.

74
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,040
Once I ascend to that position,

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
who would dare deny

76
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
that the loyal and true-hearted
leader of Yanmen Sect

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
stands for righteousness?

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,450
You twist minds
and reverse cause and effect.

79
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,380
After them!

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
It's Cheng's goose.

81
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,390
Foxy Tang,

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,210
what are you doing here?

83
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,100
And you've captured Jiang Qingyu?

84
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,270
Thank you, Mr. Tang, for sparing his life.

85
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,630
This man is a key suspect wanted

86
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,760
by the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

87
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,670
Right now,

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,390
our priority is to get out of here.

89
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,390
Which way do we go?

90
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,270
Here.

91
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,770
This way—

92
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,430
the exit is over here.

93
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,870
Wait.

94
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,550
Foxy Tang,

95
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,810
we need to leave now.

96
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Indeed, Mr. Tang.

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,310
This place is sinking fast.

98
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,440
The longer we delay,

99
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,240
the harder it will be

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,900
for even me to locate the exit.

101
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,340
Is that so?

102
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,490
An exit—

103
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
or

104
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,100
a one-way path to the underworld?

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,070
Mr. Tang,

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,980
you don't trust me?

107
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,150
I trust Feng Chuanxiang.

108
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,780
But are you

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
really Feng Chuanxiang?

110
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,560
Foxy Tang!

111
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,950
Mr. Tang,

112
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,180
why?

113
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,720
It's because the real Feng Chuanxiang

114
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
has been dead

115
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,620
for half a year.

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,270
He was killed by Jiang Cheng

117
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,170
on the very night
of his alleged disappearance—

118
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,620
slain by Jiang Cheng
in a poison-induced haze,

119
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,750
unable to distinguish hallucination

120
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,490
from reality.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,320
So that's what happened.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,870
Is that true,

123
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,190
Mr. Feng?

124
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,330
Tang Lici,

125
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,000
as expected—

126
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,000
you are a worthy adversary of Master.

127
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,500
Let me reintroduce myself.

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
I am

129
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Hua Wuyan

130
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,520
of the Fengliu Shop.

131
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
Emissary Hua,

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,150
you promised me—

133
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,480
if I helped you

134
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,510
lure Tang Lici and the others here

135
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,310
so you could eliminate them all,

136
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,390
y-you would secure my position

137
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,030
as the leader of Yanmen Sect.

138
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,590
You must not go back on your word.

139
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Silence!

140
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,590
If I may ask,

141
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,550
Mr. Tang,

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
when did you first realize

143
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,940
I wasn't Feng Chuanxiang?

144
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,000
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,390
Mr. Tang,

147
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,920
pleased to meet you.

148
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,490
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,870
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

150
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,720
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
A western sword stroke sweeps afar;

152
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,780
wild geese cross miles of riverbank.

153
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,390
Mr. Tang,

154
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,370
is something wrong?

155
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,130
You didn't recognize the jade pendant,

156
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,910
nor did you understand the poem.

157
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,600
The answer

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
was clear from the start.

159
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,790
So, I gave myself away

160
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
at the very beginning, did I?

161
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,580
He used the Hao family massacre as bait—

162
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,270
first dragging Zhong Chunji's

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,600
Central Plains Sword Alliance
into the mess,

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,720
then exploiting Jiang Qingyu's greed

165
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,280
for the Jiang Sect leadership

166
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
to stir up chaos within Yanmen.

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,830
Had I failed to see through this scheme,

168
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,230
I would have been hunted
across the jianghu

169
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,960
and forced

170
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,510
to bring Chi Yun and Zhong Chunji

171
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,150
to the Shisan Tower

172
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,820
to bargain with the Chief—

173
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,650
there, I would have been compelled

174
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,910
to speak with my own lips
and reveal the secret from years past.

175
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,120
Four years apart,

176
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
and his methods remain

177
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,160
as clumsy as your disguise.

178
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,670
How dare you disrespect the Master!

179
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,280
Did he not tell you

180
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,260
to flee

181
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
at the sight of me?

182
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,150
If you knew

183
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,870
I was an impostor from the start,

184
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,630
yet still played along

185
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,270
and let these baits into the pond,

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
it was all

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,980
to trace the Master's scheme back to him.

188
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,820
Mr. Tang,

189
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,630
have you considered

190
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,840
that if this move

191
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
had gone wrong,

192
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,320
their lives…

193
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,200
My time is precious.

194
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,790
I have no interest

195
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,970
in wasting more words on you.

196
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,720
Finding Liu Yan

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,000
is my true objective—

198
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,510
nothing else

199
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,190
matters to me.

200
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,930
Just as the Master said—

201
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,080
devoid of sentiment,

202
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,270
driven only by cold self-interest.

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,920
It seems

204
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,660
he didn't teach you

205
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,910
when to beg for mercy.

206
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,570
Knowing when to beg me for mercy

207
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,860
would have been wise.

208
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,240
Take me to him.

209
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,720
Chi Yun.

210
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,230
It's Liu Yan's doing.

211
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,630
He's mine.

212
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,480
Is that so?

213
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,270
Mr. Tang!

214
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,000
I am Cao Wufang.

215
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,790
Tang Lici,

216
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,540
you've grown careless.

217
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,590
A sword through the heart—

218
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,200
a fatal wound.

219
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,150
Foolish.

220
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,500
Two souls in one body—

221
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,000
when one dies, the other lives;

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,280
when one lives, the other dies.

223
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
To think such a constitution

224
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,710
truly exists in this world.

225
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,350
You think I'm a monster?

226
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,790
The Master said

227
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,460
you're a monster too.

228
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,940
Monster against monster—

229
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,350
a perfect match.

230
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,840
Mr. Tang,

231
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,730
can monsters

232
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,270
even understand human emotions?

233
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,880
Go tell Liu Yan

234
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,840
that his petty tricks

235
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,700
are no match for Tang Lici.

236
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,360
I, Tang Lici,

237
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,150
am second to none under heaven.

238
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,550
If he wishes to settle our score,

239
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,010
let him come himself.

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,530
Now get lost.

241
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,050
Tang Lici,

242
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,440
if you wish to see the Master,

243
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,220
follow the trail of the Evil Pill.

244
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,600
But first, you and your friends

245
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,370
shall enjoy this little extra gift

246
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,680
he prepared for you.

247
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,840
What do we do?

248
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,700
The flames are closing in on all sides!

249
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,340
Foxy Tang,

250
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,470
stop holding back—bring out

251
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,790
your contingency plan now.

252
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,990
Empty-handed as I am,

253
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,610
I have no contingency plan.

254
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,730
Empty-handed—

255
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,050
Aren't you afraid
of turning into a roasted fox?

256
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Mr. Tang,

257
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,230
after receiving word from Miss Shei,

258
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,300
I came as soon as I learned
of the situation.

259
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,030
It seems my timing

260
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,440
is just right.

261
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I knew it.

262
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,829
You cunning Foxy Tang.

263
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,720
Let's go.

264
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,400
I never expected the Vice-Chief Jiang

265
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
to be that kind of person.

266
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,550
Right?

267
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,030
He always seemed

268
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,560
so loyal to the Sect Master.

269
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,290
♪ I cross the Yan River in the wasteland ♪

270
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,920
His body

271
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,720
was completely dissolved by the poison.

272
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,750
All I could recover was this.

273
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,170
♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

274
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,370
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

275
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,680
You should go—

276
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,570
the ceremony on their side
is about to begin.

277
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,130
♪ Look down on my dream ♪

278
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Go bid your master a final farewell.

279
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,390
Master Jiang,

280
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,790
a year ago,

281
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,640
Jiang Cheng was secretly fed

282
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,400
the Blood Ghost Pill by Jiang Qingyu.

283
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,190
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

284
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,160
He never guarded against

285
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,030
his own uncle

286
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,350
and remained completely unaware

287
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,510
of the poisoning.

288
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,480
Cheng...

289
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,550
Then, half a year ago at Liulian Cottage,

290
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,460
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

291
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,440
Feng Chuanxiang couldn't bear
to tell him the truth,

292
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,880
which led
to Jiang Cheng misunderstanding him.

293
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,240
In Jiang Cheng's frenzied,
poison-induced state,

294
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
he struck out

295
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,270
at his closest friend

296
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,400
in a hallucination.

297
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,330
Feng Chuanxiang, gravely wounded

298
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,280
and knowing his time was short,

299
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,550
didn't want

300
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,510
Jiang Cheng to live with the guilt
of killing his friend,

301
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,750
so he chose

302
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,670
to await death alone.

303
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,550
When Jiang Cheng

304
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,660
woke the next day,

305
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,420
Feng Chuanxiang had vanished.

306
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,390
Tormented daily

307
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,910
by the Evil Pill,

308
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,170
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

309
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,810
he spent his remaining days

310
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
searching for a truth

311
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
he could never learn—

312
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,920
until

313
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,410
death finally took him.

314
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,840
Perhaps death is a mercy.

315
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,220
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

316
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,570
Perhaps it's better this way.

317
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,330
At least he never had

318
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,010
to face the truth
of killing his dearest friend,

319
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,830
nor become

320
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,830
a monster enslaved by the Evil Pill.

321
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,420
You think I'm a monster?

322
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,890
The Master said

323
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,470
you're a monster too.

324
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,550
A monster...

325
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,110
What?

326
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,700
With injuries that severe,

327
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
it'd be a miracle if he survived—

328
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,880
and you're saying
his wounds have already healed?

329
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,030
Yes, Senior,

330
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,720
you should go check on him.

331
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,200
The guy Senior Fang brought back…

332
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
could he be some kind of monster?

333
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,360
So, the little monster's actually awake.

334
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,590
So fierce.

335
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Fang Zhou's only talent
is picking up strays,

336
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,590
lunatics,

337
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,070
and monsters

338
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,270
to waste my medicine.

339
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I'll count to three,

340
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,030
now let go,

341
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,590
alright?

342
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,480
One,

343
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,440
two…

344
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,650
Are you even human?

345
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,300
You were really trying to kill me.

346
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,560
You can't be killed and have no humanity…

Why would a Bodhisattva

also fall into demonhood?

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,400
Mr. Tang.

418
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,690
Why are you here?

419
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,790
You've been gone so long,

420
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,590
and I was worried.

421
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,620
There's no need to do that.

422
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,180
Wounds heal on their own.

423
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,810
You're doing unnecessary things again.

424
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,150
I've told you—

425
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
this is nothing

426
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
but excess to me.

427
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I don't presume to know

428
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,480
what you want

429
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,160
or don't want.

430
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,920
I only know

431
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,250
that even if wounds heal,

432
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,700
they still hurt.

433
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:15,960
Mr. Tang…

434
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,070
are you here to mourn Young Master Jiang

435
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,270
and Mr. Feng?

436
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,160
I don't mourn

437
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,310
fools.

438
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,600
There were clearly chances
to turn things around,

439
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,460
yet through their own stupidity,

440
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,210
they walked step by step

441
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,450
into ruin.

442
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,280
You are not that kind of person,

443
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,410
nor do you truly think that way—

444
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,240
otherwise,

445
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,030
you wouldn't have helped them

446
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,440
find closure.

447
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,640
Save your compassion.

448
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,480
I am a monster.

449
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,560
That is exactly
what's going through my mind,

450
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,530
and no one's words

451
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,190
will change that.

452
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,790
Someone once told you

453
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,320
that you weren't a monster,

454
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,640
so I'm not

455
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,640
the only one

456
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,270
who sees you that way.

457
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,480
If you can stop my wounds from healing,

458
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,920
then I'll believe you.

459
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,720
But you can't—

460
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,590
which means

461
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,850
even you don't believe

462
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
the empty words

463
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,350
you speak.

464
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,440
Do you know

465
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,200
why Liu Yan wants me dead?

466
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,690
It's because

467
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,720
I killed Fang Zhou.

468
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,160
Master,

469
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,720
I have failed.

470
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
I could not lure him

471
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,280
into our gunpowder trap.

472
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,370
Master,

473
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,210
he was useless—

474
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:58,960
but I,

475
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,910
I even managed to stab Tang Lici.

476
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,670
Get back.

477
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,280
Master, I beg your forgiveness.

478
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
He didn't kill you

479
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,350
because he wanted you back here
with a message for me.

480
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,030
Is that it?

481
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,310
He said

482
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,880
these petty tricks

483
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,940
were no match for Tang Lici.

484
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,920
He said his martial arts were peerless—
second to none under heaven.

485
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,980
And if you wished to settle the score,

486
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,110
you had to go

487
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,810
to him yourself.

488
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,160
How ridiculous.

489
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,970
He wanted me to seek him out

490
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,650
and even thought
that we could settle the score.

491
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,590
Master,

492
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,790
shall we entrust the next phase

493
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,270
of the plan

494
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,450
to Xiaohong?

495
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,240
Mr. Tang,

496
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,830
Cheng...

497
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,440
killed Mr. Feng.

498
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,510
A life must be repaid.

499
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,900
I am willing

500
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,540
to sever my own arm

501
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,690
as atonement

502
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,100
to the jianghu for Cheng's crime.

503
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,760
Master Jiang,

504
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,880
the Blood Ghost Pill

505
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,440
only corrupts those
already consumed by greed.

506
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,750
An insatiable heart cannot be saved,

507
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,030
even by divine means.

508
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,480
I will accept your arm

509
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,550
as atonement.

510
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
But in these troubled times,

511
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,310
with corruption and strife everywhere,

512
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,240
keeping that arm

513
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,080
attached to your body

514
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,960
may yet serve a greater purpose.

515
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,810
Indeed,

516
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Master Jiang.

517
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,440
Your son was victimized by vile schemes—

518
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,110
the blame does not lie with him.

519
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,790
Exactly,

520
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,200
there's no need to blame yourself.

521
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
That's right, Jiang.

522
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
The enemy's blood

523
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,750
stains Yanmen's maples;

524
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,030
As constant as death,

525
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,790
their crimson glows.

526
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,830
From this day forward,

527
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,680
your causes

528
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,680
are Yanmen's causes;

529
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
those who oppose you

530
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,750
are Yanmen's enemies.

531
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
Master Jiang,

532
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,990
you honor us too greatly.

533
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,160
Thank you all.

534
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
Take a look.

535
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,310
[Under Haoyun Mountain]

536
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,480
Come take a look!

537
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,270
Try one.

538
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,110
Excuse me.

539
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:22,960
Make way.

540
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,870
Thank you.

541
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,970
Make way.

542
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,110
Excuse me.

543
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,110
Excuse me.

544
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,110
Sorry about that.

545
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,000
Excuse me.

546
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,600
Excuse me.

547
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,220
Make way, please.

548
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,880
Is this the one?

549
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,240
Sir,

550
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,240
where's that bracelet
I was looking at the other day?

551
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,500
I kept it aside for you.

552
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,510
This time I brought enough money.

553
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,310
Is it for your love?

554
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,480
It's a gift for Zhong—

555
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,290
she's coming back soon.

556
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,350
What are you doing?

557
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,720
Move aside!

558
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,790
What's wrong with you?

559
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,680
What's his deal?

560
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,270
M-My bracelet!

561
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,040
Right. It's your bracelet.

562
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,330
Why is someone from Ranqing Sect here?

563
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,930
Get out!

564
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
Stop tormenting me!

565
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,310
How dare this person cause trouble

566
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,440
in a place under the jurisdiction

567
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

568
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,550
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

569
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,400
I need to go
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

570
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,350
To the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

571
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,960
Has Ranqing Sect

572
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
run into some kind of trouble?

573
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,830
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,180
Where do you come from, you monster?

575
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,230
Watch where you're going!

576
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,070
Monster? I'm not a monster—

577
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,920
you are!

578
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,700
My apologies.

579
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,000
My Human Sword

580
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,510
is drawn only against villains—

581
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,370
I acted out of necessity just now.

582
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,200
Wait,

583
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm from Camellia Island,

584
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,700
you're from Ranqing Sect—

585
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,110
we're both on the side of righteousness.

586
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,710
Let's talk this through calmly.

587
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,560
Ranqing Sect… they're all dead.

588
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,640
All of them!

589
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,350
What did you say?

590
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,920
All dead?

591
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,510
The entire Ranqing Sect?

592
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,200
How?

593
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,510
Who did it?

594
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,310
It was Tang Lici!

595
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,160
He sent

596
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,200
a demoness in red

597
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,400
and forced us to take large doses

598
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,640
of the Blood Ghost Pill…

599
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
I was the only one who…

600
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,540
Look,

601
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,680
isn't that the legendary

602
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,350
Master Puzhu?

603
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,810
Isn't that Master Puzhu!?

604
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,130
I finally get to see him in person!

605
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,120
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

606
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,230
If not for you,

607
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,190
I would

608
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,630
have shamed my sect today.

609
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,920
Of the Three Swords—
Heaven, Earth, and Human—

610
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,710
you have begun to grasp the path
of the Human Sword.

611
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,570
It won't be long

612
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,110
before you reach the Earth Sword realm.

613
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,670
Really?

614
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,350
Truly worthy of Master Puzhu—

615
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,030
such grace and composure.

616
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,960
The killer's name

617
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,400
is Tang Lici.

618
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,920
Come in.

619
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,840
The Hao family massacre case
has been resolved.

620
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,480
Miss Zhong has already taken Jiang Qingyu

621
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,320
back to the Sword Alliance to report.

622
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,190
Shouldn't you

623
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,450
also return to Yanxian now?

624
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,280
Yes,

625
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Mr. Tang.

626
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,760
Whenever it's convenient along the way,

627
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,800
you may drop me off at any pier.

628
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,330
Why don't you say you wish to stay?

629
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,420
Are you willing to let me stay?

630
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,800
Wasn't that

631
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,310
your goal all along—to stay?

632
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,590
The water is boiling.
I'll prepare tea for you.

633
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,480
You are not Chi Yun,

634
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,820
not my servant.

635
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,550
You don't have to do this.

636
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,480
You've allowed me to stay,
even if temporarily.

637
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,230
I have little wealth to offer,

638
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,550
so being able to help with small tasks

639
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,800
puts my heart at ease.

640
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,030
You may look.

641
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,050
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

642
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,280
Master Jiang,

643
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,030
I must return promptly
to the Sword Alliance,

644
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,490
so I'll take my leave here.

645
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,550
The traitor Jiang Qingyu

646
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,480
is now in your hands, Ms. Zhong.

647
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,360
I trust you will bring him

648
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,510
before the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

649
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,170
Yanmen Sect

650
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,000
will also spare no effort in assisting

651
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,440
the investigation
into the Blood Ghost Pill case,

652
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
pursuing it to the very end.

653
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,520
Thank you.

654
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,610
In that case,

655
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,290
let us each return to our duties

656
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,290
and trust to fate.

657
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,710
Who is that,

658
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,100
arriving with such grandeur?

659
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
The Sword King has arrived.

660
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,370
The Sword King?

661
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,590
Greetings, Sword King.

662
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,800
-Greetings, Sword King.
-Greetings, Sword King.

663
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,400
We were unaware of your arrival

664
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,190
and failed to greet you properly.

665
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,670
Had we received word earlier,

666
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,360
I would have prepared a banquet

667
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,150
in your honor, Sword King.

668
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,360
Urgent matters take precedence.

669
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,630
I'm afraid there is no time

670
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,430
to enjoy Yanmen's hospitality.

671
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,400
Might I ask what you mean by that,
Sword King?

672
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,760
The Blood Ghost Pill.

673
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,820
Hand over the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
at once.

674
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Sword King Yu.

675
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,840
No one may approach
the Sword King's presence.

676
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,640
Master Jiang,

677
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,670
if you have something to say,
speak from where you stand.

678
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,190
Hold it!

679
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,320
This is still Jiang's territory.

680
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,630
Calling yourselves an orthodox sect,

681
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,160
you don't even know the simple courtesy
of a guest deferring to their host.

682
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,920
Then do you understand
the principle of first come, first served?

683
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,670
If you want someone next time,

684
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,590
try waking up earlier

685
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,190
and catching them yourself.

686
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,400
Who are you

687
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,030
to act so insolently

688
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,450
before the Sword King?

689
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,590
Chi Yun, the Cloud.

690
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,110
I never expected

691
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,310
someone from the underworld

692
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,910
to meddle in the affairs
of the righteous path.

693
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,070
He knows me?

694
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,670
The young master
of Yanmen consumed the Evil Pills;

695
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,840
Master Jiang's own brother conspired
against his nephew.

696
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,670
A once-great sect has
not only bred traitors

697
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,550
but also colluded with underworld figures.

698
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,920
To see Yanmen fall so low

699
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,550
is truly disheartening.

700
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,680
Sword King Yu,

701
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,770
this individual

702
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,990
has already been handed over

703
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,590
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

704
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,520
That's correct,

705
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,850
Sword King.

706
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,360
I am Zhong Chunji,

707
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,150
Branch Chief of the Shanfeng Branch,
Central Plains Sword Alliance.

708
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,800
Taking the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
into custody

709
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,480
is under the direct order of my master.

710
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,360
I ask for your understanding, Sword King.

711
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,960
You wield Little Peach Blossom,

712
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,150
the seventh-ranked dagger
on the Roll of Renowned Blades.

713
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,480
You are Shao Yanping's beloved disciple.

714
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,140
Young lady,

715
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,990
how is your master doing?

716
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,440
My master is well.

717
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,510
Thank you for your concern, Sword King.

718
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,440
But did you know?

719
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Even if your master were here today,

720
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,240
he would not dare stand in my way.

721
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,690
Sword One, Sword Two—seize the prisoner.

722
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,190
-Yes!
-Yes!

723
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,520
Wait!

724
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,410
From the sound of it,

725
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,280
you believe whoever has the strongest fist
makes the rules. Is that it?

726
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,630
The Sword King City has always
upheld virtue to persuade

727
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,760
and martial prowess to eradicate evil.

728
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,400
Do you dare obstruct me?

729
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,090
Look how full of yourself you are.

730
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll stand right here
and take one strike from you—

731
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,340
you still won't so much as scratch me.

732
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,360
Mr. Chi.

733
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Chi Yun, have you lost your mind?

734
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,280
Well, you scum.

735
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Do you dare or not?

736
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,880
If I take even one step back,
you can take him—

737
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,030
I won't say a word.

738
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,960
But if you can't hurt me,

739
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,510
take your pretty-boy entourage

740
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,240
and get lost.

741
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,840
Even Master Puzhu

742
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,000
would not dare utter such insolent words.

743
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,070
Enough nonsense—
do you take the bet or not?

744
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,320
Afraid I'll bully you?

745
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,710
I'll even turn my back—

746
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,650
dare you try?

747
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,510
Sword King Yu,

748
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,150
Chi Yun is just speaking out of anger.

749
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,080
Yes, Sword King.

750
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,460
He—

751
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,380
Very well.

752
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,380
I accept it.

753
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,190
Chi Yun.

754
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,320
Foxy Tang.

755
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,230
I knew it—

756
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,550
every time I'm about to have my moment,

757
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,480
you show up to steal the spotlight.

758
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,220
Foxy Tang,

759
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,550
I bet him I wouldn't take
a single step back.
