00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,570
Sir, you're sweating.

4
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,450
Is it because you're exhausted,

5
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,810
or because...

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,720
you're nervous?

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,610
You're pressing on my legs.

8
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
You broke your leg?

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,170
Why didn't you push me away?

10
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,639
You're injured.

11
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,010
I was afraid of hurting you again.

12
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,290
You don't have to force yourself.

13
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,090
Are we going to starve to death here?

14
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,520
Or...

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,980
Master Puzhu, do you think

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,150
dying together with me,
the West Palace Chief

17
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,120
of Fengliu Shop,

18
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,600
would stain your reputation?

19
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,750
I won't die.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
And neither will you.

21
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,570
I'll go find something to eat.

22
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,280
Master Puzhu,

23
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,170
do you eat meat?

24
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,820
Master Puzhu hasn't returned yet.

25
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,160
The Sword Alliance has lost a major force.

26
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,030
Not just that.

27
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,910
Aside from this map,

28
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,560
which might not even be real,

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,710
we know nothing

30
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,610
about this Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

31
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,360
And they know nothing

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
about us either.

33
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,400
They also want to know

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,360
how many weapons,

35
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
how many supplies,

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,840
and

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,760
how many experts we have.

38
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,310
Tomorrow,

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
send disciples good at lightness skill

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,030
to scout

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,530
and pretend to be alone.

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,060
Then have Master Shangguan

43
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,590
lead a team to lie in ambush from behind,

44
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,310
draw out the people of Fengliu Shop,

45
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,840
and capture them for questioning.

46
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,640
Leave it to me.

47
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,710
Master Pu,

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,680
how's the antidote

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,430
I asked you to prepare?

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,160
Don't worry.

51
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,190
If I can't make it, I'll never call myself

52
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,520
the Poison Saint again.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,890
Master Shao,

54
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,190
Sword Masters...

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Mr. Tang.

56
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,670
Our ship from Sword King City has arrived.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,840
Everyone,

58
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,920
in this operation against Fengliu Shop,

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,630
everyone

60
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,600
must follow the plan.

61
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,510
No unauthorized actions.

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
No going in alone.

63
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes!

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,310
Mr. Yu,

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,300
do you have any questions?

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,390
No.

67
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,930
Mr. Tang, bad news.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,050
Something's wrong.

69
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,310
Senior Zhong,

70
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,830
can we really do this?

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,870
Mr. Tang said

72
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,430
we must not leave the group
without authorization.

73
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
But Master also said

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,280
someone needs to scout ahead

75
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,040
to verify whether the map is real.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,830
If we can find

77
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,030
useful information,

78
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,310
it will help the Sword Alliance.

79
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,040
Back at Shanfeng Branch,

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,390
it was always you leading us.

81
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,250
After you left,

82
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,680
no one ever gave us
important assignments again.

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,140
We were almost reduced to doing chores.

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,000
When I return to Shanfeng Branch,

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,190
I won't let

86
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,250
this happen again.

87
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,040
Let me tell you.

88
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
Last time I led a team,

89
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,510
-Hide!
-and caught several of them.

90
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,000
Really?

91
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,659
That's impressive.

92
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,270
We got several boxes of treasures.

93
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,920
I'll take you along next time.

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Great.

95
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,610
No problem.

96
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,310
Let's go!

97
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,040
Follow them!

98
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,570
Let's go!

99
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,070
Hurry!

100
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,800
Strange.

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,470
They're not moving fast.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,330
Why can't we catch up with them?

103
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,640
Something's wrong.

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,050
Everyone, retreat!

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,650
Since you're here already,

106
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,020
why retreat?

107
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,070
It's him?

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,780
Everyone, run!

109
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,200
Split up and run in different directions!

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,310
Blood Begonias,

111
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,200
bloom.

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,420
There's no escape.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,190
He's toying with us.

114
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,510
This has nothing to do with them.

115
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,710
You didn't kill them,

116
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,560
which proves your target is me!

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,240
Let them go!

118
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,880
Dr. Liu!

119
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,750
Master,

120
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,040
this is Dr. Liu.

121
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm in a good mood today.

122
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,159
If you come over yourself,

123
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,310
I'll let them go.

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
You, the mighty head of Fengliu Shop,

125
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,890
actually don't keep your word?

126
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,010
Unlike Tang Lici,

127
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,430
I always keep my word.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,070
Seven days after the flowers wither,

129
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,020
the poison will wear off,

130
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,820
and they'll wake up on their own.

131
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,820
However,

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,190
you...

133
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,870
know me?

134
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,799
Let me formally introduce myself.

135
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,700
My name is Liu Yan.

136
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,360
Senior Zhong!

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Senior Zhong!

138
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Senior Zhong!

139
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,390
Zhong!

140
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,360
-Heroine!
-Senior Zhong!

141
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Zhong!

142
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
-Ms. Zhong!
-Senior Zhong!

143
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
-Search carefully!
-Zhong!

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,960
Gu.

145
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,510
Earlier,

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
a strange thick fog appeared here.

147
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,650
The wild geese wouldn't come near.

148
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,690
One of my disciples

149
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,240
saw from a distance,
riding on a wild goose,

150
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
that Ms. Zhong

151
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,470
was coming this way with people.

152
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,080
Gu!

153
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,670
Yu!

154
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,750
Yu.

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Master Jiang.

156
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,550
Yu, you're finally here.

157
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,150
We still

158
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,350
haven't found Zhong.

159
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm afraid something happened to her.

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,950
Don't worry yet.

161
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,270
We'll definitely find her.

162
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's split up and search.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,530
Alright.

164
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,200
Let's go!

165
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,630
Everyone, spread out

166
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,360
and search carefully!

167
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,720
-Look carefully!
-Zhong!

168
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,520
Senior Zhong!

169
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,200
Follow me this way!

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
-Senior Zhong! Senior Zhong!
-Zhong!

171
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,630
Senior Zhong!

172
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
Senior Zhong!

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,150
Senior Zhong!

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,550
Senior Zhong!

175
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,630
Senior Zhong!

176
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,030
Zhong!

177
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,790
Zhong!

178
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,840
Zhong!

179
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,910
Not her.

180
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,080
Zhong!

181
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,390
Zhong!

182
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,070
There are drag marks here.

183
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,120
-It looks like Fengliu Shop
-Zhong!

184
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,180
dragged them here.

185
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,480
Zhong!

186
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,120
Gu!

187
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,670
Gu!

188
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,440
Zhong!

189
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,150
Zhong's not here!

190
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,050
Don't panic.

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,550
Master Jiang.

192
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,810
Look at this.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,860
Don't touch it.

194
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,770
It should be a curse bug.

195
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,810
Take it back

196
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,170
and have Mr. Tang identify it.

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,690
It's Liu Yan!

198
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,260
Liu Yan is skilled at using curse bugs!

199
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,810
So,

200
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,920
Ms. Zhong

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,920
might have been taken by Liu Yan?

202
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Mr. Tang,

203
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,590
what should we do now?

204
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,190
[Man on earth, good at birth.]

205
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,030
First, call back the search team.

206
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,320
Then how are we supposed
to rescue Ms. Zhong?

207
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,030
Liu Yan only took Ms. Zhong

208
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,200
as a hostage.

209
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,670
He won't kill her now.

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,720
Liu Yan uses curse bugs
with deadly precision.

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Disciples affected by the Blood Begonias

212
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,270
need 7 days to wake;

213
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,600
if forced awake,

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
they'll die.

215
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,310
This is a challenge from Liu Yan.

216
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,390
What does it mean?

217
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,800
A life for a life.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,390
Seven days is the deadline.

219
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,720
If we can't rescue Ms. Zhong
within 7 days,

220
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,440
the disciples will survive,

221
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,600
and she will die.

222
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
That's right.

223
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,740
Seven days—

224
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,670
that's the challenge I set for them.

225
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,480
I don't understand.

226
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Master, why did you

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,930
give them 7 days?

228
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,900
If we attack first,

229
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,010
the initiative is in their hands.

230
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,830
But by setting a challenge

231
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,860
with a deadline,

232
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,720
people get anxious,

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,790
afraid,

234
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,720
and they stall.

235
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,780
For life-and-death matters,

236
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,960
people will wait
until the last moment to decide,

237
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
and the initiative will swing back to us.

238
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,790
Seven days

239
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,490
is enough to create cracks among them.

240
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,510
I see.

241
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,360
Whether they decide in the end

242
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,670
to save her or not,

243
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,910
the unity Tang Lici wants

244
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,780
will be broken.

245
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,330
The Sword Alliance's biggest problem

246
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,990
is its internal instability,

247
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,030
with no binding interests
and only empty talk of justice.

248
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,960
We'll start

249
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,360
with their disagreements,

250
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,220
pry them apart,

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,450
and let the alliance

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,820
collapse from within.

253
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,870
Master,

254
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm back.

255
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Chunji, you're back.

256
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,760
You did a great job on this recon

257
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
of Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

258
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,030
You made a great contribution
to the Sword Alliance.

259
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,390
Even Mr. Tang says

260
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,200
that without Ms. Zhong,

261
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,150
we'd have had no chance
of winning this battle.

262
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,620
This is simply my duty.

263
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,550
Those 6 Sword Masters,

264
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,790
hearing you faced Liu Yan's brutal torture

265
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,080
with unflinching courage

266
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
and defended the Sword Alliance's honor,

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,670
were utterly

268
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,840
impressed.

269
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
They all begged me

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,390
to immediately restore you

271
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,190
as the Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

272
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
Looks like this time,

273
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,150
you finally made it through.

274
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,160
It's been 3 days.

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
How long can you hold out?

276
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,440
Just...

277
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,480
kill me.

278
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,220
This time,

279
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,510
are you serious?

280
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,040
I don't want to kill you.

281
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,420
I deliberately set a trap to catch you.

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
If I let you die easily,

283
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,660
what would be the point?

284
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,830
Think about it—

285
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,630
the top heroine among the righteous sects,

286
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,430
Zhong Chunji,

287
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,230
the beloved disciple of Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

288
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,080
out of selfishness and recklessness,

289
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,920
drags everyone to their deaths

290
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,340
and ends up
the target of the world's scorn.

291
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,270
What a splendid drama.

292
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,270
No.

293
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,300
You won't succeed.

294
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
My master

295
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,010
will surely see through your plot.

296
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,800
He won't...

297
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,440
What?

298
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,670
He won't come to save you?

299
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,510
Wouldn't that be even sadder?

300
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,480
Ms. Zhong,

301
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,330
you truly are
Master Shao's beloved disciple.

302
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,730
You know him well.

303
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,670
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will surely attack

304
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,930
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

305
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,730
but a well-prepared attack

306
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,510
is completely different

307
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,870
from a rash one

308
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,700
launched just to save you.

309
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,970
Shao Yanping is a smart man.

310
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,800
Sacrificing your life

311
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,120
to save the Sword Alliance
from major losses

312
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,520
is too good a deal for him.

313
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,910
Anyway,

314
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,800
it's simply because
you're not worth enough.

315
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,320
Tang Lici is involved
in the Zhoudi Tower case,

316
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,390
yet Shao Yanping

317
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,200
showed him mercy

318
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,490
and even honored him as the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance.

319
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,550
But what about you?

320
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,510
The great heroine Zhong Chunji,

321
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,000
Chief of Shanfeng Branch—

322
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,440
all of these titles

323
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,470
are his reward to you.

324
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,480
None of them

325
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,720
truly belongs to you.

326
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,200
That's why you fight so hard

327
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
to defend him,

328
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,150
because you know, without him,

329
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,600
you are nothing.

330
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,750
You...

331
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
are too weak.

332
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,200
If you think I'm so worthless,

333
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,920
then why waste your breath?

334
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,030
Kill me already!

335
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm standing up for you.

336
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,100
After all you've done
for the Sword Alliance,

337
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,360
they still won't make a single sacrifice

338
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,600
for you.

339
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,830
Who am I, Zhong Chunji,

340
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,270
to make a monster like you

341
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,030
pity me, Master?

342
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,320
In your heart,

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
there's also a monster.

344
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,280
Otherwise, how would you

345
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
have acted on your own

346
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,570
and fallen right into my trap?

347
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,270
I have one as well.

348
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,440
But I've already

349
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,670
let mine out without shame.

350
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,870
While you, Ms. Zhong,

351
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,050
are still putting on a facade.

352
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,270
Ms. Zhong,

353
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,950
you are just an ordinary person.

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,510
Why do you hold yourself

355
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,040
to the standards of a saint?

356
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,080
Cry when you want to cry.

357
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,720
Laugh when you want to laugh.

358
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,520
When you're afraid,

359
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,630
allow yourself to be afraid.

360
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,100
And when you want something,

361
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
reach out and take it.

362
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,600
No rush.

363
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,120
There are still 4 days.

364
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,630
Ms. Zhong, if you want to die,

365
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,770
waiting for 4 more days
won't make a difference,

366
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,240
right?

367
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,570
If you survive these 4 days,

368
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll give you a great gift,

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,160
a gift that allows you to cast aside

370
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,030
your identity as Shao Yanping's disciple

371
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,920
and still

372
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,960
command respect.

373
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,670
You can take a gamble.

Master Shao,

423
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,340
it's time to go to Wanhua Hall.

424
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,890
Third Brother,

425
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,590
of course we have to fight,

426
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,550
but if we fight now,

427
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,720
we'll fall right into his trap.

428
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Since we're going to fight anyway,

429
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,510
isn't it the same
whether we fight now or later?

430
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,270
If you ask me,

431
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,020
it's all that girl's fault

432
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,490
for acting on her own.

433
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,110
At a time like this,

434
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,110
you're still blaming Ms. Zhong?

435
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,510
Everyone, please calm down.

436
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,770
Let's talk patiently.

437
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,590
Besides,

438
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,680
isn't Ms. Zhong's life

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,400
a life?

440
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,330
We still have 4 days.

441
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,410
There's still time to vote.

442
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,050
Right?

443
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,510
We've been arguing for 3 days.

444
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,780
Have we reached an agreement?

445
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,420
Master Shao,

446
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,070
Mr. Tang,

447
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,820
you're here.

448
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,410
It's been 3 days.

449
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,110
Three days of waiting—

450
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,180
I understand how you feel.

451
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
Chunji was captured,

452
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,960
Master Puzhu is missing,

453
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,550
and the map of the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion—

454
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,110
all show that Fengliu Shop

455
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,310
has already set a trap

456
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,370
and is just waiting for us to fall in.

457
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,640
Zhong Chunji

458
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,720
is my beloved disciple.

459
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,700
But every life

460
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,590
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance

461
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,790
is equally precious.

462
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,830
I...

463
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,830
cannot put everyone at risk

464
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,090
in this circumstance.

465
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,220
Therefore,

466
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,830
I have decided

467
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,930
to postpone our attack
on the Peony Pavilion.

468
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,350
What?

469
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,170
Master Shao,

470
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,850
while we're thinking

471
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
how we won't fall into

472
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,110
Liu Yan's trap,

473
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,360
actually,

474
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,920
we are already in it.

475
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,720
Liu Yan

476
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,480
wants to put us in a dilemma;

477
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,030
he wants us...

478
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,930
Isn't that enough?

479
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,160
-To argue endlessly...
-At a time like this,

480
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
you are still blaming Ms. Zhong?

481
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,680
And...

482
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,730
tear ourselves apart.

483
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
I consider myself the best in the world.

484
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,270
The harder something looks

485
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,400
to have it both ways,

486
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,670
the more determined I am to achieve it.

487
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,950
I will not only attack
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

488
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,510
but also rescue Ms. Zhong.

489
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,400
Tang Lici,

490
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,030
now is not the time

491
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,360
for you to play the hero.

492
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
Don't act impulsively,

493
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,750
Mr. Tang.

494
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm not playing the hero

495
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,640
nor acting impulsively.

496
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,800
Master Shao,

497
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,400
since we've decided
to attack Fengliu Shop,

498
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,160
if we allow delays

499
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,590
simply because

500
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,370
the plan is disrupted,

501
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,830
the longer we stall,

502
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,590
the deeper the unrest and suspicion

503
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,590
within the Sword Alliance

504
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,480
will grow.

505
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,310
They seized one chance

506
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,160
against us,

507
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,160
so they'll certainly seize

508
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
a second.

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,260
This is my first point.

510
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,880
Second,

511
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,650
Ms. Zhong is Master Shao's disciple.

512
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,140
Master Shao worries that if he

513
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,000
lets everyone risk themselves
to rescue her,

514
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,440
he'll put other disciples in danger.

515
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

516
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,070
Ms. Zhong is also a disciple
of the Sword Alliance

517
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,600
and a major force within it.

518
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,680
If Master Shao won't even rescue

519
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,510
his own disciple,

520
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,240
what kind of a heartless leader

521
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,400
will he appear to be

522
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,270
in the eyes

523
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,800
of the other disciples
in the Sword Alliance?

524
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,200
Third,

525
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
even if Liu Yan
has set an inescapable trap,

526
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,160
whether the Sword Alliance takes action
or not,

527
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,760
my friends

528
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,110
and I

529
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,090
will go to Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

530
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,550
to rescue Ms. Zhong—

531
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,550
because

532
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,590
she's one of us.

533
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,830
We are willing to go with you!

534
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,590
Mr. Tang,

535
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,160
thank you.

536
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,920
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,590
That woman is really tough.

538
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,360
I'll work myself to death

539
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,920
before I kill her.

540
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,280
Thank you for your help,
East Palace Chief.

541
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,790
Congratulations, Ms. Zhong.

542
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,930
Master sent me to bring you a gift.

543
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,520
Thank you.

544
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,780
How many days have we been trapped here?

545
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,480
Today is the 6th day.

546
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,070
It's been six days already,

547
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,530
and no one has found us yet.

548
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,890
Let me help you.

549
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,630
Sir, don't be so formal.

550
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,680
Is it good?

551
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,070
That's the last fruit

552
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,550
I could pick.

553
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
I can't use my inner strength,

554
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,260
and your leg's broken.

555
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,100
I want to support you
so we can go look for food together.

556
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,750
Please.

557
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,680
These fruits

558
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,030
aren't enough for us.

559
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,550
Besides,

560
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,940
I've grown sick
of eating them these past few days.

561
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,530
Catch a couple of fish.

562
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
We can grill them.

563
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,090
I won't eat them.

564
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,140
Miss Tao, please go ahead.

565
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,110
You...

566
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,060
Fish are lives.

567
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,960
So am I.

568
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,270
If I starve to death

569
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,880
because you don't want to kill them,

570
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,940
wouldn't that mean

571
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,750
I die because of you?

572
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,710
Happy now?

573
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,630
Sir, you're really amusing.

574
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,110
Much more amusing than

575
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,040
when we were chess partners.

576
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,510
Amusing?

577
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,240
You know once I recover,

578
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,570
you'll be the one to die.

579
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,200
You're truly...

580
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,920
amusingly stupid.

581
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,640
You never actually wanted

582
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,240
to kill me.

583
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,180
Instead,
you've been forcing me to kill you.

584
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Why?

585
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,350
Do you know what I like, Sir?

586
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,440
I like watching people fall.

587
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,990
All it takes is a moment's hesitation,

588
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,160
a fleeting thought.

589
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,480
They could've said no,

590
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,500
but they couldn't resist temptation.

591
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,170
And just like that,

592
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,550
they walk to

593
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,110
the cliff's edge,

594
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,090
lose their footing,

595
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,370
and fall into an endless abyss,

596
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,240
never to climb back up,

597
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,590
never to see the sky again.

598
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,030
Don't you think

599
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,480
that's amusing?

600
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Captivating.

601
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,890
Miss Tao, you find this amusing?

602
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,830
Sir, do you think

603
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,490
I deserve to die even more now?

604
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,030
I don't think that

605
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,110
once someone takes a wrong path,

606
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,670
they can't turn back.

607
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
Sir, are you saying

608
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,790
I should turn back

609
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,510
before it's too late?

610
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,770
Everyone has desires,

611
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,250
just as the Evil Pill
awakens people's cravings.

612
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,510
It's never too late

613
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
to find your way back.

614
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,170
Just turn back,

615
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,230
and you'll see the shore.

616
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,950
Everyone,

617
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,870
this attack on Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

618
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,620
will be extremely difficult.

619
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,000
Everyone must hold their positions

620
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,060
and follow orders.

621
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,510
We'll infiltrate

622
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,310
through the northern waterway,

623
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,670
relying primarily
on Master Jiang's Falcon Unit

624
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,130
for overall observation and early warning.

625
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,880
Master Shao,

626
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,860
Deputy Lord Yu,

627
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,420
you'll lead the Leopard Unit
as the vanguard,

628
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,310
breaching enemy lines
and clearing obstacles.

629
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,560
Master Cheng, Mr. Gu,

630
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,800
you'll lead the Black Tortoise Unit

631
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,860
forward steadily.

632
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,040
Stay alert.

633
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,910
The six Sword Masters will guard the rear

634
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,110
to prevent ambushes.

635
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
All units, keep pace.

636
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,260
If you're blocked, call for support.

637
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,560
Lici,

638
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,280
you're always trying to prove

639
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,540
you can do everything,

640
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,120
right?

641
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,540
There's thick fog?

642
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,350
Why is there miasma all of a sudden?

643
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,560
Send the signal.

644
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,520
There's miasma spreading from the north.

645
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,780
All ships, stay close.

646
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,690
Beware of ambushes.

647
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,800
Message from the Falcon Unit.

648
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,060
There's poisonous miasma approaching.

649
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,520
Pass down the order.

650
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,670
All disciples, take your antidote.

651
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes.

652
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,130
Did Foxy Tang lie to me?

653
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,040
Is this mission

654
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,370
really that important?

655
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,040
Why do I always feel like

656
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,830
he's doing

657
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,890
something more important than this?

658
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,750
The mission is complete.

659
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Where's my stuff?

660
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,960
As long as you give it to me,

661
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
reversing fate

662
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,450
or turning back time won't be a problem.

663
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,520
Qiaoyi Qiankun?

664
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,300
How about this?

665
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,030
I'll give you another mission.

666
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,040
Okay.

667
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Why is he here?

668
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,630
And why is he running errands for a kid?

669
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,720
Everyone, be careful.

670
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,580
We've entered the Burial Forest.

671
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,210
What kind of flower is this?

672
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,190
It's Bone-Soaking Lotus,

673
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,650
grown in poisonous water.

674
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,050
Deputy Lord Yu,

675
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,440
tell everyone in the fleet to stay alert

676
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,300
and avoid falling into the water.

677
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,720
What's that?

678
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,930
The lotuses contain Man-eating Curse Bugs.

679
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,980
Stay alert!

680
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,449
Twin Sabers front the precious shrine;

681
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,110
Dragon gleam makes galaxies decline!

682
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,790
The poisonous miasma has cleared.

683
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,840
Form up and scout!

684
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,330
Send the signal!

685
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Fucui,

686
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,790
Meihua Yishu,

687
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,040
and Kuanglan Wuxing
are stationed in the east.

688
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,320
Three rows, five columns?

689
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,960
Fucui?

690
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,440
There are two human puppets to the east
of the Burial Forest.

691
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,920
Send word to the fleet behind us—

692
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,400
we'll advance on two fronts.

693
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,100
Leopard Unit and I will continue forward.

694
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,840
The six Sword Masters
will land with the Black Tortoise Unit

695
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
from the east

696
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,430
to engage Fucui's forces

697
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,360
and hold his troops.

698
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,400
The waterway ahead is blocked.

699
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,010
I'll handle it.

700
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,180
Is that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

701
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,790
Thanks to Mr. Tang.

702
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,920
We finally found it.

703
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,520
Yes, thanks to him.

704
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,420
Indeed.

705
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,040
I didn't expect

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
we'd find it so smoothly.

707
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,710
Yes.

708
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,000
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

709
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
don't weaken each other,

710
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,820
how can he, Yique Yinyang,

711
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,480
profit from the chaos?

712
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,140
Deputy Lord Yu,

713
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,080
we are now deep in enemy territory.

714
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,890
Stay focused.

715
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,670
Master,

716
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,560
Tang Lici and the others

717
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,690
have passed the gate

718
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
and are about to land.

719
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,070
This is...

720
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,190
a trap waiting for you.

721
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,040
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion?

722
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,230
Nineshot Arbalest?

723
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,110
Dodge!

724
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,200
Master, we can't get close!

725
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,320
Spread out!

726
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,190
Keep the geese low!

727
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,440
Yes!

728
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,920
Circle around the city!

729
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,300
Follow my command!

730
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,840
Signalers, come with me!

731
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,960
Master Jiang and his people encountered

732
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,360
the Nineshot Arbalests.

733
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,730
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion.

734
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,190
He's heading to the Six Sword Masters.

735
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,920
Master Shao,

736
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,910
lead the disciples to intercept Liu Yan.

737
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,870
I will act alone.

738
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,240
Yes!

739
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,700
Why does he want to act alone?

740
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,410
Everyone, stay close later.

741
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,480
Stay fully alert.

742
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm going alone.

743
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,010
What do you mean by that?

744
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,960
Why are you going alone?

745
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,340
To save her, of course.

746
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,590
I'm afraid you won't come back.

747
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,260
Deputy Lord Yu,

748
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,220
this path is full of traps.

749
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,250
If you're not afraid of your men

750
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:58,880
dying,

751
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,440
feel free to follow me.

752
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,930
Disciples of Sword King City!

753
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,880
Go quickly

754
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,340
to reinforce Master Shao!

755
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,880
Yes!

756
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,540
Be careful!

757
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,960
Tai'e Sword!

758
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,760
The wind sweeps over the grass!

759
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,130
Sound Killing Technique?

760
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,830
Lotuses and duckweeds in full bloom;

761
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,420
through shrieks and howls,
moss veils the gloom.

762
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,180
I am Qingchan.

763
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,860
I am Xiaohong.

764
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,320
We're here to welcome the guest

765
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,750
for the Master.

766
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,230
Miss,

767
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,040
I'm afraid you're not qualified

768
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,000
to stop me.

769
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,370
Kill.

770
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,330
Not a step back?

771
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,320
Master Shao, you really are capable.

772
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,120
But if the Tai'e Sword is sealed,

773
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,780
will you still be so relaxed?

774
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,270
You really think you can seal
the Tai'e Sword

775
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,730
with your amateur skills?

776
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,360
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword

777
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,270
you can win?

778
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,520
You really underestimated the Masters

779
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,920
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance!
