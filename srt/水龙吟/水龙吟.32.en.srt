[Episode 32]

3
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,840
Tell him to come meet me out here.

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,509
Everyone,

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
at this point,

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,788
I'd like to propose an effective plan.

7
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,789
It needs to be carried out by you two.

8
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,869
Please drive Mr. Tang's pleasure boat

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
to waterways.

10
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,600
If Liu Yan can be lured away,

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,950
then Sword Alliance

12
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,150
might stand a chance

13
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,430
against Fengliu Shop.

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,949
In the event of Liu Yan realizing

15
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,019
he has been tricked,

16
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,220
try to stall him for as long as possible.

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,590
Besides,

18
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,069
though Master Puzhu was injured before,

19
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,279
he's about to fully recover.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,419
Perhaps we can hold out

21
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,820
till the imperial reinforcements arrive.

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,300
I see.

23
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,869
Shao Yanping is truly a conniving man.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,930
He tricked me with a bunch of dummies.

25
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,970
Exactly.

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,390
It's getting dark soon.

27
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,169
The imperial reinforcements
could arrive anytime.

28
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,530
I suggest you quit
and go home now.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,519
Leave before it's too late.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,310
Or you might just

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,110
lose everything in Mount Cloud.

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,419
As long as I can catch Tang Lici,

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,880
I don't mind losing
the entire Fengliu Shop.

34
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,840
I bet he's still at the Sword Alliance.

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,310
Stop him!

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,310
Red lotus over the fire.

37
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:39,510
Gone with the shadow!

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,990
This medicine

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,309
won't fully neutralize the fire poison,

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,399
but it can ease

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Master Puzhu's pain for now.

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,770
Since you're already here,

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
why leave?

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,950
Sir,

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
don't forget

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
that we stand on opposite sides.

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,910
If that's the case,

48
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
why

49
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,910
save me at all?

50
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm indebted to you.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,340
I wanted to offer myself to you,

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,370
but I feared you'd refuse,

53
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,650
so all I could give was this antidote.

54
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,180
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,340
Sir, it took you 7 days to heal.

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,820
I figured

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,189
that you'd definitely return

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,669
to the battlefield after you recovered.

59
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,070
So, I decided to wait here

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,700
for you, Master Puzhu.

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,740
Why risk coming here?

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,310
To visit you.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,750
To assassinate you.

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,870
Master Puzhu,

65
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,890
which answer do you like?

66
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,840
I like you...

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,170
forsaking the wrong for the right.

68
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,030
"Like"?

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,520
By that, I meant I hoped.

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,510
That's not strong enough.

71
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,620
I want you to like me.

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,190
Liu Yan has gone crazy.

73
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,280
Fengliu Shop will absolutely fall tomorrow.

74
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,590
About the Nine Qilin Transformations,

75
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,110
I can tell you a secret.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Does this count as

77
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,560
"forsaking the wrong for
the right" —which you like?

78
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,770
[Tingyun Pavilion]

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,280
Do you know

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
who killed your brother?

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
It was Tang Lici.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Shei.

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
You're here.

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Miss Shei,

85
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,810
why didn't you come in?

86
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,110
He looks peaceful.

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,750
Is he recovering?

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,050
No, he's dying.

89
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,170
The poison in him is quite unusual.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,309
It seems to have been
made particularly for him.

91
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,110
There's nothing I can do to help.

92
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,430
To add to that,

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,390
the heart crystal in his abdomen

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,510
is slowly killing him.

95
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
Heart crystal?

96
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,880
What heart crystal?

97
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,120
You don't know about that?

98
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,190
In his abdomen

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
resides Fang Zhou's heart crystal.

100
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,650
Whose is it?

101
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,970
Whose heart crystal is it?

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,190
Fang Zhou's.

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,110
Senior!

104
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,770
Is there a chance

105
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,820
for Fang Zhou to be revived?

106
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,030
His body has vanished.

107
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,290
How can he be revived?

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,310
Besides,

109
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,550
if his heart crystal is to be preserved,

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Tang Lici will die.

111
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,440
There's only one cure now.

112
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,599
That is, when Tang Lici wakes up,

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
he'll have to use his Rebirth Scroll

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,330
to transfer all the toxins

115
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,290
to Fang Zhou's heart crystal.

116
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,280
Only in that way can he survive.

117
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,570
What if

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,830
he can't wake up?

119
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,240
Then he'll die in a beautiful dream

120
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,480
with that heart crystal.

121
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,050
And what if

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,270
he wakes up?

123
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,220
When that happens,

124
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
he'll surely regret

125
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,730
not dying in the dream.

126
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,740
That way,

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,750
at least

128
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,750
he won't have to make a tough choice.

129
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120
This is...

130
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,240
Zhoudi Tower?

131
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,920
Why am I here?

132
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,670
No.

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
No!

134
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,390
Don't go away, Fang Zhou...

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Right.

136
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,610
Fang Zhou is forever gone.

137
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,030
His things remain,

138
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,890
yet he no longer exists.

139
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,630
Fang Zhou,

140
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm useless.

142
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,240
I couldn't bring you back.

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Lici.

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,580
Are you looking for me?

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Senior...

146
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
I thought you already...

147
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,350
It really is you.

148
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,190
Lici,

149
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
did you have a bad dream?

150
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
There, there.

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,780
All is fine.

152
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,509
Dreams are the opposite of reality.

153
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,370
The good thing is you've woken up.

154
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,270
Today is your birthday.

155
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,260
Everyone is waiting for you.

156
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,990
Why just stand there?

157
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,850
Come and eat.

158
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,550
Little Monster,

159
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,930
what's with your eyes?

160
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,650
Why do you look so pale?

161
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,220
Did you not sleep well last night?

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm fine.

163
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,770
I just had a dream.

164
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
A bad dream.

165
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,850
It must've been a bad dream.

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,750
It's alright now.

167
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,869
That was in the past.

168
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
Come on, sit down.

169
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,119
A mere bad dream, wasn't it?

170
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,920
Let's eat now.

171
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,509
How about we play a tune together

172
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,510
to soothe

173
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,939
Little Monster's nerves later?

174
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,690
Sounds good.

175
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,569
We'll play the piece composed by Senior...

176
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,430
"Wishing Each Other a Long Life."

177
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,550
How wonderful.

178
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,420
You're all here.

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,250
I've finally come back.

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
As it turns out,

181
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,150
all that happened

182
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,770
was just a bad dream.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,080
What did you dream about?

184
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,330
I dreamed that 10 years later,

185
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,960
Yique Yinyang made a comeback,

186
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,430
yet you, Senior,

187
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,210
were not around anymore.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Those...

189
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,270
who died trying to stop

190
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,330
Yique Yinyang

191
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
were never to return.

192
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,580
All the sacrifices...

193
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,900
were in vain.

194
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,630
Lici,

195
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,780
just think about how many children

196
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,549
would grow up safely and healthily,

197
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,599
and how many family would
be spared from separation

198
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
during these 10 years

199
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,830
of peace.

200
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,380
Spring comes again after snow melts.

201
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,390
In this world,

202
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
not a second of effort is wasted.

203
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,029
Although sometimes

204
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,290
hope may be shattered,

205
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,370
new hope

206
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,790
would always rise

207
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,420
from destruction.

208
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,320
New hope?

209
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,269
New hope

210
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,270
and new people

211
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,840

212

But you are

213
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:07,720
already with me now.

214
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,260
There are others too.

215
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,080
What are they doing here?

216
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300

They need you back.

00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,549
Now, once you mobilize your energy,

345
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,789
this novel poison will crush

346
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,960
all your meridians.

347
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,109
Then even miraculous
medicine can't help you.

348
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,269
Fortunately, the heart crystal in you

349
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,599
is tying you down to stillness.

350
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,330
You can't channel your
energy even if you want to.

351
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Miss Shei,

352
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,099
you're the most reasonable one.

353
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Try talking some sense into him.

354
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
Why are you both so quiet?

355
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,410
Forget it.

356
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,639
I'll perform acupuncture on you now.

357
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,029
Regulate your energy flow as I proceed,

358
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,439
so as to suppress the toxins.

359
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,750
How long was I in a coma?

360
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,920
How is the battle going?

361
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,440
-You need to rest now. -Answer me.

362
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,479
What's the current situation

363
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
at Tongsha River?

364
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,110
Shei.

365
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Tell me.

366
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,990
When you were in a coma,

367
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
in order to catch you,

368
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,309
Liu Yan ordered Fengliu Shop

369
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,770
to attack with full force.

370
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Defend Tongsha River,

371
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,590
till our dying breath!

372
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,400
Charge!

373
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Master Jiang!

374
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,920
There's no way to fend off them.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,459
The main force of the Sword Alliance

376
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,060
must not be decimated again.

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
General Yuchi,

378
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,809
retreat with the members
of the Sword Alliance now.

379
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,540
I'll lead the Yanmen disciples

380
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,679
to guard your backs.

381
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,079
Master Jiang, you can't stop the enemy!

382
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Just go!

383
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,480
Master Jiang!

384
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,290
Yanmen Sect will execute the military order

385
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,670
till death takes us!

386
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,970
If I leave too,

387
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,210
who will fight the enemy?

388
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,440
I am a man of faith and honor!

389
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,390
You're biting off more than you can chew.

390
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,120
The enemy's blood

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,440
stains Yanmen's maples;

392
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,790
The enemy's blood

393
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,030
stains Yanmen's maples;

394
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,830
As constant as death,

395
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,030
their crimson glows.

396
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,110
Cheng...

397
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Today,

398
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,670
Yanmen people

399
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,350
have shed all their blood,

400
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,350
just for...

401
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,230
the justice of jianghu

402
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,060
and the peace of the world!

403
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,270
When Master Shao arrived with his men,

404
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,480
Master Jiang

405
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,560
had died in the battle.

406
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,140
Tongsha River has fallen.

407
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,790
Mount Cloud is vulnerable.

408
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,350
Where is Liu Yan?

409
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Where is he?

410
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,329
Though Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

411
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,190
successfully lured Liu Yan away,

412
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,979
the Nine Qilin Transformations
and the formidable fighters

413
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,440
of Fengliu Shop were
not to be taken lightly.

414
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,410
It was an utterly arduous batter.

415
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,919
Master Cheng ventured deep into enemy lines

416
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,680
and was severely wounded.

417
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:49,750
Heavenly Sword, slay the evil!

418
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,580
Meanwhile, Deputy Lord Yu

419
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,880
encountered

420
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,480
Yu Qifeng, who was on
the way to attack the city.

421
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,710
You useless fool!

422
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,190
Is that the sword you plan
to kill your father with?

423
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Come at me then!

424
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,210
As you wish!

425
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,690
My son...

426
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,030
This really

427
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:59,030
is the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

428
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,749
The mediocrity that has lasted for five...

429
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,750
no,

430
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,120
six generations of the Sword King City

431
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,580
is finally coming to an end.

432
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,230
Father...

433
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
At last,

434
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,929
with severe injuries, Deputy Lord Yu still

435
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,390
managed to kill Yu Qifeng.

436
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,959
But the three Sword Masters,

437
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,789
namely Shang Yunqi, Pu Kuisheng,

438
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,790
and Ji Wuyou...

439
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,140
Second Master, this is...

440
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,970
There's an ambush. Run!

441
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,879
But, Second Master...

442
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Leave!

443
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Let's go!

444
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,110
Run!
- Let's go! -Go!

445
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,309
A big fish is on the hook.

446
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,640
Tie him up and bring him to the frontlines!

447
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,940
Let's see if they can go on with the fight.

448
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,999
So many Fengliu Shop elites.

449
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Eliminating all of them

450
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,260
right here will surely

451
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,070
inflict tremendous losses on Fengliu Shop.

452
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,510
Charge!

453
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,549
It's said that good swimmers
usually die of drowning,

454
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,269
and good riders of falling from horseback.

455
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,829
Today, as an expert in poison,

456
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,310
I'm going to die of it.

457
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,450
What a fitting end for me!

458
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,789
I see it as an honor

459
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,070
to trade my life

460
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,420
for severe damage on Fengliu Shop!

461
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
You...

462
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,199
I'll spare no effort to stall
you for as long as possible.

463
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,829
In the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

464
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,160
nobody fears death!

465
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,550
Today, I, Shang Yunqi,

466
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,100
have finally avenged my late husband!

467
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Fang Zhou...

468
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,320
I couldn't protect them.

469
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,780
I failed their trust.

470
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,570
Eventually, I still

471
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,060
couldn't achieve what you had achieved.

472
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,830
I'm unable to change anyone's fate.

473
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Lici,

474
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,330
military orders may motivate generals.

475
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,440
Sacrificing every life in Yanmen Sect

476
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,850
just to defend this wretched river...

477
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,430
Is it worthwhile?

478
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,380
It's true that Tongsha
River doesn't mean much,

479
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,510
but the faith and honor of Yanmen Sect

480
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,980
are priceless.

Zhao Quanyang the Ancestor

What are you doing, Xifang Tao?

676
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,480
Sir, if you agree

677
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:20,229
to keep me safe at the Sword Alliance,

678
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,959
I'll forsake the wrong for the right

679
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,479
and help you eliminate Qiaoyi Qiankun

680
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,680
before the Nine Qilin Transformations

681
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,030
are repaired by the Sky-Fallen Stone.

682
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,360
Xifang Tao,

683
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,950
I'll drag you two to hell with me!

684
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,930
Xifang Tao...

685
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,070
Everyone

686
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,320
deserves a second chance.

687
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,249
I've transferred the Thousand Curse Needle

688
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,410
and the toxins

689
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,510
to this heart crystal.

690
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
My dear brother,

691
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,400
should I hate him or not?

692
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,759
You love and hate him at the same time.

693
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,230
Is that tearing you apart?

694
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,240
This is where Zhao
Quanyang was enlightened.

695
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,359
It's indeed a beautiful place

696
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,510
to bury the dead.

697
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,510
Lici,

698
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,210
you've really become an invalid now.

699
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,510
Why are you so quiet?

700
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,109
Where is the eloquence

701
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,320
you were so proud of?

702
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,959
Where are your wit

703
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,710
and excellent martial skills?

704
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,060
Look at yourself now.

705
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,110
You can't speak or move.

706
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,109
You're just sitting there

707
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,370
like a complete loser.

708
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,520
What a shame

709
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,970
that there isn't a mirror in this dump.

710
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,740
If there was, I'd definitely make you see

711
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,640
what you've become.

712
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Do not approach

713
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
my master.

714
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,560
You call him Master?

715
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,760
He is steeped in evil.

716
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,189
He disowned his close ones

717
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,599
and betrayed his master and sect.

718
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,579
How does he deserve to be called Master?

719
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
Nonsense!

720
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,410
Don't you dare...
hurt...

721
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,630
my master...

722
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,070
Don't kill my master...
