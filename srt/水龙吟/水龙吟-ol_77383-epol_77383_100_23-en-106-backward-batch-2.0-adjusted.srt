00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,950
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,570
Sir, you're sweating.

4
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,450
Is it because you're exhausted,

5
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,810
or because...

6
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,720
you're nervous?

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,610
You're pressing on my legs.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,440
You broke your leg?

9
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,170
Why didn't you push me away?

10
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,639
You're injured.

11
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,010
I was afraid of hurting you again.

12
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,290
You don't have to force yourself.

13
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,090
Are we going to starve to death here?

14
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,520
Or...

15
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,980
Master Puzhu, do you think

16
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,150
dying together with me,
the West Palace Chief

17
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,120
of Fengliu Shop,

18
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,600
would stain your reputation?

19
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,750
I won't die.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
And neither will you.

21
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,570
I'll go find something to eat.

22
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,280
Master Puzhu,

23
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,170
do you eat meat?

24
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,820
Master Puzhu hasn't returned yet.

25
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,160
The Sword Alliance has lost a major force.

26
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,030
Not just that.

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,910
Aside from this map,

28
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,560
which might not even be real,

29
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,710
we know nothing

30
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,610
about this Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

31
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,360
And they know nothing

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
about us either.

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,400
They also want to know

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
how many weapons,

35
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
how many supplies,

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,840
and

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
how many experts we have.

38
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,310
Tomorrow,

39
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
send disciples good at lightness skill

40
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,030
to scout

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,530
and pretend to be alone.

42
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,060
Then have Master Shangguan

43
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,590
lead a team to lie in ambush from behind,

44
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,310
draw out the people of Fengliu Shop,

45
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,840
and capture them for questioning.

46
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,640
Leave it to me.

47
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,710
Master Pu,

48
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
how's the antidote

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,430
I asked you to prepare?

50
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,160
Don't worry.

51
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,190
If I can't make it, I'll never call myself

52
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,520
the Poison Saint again.

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,890
Master Shao,

54
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,190
Sword Masters...

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Mr. Tang.

56
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,670
Our ship from Sword King City has arrived.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,840
Everyone,

58
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,920
in this operation against Fengliu Shop,

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,630
everyone

60
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
must follow the plan.

61
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,510
No unauthorized actions.

62
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,870
No going in alone.

63
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes!

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,310
Mr. Yu,

65
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,300
do you have any questions?

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,390
No.

67
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,930
Mr. Tang, bad news.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,050
Something's wrong.

69
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,310
Senior Zhong,

70
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,830
can we really do this?

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,870
Mr. Tang said

72
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,430
we must not leave the group
without authorization.

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,560
But Master also said

74
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,280
someone needs to scout ahead

75
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,040
to verify whether the map is real.

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,830
If we can find

77
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,030
useful information,

78
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,310
it will help the Sword Alliance.

79
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,040
Back at Shanfeng Branch,

80
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,390
it was always you leading us.

81
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,250
After you left,

82
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,680
no one ever gave us
important assignments again.

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,140
We were almost reduced to doing chores.

84
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,000
When I return to Shanfeng Branch,

85
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,190
I won't let

86
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,250
this happen again.

87
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,040
Let me tell you.

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
Last time I led a team,

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,510
-Hide!
-and caught several of them.

90
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,000
Really?

91
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,659
That's impressive.

92
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,270
We got several boxes of treasures.

93
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,920
I'll take you along next time.

94
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,680
Great.

95
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,610
No problem.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,310
Let's go!

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,040
Follow them!

98
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,570
Let's go!

99
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,070
Hurry!

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Strange.

101
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,470
They're not moving fast.

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,330
Why can't we catch up with them?

103
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,640
Something's wrong.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,050
Everyone, retreat!

105
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,650
Since you're here already,

106
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,020
why retreat?

107
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,070
It's him?

108
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,780
Everyone, run!

109
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,200
Split up and run in different directions!

110
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,310
Blood Begonias,

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,200
bloom.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,420
There's no escape.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,190
He's toying with us.

114
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,510
This has nothing to do with them.

115
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,710
You didn't kill them,

116
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,560
which proves your target is me!

117
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Let them go!

118
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,880
Dr. Liu!

119
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,750
Master,

120
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,040
this is Dr. Liu.

121
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm in a good mood today.

122
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,159
If you come over yourself,

123
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,310
I'll let them go.

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,480
You, the mighty head of Fengliu Shop,

125
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,890
actually don't keep your word?

126
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,010
Unlike Tang Lici,

127
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,430
I always keep my word.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,070
Seven days after the flowers wither,

129
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,020
the poison will wear off,

130
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,820
and they'll wake up on their own.

131
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,820
However,

132
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,190
you...

133
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,870
know me?

134
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,799
Let me formally introduce myself.

135
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,700
My name is Liu Yan.

136
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,360
Senior Zhong!

137
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,360
Senior Zhong!

138
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Senior Zhong!

139
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,390
Zhong!

140
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,360
-Heroine!
-Senior Zhong!

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Zhong!

142
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
-Ms. Zhong!
-Senior Zhong!

143
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
-Search carefully!
-Zhong!

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,960
Gu.

145
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,510
Earlier,

146
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,240
a strange thick fog appeared here.

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,650
The wild geese wouldn't come near.

148
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,690
One of my disciples

149
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,240
saw from a distance,
riding on a wild goose,

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
that Ms. Zhong

151
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,470
was coming this way with people.

152
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,080
Gu!

153
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,670
Yu!

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,750
Yu.

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
Master Jiang.

156
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,550
Yu, you're finally here.

157
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,150
We still

158
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,350
haven't found Zhong.

159
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm afraid something happened to her.

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,950
Don't worry yet.

161
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,270
We'll definitely find her.

162
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's split up and search.

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,530
Alright.

164
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's go!

165
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,630
Everyone, spread out

166
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,360
and search carefully!

167
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
-Look carefully!
-Zhong!

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,520
Senior Zhong!

169
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,200
Follow me this way!

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,360
-Senior Zhong! Senior Zhong!
-Zhong!

171
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,630
Senior Zhong!

172
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Senior Zhong!

173
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,150
Senior Zhong!

174
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,550
Senior Zhong!

175
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,630
Senior Zhong!

176
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,030
Zhong!

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,790
Zhong!

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,840
Zhong!

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,910
Not her.

180
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,080
Zhong!

181
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,390
Zhong!

182
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,070
There are drag marks here.

183
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,120
-It looks like Fengliu Shop
-Zhong!

184
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,180
dragged them here.

185
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,480
Zhong!

186
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,120
Gu!

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,670
Gu!

188
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,440
Zhong!

189
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,150
Zhong's not here!

190
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,050
Don't panic.

191
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,550
Master Jiang.

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,810
Look at this.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,860
Don't touch it.

194
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,770
It should be a curse bug.

195
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,810
Take it back

196
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,170
and have Mr. Tang identify it.

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,690
It's Liu Yan!

198
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,260
Liu Yan is skilled at using curse bugs!

199
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,810
So,

200
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:54,920
Ms. Zhong

201
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
might have been taken by Liu Yan?

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Tang,

203
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,590
what should we do now?

204
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,190
[Man on earth, good at birth.]

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,030
First, call back the search team.

206
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,320
Then how are we supposed
to rescue Ms. Zhong?

207
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,030
Liu Yan only took Ms. Zhong

208
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,200
as a hostage.

209
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,670
He won't kill her now.

210
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,720
Liu Yan uses curse bugs
with deadly precision.

211
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
Disciples affected by the Blood Begonias

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,270
need 7 days to wake;

213
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,600
if forced awake,

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,960
they'll die.

215
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,310
This is a challenge from Liu Yan.

216
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
What does it mean?

217
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,800
A life for a life.

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,390
Seven days is the deadline.

219
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,720
If we can't rescue Ms. Zhong
within 7 days,

220
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440
the disciples will survive,

221
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,600
and she will die.

222
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,760
That's right.

223
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,740
Seven days—

224
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,670
that's the challenge I set for them.

225
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,480
I don't understand.

226
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Master, why did you

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,930
give them 7 days?

228
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,900
If we attack first,

229
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,010
the initiative is in their hands.

230
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,830
But by setting a challenge

231
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,860
with a deadline,

232
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,720
people get anxious,

233
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,790
afraid,

234
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,720
and they stall.

235
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,780
For life-and-death matters,

236
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,960
people will wait
until the last moment to decide,

237
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
and the initiative will swing back to us.

238
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,790
Seven days

239
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,490
is enough to create cracks among them.

240
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,510
I see.

241
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,360
Whether they decide in the end

242
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,670
to save her or not,

243
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,910
the unity Tang Lici wants

244
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,780
will be broken.

245
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,330
The Sword Alliance's biggest problem

246
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,990
is its internal instability,

247
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,030
with no binding interests
and only empty talk of justice.

248
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,960
We'll start

249
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,360
with their disagreements,

250
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,220
pry them apart,

251
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,450
and let the alliance

252
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,820
collapse from within.

253
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:56,870
Master,

254
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm back.

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Chunji, you're back.

256
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,760
You did a great job on this recon

257
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
of Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

258
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,030
You made a great contribution
to the Sword Alliance.

259
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,390
Even Mr. Tang says

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,200
that without Ms. Zhong,

261
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,150
we'd have had no chance
of winning this battle.

262
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,620
This is simply my duty.

263
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,550
Those 6 Sword Masters,

264
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,790
hearing you faced Liu Yan's brutal torture

265
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,080
with unflinching courage

266
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,000
and defended the Sword Alliance's honor,

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,670
were utterly

268
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,840
impressed.

269
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
They all begged me

270
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,390
to immediately restore you

271
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,190
as the Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

272
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
Looks like this time,

273
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,150
you finally made it through.

274
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,160
It's been 3 days.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,400
How long can you hold out?

276
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,440
Just...

277
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,480
kill me.

278
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,220
This time,

279
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,510
are you serious?

280
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,040
I don't want to kill you.

281
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,420
I deliberately set a trap to catch you.

282
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
If I let you die easily,

283
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,660
what would be the point?

284
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,830
Think about it—

285
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,630
the top heroine among the righteous sects,

286
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,430
Zhong Chunji,

287
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,230
the beloved disciple of Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

288
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,080
out of selfishness and recklessness,

289
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,920
drags everyone to their deaths

290
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,340
and ends up
the target of the world's scorn.

291
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,270
What a splendid drama.

292
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,270
No.

293
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,300
You won't succeed.

294
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
My master

295
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,010
will surely see through your plot.

296
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,800
He won't...

297
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,440
What?

298
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,670
He won't come to save you?

299
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,510
Wouldn't that be even sadder?

300
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,480
Ms. Zhong,

301
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,330
you truly are
Master Shao's beloved disciple.

302
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,730
You know him well.

303
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,670
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will surely attack

304
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,930
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,730
but a well-prepared attack

306
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,510
is completely different

307
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,870
from a rash one

308
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,700
launched just to save you.

309
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,970
Shao Yanping is a smart man.

310
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,800
Sacrificing your life

311
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,120
to save the Sword Alliance
from major losses

312
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,520
is too good a deal for him.

313
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,910
Anyway,

314
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,800
it's simply because
you're not worth enough.

315
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,320
Tang Lici is involved
in the Zhoudi Tower case,

316
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,390
yet Shao Yanping

317
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,200
showed him mercy

318
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,490
and even honored him as the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance.

319
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,550
But what about you?

320
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,510
The great heroine Zhong Chunji,

321
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,000
Chief of Shanfeng Branch—

322
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,440
all of these titles

323
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,470
are his reward to you.

324
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,480
None of them

325
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,720
truly belongs to you.

326
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,200
That's why you fight so hard

327
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,000
to defend him,

328
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,150
because you know, without him,

329
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,600
you are nothing.

330
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,750
You...

331
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,730
are too weak.

332
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
If you think I'm so worthless,

333
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,920
then why waste your breath?

334
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,030
Kill me already!

335
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm standing up for you.

336
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,100
After all you've done
for the Sword Alliance,

337
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,360
they still won't make a single sacrifice

338
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,600
for you.

339
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,830
Who am I, Zhong Chunji,

340
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,270
to make a monster like you

341
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,030
pity me, Master?

342
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,320
In your heart,

343
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
there's also a monster.

344
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,280
Otherwise, how would you

345
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,480
have acted on your own

346
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,570
and fallen right into my trap?

347
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,270
I have one as well.

348
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,440
But I've already

349
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,670
let mine out without shame.

350
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,870
While you, Ms. Zhong,

351
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,050
are still putting on a facade.

352
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,270
Ms. Zhong,

353
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,950
you are just an ordinary person.

354
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,510
Why do you hold yourself

355
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,040
to the standards of a saint?

356
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,080
Cry when you want to cry.

357
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,720
Laugh when you want to laugh.

358
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,520
When you're afraid,

359
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,630
allow yourself to be afraid.

360
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,100
And when you want something,

361
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,120
reach out and take it.

362
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,600
No rush.

363
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,120
There are still 4 days.

364
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,630
Ms. Zhong, if you want to die,

365
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,770
waiting for 4 more days
won't make a difference,

366
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,240
right?

367
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,570
If you survive these 4 days,

368
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll give you a great gift,

369
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,160
a gift that allows you to cast aside

370
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,030
your identity as Shao Yanping's disciple

371
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,920
and still

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
command respect.

373
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,670
You can take a gamble.

Master Shao,

423
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,340
it's time to go to Wanhua Hall.

424
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,890
Third Brother,

425
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,590
of course we have to fight,

426
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,550
but if we fight now,

427
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,720
we'll fall right into his trap.

428
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Since we're going to fight anyway,

429
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,510
isn't it the same
whether we fight now or later?

430
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,270
If you ask me,

431
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,020
it's all that girl's fault

432
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,490
for acting on her own.

433
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,110
At a time like this,

434
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,110
you're still blaming Ms. Zhong?

435
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,510
Everyone, please calm down.

436
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,770
Let's talk patiently.

437
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,590
Besides,

438
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,680
isn't Ms. Zhong's life

439
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,400
a life?

440
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,330
We still have 4 days.

441
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,410
There's still time to vote.

442
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,050
Right?

443
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,510
We've been arguing for 3 days.

444
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,780
Have we reached an agreement?

445
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,420
Master Shao,

446
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,070
Mr. Tang,

447
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,820
you're here.

448
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,410
It's been 3 days.

449
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,110
Three days of waiting—

450
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,180
I understand how you feel.

451
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,360
Chunji was captured,

452
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,960
Master Puzhu is missing,

453
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,550
and the map of the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion—

454
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,110
all show that Fengliu Shop

455
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,310
has already set a trap

456
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,370
and is just waiting for us to fall in.

457
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,640
Zhong Chunji

458
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,720
is my beloved disciple.

459
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,700
But every life

460
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,590
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance

461
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,790
is equally precious.

462
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,830
I...

463
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,830
cannot put everyone at risk

464
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,090
in this circumstance.

465
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,220
Therefore,

466
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,830
I have decided

467
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,930
to postpone our attack
on the Peony Pavilion.

468
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,350
What?

469
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,170
Master Shao,

470
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,850
while we're thinking

471
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,880
how we won't fall into

472
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,110
Liu Yan's trap,

473
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,360
actually,

474
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,920
we are already in it.

475
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,720
Liu Yan

476
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,480
wants to put us in a dilemma;

477
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,030
he wants us...

478
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,930
Isn't that enough?

479
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,160
-To argue endlessly...
-At a time like this,

480
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,960
you are still blaming Ms. Zhong?

481
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,680
And...

482
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,730
tear ourselves apart.

483
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,640
I consider myself the best in the world.

484
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,270
The harder something looks

485
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,400
to have it both ways,

486
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,670
the more determined I am to achieve it.

487
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,950
I will not only attack
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

488
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,510
but also rescue Ms. Zhong.

489
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,400
Tang Lici,

490
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,030
now is not the time

491
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,360
for you to play the hero.

492
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
Don't act impulsively,

493
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,750
Mr. Tang.

494
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm not playing the hero

495
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
nor acting impulsively.

496
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,800
Master Shao,

497
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,400
since we've decided
to attack Fengliu Shop,

498
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,160
if we allow delays

499
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,590
simply because

500
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,370
the plan is disrupted,

501
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,830
the longer we stall,

502
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,590
the deeper the unrest and suspicion

503
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,590
within the Sword Alliance

504
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,480
will grow.

505
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,310
They seized one chance

506
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,160
against us,

507
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,160
so they'll certainly seize

508
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,000
a second.

509
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,260
This is my first point.

510
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,880
Second,

511
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,650
Ms. Zhong is Master Shao's disciple.

512
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,140
Master Shao worries that if he

513
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,000
lets everyone risk themselves
to rescue her,

514
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
he'll put other disciples in danger.

515
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,840
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

516
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,070
Ms. Zhong is also a disciple
of the Sword Alliance

517
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,600
and a major force within it.

518
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,680
If Master Shao won't even rescue

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,510
his own disciple,

520
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,240
what kind of a heartless leader

521
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,400
will he appear to be

522
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,270
in the eyes

523
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,800
of the other disciples
in the Sword Alliance?

524
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,200
Third,

525
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
even if Liu Yan
has set an inescapable trap,

526
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,160
whether the Sword Alliance takes action
or not,

527
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,760
my friends

528
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,110
and I

529
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,090
will go to Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,550
to rescue Ms. Zhong—

531
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,550
because

532
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,590
she's one of us.

533
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,830
We are willing to go with you!

534
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,590
Mr. Tang,

535
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,160
thank you.

536
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,920
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,590
That woman is really tough.

538
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
I'll work myself to death

539
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,920
before I kill her.

540
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,280
Thank you for your help,
East Palace Chief.

541
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,790
Congratulations, Ms. Zhong.

542
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,930
Master sent me to bring you a gift.

543
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,520
Thank you.

544
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,780
How many days have we been trapped here?

545
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,480
Today is the 6th day.

546
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,070
It's been six days already,

547
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,530
and no one has found us yet.

548
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,890
Let me help you.

549
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,630
Sir, don't be so formal.

550
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,680
Is it good?

551
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,070
That's the last fruit

552
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,550
I could pick.

553
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,000
I can't use my inner strength,

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,260
and your leg's broken.

555
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,100
I want to support you
so we can go look for food together.

556
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,750
Please.

557
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,680
These fruits

558
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,030
aren't enough for us.

559
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,550
Besides,

560
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,940
I've grown sick
of eating them these past few days.

561
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,530
Catch a couple of fish.

562
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
We can grill them.

563
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,090
I won't eat them.

564
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,140
Miss Tao, please go ahead.

565
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,110
You...

566
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,060
Fish are lives.

567
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,960
So am I.

568
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,270
If I starve to death

569
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,880
because you don't want to kill them,

570
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,940
wouldn't that mean

571
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,750
I die because of you?

572
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,710
Happy now?

573
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,630
Sir, you're really amusing.

574
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,110
Much more amusing than

575
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,040
when we were chess partners.

576
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,510
Amusing?

577
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,240
You know once I recover,

578
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,570
you'll be the one to die.

579
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,200
You're truly...

580
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,920
amusingly stupid.

581
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,640
You never actually wanted

582
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,240
to kill me.

583
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,180
Instead,
you've been forcing me to kill you.

584
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,920
Why?

585
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,350
Do you know what I like, Sir?

586
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,440
I like watching people fall.

587
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,990
All it takes is a moment's hesitation,

588
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,160
a fleeting thought.

589
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,480
They could've said no,

590
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,500
but they couldn't resist temptation.

591
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,170
And just like that,

592
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,550
they walk to

593
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,110
the cliff's edge,

594
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,090
lose their footing,

595
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,370
and fall into an endless abyss,

596
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,240
never to climb back up,

597
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,590
never to see the sky again.

598
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,030
Don't you think

599
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,480
that's amusing?

600
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Captivating.

601
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,890
Miss Tao, you find this amusing?

602
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,830
Sir, do you think

603
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,490
I deserve to die even more now?

604
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,030
I don't think that

605
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,110
once someone takes a wrong path,

606
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,670
they can't turn back.

607
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,720
Sir, are you saying

608
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,790
I should turn back

609
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,510
before it's too late?

610
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,770
Everyone has desires,

611
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,250
just as the Evil Pill
awakens people's cravings.

612
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,510
It's never too late

613
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,600
to find your way back.

614
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,170
Just turn back,

615
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,230
and you'll see the shore.

616
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,950
Everyone,

617
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,870
this attack on Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

618
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,620
will be extremely difficult.

619
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Everyone must hold their positions

620
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,060
and follow orders.

621
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,510
We'll infiltrate

622
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,310
through the northern waterway,

623
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,670
relying primarily
on Master Jiang's Falcon Unit

624
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,130
for overall observation and early warning.

625
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,880
Master Shao,

626
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,860
Deputy Lord Yu,

627
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,420
you'll lead the Leopard Unit
as the vanguard,

628
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,310
breaching enemy lines
and clearing obstacles.

629
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,560
Master Cheng, Mr. Gu,

630
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
you'll lead the Black Tortoise Unit

631
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,860
forward steadily.

632
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,040
Stay alert.

633
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,910
The six Sword Masters will guard the rear

634
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,110
to prevent ambushes.

635
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,640
All units, keep pace.

636
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,260
If you're blocked, call for support.

637
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,560
Lici,

638
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,280
you're always trying to prove

639
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,540
you can do everything,

640
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,120
right?

641
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,540
There's thick fog?

642
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,350
Why is there miasma all of a sudden?

643
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,560
Send the signal.

644
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,520
There's miasma spreading from the north.

645
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,780
All ships, stay close.

646
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,690
Beware of ambushes.

647
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,800
Message from the Falcon Unit.

648
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,060
There's poisonous miasma approaching.

649
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,520
Pass down the order.

650
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,670
All disciples, take your antidote.

651
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes.

652
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,130
Did Foxy Tang lie to me?

653
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,040
Is this mission

654
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,370
really that important?

655
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,040
Why do I always feel like

656
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,830
he's doing

657
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,890
something more important than this?

658
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,750
The mission is complete.

659
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Where's my stuff?

660
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,960
As long as you give it to me,

661
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,160
reversing fate

662
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,450
or turning back time won't be a problem.

663
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,520
Qiaoyi Qiankun?

664
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,300
How about this?

665
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,030
I'll give you another mission.

666
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,040
Okay.

667
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Why is he here?

668
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,630
And why is he running errands for a kid?

669
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,720
Everyone, be careful.

670
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,580
We've entered the Burial Forest.

671
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,210
What kind of flower is this?

672
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,190
It's Bone-Soaking Lotus,

673
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,650
grown in poisonous water.

674
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,050
Deputy Lord Yu,

675
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,440
tell everyone in the fleet to stay alert

676
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,300
and avoid falling into the water.

677
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,720
What's that?

678
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,930
The lotuses contain Man-eating Curse Bugs.

679
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,980
Stay alert!

680
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,449
Twin Sabers front the precious shrine;

681
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,110
Dragon gleam makes galaxies decline!

682
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,790
The poisonous miasma has cleared.

683
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,840
Form up and scout!

684
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,330
Send the signal!

685
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Fucui,

686
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,790
Meihua Yishu,

687
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,040
and Kuanglan Wuxing
are stationed in the east.

688
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
Three rows, five columns?

689
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,960
Fucui?

690
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,440
There are two human puppets to the east
of the Burial Forest.

691
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,920
Send word to the fleet behind us—

692
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,400
we'll advance on two fronts.

693
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,100
Leopard Unit and I will continue forward.

694
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,840
The six Sword Masters
will land with the Black Tortoise Unit

695
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,000
from the east

696
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,430
to engage Fucui's forces

697
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,360
and hold his troops.

698
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,400
The waterway ahead is blocked.

699
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,010
I'll handle it.

700
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,180
Is that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

701
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,790
Thanks to Mr. Tang.

702
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,920
We finally found it.

703
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,520
Yes, thanks to him.

704
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,420
Indeed.

705
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,040
I didn't expect

706
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
we'd find it so smoothly.

707
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,710
Yes.

708
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,000
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

709
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
don't weaken each other,

710
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,820
how can he, Yique Yinyang,

711
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,480
profit from the chaos?

712
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,140
Deputy Lord Yu,

713
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,080
we are now deep in enemy territory.

714
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,890
Stay focused.

715
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,670
Master,

716
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Tang Lici and the others

717
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,690
have passed the gate

718
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,200
and are about to land.

719
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,070
This is...

720
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,190
a trap waiting for you.

721
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,040
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion?

722
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,230
Nineshot Arbalest?

723
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,110
Dodge!

724
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,200
Master, we can't get close!

725
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,320
Spread out!

726
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,190
Keep the geese low!

727
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,440
Yes!

728
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,920
Circle around the city!

729
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,300
Follow my command!

730
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,840
Signalers, come with me!

731
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,960
Master Jiang and his people encountered

732
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,360
the Nineshot Arbalests.

733
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,730
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion.

734
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,190
He's heading to the Six Sword Masters.

735
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,920
Master Shao,

736
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,910
lead the disciples to intercept Liu Yan.

737
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,870
I will act alone.

738
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,240
Yes!

739
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,700
Why does he want to act alone?

740
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,410
Everyone, stay close later.

741
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,480
Stay fully alert.

742
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm going alone.

743
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,010
What do you mean by that?

744
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,960
Why are you going alone?

745
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,340
To save her, of course.

746
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,590
I'm afraid you won't come back.

747
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,260
Deputy Lord Yu,

748
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,220
this path is full of traps.

749
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,250
If you're not afraid of your men

750
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,880
dying,

751
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,440
feel free to follow me.

752
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,930
Disciples of Sword King City!

753
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,880
Go quickly

754
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,340
to reinforce Master Shao!

755
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,880
Yes!

756
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,540
Be careful!

757
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,960
Tai'e Sword!

758
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,760
The wind sweeps over the grass!

759
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,130
Sound Killing Technique?

760
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,830
Lotuses and duckweeds in full bloom;

761
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,420
through shrieks and howls,
moss veils the gloom.

762
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,180
I am Qingchan.

763
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,860
I am Xiaohong.

764
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,320
We're here to welcome the guest

765
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,750
for the Master.

766
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,230
Miss,

767
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm afraid you're not qualified

768
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,000
to stop me.

769
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,370
Kill.

770
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,330
Not a step back?

771
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,320
Master Shao, you really are capable.

772
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,120
But if the Tai'e Sword is sealed,

773
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,780
will you still be so relaxed?

774
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,270
You really think you can seal
the Tai'e Sword

775
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,730
with your amateur skills?

776
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,360
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword

777
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,270
you can win?

778
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,520
You really underestimated the Masters

779
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,920
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance!
