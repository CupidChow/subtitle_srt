3
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,759
Cheng is already gone.

4
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,340
Why are you still lingering here?

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
You're free now.

6
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,120
Go wherever

7
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,509
you want to go.

8
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,710
Off you go.

9
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,570
Go!

10
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,060
Father,

11
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,290
this Yan Whistle is so hard to pick up.

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,560
Then I'll give you this wooden whistle.

13
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,220
Before you learn
how to use the Yan Whistle,

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,139
just try this wooden one instead, alright?

15
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,200
Thank you, Father.

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,450
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,860
Get lost!

18
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,710
I've just lost my son.

19
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,440
I only want some time by myself.

20
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,520
I've been sickly since childhood.

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,760
When I was busking with my father
to make a living,

22
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,750
I once saw two wild geese that got lost.

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,079
They looked like a father and his son.

24
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,440
The northern land was freezing cold.

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
The old goose froze to death
on the mudflat.

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,340
The young goose

27
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,890
hovered around the old one's body,

28
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,079
over and over again,

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,970
until my father

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,610
dug a hole and buried the old goose.

31
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,160
We people of Yanmen all know

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,360
that wild geese are
the most affectionate creatures.

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,840
Yeah,

34
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,710
wild geese are truly affectionate.

35
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,510
When I saw those two geese,

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
it was already the last month of winter.

37
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,130
The young goose was too weak to fly south.

38
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,430
A few days later,

39
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,570
a cold wave suddenly swept in,

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,990
and it followed the old goose's path
and passed away.

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
That was just foolish filial piety.

Before Mr. Jiang passed away,

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,150
he was so concerned
about the Yanmen Sect's reputation

68
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,600
that he even sacrificed his own life
to protect it.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
He cared about everything

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
that his father cared about

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
more than his own life.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
Silly boy.

73
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Why couldn't he understand

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,260
that his life

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,430
was actually what mattered most to me?

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,940
We all do what we believe is right

77
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,750
for the sake of our family.

78
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,320
But is that really good?

79
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,860
You also don't want to leave Yanmen

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,830
and me, right?

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,750

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680

86
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,300
nice to meet you.

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

88
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,430
Mr. Tang,

89
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
what's wrong?

90
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

91
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,240
Isn't it?

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,210
My friend just passed away.

94
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm not in the mood

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,330
to appreciate the scenery yet.

96
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,760
Mr. Tang, I heard that you

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,990
were the last person

98
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,810
to see Jiang Cheng before his death.

99
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,240
Before Jiang Cheng passed away,

100
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,950
I was indeed

101
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,450
the only one by his side.

102
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,480
Master Jiang is suffering
from the sudden loss of his son.

103
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,540
He had you arrested

104
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,230
and put you through all this.

105
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,510
I hope you won't mind.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Mr. Feng, that's so kind of you.

107
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,480
Haven't they told you

108
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,830
that I've already confessed

109
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,160
to killing Jiang Cheng?

110
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,510
I brought this upon myself.

111
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,860
It's just fair.

112
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't know

113
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,240
why you would take

114
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,500
such blame upon yourself,

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,980
but...

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
Judging by what you said,

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,950
you're so sure

118
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,520
that I'm not the killer?

119
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,310
Yes.

120
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,700
Because you were not

121
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,909
the one who poisoned him.

122
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,159
Why did they

123
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:09,820
release us?

124
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,970
What happened?

125
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,270
Because Mr. Feng

126
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,540
vouched for Mr. Tang.

127
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,760
Master Jiang's got no trust in us,

128
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,240
but plenty in Mr. Feng.

129
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,430
You mean

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Feng Chuanxiang, the one who went missing?

131
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,630
Yes.

132
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,000
I suppose the news of his disappearance

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,120
was just a rumor.

134
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,830
But thankfully, he arrived in time.

135
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,160
Things turned out fine.

136
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,180
I came here

137
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,040
to catch the real culprit

138
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,090
and avenge my friend's death.

139
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,580
Please help me, Mr. Tang.

140
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,400
What's in it for me?

141
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,110
If we catch the real culprit,

142
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,510
you'll naturally be cleared of suspicion.

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,490
That's not a benefit.

144
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,360
Indeed.

145
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,300
Even if I hadn't appeared,

146
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,720
you'd still find a way to escape for sure.

147
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,060
But from what I know,

148
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,909
Mr. Tang,

149
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,320
you were first involved

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,200
in the massacre of Hao Wenhou's family.

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,510
After leaving the temple,

152
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,120
you soon became

153
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,179
the prime suspect in Cheng's murder.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,970
Mr. Tang,

155
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,740
even if you escape from Yanmen,

156
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,720
how can you be sure it won't happen again?

157
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,360
Do you really want

158
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,750
to leave a trail of false accusations

159
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,720
wherever you go

160
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,870
and end up
as an enemy of the whole jianghu?

161
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,960
Mr. Feng,

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,560
you sure are well-informed.

163
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,400
After all these years in the jianghu,

164
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
I've made quite a few friends.

165
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,250
If you have so many friends,

166
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,680
why do you specifically ask for my help?

167
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,540
Because this time, the enemy is

168
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,750
way more powerful than we thought.

169
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,470
"We"?

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,300
Yes,

171
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,300
we.

172
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,630
I believe

173
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,960
we have a common enemy.

174
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,850
Chi.

175
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,980
You're awake.

176
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,640
Where are

177
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,620
those damn brutes from the Yanmen Sect?

178
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,880
Master Jiang's taken the Yanmen disciples

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,680
back already.

180
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,980
They just left?

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,750
So easily?

182
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,750
Before Master Jiang left,

183
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,810
he set a condition.

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,260
Within seven days,

185
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,790
Mr. Tang must help Mr. Feng

186
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,000
investigate how Young Master Jiang

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,150
ended up taking the Blood Ghost Pill

188
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,960
and figure out the truth

189
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,090
for the Yanmen Sect.

190
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,050
I'll go ask him about it.

191
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
I can only drink this much today.

192
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
If Jiang Cheng were still alive,

193
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,890
we would definitely
share another pot of wine with you

194
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,750
and drink to our hearts' content.

195
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,010
I didn't expect

196
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
you to hold

197
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,370
your liquor so well.

198
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,260
I'm not much of a drinker.

199
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,790
It's just that when drinking
with a kindred spirit,

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,190
even a thousand cups of wine are
not enough.

201
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,580
Really?

202
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,760
You two just met each other,

203
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,050
and now you're already kindred spirits?

204
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,030
I never knew that you, Foxy Tang,

205
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,970
were so passionate about making friends.

206
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,640
Mr. Chi.

207
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,020
Don't call me that.

208
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,700
Just call me Chi Yun.

209
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,800
Or

210
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,490
Master Chi,

211
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,350
Chief Chi,

212
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,510
any of those will do.

213
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,630
Alright.

214
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,400
We still have things to do today.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,620
We need some good tea

216
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,430
to sober up.

217
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,080
Indeed, you're right.

218
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,030
But I

219
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,610
don't have any tea with me.

220
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,470
Now

221
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,010
it's not appropriate
to ask Master Jiang for some.

222
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,070
Don't worry, Feng.

223
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,190
I have some.

224
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,280
Chi Yun,

225
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,440
serve the tea.

226
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,170
You want me

227
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,150
to pour tea for him?

228
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,010
Are you reluctant to do it?

229
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,250
I refuse.

230
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,380
Fine.

231
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,830
It hurts again?

232
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,740
Then why did you drink so much?

233
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,870
Why did you act

234
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,910
all buddy-buddy with a stranger

235
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,360
who came out of nowhere?

236
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,550
So

237
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,200
I want some good tea

238
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,240
to sober up.

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,260
You sly fox.

240
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,330
Just a minute.

241
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,650
I'm just that petty.

242
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,510
In the jianghu,

243
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,390
kindred spirits are rare to meet,

244
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,250
and true friends are hard to find.

245
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,170
You two...

246
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,130
Feng, you're mistaken.

247
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,670
He's not my friend,

248
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,910
but my servant.

249
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,940
Servant?

250
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,840
This is his contract of servitude.

251
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,760
Mr. Feng,

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm merely a lowly servant.

253
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,460
How could I possibly deserve
to befriend Foxy Tang?

254
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,320
Drink it.

255
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,630
This is the private joke

256
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,160
between Cloud and Mr. Tang.

257
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,950
I shall not comment on it.

258
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,310
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

259
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,070
Thank you,

260
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,510
Cloud.

261
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,100
This is yours.

262
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
Sorry for that, Feng.

263
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,630
Miss Shei,

264
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,230
you've fitted in quite well.

265
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,910
These are just some chores
within my ability.

266
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,290
Now that things have settled down,

267
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,290
we should sit down

268
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,320
and have a good, hearty meal.

269
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,720
You're right.

270
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
That's what we should do.

271
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,910
Then let me help out, too.

272
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,650
Miss Zhong.

273
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,580
Your nose.

274
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,780
Let me help you.

275
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,680
There, done.

276
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,380
Thank you, Miss Shei.

277
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,490
I'd better not get in the way.

278
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,550
It's fine.

279
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,670
Miss Zhong, I'm already so happy

280
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,320
that you're willing to stay here with me.

281
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,410
Your hands

282
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,150
are meant to fight evil.

283
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,270
Just let me do these things.

284
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,760
In just a few days,

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,660
so many things have happened.

286
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,960
You, a lone orphan girl,
have wandered so far.

287
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,020
You must've suffered a lot.

288
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,720
I used to travel with my father,
busking for a living.

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,080
We've endured countless hardships.

290
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,200
Now I can

291
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,670
stay in such a safe place

292
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,510
with warm clothes and abundant food.

293
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm already very fortunate.

294
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,620
Besides,

295
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,990
I can experience things

296
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,910
that I've never

297
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,910
seen before.

298
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,570
Yes.

299
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,370
I once thought

300
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,390
my trip down the mountain

301
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,300
representing
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

302
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,210
would be easy.

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,620
It turned out that I was too naive.

304
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,740
Speaking of which,

305
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,170
I'm grateful to have met all of you.

306
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,740
Thanks to you guys,

307
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,500
all these tangled clues

308
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,240
have gradually come to light.

309
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,470
And Master Tang.

310
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,260
Although his way
of doing things is quite wild,

311
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,320
it often yields remarkable results.

312
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,560
It's truly admirable.

313
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,330
Indeed.

314
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,380
Mr. Tang

315
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,080
is a very special person.

316
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
If you asked me a few days ago,

317
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,590
I couldn't imagine

318
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,000
that instead of being trapped

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
in seclusion in the Hao Residence forever,

320
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,960
I'd be with a crew of wandering heroes,

321
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
going on adventures in the jianghu.

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,670
Miss Zhong,

323
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,320
I owe all this to you

324
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,120
for saving me.

325
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,070
Don't mention it.

326
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,910
Actually,

327
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,390
I've seen

328
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,630
a lot in the Jianghu.

329
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,270
But I've never had

330
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,400
such a special experience as this one.

331
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,730
It's thrilling

332
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,140
with twists and turns.

333
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,200
I hope to uncover the truth soon

334
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,630
and return to the Sword Alliance
with credits,

335
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,700
living up to my master's expectations.

336
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,550
Yet I also wish

337
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,480
to delay our parting.

338
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,240
Feng, you just mentioned

339
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,940
a beautiful scenic spot

340
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,750
where you and Jiang Cheng

341
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,760
live in seclusion. Where is it?

342
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,750
At the end of Huaxi Stream,

343
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,810
beside Feng Cliff,

344
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,310
it's the Liulian Cottage.

345
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
After we fulfill

346
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,540
our seven-day agreement with Master Jiang,

347
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,970
you can feel free to visit

348
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,480
my humble abode anytime

349
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,540
with your friends.

350
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,760
Liulian Cottage.

351
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,240
Feng,

352
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,300
I have never seen

353
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
the morning view of Yan River.

354
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,640
Would you like

355
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,000
to accompany me to the bow for a look?

356
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,210
With pleasure.

357
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,260
The warm and gentle morning light.

358
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,870
What an amazing view.

359
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,580
Such a beautiful scene

360
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,530
is perfect...

361
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,300
It's perfect to wake people up.

362
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,310
Mr. Tang, what are you doing?

363
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,820
Breaking my promise.

364
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,550
Foxy Tang,

365
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,420
what's happening?

366
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,360
Mr. Feng,

367
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,230
I've heard your story.

368
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm somewhat interested,

369
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,630
but not much.

370
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,060
It's not worth the effort
I have to put in.

371
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,750
I thought

372
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,540
you were someone

373
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,950
who cared about friends, Mr. Tang.

374
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,290
I have no friends,

375
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,040
so how would I care about them?

376
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,550
Mr. Feng,

377
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,890
you got me wrong.

378
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,790
But Mr. Tang...

379
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,790
No buts.

380
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,960
He already told you

381
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
he has no friends.

382
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,310
You want to be friends

383
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,140
with this heartless fox?

384
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,510
You'll be eaten down to the bones

385
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,110
and die without knowing why!

386
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,710
Mr. Tang!

387
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,310
Just say whatever you want.

388
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,040
What was that just now?

389
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,510
Weren't you two
getting along well last night?

390
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,440
Why did things suddenly turn sour?

391
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,240
That day, Jiang Cheng told me

392
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,640
that the first person

393
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,700
who made him take the Blood Ghost Pill

394
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,560
was Feng Chuanxiang.

395
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,280
No way!

396
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,770
Weren't they sworn brothers?

397
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,400
Chi Yun,

398
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,520
you've always hated evil guys.

399
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,320
I was afraid you couldn't hold back.

400
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,340
Yeah, I can't stand someone

401
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,740
who betrayed his friend.

402
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm going after him to check it out.

403
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,100
If he really poisoned Jiang Cheng,

404
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
I'll kill him right away!

405
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,140
Where is Chi Yun going?

406
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,110
Miss Shei,

407
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,200
I need to follow him and take a look.

408
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,230
I believe

409
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,260
we have a common enemy.

410
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,690
What do you want to ask?

411
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,130
Sir, if you wanted Chi

412
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,240
to follow Mr. Feng,

413
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,640
why didn't you say it directly?

414
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,270
Being instructed by others
and taking initiative on one's own

415
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,230
might seem the same to others.

416
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,030
But for Chi Yun,

417
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,490
there's a big difference.

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Most of the time,

419
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,340
I prefer to let him maintain

420
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,690
a pleasant mood.

421
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,780
I thought

422
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
you would ask another question.

423
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,290
What?

424
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,780
The hand.

425
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,210
Yesterday,

426
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,550
you saw me get injured

427
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,420
and saw the wound heal with your own eyes.

428
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,490
Aren't you curious?

429
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,820
I just think

430
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,680
that maybe

431
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,550
everyone has

432
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,680
secrets they want to keep from others.

433
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,570
You're very clever, miss,

434
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,030
but unfortunately,

435
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,640
you've overlooked

436
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,190
a very important fact.

437
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
Chi Yun and Ms. Zhong

438
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,980
have both left the ship to track someone.

439
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,990
Now, there are

440
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,770
only you and me left on this ship.

441
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,090
Miss Shei,

442
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,920
didn't the person

443
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,320
who sent you ever tell you

444
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,110
how dangerous Tang Lici is?

445
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,440
Miss Shei,

446
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,030
you are

447
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,930
the only survivor from the Hao Residence,

448
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,670
as well as the witness chosen by Liu Yan.

449
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,190
Tell me

450
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,930
why my friend Liu Yan

451
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,670
chose you?

452
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,400
I don't know,

453
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,350
Mr. Tang.

454
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,210
I was being rude.

456
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,920
Mr. Tang,

457
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,880
your apology

458
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,270
isn't sincere at all.

459
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,310
Because you don't care

460
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,910
whether I forgive you or not.

461
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,090
To get the truth you want,

462
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,110
you even

463
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,440
tested me in the most brutal way

464
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,410
without a care

465
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,700
for others' feelings.

466
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,160
Yet someone like you

467
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,720
is willing to meddle

468
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
in the affairs of Mr. Feng and Mr. Jiang.

469
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,770
Could you tell me

470
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,190
why?

471
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,660
Liu Yan did leave you by my side

472
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,110
for some reason.

473
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,340
What?

474
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,010
Come with me.

475
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,200
Where is he?

476
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,050
He should be around here.

477
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,880
Mr. Feng!

478
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,980
Mr. Jiang.

479
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,240
Mr. Feng,

480
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,140
how did you fall into the water?

481
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,580
Come on,

482
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
sit down quickly.

483
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,490
Here you are.

484
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,200
Put this on.

485
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Jiang Qingyu?

486
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,960
Why is he here?

487
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,630
Mr. Feng,

488
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,620
how did you end up in the water?

489
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,010
Also,

490
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,930
where's Mr. Tang?

491
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
Mr. Tang suddenly turned against me

492
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,090
and backed out of our cooperation.

493
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,550
So

494
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,020
he used you and then abandoned you?

495
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,980
Mr. Jiang,

496
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,130
what brings you here?

497
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm here

498
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,790
for Cheng's case.

499
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,340
Given what you said yesterday,

500
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,160
there's more behind Cheng's taking

501
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,070
that evil pill?

502
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,970
That's right.

503
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,930
I suspect

504
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,660
that he was poisoned.

505
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,010
What?

506
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Darn it.

507
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,700
How despicable!

508
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,090
What do you plan to do next, Mr. Feng?

509
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,650
Jiang Cheng was my best friend.

510
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,170
I will definitely

511
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,150
bring the poisoner to justice

512
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,420
and make him pay with his life.

513
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Cheng was fortunate to have a friend

514
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
like you, Mr. Feng.

515
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,440
Would you allow me to come along

516
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
with you?

517
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,650
Our Yanmen Sect

518
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,110
has some connections

519
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,850
in both legal and underworld communities.

520
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,050
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

521
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,120
That would be perfect.

522
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,580
Let's go then.

523
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,730
We should hurry and find a place

524
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,310
to dry your clothes first.

525
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:22,800
Let's go.

526
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay.

527
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,350
Forget about whether Feng Chuanxiang

528
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,610
is suspicious for now.

529
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,310
Why is Mr. Jiang Qingyu
even more dedicated to it

530
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,840
than Jiang Cheng's father?

531
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,410
Something's off.

532
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
I need to look into it.

533
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,660
What are you doing? Are you going bonkers?

534
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,650
Keep up.

535
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,370
Where are we?

536
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,490
Huaxi.

537
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,720
The place where Young Mr. Jiang

538
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,270
and Mr. Feng once lived.

539
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,640
Mr. Tang,

540
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,200
didn't you say

541
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,730
you wouldn't help Mr. Feng?

542
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,440
Or are you planning

543
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,280
to split up with Chi Yun

544
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,480
and investigate the case

545
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
about Young Master Jiang together?

546
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,270
You were right about the beginning,

547
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,800
but wrong about the ending.

548
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,270
I did break

549
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,000
my promise to Feng Chuanxiang.

550
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,750
However,

551
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,140
I came here

552
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,310
because Shisan Tower

553
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,640
revealed the clues leading to this place.

554
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
[Jin Hua Yin]

555
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,270
Sorry for the delay.

556
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,720
Sirs,

557
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,610
here's your tea.

558
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Since we know

559
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,220
he's the poisoner,

560
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,700
why don't we arrest him?

561
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I am impatient,

562
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,710
but I'm not a fool.

563
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,460
My keen instincts

564
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,170
tell me

565
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,510
that something fishy is going on here.

566
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,680
Mr. Feng,

567
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,680
my big brother is hot-tempered.

568
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,440
If he finds out

569
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,590
that you let Tang Lici escape...

570
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,000
Sir!

571
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,550
He might

572
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,550
do crazy things.

573
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,720
Alright!

574
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,100
Mr. Jiang, have you figured out

575
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,900
a better plan?

576
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,320
Shisan Tower? What kind of place is that?

577
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,970
A place
where you can find answers to everything.

578
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,790
Shisan Tower has the world's

579
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,320
most formidable assassins

580
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,160
and the most comprehensive intelligence
in the jianghu.

581
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,960
But you need to afford the price.

582
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Then where is this tower?

583
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,440
Shisan Tower's location is so mysterious

584
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,170
that few in the jianghu know it.

585
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,720
But if you wish to make a deal with them,

586
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,450
you should go to their outpost,

587
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,270
Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

588
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,300
[Floating Abyss]

589
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,410
If you still want to keep
these eyes of yours,

590
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,030
I suggest you stop looking
where you shouldn't.

591
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,230
I've heard that the Fallen Shisan Tower

592
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,530
has the most skilled assassins
in the world

593
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,270
and the most comprehensive information.

594
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,830
So this must be

595
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,490
the Floating Abyss of Buhuan Tower.

596
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,920
Then where is the Fallen Shisan Tower?

597
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Ms. Zhong,

598
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
do you know why

599
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,850
it's called the Floating Abyss
of Buhuan Tower?

600
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,310
That's because this place

601
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,850
really floats.

602
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,620
What does that mean?

603
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,590
On the fifteenth of every month,

604
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,050
which happens to be today,

605
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,890
which happens to be right now.

606
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,380
[Floating Abyss, Buhuan Tower]

607
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,410
It will rise from this part of the river.

608
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,030
That's when

609
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,690
you can go up this Buhuan Tower

610
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,220
to make a deal
with the Fallen Shisan Tower.

611
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,930
As for seeing

612
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,220
the real Shisan Tower,

613
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,010
your qualifications

614
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,100
are not enough yet.

615
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,780
Come on,

616
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,980
why must I lie in a coffin?

617
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,910
I don't understand.

618
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,390
If that's the case,

619
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,270
Mr. Tang,

620
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,060
why don't you go directly to Shisan Tower

621
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,960
to buy the truth about Young Master Jiang

622
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
and Mr. Feng?

623
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,870
Liu Yan arranged all these incidents

624
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,210
just to make me, while being pushed

625
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,070
by the Yanmen Sect relentlessly,

626
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,030
have no choice

627
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,600
but to go to Shisan Tower again
to buy information

628
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,930
and prove my innocence.

629
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,460
But I surrendered willingly.

630
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,860
This disrupted his plan.

631
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,940
So

632
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,170
he sent Feng Chuanxiang.

633
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,270
As long as I don't play along

634
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,550
with his plan,

635
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,890
he just can't win this round.

636
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,510
So that's why you

637
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,240
kicked Mr. Feng into the water.

638
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
But why would Mr. Feng

639
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,480
take orders from Liu Yan?

640
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,440
That's

641
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,970
the purpose of our journey.

642
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,890
The affairs in the jianghu

643
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,510
are truly bewildering

644
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,480
and creepy.

645
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,280
Sorry for the interruption.

646
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,080
When entering someone's home,

647
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,460
it's only polite to announce yourself.

648
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,220
[The flowers and the moon
decorate the river with breezes]

649
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,610
In your opinion,

650
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,110
between Jiang Cheng and Feng Chuanxiang,

651
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,940
which one was telling the truth?

652
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Jiang Cheng said

653
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,480
Feng Chuanxiang poisoned him.

654
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,240
A person might lie

655
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,310
at any time,

656
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,080
but they would never lie at death's door,

657
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,600
especially about their unfulfilled wishes.

658
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,360
Mr. Tang...

659
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,310
Therefore,

660
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,500
Jiang Cheng's words must be true.

661
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,920
As for Feng Chuanxiang,

662
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,030
he can lie,

663
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,240
and he can hide

664
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,350
hatred and murderous intent

665
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,110
in a clever way

666
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,240
to go undetected.

667
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,020
But a place where someone has lived

668
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
for a long time

669
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,110
will leave traces,
and those traces tell the truth.

670
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,850
Especially when it comes to friendship.

671
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,660
Even if one can fake it for a day

672
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,070
or for ten days,

673
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,140
how could he possibly pretend

674
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
every single day?

675
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,000
The flowers and the moon decorate
the river (Jiang) with breezes (Feng).

676
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,810
They both

677
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,590
told the truth.

678
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,650
But what kind of misunderstanding

679
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,260
could make such good friends

680
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,400
unable to talk it over face-to-face?

681
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,110
Since they both

682
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,970
told the truth,

683
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,140
there must be a misunderstanding

684
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,750
they couldn't talk about,

685
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,090
nor was there a chance to explain.

686
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,970
When suppressing the poison
for Jiang Cheng,

687
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,820
I found that the toxins
had accumulated in his body

688
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,120
for possibly more than a year.

689
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,760
Therefore, over six months ago,

690
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,290
when Jiang Cheng came
to see Feng Chuanxiang,

691
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,510
he was already poisoned

692
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,970
with the Blood Ghost Pill.

693
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,920
But he himself

694
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,720
was completely unaware of this.

695
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,120
In order to help

696
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,780
delay the poison's outbreak,

697
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,810
Feng Chuanxiang

698
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,250
had to make him
keep taking the evil pills

699
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,850
by mixing them into his food in secret.

700
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,190
Unfortunately,

701
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,870
Jiang Cheng happened to witness this.

702
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,030
So

703
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,080
a misunderstanding arose.

704
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,510
I was already wondering

705
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,960
why Shisan Tower sent clues

706
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,570
about Liulian Cottage's murder

707
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,300
after the Hao family massacre.

708
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,140
Now I'm even more convinced

709
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,530
that from the very beginning,

710
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,590
not a single thing was coincidental.

711
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,310
But

712
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,200
you already knew

713
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,670
that everything they said was true.

714
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,310
You also knew
that your getting involved in this

715
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,770
was part of Liu Yan's plan.

716
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,510
Why

717
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,840
did you still come here?

718
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,410
All of this is merely

719
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,370
my speculation.

720
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,950
As for whether it's true or not,

721
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,350
and whether to join the game
or overturn it,

722
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,390
I'll find out once I investigate.

723
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,850
Tang Lici,

724
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,010
you're doing very well.

725
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,890
Tonight's guests of Buhuan Tower

726
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,290
have all arrived, right?

727
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,890
You know what to do.

728
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,670
Trade for hands!

729
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,540
Sell one of your hands

730
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,680
for whatever information you want.

731
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,740
What is this place?

732
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,640
Why is there a market here?

733
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,070
This is

734
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,990
the black market
in Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

735
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,600
If ordinary people want help
from Shisan Tower,

736
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
they must first come to the Floating Abyss

737
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,130
and find the Porter.

738
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,200
But not everyone is qualified

739
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,270
to meet the Porter.

740
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Over time,

741
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,970
a black market has formed here.

742
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,400
Those who aren't qualified

743
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
to meet the Porter

744
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,640
can still

745
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,990
buy what they want here.

746
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,780
It's way too crowded here.

747
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,210
And they're all wearing
the same black cloaks.

748
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,410
Chi Yun, walk faster.

749
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,530
Don't lose them.

750
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,070
Oh, no, they really disappeared.

751
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,690
Calm down.

752
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,990
When the time comes,

753
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,310
we'll meet them

754
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,240
near the Porter.

755
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,270
Wait,

756
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,050
didn't you just say

757
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,830
not everyone is qualified

758
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,890
to meet the Porter?

759
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,400
Feng Chuanxiang had been missing
for so long.

760
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,590
Is it weird that Shisan Tower is

761
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,570
interested in him?

762
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,370
What about us?

763
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,720
Why would the Porter

764
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
choose us as well?

765
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,090
At this point,

766
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,490
I might as well tell you.

767
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,060
What?

768
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,410
Fiancée?

769
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,480
I am the handsome and charming Cloud.

770
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,660
Is it weird that a woman likes me?

771
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,790
Then may I ask who

772
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,920
your fiancée is?

773
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,870
Bai Suche.

774
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,570
Bai Suche?

775
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,920
You mean the one
known as the most beautiful woman

776
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
in Jiangnan, the elegant Bai Suche?

777
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,370
What's with that look?

778
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,989
Nothing.

779
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,060
Your expression clearly says,

780
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,840
"How would that elegant beauty

781
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,440
marry someone like you?"

782
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,969
Exactly!

783
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,679
How would she ever agree to marry you?

784
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,110
A few years ago, I

785
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,550
went to Jiangnan, performing heroic deeds

786
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,350
and saving Bai Yuming's family.

787
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,179
He liked me so much

788
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,909
that he insisted on marrying off
his daughter to me.

789
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,130
What's wrong with this?

790
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,520
Wait.

791
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,969
Are you saying

792
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,080
that Master Bai

793
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,820
insisted on betrothing his daughter
to you?

794
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,520
Instead of me desperately asking

795
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,449
to marry into their family, right?

796
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,239
That's not what I meant.

797
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,520
I just think

798
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,360
that since Master Bai is a descendant
of the Calligraphy Saint,

799
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,110
if you're

800
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,920
Master Bai's son-in-law,

801
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,190
you should at least share his interests.

802
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,280
But I'm just

803
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,679
an underworld gangster.

804
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,429
So what?

805
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,699
Yeah,

806
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,870
you're right.

807
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,550
You, Cloud, are the hope
of the underworld.

808
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,810
Just eat your cake.

809
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,430
The Bai's Estate

810
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,530
suffered a massacre a year ago, right?

811
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,280
Indeed, they were massacred.

812
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,150
But no one's found

813
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,420
my fiancée's body in the estate.

814
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,720
I've always believed

815
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,770
that she's still alive somewhere.

816
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,050
But

817
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,330
that doesn't make sense.

818
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,460
After all you've said,

819
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,580
you still haven't explained why

820
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,540
we'll definitely be chosen by the Porter.

821
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,040
Because I came to look for my fiancée,

822
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,810
who hadn't

823
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,700
married me yet,

824
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,700
and bought information from Shisan Tower.

825
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,670
Who knew this Shisan Tower

826
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,800
was all about scams?

827
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,390
They saw how desperate I was
to find my wife

828
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,880
and demanded

829
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,340
a price I couldn't afford.

830
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,630
In the end, I didn't find my wife

831
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,760
and even got myself sold
to the Shisan Tower.

832
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,150
If that damn Foxy Tang hadn't

833
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,210
happened to pass by

834
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,970
with a contract claiming ownership of me,

835
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,490
saying that I was already sold to him

836
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,030
and couldn't be sold
to Shisan Tower again.

837
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,370
Between getting sold
to the Fallen Shisan Tower

838
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,490
or to Foxy Tang,

839
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,920
it was quite obvious

840
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,380
which one I'd pick, right?

841
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,760
When the Porter sees me

842
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,690
back here again,

843
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,440
he definitely won't let me go.

844
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,050
Mr. Tang,

845
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,540
the road ends here.

846
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,710
We've searched everywhere possible.

847
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
If we've already searched

848
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,870
all possible places,

849
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,330
then it must be right here.

850
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,930
Shei,

851
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,360
are there really

852
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,590
friends in this world

853
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
you can trust with your life?

854
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,090
You go to Yanmen
with the messenger goose first.

855
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,860
I will

856
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,790
go there for a thorough investigation.

857
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Mr. Tang!

858
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,110
[Floating Red Worm Silk]

859
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,450
Please feel free to take a look.

860
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,520
It's just one year of your lifespan.

861
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,120
What are you hesitating for?

862
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,450
The porter carries weight on both ends.

863
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,280
One end succeeds, one end fails.

864
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,050
Welcome, everyone, to Buhuan Tower.

865
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,970
May I ask which guest

866
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,600
will make the first bid?

867
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,710
Me.

868
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,550
What is your offer?

869
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,730
A pair of sorrowful eyes.

870
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,670
Three fingers filled with hatred.

871
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,720
Five drops of blood from my heart.

872
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,120
Ten years of freedom.

873
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,850
What are you trying to exchange for?

874
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,750
The real culprit.

875
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,590
Carrying pole,

876
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,210
what do you think?

877
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,600
Sir.

878
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,580
Your chips aren't enough, I'm afraid.

879
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,460
Unless...

880
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,030
Unless what?

881
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,520
Unless you exchange your life for it!

882
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,010
Mr. Jiang, what are you doing?

883
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,790
I'm trying to kill you.

884
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,440
You're the one

885
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,100
bringing it upon yourself.

886
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,850
According to my plan,

887
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,090
after Cheng died
and the murderer confessed,

888
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,800
my brother's furious actions

889
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,660
would offend
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

890
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,000
And then I would rightfully

891
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,490
become the master of the Yanmen Sect.

892
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,230
This wonderful

893
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,960
dream-come-true moment

894
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,250
was ruined

895
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,810
by your sudden appearance.

896
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,790
I paid a hefty price

897
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,360
to Shisan Tower's Master

898
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,960
for a chance to kill you.

899
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,110
Here and now,

900
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,510
no one will

901
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,800
step in and help you.

902
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,970
Today,

903
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,770
you're doomed to die.

904
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,240
Mr. Tang,

905
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,650
I want to find Chuanxiang

906
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,480
and ask him

907
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,690
why he wanted to kill me.

908
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,920
We used to be best friends
who would die for each other.

909
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,720
Why are we turning on each other?

910
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,960
If someone kills people because of me,

911
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,110
if innocents suffer because of me,

912
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,280
does that make it my karma?

913
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,450
Tang Lici, do you see now?

914
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,550
Such a tiny pill

915
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,480
can turn the best friends

916
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,640
into bitter enemies

917
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,440
and make family members
betray and kill each other.

918
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,480
Who can resist the temptation

919
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,960
of overnight wealth, glory,

920
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,880
and unparalleled martial arts?

921
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,030
I have already spread it

922
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,800
throughout the martial arts world.

923
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,280
It has returned to this world

924
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,550
all because of you,

925
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,070
Tang Lici.

926
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:16,960
This time,

927
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
I'll make you wish you were dead.

928
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,110
Let your friends be your warning.

929
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,170
It's their fault
for trusting the wrong person.

930
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:30,730
You

931
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,070
can't save them.

932
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,670
Liu Yan's curse bug?

933
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,980
I can't save them?

934
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:41,820
But Liu Yan,

935
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,810
I'm looking for you.

936
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,750
Yanmen.
