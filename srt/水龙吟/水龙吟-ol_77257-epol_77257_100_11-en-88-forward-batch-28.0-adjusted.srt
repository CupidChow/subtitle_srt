[Episode 11]

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,950
I admire your ambition.

4
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,630
That is why tomorrow,

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,050
you will kill for me.

6
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,039
Master,

7
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,160
who do you want me to kill?

8
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,970
Everyone.

9
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,100
Wuhu Fortress.

10
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,310
Renwu Sect.

11
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
Golden Leopard Gang?

12
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,160
Miss Shei,

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,790
why don't you take a rest first?

14
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,510
You may go now.

15
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,960
Let's go.

16
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh no!

17
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,500
The ledger!

18
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
Miss Shei, be careful!

19
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,150
Sister!

20
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,410
Be careful!

21
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,330
Pull her back!

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,200
Watch out!

23
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,590
Fire! Help!

24
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,290
Who are you?

25
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
Bafeng Flame Scripture?

26
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,700
Don't run!

27
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,360
Want to leave?

28
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,720
Did you ask me first?

29
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,310
Miss Shei!

30
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,630
Step back.Grab your sister!

31
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,400
Be careful, Sister!

32
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,829
Help!

33
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,630
Fire!

34
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,630
Help!

35
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,630
Mr. Sen!

36
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,560
Sen!

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,530
Hurry up!

38
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,680
Fire!

39
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,540
There's a fire!

40
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,270
Hurry!

41
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,070
Help!

42
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,600
Over there!

43
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,670
Hurry!

44
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,430
You demon from Fengliu Shop,

45
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,310
put Shei down!

46
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,180
As expected of Cloud.

47
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,430
It's a pity that...

48
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,070
Bai Suche?

49
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,550
Stop chasing!

50
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Unless you can get past me first.

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,930
You're not Yu Qifeng's concubine.

52
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,580
You're from Fengliu Shop!

53
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,920
So what?

54
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,270
How could you do this?

55
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,720
Was the Bai family's massacre a year ago

56
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,520
orchestrated

57
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,600
by Fengliu Shop?

58
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,880
Are you alright?

59
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,780
I...

60
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,470
You knew I was your enemy,

61
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,840
yet you still held back.

62
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,750
The fact that you're still alive

63
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,870
is pure luck.

64
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,790
As long as you step aside,

65
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll pretend

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
this never happened.

67
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,430
Besides,

68
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
I just don't want to lose my wife

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
at such a young age.

70
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,820
Who said I'm your wife?

71
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
Mr. Chi,

72
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,600
look carefully.

73
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,950
Bai Suche,
the "Moonlight Garment" back then,

74
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,800
is already dead.

75
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,750
The person standing before you

76
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,550
is just the Master's attendant.

77
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
For the sake of the time

78
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,880
you saved my father,

79
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
this is my final warning to you.

80
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
If you dare stand in Fengliu Shop's way,

81
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll make sure

82
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,409
you die without a burial place.

83
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,240
You know better than I do

84
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,700
what kind of man Liu Yan is.

85
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,830
Did you join Fengliu Shop

86
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,830
to seek revenge?

87
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,870
Who are you

88
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,040
to speak the Master's name?

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,550
In the battle of Sword King City,

90
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,260
Tang Lici is doomed to die.

91
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,760
What did you say?

92
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,250
If you want to live,

93
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,310
get lost now.

94
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,700
Otherwise, you'll be the next

95
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,680
to die.

96
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Bai Suche!

97
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,190
Why did you leave before finishing

98
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,390
what you were saying?

99
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,550
What scheme is Liu Yan plotting?

100
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,950
Tell me, Bai Suche!

101
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,510
Bai Suche!

102
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,830
Bai Suche!

103
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
No wonder I searched for her for so long

104
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
with no trace.

105
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,120
So she's been hiding
in Fengliu Shop all along.

106
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,150
Foxy Tang, you're so clever.

107
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,150
Help me analyzeâ€”

108
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
why did she join

109
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,280
Fengliu Shop?

110
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
And there's Shei.

111
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,750
What exactly are those demons

112
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,350
in Fengliu Shop up to anyway?

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,320
How was it?

114
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,320
Did you find her?

115
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,580
There's only one place

116
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,250
where Shei could be hidden.

117
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,750
After fighting with Chi Yun, Bai Suche

118
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,880
never returned to Sword King Mansion.

119
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,700
It seems, just as she said,

120
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,050
Yu Qifeng is planning something big.

121
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
You go over there.

122
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,600
Okay.

123
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,390
There's no one in the guest quarters.

124
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,390
Could it be that those sect leaders,

125
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,840
knowing they were exposed yesterday,

126
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,370
fled with their disciples?

127
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,750
How are we going to investigate then?

128
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,150
Perhaps that's the case.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,510
Wait.

130
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,870
Yu Qifeng wouldn't

131
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,730
let them leave at a time like this.

132
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,120
Could they have been...

133
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Zhong, don't panic.

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
Perhaps
there's still someone in this house.

135
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,850
Let's keep looking.

136
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,310
Now Shei was taken away,

137
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,040
the ledger was burned,

138
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,080
and Bai Suche said

139
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880
you would die in Sword King City.

140
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,540
Fengliu Shop
must be planning something big.

141
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,150
Foxy Tang,

142
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,350
what should we do now?

143
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,860
Say something.

144
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,780
You want to go rescue Shei?

145
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,720
No matter what he's planning,

146
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,520
both of us have been waiting

147
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,940
for this moment

148
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
since Jinye Temple.

149
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,000
Going alone

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is too dangerous.

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's go together.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,660
I'll go too.

153
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,810
I'm also responsible for this.

154
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,790
No need.

155
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,310
This is between him and me.

156
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,370
I don't want anyone to interfere.

157
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,870
You two

158
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,380
have something else to attend to.

159
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,930
What do we need to do?

160
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,990
Last night at the Qiongtai Banquet,

161
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,150
Liu Yan took advantage of me
being off guard

162
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,680
to attack Wanqiao Chamber.

163
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,790
He let Shen go

164
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,550
just to

165
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,950
reveal his hiding place.

166
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
Yu Qifeng is now in a dead end.

167
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,580
He hates me to the bone.

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,310
To defeat me,

169
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,270
he will certainly use any means necessary.

170
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,360
And Liu Yan

171
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,030
will definitely do something for him.

172
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,160
I'll leave Yu Qifeng

173
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,260
to you two.

174
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,490
Leave him to me.

175
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,000
I absolutely won't

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,590
let that old bastard Yu Qifeng

177
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,650
cause any trouble.

178
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
This is the last room.

179
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,610
Where is everyone?

180
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,790
Oh no.

181
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,830
Yu Qifeng will definitely
kill them to silence them.

182
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,890
Let's follow them.

183
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,790
Stop!

184
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:29,960
Zhong,

185
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,740
watch out!

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,120
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,580
are you alright?

188
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,170
Commander Yu,

189
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,050
don't put on a fake act.

190
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,360
You just intervened

191
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,670
to help them escape, didn't you?

192
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,400
How dare you!

193
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,940
Who were those people just now?

194
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,630
Everyone,

195
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
we discovered that

196
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,720
the disciples from various sects
in the west wing

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,670
were all taken away,

198
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,930
so we chased them here.

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,550
Suddenly losing track of them

200
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,120
naturally put us in a bad mood.

201
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,980
Please forgive us, Commander Yu.

202
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,740
Ms. Zhong,

203
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,000
from what you just said,

204
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,670
do you think those villains are connected

205
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,860
to Sword King City?

206
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,650
Whether they are or not,

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
we'll know soon.

208
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,870
Mr. Yu,

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,030
those villains couldn't have gone far.

210
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,320
Let's investigate ahead together.

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
We might find something.

212
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Very well.

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,720
The city's security

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,250
is also my responsibility.

215
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,450
Sword King,

216
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,550
the Blood Ghost Pill

217
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,120
has been discovered by Tang Lici.

218
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,580
And Puzhu probably has...

219
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,870
Sword King City

220
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,390
might not be safe for us anymore.

221
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes.

222
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,920
This is the Master's reward

223
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,420
for everyoneâ€”

224
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,240
the newly made divine pills,

225
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,640
even better than before.

226
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,120
Today,

227
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,800
let's have the divine pills together.

228
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,170
Here.

229
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,240
Here.

230
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,150
Here.

231
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,060
Is this the power of the divine pill?

232
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,080
My strength

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,540
keeps flowing endlessly.

234
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,550
My strength keeps flowing endlessly too.

235
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,150
Mine too.

236
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,080
Sword King,

237
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
the Blood Ghost Pill

238
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
has already been intercepted by Tang Lici.

239
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,050
Puzhu will eventually report this

240
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,720
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

241
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
So what?

242
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,240
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

243
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,300
has long been wary of Sword King City.

244
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,790
I've had enough

245
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,520
of those incompetent cowards.

246
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,960
And Fengliu Shop is now
at the height of its power.

247
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,480
If we

248
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,880
can eliminate Tang Lici,

249
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,750
we'll be doing Fengliu Shop a great favor.

250
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,440
One day when power shifts in jianghu

251
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,960
and Fengliu Shop
replaces the Sword Alliance,

252
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,550
I won't be

253
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,480
the only Sword King.

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,150
You,

255
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,880
you'll be Sword King Shi.

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
You'll be Sword King Li.

257
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Each one of you

258
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,210
will be a Sword King!

259
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,410
-Sword King Zhao!
Sword King!

260
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,370
Sword King Zhou.

261
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,810
Sword King, since you said so,

262
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,750
I'm willing to give my life

263
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
to serve you!

264
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,480
We are willing to serve you!

265
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,390
We're willing

266
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,630
to die for you

267
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,960
without hesitation!

268
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,320
What's going on?

269
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,200
Let's go take a closer look.

270
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,030
Sword King,

271
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,150
what are you doing?

272
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm not breaking my promise to you.

273
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,610
I'm letting you all become a part of me.

274
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,200
After today,

275
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,940
you'll all be Sword Kings!

276
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
It serves you right.

277
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,840
More!

278
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
More!

279
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,240
More! More!

280
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,840
Not enough!

281
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,790
Not enough!

282
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,589
Pale,

283
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
fragile,

284
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,550
and such beautiful legs.

285
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:45,680
With a slight twist, they'd snap.

286
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,430
Aren't you scared?

287
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,589
Of course I am.

288
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,650
Then why aren't you screaming,

289
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,720
hoping Mr. Tang will come save you?

290
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Help!

291
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
Help!

292
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,880
Save me!

293
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Shouldn't that be what you do?

294
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,560
Mr. Tang

295
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,060
won't come.

296
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,070
He won't?

297
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,350
Mr. Tang cares deeply for you,

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,860
with such passionate affection.

299
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,070
How would he not come?

300
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,790
He...

301
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,400
won't come for me.

302
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,550
Even if he comes,

303
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,230
it'll be for Liu Yan,

304
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,270
not to save me.

305
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,310
Well,

306
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,210
does that mean I can kill you

307
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,970
right now?

308
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,950
Master said

309
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,110
someone like Tang Lici

310
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,110
would never

311
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,550
keep unimportant people

312
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,750
by his side every day.

313
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,880
I guess...

314
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,590
he must be deeply in love with you.

315
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,260
You just don't dare to believe it.

316
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,200
Whether you believe it or not,

317
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,720
to Mr. Tang.

318
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,000
I am insignificant.

319
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,670
Whether you're important or not,

320
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,200
we'll see.

321
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,810
I like your legs.

322
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,480
Why don't you...

323
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
give them to me?

324
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,750
Shei.

325
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,430
Shei!

326
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,790
Miss, you are so beautifulâ€”

327
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
why do you need someone else's legs?

328
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Mr. Tang, you care for this beauty

329
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,400
and are so devoted

330
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,750
that you came to save her.

331
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
You should be glad

332
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,680
you didn't truly act just now.

333
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,750
So you do care about that lady.

334
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Do I?

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,520
You're wrong.

336
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,720
She means...

337
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
nothing to me.

338
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,010
You say one thing but mean another.

339
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,270
Then listen

340
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,880
to the piece

341
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I prepared especially for you.

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,490
The Six Paths of Descent...

343
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,530
and Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance!

344
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,310
Combined

345
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,040
with my Mist Flower Pollen,

346
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,920
this move will trap a person

347
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,580
in their deepest inner demon.

348
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,690
If one stays in it for too long,

349
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,140
they will sink into the depths
of their obsession

350
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,830
and never be able to wake up.

351
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,200
Tang Lici,

352
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,110
what is your inner demon?

353
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,710
What is the sin you're hiding?

354
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,310
What is your sin?

355
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,490
The great cause remains unfinished.

356
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,210
How dare you sleep?

357
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,480
Tang Lici,

358
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,400
you were born

359
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,400
to kill.

360
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,290
This is your purpose.

361
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,770
Why did you kill us?

362
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Why?

363
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,110
Why?

364
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
Their sacrifice

365
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,830
was to make you perfect.

366
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,790
And your perfection

367
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,590
is meant to allow more people

368
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,920
to survive.

369
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,790
This is your destiny.

370
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,590
You all defied destiny.

371
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,590
You're nothing but a monster!

372
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,920
Who are you to abandon us?

373
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,920
No! I don't want this!

374
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,110
If I really am him,

375
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
will they fear me?

376
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,890
I can't drag them down with me.

377
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,410
Come take a look!

378
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
Oiled paper umbrellas! Take a look!

379
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,360
Oiled paper umbrellas!

380
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,880
Lici!

381
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,960
Lici, stop.

382
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,280
Seven years have passed,

383
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,040
and you still want to leave?

384
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,810
I don't belong here.

385
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm different from you guys.

386
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,680
Enough.

387
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,170
Don't be trapped by your past.

388
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,160
A place you have forgotten
is not your home.

389
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,490
We all see you as family.

390
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,160
Come back to Zhoudi Tower with me

391
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,820
and continue your life there.

392
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,070
Jile Sect?

393
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,790
They are Yique Yinyang's subordinates,

394
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,990
a group that knows nothing but killing.

395
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,510
See?

396
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,680
Everyone fears people

397
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,880
-who know nothing but killing.
-Lici!

398
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,740
Hide behind me!

399
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,890
Take a good look.

400
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,350
How are you any different from them?

401
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,480
If they ever find out

402
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,610
you're the same kind of person as them,

403
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,960
they will surely fear you,

404
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,070
stay away from you,

405
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,200
and even...

406
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,200
kill you.

407
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,070
Fang Zhou,

408
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,790
the wound Chief left on your heart crystal

409
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,310
is acting up, isn't it?

410
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,130
No one will come to save you.

411
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
If my death

412
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,440
can save everyone,

413
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,790
then why not?

414
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,920
One life...

415
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,790
for all lives?

416
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,130
I did lie to you,

417
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,200
but if your sacrifice

418
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,880
can make everyone survive,

419
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,210
isn't that a good thing?

420
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
But I don't want to die!

421
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,400
If it weren't to save everyone,

422
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,800
you wouldn't have been born
in the first place.

423
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,400
Lici,

424
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,340
go now!

425
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,370
Go!

426
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
I need to save him.

427
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
The golden eyes and forehead mark?

428
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,750
The Chief is back!

429
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,680
-Chief.
-Chief.

430
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,400
This is...

431
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
your true power.

432
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,590
This is...

433
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,350
your true nature.

434
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,030
Lici.

435
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,920
You...

436
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,160
Mr. Tang?

437
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,510
Mr. Tang?

438
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,440
He's trapped in his inner demon.

439
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,150
You can't wake him up.

440
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,030
Dying in his inner demons

441
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,570
is better than losing everything
bit by bit.

442
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,030
Chi Yun,

443
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,880
Shen Langhun,

444
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,720
Zhong Chunji,

445
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,480
Gu Xitan,

446
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
and Miss Shei

447
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,680
in your armsâ€”

448
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,550
all your friends

449
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,050
will soon die with you.

450
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,180
My...

451
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,030
final mercy to you...

452
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,480
is...

453
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,070
No.

454
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I need to save him.

455
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,960
Lici,

456
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,640
who are you?

457
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,350
He found your identity.

458
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,210
He found your identity.

459
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,030
No! I don't want to!

460
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,720
No! I don't want to!

461
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,340
you saw me get injured

462
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,960
and you saw it heal
right before your eyes.

463
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,240
I just think

464
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,350
everyone

465
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,510
might have secrets

466
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,160
they don't want others to know.

467
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,240
I only know

468
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,360
that even if wounds heal,

469
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,890
they still hurt.

470
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,120
Mr. Tang,

471
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,400
wake up.

472
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,280
The Sevenâ€‘String True Tune.

473
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,900
The Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

474
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,690
Trying to control me with my inner demon?

475
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,680
When did Liu Yan become so naive?

476
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,960
Didn't he tell you

477
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,200
that in his eyes, Tang Lici

478
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,690
is a ruthless, heartless demon

479
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,960
with no feelings?

480
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,510
How can a demon have inner demons?

481
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,960
Mr. Tang,

482
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,440
are you alright?

483
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm fine.

484
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,639
Let me take you back.

485
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,010
No need.

486
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,630
But you're injured.

487
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,030
Shei, listen to me.

488
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,020
Chi Yun still needs me there.

489
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,840
Go back to Wanqiao Chamber
and wait for my news.

490
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
What is that

491
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,760
black crystal?

492
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,320
Yu Qifeng

493
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,780
is absorbing their power.

494
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,160
We need to stop him now.

495
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,400
Are you okay?

496
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,800
I won't die.

497
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,360
Black Tuli?

498
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,480
I saw it once in Dieban Chonghua's

499
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
collection room.

500
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,070
Legend has it that Yique Yinyang

501
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,800
was unbeatable

502
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,060
because of that thing.

503
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,630
Unorthodox.

504
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,520
I don't buy that crap.

505
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,060
Let's fight him first!

506
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,060
You know quite a lot.

507
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,630
Come on!

508
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,360
Impervious to weapons?

509
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,000
Shen,

510
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,590
why don't we use spells like Foxy Tang?

511
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,320
You know how?

512
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,610
I heard him use one once.

513
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What was it again?

514
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,440
How did his power

515
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
become so strong?

516
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,880
Let's kill him quickly!

517
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,810
Let's go all out!

518
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,360
You two have been fighting me

519
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,230
for so long,

520
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,270
yet your master hasn't shown up.

521
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,070
The Number one assassin?

522
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,580
The overlord of the underworld?

523
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,540
You're just his dogs.

524
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,590
I don't have time to waste on you anymore.

525
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,320
Go to hell

526
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,880
and meet Tang Lici!

527
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,000
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

528
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,850
Invincible!

529
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,670
Snake Fang!

530
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,700
Soul Breaker!

531
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,210
How dare a firefly
compete with the bright moon?

532
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,840
My nickname is Cloud.

533
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,480
You're the firefly!

534
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,880
You're asking for death!

535
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,760
Tang Lici?

536
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,070
Yu Qifeng,

537
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,960
were you waiting for me?

538
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,150
Tang Lici,

539
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,790
I will repay the humiliation
you've caused me

540
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,500
a hundredfold.

541
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,240
Master.

542
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,310
Tang Lici is fighting the Sword King.

543
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,710
We need to set off some fireworks

544
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,920
to liven things up.

545
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,910
The Tianyan Sword Wall?

546
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,090
Isn't Liu Yan here?

547
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,650
The Tianyan Sword Wall is collapsing?

548
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,990
Tang Lici!

549
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,880
This is Liu Yan's doing.

550
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,090
The mountain wall collapsing

551
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,000
will surely kill

552
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,360
many people at the foot of the mountain.

553
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,840
Shen,

554
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,840
go to Wanqiao Chamber and find Shei.

555
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,110
She knows who to seek.

556
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,110
Chi Yun.

557
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,220
I'll stay here!

558
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,000
Yu has absorbed a lot of people's power.

559
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,900
He's not easy to deal with.

560
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,340
No.

561
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,320
Go meet Zhong Chunji

562
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,360
and Gu Xitan

563
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,640
to evacuate the civilians.

564
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,290
This is my wager with Puzhu.

565
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,860
Help me hold it.

566
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,920
Okay.

567
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,210
Be careful.

568
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,150
It's just us now.

569
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,400
Tang Lici,

570
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,590
to defeat you,

571
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,030
Master

572
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,320
gave me a gift!

573
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,110
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual!

574
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,670
Puzhu forbade me to kill you.

575
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,550
If he knew

576
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,190
you've killed so many people,

577
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,550
he might regret

578
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,550
having shown you mercy.

579
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,020
What is that?

580
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,550
Chi Yun!

581
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,070
Chi!

582
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,480
What happened to the Tianyan Sword Wall?

583
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Where is Mr. Tang?

584
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,920
He's up there dueling with Yu Qifeng.

585
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,880
They caused the mountain to collapse!

586
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,810
Save the people!

587
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,660
Be careful!

588
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,670
Master?

589
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,320
Everyone, listen!

590
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,780
Follow me up the mountain!

591
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,690
Commander Yu!

592
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,360
If you leave,

593
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,620
what about the people of Sword King City?

594
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,110
Hurry!

595
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,190
Quickly!

596
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,480
It's dangerous here!

597
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,730
Disciples of Sword King City!

598
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,030
Follow me to evacuate the civilians!

599
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,550
Yes!

600
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,410
Such an explosion...

601
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,150
If it's really Mr. Tang...

602
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,760
Foxy Tang,

603
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,150
please be safe.
