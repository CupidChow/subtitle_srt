[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,640
Not a single step back?

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Master Shao, you're truly skilled.

5
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,580
But if the Tai'e Sword were sealed,

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,240
would you still be so relaxed?

7
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,070
With your amateur skills,

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,420
you think you can seal the Tai'e Sword?

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,759
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword,

10
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,680
you can win?

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,870
You really underestimate

12
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,070
the Sword Master of the Sword Alliance.

13
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,870
Master Shao,

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,079
I've missed you since we parted
at Sword King City.

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,430
He's walking so casually.

16
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,670
Is he really here to save someone?

17
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,970
I've been walking with you for so long

18
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,050
and haven't encountered any danger.

19
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,300
Isn't this a bit strange?

20
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,740
Do you think

21
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,240
we're unharmed

22
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,710
because

23
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm in cahoots with the Fengliu Shop?

24
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,400
Liu Yan specializes
in curse bugs and poisons.

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,030
The plants and trees here,

26
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,520
like the Bone-Soaking Lotus

27
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,980
we saw on the lake earlier,

28
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,390
appear harmless,

29
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,430
but in reality,

30
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,110
they contain deadly poison.

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,930
Poisonous plants are potent

32
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,100
but predictable.

33
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,710
Meanwhile, the changes of human hearts

34
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,570
are as unfathomable as the abyss.

35
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,300
I've already destroyed
many poisonous flowers.

36
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,770
You just didn't notice.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,150
However, the poison still lingers.

38
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,750
I suggest you take

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,079
another antidote pill.

40
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,190
I almost forgot

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,150
that you know

42
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,140
Yique Yinyang's strange technique,

43
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,540
so you don't even need it.

44
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,480
It's Master Shao.

45
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,100
Finally,

46
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
he's here.

47
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,470
You mean

48
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,020
that we face the enemy directly

49
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,750
and win with surprise tactics?

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,480
Will Liu Yan comply?

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,170
He dared to issue a challenge,

52
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,000
which means he's fully prepared.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,920
And what we need to do

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,120
is to make him believe

55
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,890
everything is going according to his plan.

56
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,360
You bunch of idiots

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,520
really came to die.

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,660
Shen Langhun moves swiftly.

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,270
Working with the six Sword Masters,

60
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,720
they can handle Meihua Yishu

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
and Kuanglan Wuxing.

62
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,180
Master Cheng and Gu Xitan

63
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,090
can perfectly counter Fucui.

64
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,810
Eliminating evil
and defending righteousness...

65
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,180
Happens today.

66
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,760
Charge!

67
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,460
This way,

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
of Liu Yan's skilled fighters,

69
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,070
all that remain will be

70
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,950
Miss Hong,

71
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,770
Qingchan,

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,700
Hua Wuyan,

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,720
and Bai Suche.

74
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,780
What's your plan?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Liu Yan and I are evenly matched.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,510
To avoid
a direct confrontation with me,

77
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,920
he'll certainly use Ms. Zhong as bait

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
to lure me away,

79
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,360
then use the curse bugs to set a trap

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
and slaughter
the Sword Alliance's disciples.

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,250
Once Liu Yan leaves Bishang Pavilion,

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
you will need to intercept him.

83
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,000
We can't let him join the main battlefield

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,310
nor allow him to return.

85
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,270
Only then will I have a chance

86
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
to rescue Ms. Zhong.

87
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,310
Therefore...

88
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,480
Master Shao,

89
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,770
you must use yourself as bait.

90
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,360
Tang Lici,

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
what exactly is going on?

92
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,120
All the Sword Masters are fighting,

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,450
yet you chose this path.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,920
When Master Shao encountered enemies,

95
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,270
you still remained indifferent.

96
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,400
You're not planning

97
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,240
to weaken both sides in this chaos

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,970
and eventually kill everyone,

99
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,840
like Yique Yinyang, right?

100
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,200
Green Corpse Curse Bug.

101
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,680
If this thing burrowed into

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,600
your brain,

103
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,870
trying to remove it

104
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,550
would be quite troublesome.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,010
Deputy Lord Yu,

106
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,310
I know you have
misunderstandings about me,

107
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,840
but I still want to tell you,

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,830
that I

109
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,390
am not Yique Yinyang.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,570
Let's go.

111
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
Step back.

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,760
Tang Lici,

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,570
long time no see.

114
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,920
After you fought your way out,

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,450
did you encounter

116
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,540
anyone else?

117
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,470
Deputy Lord Yu,

118
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,340
so this is what you've been hiding.

119
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,580
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Such a commotion.

121
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,770
Something is definitely wrong here.

122
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,600
Chief,

123
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,890
I'm annoyed each time I come here.

124
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Coffins in cold water?

125
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,630
Only Gui Fusheng

126
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,390
would create

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,560
such cumbersome and tedious things.

128
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,680
As long as you can create

129
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,720
what I want,

130
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,390
the Floating Abyss is yours to use.

131
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,560
What you want

132
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,510
is almost ready.

133
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,669
Just give me a little more time.

134
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,080
Once the Leader delivers

135
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
the promised Sky-Fallen Stone fragments,

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,870
I will create

137
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,630
a true miracle.

138
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
The Inverted Dream

139
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,860
won't disappoint you, Chief.

140
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,870
What's this "inverted" nonsense?

141
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,030
What weird stuff is this weirdo

142
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,000
trying to do?

143
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,390
We have a visitor.

144
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,710
You want me to personally distract Liu Yan

145
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,520
to buy you time for the rescue?

146
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,490
This round, Liu Yan and I

147
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,810
are competing for
the preemptive advantage.

148
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,130
I am fully confident.

149
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,460
Master Shao, please rest assured.

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Just proceed according to the plan.

151
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
Master Shao,

152
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,050
long time no see.

153
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,970
Dr. Liu,

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
thanks to your presence,

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,320
the people here

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,250
aren't left without medical care.

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,510
I, Shao,

158
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,200
truly failed to recognize your status.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,650
I didn't realize

160
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,600
you're the master of Fengliu Shop.

161
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,840
It seems that it's my honor

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,020
to have you lower yourself

163
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,100
to meet me in person.

164
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,670
May I ask,

165
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,720
as a descendant of Zhoudi Tower,

166
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,360
why have you gone astray

167
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,000
and committed such evil deeds?

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,610
Sword Master, stop wasting time.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,330
I won't answer your question.

170
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,290
Let's see if Tang Lici comes
to save you first

171
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
or if you will

172
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,510
die in battle first?

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,750
I see now

174
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,960
that Sword King Yu
is guarding the pass for Liu Yan.

175
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,400
Master Shao is facing Liu Yan already.

176
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,660
I need to make it quick.

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,830
Go save Ms. Zhong first.

178
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,200
Hurry!

179
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,340
Mofeng Black Fire.

180
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,150
Phoenix's Bloody Tears.

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,980
Ten Blazing Suns, Lotuses Bloom!

182
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,540
Neither truly dead nor alive,

183
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,600
why live such a miserable existence?

184
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,870
Don't tell me

185
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,250
that after the battle in Biluo Palace,

186
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,830
you actually believed his disguise.

187
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,160
Doing bad things

188
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,670
doesn't make you a bad person,

189
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,390
as long as you're not caught.

190
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,050
Don't let your life

191
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,770
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

192
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,100
become the price of your misplaced trust!

193
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,350
Tang Lici,

194
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,530
you're indeed a monster.

195
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,300
Yu Qifeng.

196
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,890
I can kill you right now.

197
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,540
Of course you can kill me.

198
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,720
Today,

199
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,480
I've already trapped
the Sword Alliance here.

200
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,390
Tomorrow, I'll storm into Sword King City,

201
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,590
invade Biluo Palace,

202
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,360
and turn the entire jianghu

203
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
into a river of blood!

204
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
and release

205
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,750
the followers who were imprisoned
on Camellia Island

206
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,550
They've waited for so many years

207
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,370
and can finally welcome back...

208
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,630
Yique Yinyang.

209
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,250
Follow and live, or resist and die,

210
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,320
just like over 10 years ago.

211
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,200
He is my enemy.

212
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,370
Since that's what you believe,

213
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
I'll help make your dream come true.

214
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,990
Yique Yinyang.

215
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,440
You really are Yique Yinyang.

216
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,480
Are Biluo Palace and the Sword Alliance

217
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,030
all just

218
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,160
your excuses to yield in order to gain?

219
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,030
Furen,

220
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,030
you're truly my good son.

221
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,080
I will kill Yique Yinyang right now

222
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,660
to honor your heroic sacrifice.

223
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,590
Father, you actually want to kill me?

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,090
Do you see now?

225
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,690
He's the one who's been
using you all along.

226
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,600
Draw your sword.

227
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,090
Tang Lici.

228
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,520
Draw your sword.

229
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,750
My son, why are you drawing your sword?

230
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
You believe Yique Yinyang

231
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,670
but not your own father?

232
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,240
You're not my father at all!

233
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
Die!

234
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,390
In our next life, we'll be enemies,
not father and son!

235
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,150
Acting on impulse

236
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,810
nearly ruined everything.

237
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,550
That voice...

238
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,150
How may I address you?

239
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,720
Ghostly Peony.

240
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,100
You should rest and recover here,

242
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,450
and await assistance.

243
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,920
Yu Qifeng has delayed me for too long.

244
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,650
I'll go rescue Ms. Zhong first.

245
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,030
I wonder how Mr. Tang

246
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,440
and the others are doing.

247
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,200
Stone!

248
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,000
Stone, are you alright?

249
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,170
I have a feeling

250
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,980
that Master

251
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,360
is in danger.

252
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,380
There are traps here.

253
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,089
There's poison!

254
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,480
This formation has been activated.

255
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,869
Everything within its reach

256
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,130
becomes territory for my Martial Realm.

257
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,590
Drawing boundaries to create a prison,

258
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,120
trapping oneself in a cage.

259
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,790
Is Liu Yan always

260
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,550
so self-pitying like this?

261
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,690
Master ordered me

262
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,340
to delay you for a moment.

263
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,680
You think you can trap me

264
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,550
with just this cage and smoke?

265
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,510
Mr. Tang,

266
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,630
don't underestimate this cage.

267
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,240
Once you leave

268
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,960
this cage,

269
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,170
Ms. Zhong will be in grave danger.

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Moreover,

271
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Master has also

272
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,790
left something for me.

273
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,200
This item is called
the Moon in Water Mirror.

274
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,960
It not only reveals

275
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,890
all your actions

276
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,640
but also allows you to witness

277
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,370
how Fengliu Shop slaughters
the Sword Alliance.

278
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,510
However, Mr. Tang

279
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,040
and Ms. Zhong, don't worry.

280
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,750
The place where you are now
is perfectly safe.

281
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,610
Just wait until they're all dead,

282
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,970
then come out to collect their bodies.

283
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,350
Ms. Zhong,

284
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,790
hang in there.

285
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,490
How did you escape?

286
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,510
No self, no form.

287
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,330
The one you saw in the cage

288
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,010
was merely an illusion.

only then might you stand a slim chance

And you, Ms. Zhong,

418
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
are still putting on a facade.

419

If this thing burrowed into

439
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,650
your brain,

440
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,350
trying to remove it

441
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,190

Weren't you told to wait for assistance?

447
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,530
You should rest and recover here,

448
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,790
and await assistance.

449
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,300
Stop spacing out. Follow me.

Master Shao,

451
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,640
it seems you won't last

452
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,970
until Mr. Tang arrives.

453
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,270
Who says my body is failing?

454
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,510
Master Shao!

455
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,420
Master Shao!

456
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,330
Are you alright?

457
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,060
Master Shao!

458
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,100
A few more of you
won't make any difference.

459
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,420
Come on if you dare!

460
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,780
It's blood.

461
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,310
This is Hua Wuyan's blood.

462
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,040
He died,

463
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,750
but his death

464
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,930
will bring you all a great gift.

465
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,430
The formation eye mark left by Tang Lici.

466
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,580
Search for the mark.

467
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,440
-Hurry.
-Okay.

468
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,030
Pu,

469
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,960
your antidote pills
aren't working anymore.

470
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,840
How would I know

471
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,790
this thing could mutate?

472
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,810
Everyone, hold on!

473
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,920
The Peony Pavilion

474
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,960
means nothing to me.

475
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,560
It's no matter to abandon it.

476
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,240
But you nobodies...

477
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,000
None of you will escape

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,130
from under my watch!

479
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,720
If I release all the power

480
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,780
of the Tai'e Sword,

481
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,550
I can surely defeat Liu Yan.

482
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,240
Since the situation can't be reversed,

483
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,960
we should at least
make this demon die with us.

484
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,790
Stars in the vast cosmos,

485
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
the mystery of mysteries!

486
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,720
Illuminating the dark night,

487
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,390
bringing order to the heavens.

488
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,810
Reflecting upon mountains
and rivers as protection.

489
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,430
All living beings,

490

Biluo Palace returning to Luo River

492
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,940
was thanks to your assistance.

493
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,720
If trouble befalls the jianghu,

494
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,200
Biluo Palace

495
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,110
can lend the Celestial Thunder Technique

496
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,270
to help the Sword Alliance
achieve victory.

497

Palace Chief Wanyu

498
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,890
is counting on you.

499
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,710
Poison spreads everywhere.

500
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Heaven's virtue is lost.

501
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
I, who worship the stars,

502
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,850
Wanyu Yuedan...

503
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,390
Sincerely perform this dance
to ward off evil,

504
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,820
borrowing the spirits of heaven and earth.

505
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,810
May the Thunder God clear the path,

506
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,870
and bring rain to eliminate disaster!

507
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,260
Consecrate the sword!

508
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,950
Liu Yan,

509
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,540
you have already lost this battle.

510
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
You can abandon the Peony Pavilion.

511
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,520
You can abandon your comrades.

512
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,960
You can also easily abandon

513
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,510
the righteous path taught by Fang Zhou.

514
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,410
But I will never abandon

515
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
any disciple of the Sword Alliance.

516
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
I swore on the Tai'e Sword

517
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,800
to protect

518
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,350
the lives of all disciples.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
I will personally cut off

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,240
your demonic head.

521
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,920
Even if I have to die for this,

522
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,320
fighting for justice...

523
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,750
What is there to fear?

524
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,730
If we were elsewhere,

525
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,880
I would probably

526
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,340
have died under that move.

527
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,930
But since I lured you here,

528
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,880
I'm obviously prepared.

529
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,480
This is

530
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,160
the Ice Flower curse bug
that I prepared

531
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,290
for the Tai'e Sword.

532
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,750
Combining the power of three,

533
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,110
I waited specifically
for the moment of sword consecration

534
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,030
to control you

535
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,420
and show you

536
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,370
what true despair really is.

537
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,130
Master Shao,

538
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,750
if there were
true righteousness in this world,

539
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,680
how could Fang Zhou have perished?

540
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,950
Master Shao!

541
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,750
Master!

542
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,870
Master!

543
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,750
Chunji,

544
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,550
I'm glad you're back.

545
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,370
I'm glad you're back.

546
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,120
Liu Yan,

547
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,310
Hua Wuyan died because of you.

548
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
How many more times

549
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,950
will you repeat such needless sacrifices?

550
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,080
Those words should be directed at you.

551
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm curious to know

552
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,000
how many more heroes

553
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,560
you'll send to their deaths

554
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,950
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

555
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,470
You...

556
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,350
Chunji.

557
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,270
Chunji.

558
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,420
Chunji!

559
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Besides such clumsy provocations,

560
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,670
what else can you do?

561
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,480
Clumsy?

562
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,350
Could it be clumsier

563
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,000
than the lies you told me at Biluo Palace?

564
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,420
I've been to Zhoudi Tower.

565
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,280
There was clearly nothing there!

566
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
In that case,

567
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,820
I'll capture you first

568
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,170
and then explain everything clearly.

569
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,510
You often use that innocent face

570
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,760
to deceive people

571
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,659
who believe your nonsense.

572
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,909
None of you are innocent.

573
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,550
You always think

574
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,840
you can do anything.

575
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,110
The Sword Alliance

576
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,010
was ruined because of your confidence.

577
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,140
Master Jiang,

578
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,110
all the curse bugs

579
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,440
are attacking Mr. Tang.

580
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,520
Follow Mr. Tang's orders.

581
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,800
Notify the Mole Camp

582
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
to light the fire!

583
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,740
Liu Yan,

584
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
you've used all your backup plans

585
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,590
to attack me.

586
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,420
You've already used up
all your trump cards.

587
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,920
The endgame has arrived.

588
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,880
This is what I mean by...

589
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,270
"giving back in twofold"

590
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,550
Tang Lici,

591
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,590
the Peony Pavilion is yours now.

592
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,370
I wonder when we meet again,

593
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,920
what kind of person

594
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,070
you will become.

595
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,360
Great!

596
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,500
Look at what's written here.

597
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,060
Look!

598
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,640
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

599
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,370
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

600
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,360
We've won!

601
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,150
Victory!

602
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,000
Zhong Chunji, the heroine
and Chief of Shanfeng Branch,

603
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,710
all of this

604
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,230
was given to you by him.

605
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,960
Not a single thing

606
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,630
truly belongs to you.

607
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,000
That's why you fight so hard

608
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
to defend him.

609
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,190
It's because you know that, without him,

610
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,630
you are nothing.

611
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,180
If you think I'm so worthless,

612
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,560
then why waste your breath?

613
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,760
Kill me already!

614
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,800
In your heart,

615
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,070
there's also a monster.

616
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,070
This attack on Fengliu Shop

617
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,590
cost many lives.

618
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,280
It's because Senior Zhong
was too eager for merit

619
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,590
and acted without following orders.

620
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,500
Don't say that.

621
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,360
It was always the plan

622
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
to attack Fengliu Shop.

623
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,880
Sooner or later, we had to attack anyway.

624
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,140
It's not good if someone overhears this.

625
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,750
I really want to know

626
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,960
how many more heroes

627
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,860
you'll send to their deaths

628
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,090
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

629
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,590
Who is it?

630
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,400
Ms. Zhong,

631
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,280
it's me.

632
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,760
Where is Mr. Tang?

633
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,080
Where is my Master?

634
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,790
They're talking in Wanhua Hall.

635
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,230
Why are you up?

636
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,110
You need to rest more.

637
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,170
Ms. Zhong,

638
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,910
you've suffered so much.

639
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,730
It's alright now.

640
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,810
When I was in Yanxian,

641
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,590
I was also imprisoned and tortured.

642
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,500
You were the one who saved me.

643
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,090
That feeling of despair

644
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,670
was truly unbearable.

645
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,880
Thankfully,

646
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,760
we're both safe now.

647
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,440
By the way,

648
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,450
while you were unconscious,

649
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,510
Mr. Tang came to examine

650
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,590
your injuries.

651
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,250
They're just some surface wounds.

652
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,740
This is the medicine he provided.

653
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,950
As long as you take it regularly,

654
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,480
you'll recover soon.

655
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Everything will be fine.

656
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,730
Thank you,

657
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,610
Shei.

658
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,150
Master Jiang,

659
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,840
you'll be responsible
for arranging guards to patrol

660
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,100
and secure the perimeter of Mount Cloud.

661
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,360
As for distributing medication

662
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,110
and taking care of the wounded,

663
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,560
Master Ji will be in charge of that.

664
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,670
-We will do our best.
-We will do our best.

665
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,280
Mr. Tang,

666
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,960
I had many misgivings
about you before.

667
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
I feel ashamed.

668
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,220
This battle at Peony Pavilion...

669
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,290
I understand.

670
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,960
No need to worry, Master Jiang.

671
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,250
Hold it in.

672
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,470
It would be embarrassing
if we both coughed up blood here.

673
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,290
The Sword Alliance is a complex group.

674
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,950
Now, all branches are united.

675
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
It's truly a feat.

676
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,540
Thank you for your help,
Palace Chief Wanyu.

677
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,830
If it weren't for you,

678
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,030
the Sword Alliance would have
suffered greater losses.

679
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,960
As allies,

680
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,950
helping each other is expected.

681
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,190
It's a pity we couldn't

682
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,700
eliminate them completely.

683
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,630
We searched the entire Peony Pavilion

684
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,230
but couldn't find

685
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,000
the whereabouts

686
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,600
of Liu Yan and other key figures.

687
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,400
However, blowing up

688
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,130
the entire Peony Pavilion base

689
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,360
and forcing Liu Yan to abandon his hideout

690
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,440
has boosted morale,

691
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,550
so it wasn't a complete waste.

692
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,900
Indeed.

693
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,550
But Master Puzhu

694
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,410
still hasn't sent any news.

695
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
I wonder if he's safe.

696
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,840
Looking at it like this,

697
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,630
the world seems so small.

698
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,580
But after staring for a while,

699
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,840
this tiny night sky

700
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,330
feels like a vortex.

701
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,910
It keeps spinning,

702
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,710
pulling people in.

703
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,690
If we died here,

704
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,020
would it count as dying together?

705
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,330
Miss Tao,

706
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,790
why did you join Fengliu Shop?
