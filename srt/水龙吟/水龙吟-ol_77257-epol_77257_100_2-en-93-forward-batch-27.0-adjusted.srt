3
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,530
[Four years ago, in the peach blossom
forest of Zhoudi Tower]

4
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,070
A friend who would move heaven and earth

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
to kill me.

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,120
A friend whom I would search

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,380
to the ends of the earth

8
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,030
just to find.

9
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,920
Yan,

10
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,840
for the past six months,

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,640
you've been avoiding me.

12
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,670
Actually, that day...

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Back then,

14
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,780
under the blossoms stretching for miles,

15
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,820
Senior Brother taught you,

16
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,570
me,

17
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,700
and Zhumei our craft.

18
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,370
It was warm in the spring.

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,460
What a beautiful time.

20
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,990
But now,
the flowers still bloom as they did,

21
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,130
yet the people are gone.

22
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,610
After Senior Brother left,

23
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,610
Zhumei vanished without a trace.

24
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,390
In the Zhoudi Tower,

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,510
only you and I remain.

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,190
Lici,

27
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,770
you composed this melody back then.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,650
Today, let's play it once more for him.

29
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,120
What do you say?

30
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,010
A childhood composition

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,090
could never compare
to

32
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,450
Senior Brother's masterpieces.

33
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,840
But I think

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,480
this melody

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,200
is the best I've ever heard.

36
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,250
Yan…

37
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
This is the only melody

38
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,250
worthy of sending you to your grave.

39
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
You used a curse bug on me?

40
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,690
If you hadn't come wounded,

41
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,040
I couldn't have
planted it in you so easily.

42
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,990
Tang Lici,

43
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,300
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

44
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,650
Yan…

45
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,390
Yan,

46
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,490
it's been four years

47
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,870
since we parted.

48
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,790
Killing me once wasn't enough for you.

49
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,430
Now,

50
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,190
you're using the Hao family massacre

51
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,480
to lure me into your trap

52
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,430
to kill me again.

53
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,650
Since that's the case,

54
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,049
I'll play along.

55
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,330
Let's see if after four years,

56
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,549
you can still manage to kill me.

57
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,150
It was him.

58
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,330
It was Tang Lici.

59
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,680
It was Tang Lici!

60
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,570
It was he

61
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,440
who told me to say this.

62
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,840
It wasn't me.

63
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,240
Please spare me.

64
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Let me go.

65
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,790
There's someone

66
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,960
so vicious in the jianghu.

67
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,300
How dangerous.

68
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,020
Stop playing dumb.

69
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,860
Why did you kill Lord Hao?

70
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,550
For money?

71
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,120
Or did he have something

72
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,750
on you?

73
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,670
It was because...

74
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,480
Who's there?

75
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,480
Chi Yun!

76
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,060
The Blood Ghost Pill?

77
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,290
Jianghu matters
should be settled in the jianghu.

78
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,350
Either you kill me,

79
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,650
or I kill you.

80
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,430
Masters and servants
can turn on each other for money.

81
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,070
Brothers can betray and kill each other.

82
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,720
In the end,

83
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,250
the heart is the hardest to see through.

84
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,730
Demons are everywhere.

85
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Amitabha.

86
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,910
Right and wrong, good and evil—
they're just a thought apart.

87
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,000
What you can't let go of is obsession.

88
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,650
You're very wise, sir.

89
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,820
Salvation lies in your own hands.

90
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
I believe

91
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,150
you'll eventually reach the other shore.

92
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,910
Yan,

93
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,290
I'm coming for you.

94
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,170
When it comes to lightness skills,

95
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,870
who can compare to me, Chi Yun,

96
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,630
the Cloud?

97
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,910
Stop!

98
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,970
A messenger goose?

99
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,630
You're from the Yanmen Sect?

100
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,240
I forgot Yanmen had this trick.

101
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Had I known,

102
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,630
I'd have raised a hawk myself.

103
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,420
Where did Chi Yun go?

104
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,410
Miss Zhong!

105
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,390
Miss Zhong!

106
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,500
Miss Shei?

107
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,440
Where did this ship come from?

108
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,070
Miss Shei, why are you here?

109
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,350
Mr. Tang brought me here.

110
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,180
He said we'd meet you here.

111
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,520
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

112
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,700
You won't be able to catch up with him.

113
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,730
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

114
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,030
And why did Miss Shei come too?

115
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,700
Since we're hunting down the culprit,

116
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,890
it's natural to bring along the victim.

117
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,320
The person you're looking for

118
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,250
has already gone dozens of li west.

119
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,870
Taking the waterway would be faster.

120
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,530
You already know everything.

121
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,740
That man is incredibly agile.

122
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,250
He's no ordinary fighter.

123
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,510
With the Cloud,

124
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,390
we won't

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
lose him.

126
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
And we can

127
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,930
catch up with them.

128
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,590
I never expected

129
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,570
this pleasure ship
would have such mechanisms.

130
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,320
Wait.

131
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,480
Mr. Tang, why are you so certain

132
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,200
that Chi Yun will come this way?

133
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,270
I'm not certain

134
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,530
about Chi Yun's route.

135
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,030
I'm just certain
where the killer is headed.

136
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,390
You mean…

137
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,050
you already know
who the killer is?

138
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,480
Due to my personal affairs,

139
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,070
I have gathered much information.

140
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,510
And coincidentally, one clue

141
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,290
points right here.

142
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,720
Six months ago,

143
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
the Westwind Swordsman, Feng Chuanxiang,

144
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,600
vanished mysteriously
from Liulian Cottage.

145
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,790
Only his footsteps leading into

146
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,120
the cottage were found.

147
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,620
None leading out.

148
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
It is said that

149
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,910
in Liulian Cottage,

150
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,630
there were traces
of two people living there.

151
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,570
After Feng Chuanxiang disappeared,

152
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,090
his mysterious roommate

153
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,690
vanished too.

154
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,630
And the answer

155
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,670
lies in this very item.

156
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,960
A goose feather?

157
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,590
Long and resilient;

158
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
lustrous and smooth.

159
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,480
This is no ordinary goose feather.

160
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Messenger geese?

161
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,610
Yanmen's messenger geese?

162
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,180
100 li east of Yan County

163
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,300
is the Yanmen Sect.

164
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,440
This river flows from east to west.

165
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,370
If the killer wants
to avoid implicating Yanmen,

166
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,300
he'll head west.

167
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,690
Even if something happens
and he turns east midway,

168
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,290
he'll run right into us.

169
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,440
But...

170
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,570
that's impossible.

171
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,860
Why do you say that, Miss Zhong?

172
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,330
What kind of sect is the Yanmen Sect?

173
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,580
The Yanmen Sect began as a bandit clan

174
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,750
but was granted amnesty
by the former dynasty

175
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,150
and became

176
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,270
the military guards of the Yanmen Pass.

177
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,870
Their goose-training skills
are remarkable.

178
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,620
10 years ago,
when the world fell into chaos,

179
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,840
the Sword Sect led many great fighters

180
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
to hunt down Yique Yinyang.

181
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,750
Yanmen provided

182
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,870
crucial intelligence.

183
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,390
Its leader, Jiang Feiyu,

184
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,330
has a fiery temper,

185
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,390
but he's extremely

186
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,960
protective of his own people.

187
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,910
That's why Yanmen disciples

188
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,570
value loyalty above all else.

189
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,500
There's a saying in the jianghu:

190
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,310
"Better to offend the King of Hell's men

191
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,310
than to cross someone from Yanmen."

192
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,440
It sounds like

193
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,020
a righteous sect.

194
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
It doesn't just sound like it—

195
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,250
it is a righteous sect.

196
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,860
Yang Shangqing

197
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,000
was also from a righteous sect.

198
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,870
I found this

199
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,120
on Yang Shangqing.

200
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,500
To be honest,

201
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,410
my master sent me down the mountain

202
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,200
not only for the Hao family massacre

203
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
but also for this matter.

204
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,380
These evil pills

205
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,820
haven't been seen again

206
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,750
since the death of Yique Yinyang.

207
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,360
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

208
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,730
I've paid attention

209
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,730
to the Blood Ghost Pills too.

210
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,560
My leaving the temple

211
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,390
should tell you what I think.

212
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,520
Then…

213
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,520
Miss Zhong,

214
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,170
don't worry for now.

215
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,090
Come have some refreshments.

216
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,030
Talk.

217
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,630
Who are you?

218
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
Who sent you to kill that guy?

219
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,750
You think staying silent will save you?

220
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,480
Don't…

221
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
Don't push me.

222
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:38,970
Don't push you?

223
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,000
Then why do you think

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,310
I chased you for over 100 li?

225
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,880
For fun?

226
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,920
Brat,

227
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,500
don't take poison!

228
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,869
Even an ant fights to stay alive.

229
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,329
Please don't take poison.

230
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,780
It's not poison.

231
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,230
What the hell is that?

232
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,190
This is getting difficult.

233
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,560
Chi Yun, you're not

234
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,960
as good as you used to be.

235
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,930
I haven't even gone all out yet.

236
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,440
Let's stop here.

237
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,820
He knelt right before you.

238
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,880
The assassin who killed Yang Shangqing

239
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,550
is actually

240
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,650
Jiang Cheng.

241
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
Miss Zhong, you know him?

242
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,560
Jiang Cheng is the young master of Yanmen.

243
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,270
He's upright and chivalrous,

244
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,860
a close friend
of the Westwind Swordsman.

245
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,030
They often went to the Huaxi region

246
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,160
in the Sword King City

247
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,520
to fight injustice and help the weak.

248
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,330
They're known

249
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,890
as the Twin Heroes of Huaxi.

250
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,920
Six months ago,

251
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,830
the Westwind Swordsman

252
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,240
vanished mysteriously at home,

253
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
and Young Master Jiang
also went missing.

254
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,610
How did he become like this?

255
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,530
What are you murmuring?

256
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,300
Foxy Tang, what are you murmuring?

257
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,440
I still need to ask him

258
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,100
why he killed Yang Shangqing.

259
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,310
Is anyone hurt?

260
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Drop the act.

261
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,570
I really don't remember anything.

262
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,520
Young Master Jiang.

263
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,350
You…

264
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,390
You've got the wrong person.

265
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm…

266
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm not Young Master Jiang.

267
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,310
Over a year ago,

268
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,160
I met you and Mr. Feng

269
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,710
at the Sword Sect in the Central Plains.

270
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,710
I'm not mistaken.

271
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,280
Now that we know who he is,

272
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,000
there's no need for questions.

273
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
I'll just take him

274
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
to the Yanmen Sect

275
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,200
and let his people

276
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,410
explain for him.

277
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,310
Watch out!

278
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,040
Mr. Tang.

279
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,970
You're injured.

280
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,240
You're injured.

281
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,190
Don't use this hand for now.

282
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,000
You wanted to take your own life

283
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,450
because you were worried that your actions

284
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,770
would disgrace Yanmen's name, right?

285
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Foxy Tang,

286
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,660
you were right.

287
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,140
The so-called Yanmen Sect

288
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,850
is just a bunch of filth.

289
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,030
Watch your mouth!

290
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,350
You don't know anything!

291
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,510
What should I know?

292
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,430
The Blood Ghost Pills…

293
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,200
Those evil pills

294
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,540
have resurfaced in the jianghu.

295
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,990
I thought I had the wrong person,

296
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,600
but it seems I was right.

297
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,420
You do have the wrong person.

298
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm not him.

299
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,070
The poison has spread within you.

300
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,240
Your energy flow is reversed.

301
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,370
You don't have long.

302
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,410
You're not afraid of death,

303
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,510
but you don't want to die now.

304
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,310
You still have unfinished business.

305
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,910
Am I right?

306
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,090
If you don't want to speak

307
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,190
with all these people here,

308
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,050
we can talk privately elsewhere.

309
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,480
Hey!

310
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,310
What's so secret

311
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,110
that it
can't be said in front of us?

312
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,920
Foxy Tang

313
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,680
is being so mysterious.

314
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,140
Miss Shei,

315
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,510
how is

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Mr. Tang's injury from earlier?

317
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,810
Miss Zhong, don't worry.

318
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,680
Once we get back,

319
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,130
I'll apply some more medicine for him,

320
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,130
and he'll be fine.

321
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,990
But, Mr. Chi,

322
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
what exactly are

323
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,980
the Blood Ghost Pills?

324
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,600
Why does everyone

325
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,110
go pale

326
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,510
when they're mentioned?

327
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,920
They were created by Yique Yinyang,

328
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,110
the former dynasty's Imperial Preceptor
and leader of the Jile Sect,

329
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,270
to control people.

330
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,680
To control people?

331
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,610
In the jianghu,

332
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,900
power has always been respected above all.

333
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,640
Who doesn't want

334
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,370
to excel and rise above others?

335
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,370
But not everyone

336
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,000
has the ability and talent.

337
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,390
Greed knows no bounds.

338
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,480
The weak crave power,

339
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,190
and the strong

340
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,720
seek shortcuts
to become even stronger.

341
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,130
Those evil pills

342
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,070
can give your cultivation a huge boost.

343
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,070
So initially,

344
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,480
the Blood Ghost Pills

345
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,200
were treated

346
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
like a popular tonic.

347
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,350
But soon after,

348
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,200
people realized

349
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,260
they'd been duped.

350
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,830
Why?

351
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
Anyone who takes those pills

352
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,910
has to keep taking them for life.

353
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,260
If they stop,
they go mad and die.

354
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,090
So whoever has the Blood Ghost Pills

355
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,890
controls those people's lives.

356
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,300
Yique Yinyang

357
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,130
used this very method to seize control

358
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,520
of half the jianghu.

359
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,130
More than a year ago,

360
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,180
after arguing with my father,

361
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,100
I went to stay with Chuanxiang.

362
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,150
We lived together on Mount Huaxi,

363
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,550
practicing martial arts

364
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,830
and fighting for justice.

365
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,500
[Liulian Cottage]

366
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,970
During that time,

367
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,170
my martial skills improved dramatically.

368
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,030
I thought it was because

369
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,890
Chuanxiang was training with me.

370
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,170
But little did I know,

371
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,030
he was secretly taking evil pills

372
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,680
and mixing them into my food.

373
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,080
After I found out about this,

374
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,510
I confronted him
about why he spiked my food.

375
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,680
He wouldn't tell me.

376
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,130
He only told me to trust him,

377
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,370
saying he'd help me.

378
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,660
Jiang Cheng,

379
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
please trust me.

380
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,440
I will help you.

381
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,310
But I didn't want

382
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,310
that kind of help.

383
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,030
And I didn't need

384
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,960
to improve my skills

385
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,200
through such means.

386
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,350
After that,

387
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,840
I refused to take the pills again

388
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,030
and asked Chuanxiang

389
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,030
to help me suppress the poison in me.

390
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,440
But that process

391
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,600
was agonizing.

392
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,930
It was so painful
that just

393
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,330
thinking about it makes my mind go blank.

394
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,570
Then, six months ago,

395
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,360
Chuanxiang suddenly disappeared,

396
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,640
leaving me alone.

397
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,440
I searched everywhere

398
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,080
but couldn't find any trace of him.

399
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,860
So I carried
the remaining pills he had bought

400
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,440
and started

401
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,700
tracing their source,

402
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,990
which eventually led me

403
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,200
to Yang Shangqing.

404
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,470
So you feared

405
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,200
Yang Shangqing

406
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,530
might expose the truth,

407
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,790
ruining the reputation of Feng Chuanxiang,

408
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,790
the Westwind Swordsman.

409
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,440
That's why,

410
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,820
even at the risk of being

411
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,220
chased down by the Cloud,

412
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,780
you still killed him.

413
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,790
If I'd had

414
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,790
any other option,

415
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,920
I never would've taken the pill again.

416
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,350
Wind swept across the reed flowers;

417
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,790
moonlight shone on Mount Huaxi.

418
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,640
We...

419
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,580
we were such good friends.

420
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,680
Mr. Tang,

421
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,110
I want to find Chuanxiang

422
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,760
and ask him

423
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,920
why he did this to me.

424
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,990
We were friends who'd die for each other.

425
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,660
Why do we have to turn against each other?

426
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,910
Very well.

427
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,050
I understand.

428
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,740
You're fortunate.

429
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,640
Today,

430
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,030
I'm in a good mood.

431
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,010
I'll give you two choices.

432
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,860
Choice one:

433
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,420
you die now.

434
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,980
That way,

435
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,690
everyone in the jianghu

436
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,380
will immediately know

437
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,990
the Jiang family of Yanmen

438
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,640
colluded with the remnants
of the Jile Sect

439
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,800
and took evil pills.

440
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,790
Choice two:

441
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,840
I help you suppress the poison,

442
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,000
and you'll die in three months.

443
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,660
Then I'll consider

444
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,170
leaving Yanmen's reputation intact.

445
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,140
What's the condition?

446
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,380
That pipa player in black—

447
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,400
you've seen him, right?

448
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,610
He revealed clues

449
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,440
that led you to Yang Shangqing,

450
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,390
didn't he?

451
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,450
He looks exactly like you.

452
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,770
He killed a lot of people

453
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,560
and saved a lot of people too.

454
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
He's a madman.

455
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,360
Where is he?

456
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,950
He is nowhere

457
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,750
yet everywhere.

458
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,700
You won't find him.

459
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,030
He only appears

460
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,360
when he wants to see you.

461
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,600
Mr. Tang…

462
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,230
help me.

463
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,560
He can't help you.

464
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,230
Because he can barely protect himself.

465
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,070
Report!

466
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,080
Master Jiang,

467
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,030
we've spotted the young master

468
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,360
in the reed marsh ahead.

469
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,270
Foxy Tang!

470
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,470
Foxy Tang, what's going on?

471
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,680
Why is he dead?

472
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,470
Look.

473
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,890
What is that?

474
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,200
This is…

475
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,100
A curse bug.

476
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,680
Oh, no.

477
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,710
The Yanmen Sect

478
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,110
must think we killed him.

479
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,160
Mr. Tang,

480
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,790
we…

481
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,790
Foxy Tang,

482
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,120
Yanmen's goose formation

483
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,850
is quite famous in the jianghu.

484
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,910
Be careful. Don't…

485
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,750
Kill!

486
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,080
I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng.

487
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm willing to go with you for punishment.

488
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,310
I plead guilty

489
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,600
and surrender myself.

490
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
Master Jiang, please temporarily

491
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,510
uphold justice for the Sword Sect.

492
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,370
Are you insane?

493
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,720
What do you mean?

494
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,120
This guy

495
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,020
is my accomplice.

496
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,850
Master,

497
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,290
I've completed

498
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,120
almost

499
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,440
all the tasks you gave me.

500
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,070
Now, you are

501
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,390
the esteemed Master of Fengliu Shop.

502
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,710
Tang Lici is just a nobody

503
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,040
hiding in a ruined temple in Yan County.

504
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,710
You could even

505
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,310
kill Shao Yanping

506
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,510
from the Sword Sect

507
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,370
without breaking a sweat if you wish.

508
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,620
Forgive my ignorance,

509
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,400
but why don't you

510
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,060
just kill Tang Lici outright?

511
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,840
So why go through

512
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
all this trouble?

513
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,220
What's the point

514
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,680
in killing a monster like him?

515
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,400
He can't be killed,

516
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,010
and he has no humanity.

517
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,640
Tang Lici is certainly a monster.

518
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,230
Hua Wuyan, am I right?

519
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,900
Miss Hong.

520
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,989
Master,

521
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,989
you can't let him

522
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,420
die so easily.

523
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,070
If I can kill him once,

524
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,730
I can kill him a second time.

525
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,850
Hong,

526
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,670
tell me—

527
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,469
how should I kill him this time?

528
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,969
Naturally,

529
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,440
you should make him feel what you felt,

530
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,940
suffer what you suffered,

531
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,250
ensure he's condemned by all,

532
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,580
and completely ruin his name.

533
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,330
In the end,

534
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,630
let him die miserably

535
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,840
amid the curses of thousands.

536
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,690
Someone help!

537
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,630
I'm not his accomplice!

538
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,990
I'm just a passerby!

539
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,070
Let me out!

540
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,220
I'm innocent, I swear!

541
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,440
Look at the Yanmen Sect.

542
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,890
People are in cages

543
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,320
while birds are outside.

544
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,190
It's truly a sect

545
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,650
with no respect for rules.

546
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,650
This really has

547
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,960
opened my eyes.

548
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,470
Chi Yun,

549
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,720
be quiet.

550
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,840
What?

551
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,050
You have a plan?

552
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,590
My ears hurt.

553
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,110
You…

554
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,030
Following you

555
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,960
has brought me the worst luck ever!

556
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
"I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng."

557
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,990
Are you insane?

558
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,190
If you wanted to come in here,

559
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,550
you could've come alone.

560
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,010
Why did you bring me along?

561
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,930
I was afraid of being bored alone.

562
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,670
Why are you still carrying that thing?

563
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,870
This is his curse bug.

564
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,030
Your mortal enemy?

565
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,070
Besides him,

566
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,630
who else could have

567
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,090
used something like this?

568
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,360
Even if that's true,

569
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,400
you can't be at the end of your rope.

570
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,160
Why don't you think about

571
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,930
what his plan might be?

572
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,920
To frame you?

573
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,470
He first framed you

574
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,530
for killing Hao Wenhou and his family

575
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,090
and then pinned
Jiang Cheng's murder on you.

576
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,380
That's right.

577
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,600
What's right?

578
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,520
Now, unless the dead come back to life,

579
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,370
no one…

580
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,070
can prove

581
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,400
my innocence.

582
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,530
What are they doing?

583
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,110
That...

584
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,070
Foxy Tang,

585
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,470
they're about to boil us alive.

586
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,030
You're too noisy.

587
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,970
I'm starting
to regret bringing you in here.

588
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,050
Stop carving that wood!

589
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,920
Think of something!

590
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,530
They'll cook you in a bit

591
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,990
and eat you in 18 ways.

592
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,700
Neither of us will escape.

593
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,860
Think of something?

594
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,390
Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

595
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,150
Then you...

596
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,320
Because I never planned

597
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,380
to get out on my own.

598
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,000
Tang Lici,

599
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,260
you're insane, aren't you?

600
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,470
You truly are insane! I'm certain now.

601
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,800
You are insane!

602
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,630
You…

603
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,890
Mr. Jiang, please believe me.

604
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,920
I swear on my honor as a disciple

605
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,850
of the Sword Sect

606
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,670
that I'm telling the truth.

607
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,320
Enough!

608
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,630
Miss Zhong,

609
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,110
what you're saying is

610
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,910
simply too shocking to believe.

611
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,160
Cheng…

612
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,110
he was my elder brother's

613
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,150
only son.

614
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,670
I practically

615
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,800
watched him grow up.

616
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,260
I know his character well.

617
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,760
How could he possibly

618
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,620
have taken that kind of evil pill?

619
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,250
The evil pills have begun to spread again.

620
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,550
Mr. Tang was

621
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,280
actually helping him

622
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,480
suppress the poison.

623
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,520
Miss Shei can testify to this.

624
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,110
Yes.

625
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,310
Are you done talking?

626
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,420
I know,

627
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,910
Master Jiang,

628
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,760
after losing your son,

629
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,320
you're very…

630
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,650
Have you ever lost a son?

631
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
Then what do you know?

632
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,990
You know nothing!

633
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,750
Brother.

634
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,070
Brother.

635
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,870
Master Jiang.

636
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,910
Master Jiang!

637
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,830
Master Jiang.

638
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,000
There must be a reason

639
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,640
why Jiang Cheng took the pills.

640
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,020
It's up to you
to uncover the truth

641
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,110
and clear his name.

642
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,720
If you let grief blind you

643
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
to the truth and evidence,

644
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
aren't you just playing right into

645
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,360
the real killer's hands?

646
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,960
I saw with my own eyes

647
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,330
Cheng's body explode

648
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,550
in front of Tang Lici.

649
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,330
Tang Lici has admitted it herself!

650
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,630
What more proof

651
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,720
do you need?

652
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,800
Today, I'll make sure

653
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,190
that the murderer Tang Lici

654
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,760
will suffer Yanmen's

655
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,820
Three Cuts and Six Stabs Punishment.

656
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,840
If it turns out later that I killed

657
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,760
the wrong man,

658
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll take my own life

659
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,840
to atone for it.

660
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,330
Light the fire!

661
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,630
If they

662
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,280
really put me on that burning stake,

663
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,720
I'll fight my way out of here.

664
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,630
Chi Yun,

665
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,250
a lot of times,

666
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,780
only when you hit rock bottom

667
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,440
does a way out finally appear.

668
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,690
What's happening?

669
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,700
Such a nice fragrance.

670
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,440
The scent of magnolia.

671
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,630
No,

672
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,510
not flowers.

673
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,500
It's sword energy.

674
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,660
Only one person
has this kind of sword energy.

675
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,880
Who?

676
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,630
The one

677
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,180
who vanished long ago—

678
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,920
the Westwind Swordsman,

679
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,730
Feng Chuanxiang.

680
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,850
Mr. Feng?

681
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,190
I heard

682
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,190
you'd gone missing,

683
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,450
and I found it strange.

684
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,570
With such exceptional skills,

685
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,360
how could you

686
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,490
have just vanished?

687
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,720
I did encounter some problems.

688
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,320
Are you here today

689
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,470
to see Cheng?

690
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,450
Cheng has been killed.

691
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,850
I know.

692
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,550
Then why did you

693
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,750
extinguish the fire?

694
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,360
I was going to

695
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
make the murderer

696
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,390
suffer the Three Cuts
and Six Stabs Punishment

697
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,670
before burning him to ashes

698
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,760
to honor Cheng's spirit in heaven.

699
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,670
Understand?

700
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,150
I can say with certainty,

701
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,990
Master Jiang,

702
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,110
that Cheng's death
is part of

703
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,440
something much bigger.

704
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,940
Cheng and I were close friends.

705
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,200
I'd never
deceive you

706
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,730
about something like this.

707
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,170
You know something?

708
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,840
There is indeed something off.

709
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
If you're willing

710
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
to trust me,

711
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,520
would you allow me

712
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,880
to investigate it?

713
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,840
Brother,

714
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,610
isn't that Cheng's…

715
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,770
Master Jiang,

716
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,040
do you believe me now?

717
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,200
What do you want?

718
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,360
I want…

719
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,430
Mr. Tang.

720
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,360
I need

721
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,990
to think it over carefully.
