[Episode 11]

3
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,950
I admire your ambition.

4
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,630
That is why tomorrow,

5
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,050
you will kill for me.

6
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,039
Master,

7
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,160
who do you want me to kill?

8
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,970
Everyone.

9
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,100
Wuhu Fortress.

10
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,310
Renwu Sect.

11
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
Golden Leopard Gang?

12
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,160
Miss Shei,

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,790
why don't you take a rest first?

14
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,510
You may go now.

15
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,960
Let's go.

16
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,500
Oh no!

17
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,500
The ledger!

18
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
Miss Shei, be careful!

19
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,150
Sister!

20
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,410
Be careful!

21
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,330
Pull her back!

22
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,200
Watch out!

23
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,590
Fire! Help!

24
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,290
Who are you?

25
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Bafeng Flame Scripture?

26
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,700
Don't run!

27
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,360
Want to leave?

28
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,720
Did you ask me first?

29
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,310
Miss Shei!

30
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,630
Step back.Grab your sister!

31
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,400
Be careful, Sister!

32
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,829
Help!

33
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:17,630
Fire!

34
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,630
Help!

35
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,630
Mr. Sen!

36
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,560
Sen!

37
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,530
Hurry up!

38
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,680
Fire!

39
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,540
There's a fire!

40
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,270
Hurry!

41
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,070
Help!

42
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,600
Over there!

43
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,670
Hurry!

44
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,430
You demon from Fengliu Shop,

45
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,310
put Shei down!

46
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,180
As expected of Cloud.

47
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,430
It's a pity that...

48
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Bai Suche?

49
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,550
Stop chasing!

50
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Unless you can get past me first.

51
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,930
You're not Yu Qifeng's concubine.

52
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,580
You're from Fengliu Shop!

53
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,920
So what?

54
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,270
How could you do this?

55
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,720
Was the Bai family's massacre a year ago

56
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
orchestrated

57
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,600
by Fengliu Shop?

58
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,880
Are you alright?

59
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,780
I...

60
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,470
You knew I was your enemy,

61
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,840
yet you still held back.

62
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,750
The fact that you're still alive

63
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,870
is pure luck.

64
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,790
As long as you step aside,

65
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,680
I'll pretend

66
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
this never happened.

67
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,430
Besides,

68
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,000
I just don't want to lose my wife

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,560
at such a young age.

70
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,820
Who said I'm your wife?

71
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,510
Mr. Chi,

72
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,600
look carefully.

73
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,950
Bai Suche,
the "Moonlight Garment" back then,

74
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,800
is already dead.

75
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,750
The person standing before you

76
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,550
is just the Master's attendant.

77
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,750
For the sake of the time

78
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,880
you saved my father,

79
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
this is my final warning to you.

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,000
If you dare stand in Fengliu Shop's way,

81
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,680
I'll make sure

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,409
you die without a burial place.

83
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,240
You know better than I do

84
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,700
what kind of man Liu Yan is.

85
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,830
Did you join Fengliu Shop

86
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,830
to seek revenge?

87
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,870
Who are you

88
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,040
to speak the Master's name?

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,550
In the battle of Sword King City,

90
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,260
Tang Lici is doomed to die.

91
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,760
What did you say?

92
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,250
If you want to live,

93
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,310
get lost now.

94
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,700
Otherwise, you'll be the next

95
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,680
to die.

96
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,000
Bai Suche!

97
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,190
Why did you leave before finishing

98
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,390
what you were saying?

99
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,550
What scheme is Liu Yan plotting?

100
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,950
Tell me, Bai Suche!

101
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,510
Bai Suche!

102
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,830
Bai Suche!

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
No wonder I searched for her for so long

104
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
with no trace.

105
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,120
So she's been hiding
in Fengliu Shop all along.

106
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,150
Foxy Tang, you're so clever.

107
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,150
Help me analyze—

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,480
why did she join

109
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,280
Fengliu Shop?

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
And there's Shei.

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,750
What exactly are those demons

112
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,350
in Fengliu Shop up to anyway?

113
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,320
How was it?

114
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,320
Did you find her?

115
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,580
There's only one place

116
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,250
where Shei could be hidden.

117
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,750
After fighting with Chi Yun, Bai Suche

118
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,880
never returned to Sword King Mansion.

119
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,700
It seems, just as she said,

120
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,050
Yu Qifeng is planning something big.

121
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
You go over there.

122
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,600
Okay.

123
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,390
There's no one in the guest quarters.

124
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
Could it be that those sect leaders,

125
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,840
knowing they were exposed yesterday,

126
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,370
fled with their disciples?

127
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,750
How are we going to investigate then?

128
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,150
Perhaps that's the case.

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,510
Wait.

130
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,870
Yu Qifeng wouldn't

131
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,730
let them leave at a time like this.

132
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,120
Could they have been...

133
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Zhong, don't panic.

134
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Perhaps
there's still someone in this house.

135
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,850
Let's keep looking.

136
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,310
Now Shei was taken away,

137
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,040
the ledger was burned,

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,080
and Bai Suche said

139
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
you would die in Sword King City.

140
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,540
Fengliu Shop
must be planning something big.

141
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,150
Foxy Tang,

142
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,350
what should we do now?

143
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,860
Say something.

144
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,780
You want to go rescue Shei?

145
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,720
No matter what he's planning,

146
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,520
both of us have been waiting

147
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,940
for this moment

148
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,200
since Jinye Temple.

149
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,000
Going alone

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is too dangerous.

151
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go together.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,660
I'll go too.

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm also responsible for this.

154
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,790
No need.

155
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,310
This is between him and me.

156
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,370
I don't want anyone to interfere.

157
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,870
You two

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,380
have something else to attend to.

159
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,930
What do we need to do?

160
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,990
Last night at the Qiongtai Banquet,

161
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,150
Liu Yan took advantage of me
being off guard

162
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,680
to attack Wanqiao Chamber.

163
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,790
He let Shen go

164
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,550
just to

165
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,950
reveal his hiding place.

166
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,680
Yu Qifeng is now in a dead end.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,580
He hates me to the bone.

168
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,310
To defeat me,

169
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,270
he will certainly use any means necessary.

170
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,360
And Liu Yan

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,030
will definitely do something for him.

172
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,160
I'll leave Yu Qifeng

173
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,260
to you two.

174
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,490
Leave him to me.

175
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,000
I absolutely won't

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,590
let that old bastard Yu Qifeng

177
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,650
cause any trouble.

178
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,350
This is the last room.

179
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,610
Where is everyone?

180
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,790
Oh no.

181
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,830
Yu Qifeng will definitely
kill them to silence them.

182
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,890
Let's follow them.

183
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,790
Stop!

184
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:58,960
Zhong,

185
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,740
watch out!

186
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,120
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,580
are you alright?

188
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,170
Commander Yu,

189
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,050
don't put on a fake act.

190
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
You just intervened

191
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,670
to help them escape, didn't you?

192
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,400
How dare you!

193
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,940
Who were those people just now?

194
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,630
Everyone,

195
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,750
we discovered that

196
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,720
the disciples from various sects
in the west wing

197
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,670
were all taken away,

198
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,930
so we chased them here.

199
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,550
Suddenly losing track of them

200
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,120
naturally put us in a bad mood.

201
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,980
Please forgive us, Commander Yu.

202
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,740
Ms. Zhong,

203
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,000
from what you just said,

204
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,670
do you think those villains are connected

205
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,860
to Sword King City?

206
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,650
Whether they are or not,

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,080
we'll know soon.

208
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,870
Mr. Yu,

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,030
those villains couldn't have gone far.

210
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,320
Let's investigate ahead together.

211
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
We might find something.

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,080
Very well.

213
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
The city's security

214
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,250
is also my responsibility.

215
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,450
Sword King,

216
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,550
the Blood Ghost Pill

217
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,120
has been discovered by Tang Lici.

218
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,580
And Puzhu probably has...

219
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,870
Sword King City

220
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,390
might not be safe for us anymore.

221
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,960
Yes.

222
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,920
This is the Master's reward

223
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,420
for everyone—

224
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,240
the newly made divine pills,

225
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
even better than before.

226
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,120
Today,

227
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,800
let's have the divine pills together.

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,170
Here.

229
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,240
Here.

230
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,150
Here.

231
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,060
Is this the power of the divine pill?

232
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,080
My strength

233
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,540
keeps flowing endlessly.

234
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,550
My strength keeps flowing endlessly too.

235
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,150
Mine too.

236
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,080
Sword King,

237
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
the Blood Ghost Pill

238
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,120
has already been intercepted by Tang Lici.

239
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,050
Puzhu will eventually report this

240
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,720
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

241
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
So what?

242
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,240
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

243
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,300
has long been wary of Sword King City.

244
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,790
I've had enough

245
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,520
of those incompetent cowards.

246
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,960
And Fengliu Shop is now
at the height of its power.

247
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,480
If we

248
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
can eliminate Tang Lici,

249
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,750
we'll be doing Fengliu Shop a great favor.

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,440
One day when power shifts in jianghu

251
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,960
and Fengliu Shop
replaces the Sword Alliance,

252
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,550
I won't be

253
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,480
the only Sword King.

254
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,150
You,

255
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,880
you'll be Sword King Shi.

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
You'll be Sword King Li.

257
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,880
Each one of you

258
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,210
will be a Sword King!

259
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,410
-Sword King Zhao!
Sword King!

260
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,370
Sword King Zhou.

261
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,810
Sword King, since you said so,

262
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,750
I'm willing to give my life

263
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
to serve you!

264
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,480
We are willing to serve you!

265
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,390
We're willing

266
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630
to die for you

267
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,960
without hesitation!

268
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,320
What's going on?

269
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,200
Let's go take a closer look.

270
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,030
Sword King,

271
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,150
what are you doing?

272
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm not breaking my promise to you.

273
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,610
I'm letting you all become a part of me.

274
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,200
After today,

275
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,940
you'll all be Sword Kings!

276
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,440
It serves you right.

277
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,840
More!

278
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
More!

279
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,240
More! More!

280
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,840
Not enough!

281
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,790
Not enough!

282
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,589
Pale,

283
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
fragile,

284
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,550
and such beautiful legs.

285
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,680
With a slight twist, they'd snap.

286
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,430
Aren't you scared?

287
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:20,589
Of course I am.

288
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,650
Then why aren't you screaming,

289
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,720
hoping Mr. Tang will come save you?

290
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Help!

291
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
Help!

292
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,880
Save me!

293
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Shouldn't that be what you do?

294
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,560
Mr. Tang

295
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,060
won't come.

296
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,070
He won't?

297
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,350
Mr. Tang cares deeply for you,

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,860
with such passionate affection.

299
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,070
How would he not come?

300
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,790
He...

301
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,400
won't come for me.

302
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,550
Even if he comes,

303
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,230
it'll be for Liu Yan,

304
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,270
not to save me.

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,310
Well,

306
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,210
does that mean I can kill you

307
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,970
right now?

308
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,950
Master said

309
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,110
someone like Tang Lici

310
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,110
would never

311
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,550
keep unimportant people

312
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,750
by his side every day.

313
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,880
I guess...

314
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,590
he must be deeply in love with you.

315
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,260
You just don't dare to believe it.

316
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,200
Whether you believe it or not,

317
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,720
to Mr. Tang.

318
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,000
I am insignificant.

319
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,670
Whether you're important or not,

320
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,200
we'll see.

321
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,810
I like your legs.

322
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,480
Why don't you...

323
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
give them to me?

324
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,750
Shei.

325
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,430
Shei!

326
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,790
Miss, you are so beautiful—

327
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
why do you need someone else's legs?

328
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,400
Mr. Tang, you care for this beauty

329
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,400
and are so devoted

330
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,750
that you came to save her.

331
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
You should be glad

332
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,680
you didn't truly act just now.

333
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,750
So you do care about that lady.

334
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,880
Do I?

335
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,520
You're wrong.

336
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,720
She means...

337
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
nothing to me.

338
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,010
You say one thing but mean another.

339
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,270
Then listen

340
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
to the piece

341
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I prepared especially for you.

342
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,490
The Six Paths of Descent...

343
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,530
and Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance!

344
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,310
Combined

345
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,040
with my Mist Flower Pollen,

346
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,920
this move will trap a person

347
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,580
in their deepest inner demon.

348
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,690
If one stays in it for too long,

349
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,140
they will sink into the depths
of their obsession

350
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,830
and never be able to wake up.

351
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,200
Tang Lici,

352
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,110
what is your inner demon?

353
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,710
What is the sin you're hiding?

354
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,310
What is your sin?

355
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,490
The great cause remains unfinished.

356
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,210
How dare you sleep?

357
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,480
Tang Lici,

358
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,400
you were born

359
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,400
to kill.

360
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,290
This is your purpose.

361
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,770
Why did you kill us?

362
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,000
Why?

363
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,110
Why?

364
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
Their sacrifice

365
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,830
was to make you perfect.

366
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,790
And your perfection

367
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,590
is meant to allow more people

368
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,920
to survive.

369
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,790
This is your destiny.

370
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,590
You all defied destiny.

371
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,590
You're nothing but a monster!

372
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,920
Who are you to abandon us?

373
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,920
No! I don't want this!

374
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,110
If I really am him,

375
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,880
will they fear me?

376
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,890
I can't drag them down with me.

377
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,410
Come take a look!

378
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
Oiled paper umbrellas! Take a look!

379
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,360
Oiled paper umbrellas!

380
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,880
Lici!

381
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,960
Lici, stop.

382
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,280
Seven years have passed,

383
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,040
and you still want to leave?

384
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,810
I don't belong here.

385
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm different from you guys.

386
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,680
Enough.

387
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,170
Don't be trapped by your past.

388
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,160
A place you have forgotten
is not your home.

389
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,490
We all see you as family.

390
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,160
Come back to Zhoudi Tower with me

391
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,820
and continue your life there.

392
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,070
Jile Sect?

393
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,790
They are Yique Yinyang's subordinates,

394
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,990
a group that knows nothing but killing.

395
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,510
See?

396
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,680
Everyone fears people

397
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,880
-who know nothing but killing.
-Lici!

398
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,740
Hide behind me!

399
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,890
Take a good look.

400
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,350
How are you any different from them?

401
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,480
If they ever find out

402
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,610
you're the same kind of person as them,

403
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
they will surely fear you,

404
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,070
stay away from you,

405
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,200
and even...

406
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,200
kill you.

407
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,070
Fang Zhou,

408
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,790
the wound Chief left on your heart crystal

409
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,310
is acting up, isn't it?

410
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,130
No one will come to save you.

411
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
If my death

412
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,440
can save everyone,

413
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,790
then why not?

414
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,920
One life...

415
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,790
for all lives?

416
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,130
I did lie to you,

417
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,200
but if your sacrifice

418
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,880
can make everyone survive,

419
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,210
isn't that a good thing?

420
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,440
But I don't want to die!

421
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,400
If it weren't to save everyone,

422
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,800
you wouldn't have been born
in the first place.

423
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,400
Lici,

424
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,340
go now!

425
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,370
Go!

426
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
I need to save him.

427
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
The golden eyes and forehead mark?

428
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,750
The Chief is back!

429
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,680
-Chief.
-Chief.

430
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,400
This is...

431
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,920
your true power.

432
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,590
This is...

433
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,350
your true nature.

434
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,030
Lici.

435
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,920
You...

436
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,160
Mr. Tang?

437
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,510
Mr. Tang?

438
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,440
He's trapped in his inner demon.

439
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,150
You can't wake him up.

440
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,030
Dying in his inner demons

441
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,570
is better than losing everything
bit by bit.

442
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,030
Chi Yun,

443
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,880
Shen Langhun,

444
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,720
Zhong Chunji,

445
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,480
Gu Xitan,

446
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
and Miss Shei

447
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
in your arms—

448
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,550
all your friends

449
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,050
will soon die with you.

450
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,180
My...

451
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,030
final mercy to you...

452
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
is...

453
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,070
No.

454
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
I need to save him.

455
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,960
Lici,

456
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,640
who are you?

457
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,350
He found your identity.

458
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,210
He found your identity.

459
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,030
No! I don't want to!

460
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,720
No! I don't want to!

461
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,340
you saw me get injured

462
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,960
and you saw it heal
right before your eyes.

463
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
I just think

464
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,350
everyone

465
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,510
might have secrets

466
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,160
they don't want others to know.

467
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,240
I only know

468
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,360
that even if wounds heal,

469
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,890
they still hurt.

470
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,120
Mr. Tang,

471
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
wake up.

472
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,280
The Seven‑String True Tune.

473
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,900
The Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

474
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,690
Trying to control me with my inner demon?

475
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,680
When did Liu Yan become so naive?

476
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,960
Didn't he tell you

477
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,200
that in his eyes, Tang Lici

478
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,690
is a ruthless, heartless demon

479
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,960
with no feelings?

480
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,510
How can a demon have inner demons?

481
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,960
Mr. Tang,

482
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,440
are you alright?

483
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,070
I'm fine.

484
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,639
Let me take you back.

485
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,010
No need.

486
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,630
But you're injured.

487
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,030
Shei, listen to me.

488
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,020
Chi Yun still needs me there.

489
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,840
Go back to Wanqiao Chamber
and wait for my news.

490
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
What is that

491
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,760
black crystal?

492
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,320
Yu Qifeng

493
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,780
is absorbing their power.

494
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,160
We need to stop him now.

495
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,400
Are you okay?

496
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,800
I won't die.

497
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,360
Black Tuli?

498
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,480
I saw it once in Dieban Chonghua's

499
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
collection room.

500
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,070
Legend has it that Yique Yinyang

501
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,800
was unbeatable

502
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,060
because of that thing.

503
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,630
Unorthodox.

504
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
I don't buy that crap.

505
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,060
Let's fight him first!

506
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,060
You know quite a lot.

507
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,630
Come on!

508
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,360
Impervious to weapons?

509
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,000
Shen,

510
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,590
why don't we use spells like Foxy Tang?

511
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,320
You know how?

512
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,610
I heard him use one once.

513
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What was it again?

514
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,440
How did his power

515
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
become so strong?

516
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,880
Let's kill him quickly!

517
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,810
Let's go all out!

518
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,360
You two have been fighting me

519
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,230
for so long,

520
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,270
yet your master hasn't shown up.

521
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,070
The Number one assassin?

522
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,580
The overlord of the underworld?

523
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,540
You're just his dogs.

524
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,590
I don't have time to waste on you anymore.

525
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,320
Go to hell

526
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,880
and meet Tang Lici!

527
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,000
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

528
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,850
Invincible!

529
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,670
Snake Fang!

530
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Soul Breaker!

531
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,210
How dare a firefly
compete with the bright moon?

532
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,840
My nickname is Cloud.

533
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,480
You're the firefly!

534
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,880
You're asking for death!

535
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,760
Tang Lici?

536
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,070
Yu Qifeng,

537
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,960
were you waiting for me?

538
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,150
Tang Lici,

539
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,790
I will repay the humiliation
you've caused me

540
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,500
a hundredfold.

541
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,240
Master.

542
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,310
Tang Lici is fighting the Sword King.

543
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,710
We need to set off some fireworks

544
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,920
to liven things up.

545
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,910
The Tianyan Sword Wall?

546
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,090
Isn't Liu Yan here?

547
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,650
The Tianyan Sword Wall is collapsing?

548
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,990
Tang Lici!

549
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,880
This is Liu Yan's doing.

550
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,090
The mountain wall collapsing

551
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,000
will surely kill

552
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,360
many people at the foot of the mountain.

553
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,840
Shen,

554
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,840
go to Wanqiao Chamber and find Shei.

555
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,110
She knows who to seek.

556
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,110
Chi Yun.

557
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,220
I'll stay here!

558
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,000
Yu has absorbed a lot of people's power.

559
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,900
He's not easy to deal with.

560
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,340
No.

561
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,320
Go meet Zhong Chunji

562
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,360
and Gu Xitan

563
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,640
to evacuate the civilians.

564
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,290
This is my wager with Puzhu.

565
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,860
Help me hold it.

566
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,920
Okay.

567
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,210
Be careful.

568
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,150
It's just us now.

569
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,400
Tang Lici,

570
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,590
to defeat you,

571
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,030
Master

572
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,320
gave me a gift!

573
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,110
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual!

574
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,670
Puzhu forbade me to kill you.

575
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,550
If he knew

576
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,190
you've killed so many people,

577
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,550
he might regret

578
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,550
having shown you mercy.

579
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,020
What is that?

580
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,550
Chi Yun!

581
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,070
Chi!

582
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,480
What happened to the Tianyan Sword Wall?

583
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Where is Mr. Tang?

584
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,920
He's up there dueling with Yu Qifeng.

585
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,880
They caused the mountain to collapse!

586
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,810
Save the people!

587
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,660
Be careful!

588
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,670
Master?

589
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,320
Everyone, listen!

590
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,780
Follow me up the mountain!

591
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,690
Commander Yu!

592
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,360
If you leave,

593
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,620
what about the people of Sword King City?

594
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,110
Hurry!

595
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,190
Quickly!

596
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,480
It's dangerous here!

597
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,730
Disciples of Sword King City!

598
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,030
Follow me to evacuate the civilians!

599
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,550
Yes!

600
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,410
Such an explosion...

601
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,150
If it's really Mr. Tang...

602
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,760
Foxy Tang,

603
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,150
please be safe.
