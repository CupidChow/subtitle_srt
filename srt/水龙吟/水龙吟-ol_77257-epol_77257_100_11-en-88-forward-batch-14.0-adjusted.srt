[Episode 11]

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,950
I admire your ambition.

4
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,630
That is why tomorrow,

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,050
you will kill for me.

6
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,039
Master,

7
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,160
who do you want me to kill?

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,970
Everyone.

9
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,100
Wuhu Fortress.

10
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,310
Renwu Sect.

11
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,280
Golden Leopard Gang?

12
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,160
Miss Shei,

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,790
why don't you take a rest first?

14
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,510
You may go now.

15
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,960
Let's go.

16
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,500
Oh no!

17
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,500
The ledger!

18
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Miss Shei, be careful!

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,150
Sister!

20
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,410
Be careful!

21
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,330
Pull her back!

22
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Watch out!

23
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,590
Fire! Help!

24
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,290
Who are you?

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Bafeng Flame Scripture?

26
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,700
Don't run!

27
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,360
Want to leave?

28
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,720
Did you ask me first?

29
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,310
Miss Shei!

30
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,630
Step back.Grab your sister!

31
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,400
Be careful, Sister!

32
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,829
Help!

33
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:34,630
Fire!

34
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,630
Help!

35
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,630
Mr. Sen!

36
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,560
Sen!

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,530
Hurry up!

38
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,680
Fire!

39
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,540
There's a fire!

40
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,270
Hurry!

41
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,070
Help!

42
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,600
Over there!

43
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,670
Hurry!

44
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,430
You demon from Fengliu Shop,

45
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,310
put Shei down!

46
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,180
As expected of Cloud.

47
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,430
It's a pity that...

48
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,070
Bai Suche?

49
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,550
Stop chasing!

50
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,480
Unless you can get past me first.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,930
You're not Yu Qifeng's concubine.

52
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,580
You're from Fengliu Shop!

53
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,920
So what?

54
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,270
How could you do this?

55
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,720
Was the Bai family's massacre a year ago

56
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
orchestrated

57
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,600
by Fengliu Shop?

58
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,880
Are you alright?

59
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,780
I...

60
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,470
You knew I was your enemy,

61
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,840
yet you still held back.

62
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,750
The fact that you're still alive

63
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,870
is pure luck.

64
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,790
As long as you step aside,

65
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,680
I'll pretend

66
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,880
this never happened.

67
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,430
Besides,

68
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
I just don't want to lose my wife

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,560
at such a young age.

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,820
Who said I'm your wife?

71
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,510
Mr. Chi,

72
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,600
look carefully.

73
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,950
Bai Suche,
the "Moonlight Garment" back then,

74
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,800
is already dead.

75
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,750
The person standing before you

76
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,550
is just the Master's attendant.

77
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,750
For the sake of the time

78
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,880
you saved my father,

79
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
this is my final warning to you.

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
If you dare stand in Fengliu Shop's way,

81
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll make sure

82
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,409
you die without a burial place.

83
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,240
You know better than I do

84
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,700
what kind of man Liu Yan is.

85
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,830
Did you join Fengliu Shop

86
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,830
to seek revenge?

87
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,870
Who are you

88
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,040
to speak the Master's name?

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,550
In the battle of Sword King City,

90
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,260
Tang Lici is doomed to die.

91
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,760
What did you say?

92
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,250
If you want to live,

93
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,310
get lost now.

94
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,700
Otherwise, you'll be the next

95
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,680
to die.

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,000
Bai Suche!

97
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,190
Why did you leave before finishing

98
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,390
what you were saying?

99
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,550
What scheme is Liu Yan plotting?

100
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,950
Tell me, Bai Suche!

101
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,510
Bai Suche!

102
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,830
Bai Suche!

103
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,320
No wonder I searched for her for so long

104
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,360
with no trace.

105
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,120
So she's been hiding
in Fengliu Shop all along.

106
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,150
Foxy Tang, you're so clever.

107
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,150
Help me analyzeâ€”

108
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,480
why did she join

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,280
Fengliu Shop?

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
And there's Shei.

111
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,750
What exactly are those demons

112
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,350
in Fengliu Shop up to anyway?

113
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,320
How was it?

114
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,320
Did you find her?

115
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,580
There's only one place

116
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,250
where Shei could be hidden.

117
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,750
After fighting with Chi Yun, Bai Suche

118
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,880
never returned to Sword King Mansion.

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,700
It seems, just as she said,

120
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,050
Yu Qifeng is planning something big.

121
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
You go over there.

122
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay.

123
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,390
There's no one in the guest quarters.

124
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,390
Could it be that those sect leaders,

125
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,840
knowing they were exposed yesterday,

126
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,370
fled with their disciples?

127
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,750
How are we going to investigate then?

128
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,150
Perhaps that's the case.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,510
Wait.

130
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,870
Yu Qifeng wouldn't

131
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,730
let them leave at a time like this.

132
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,120
Could they have been...

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Zhong, don't panic.

134
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
Perhaps
there's still someone in this house.

135
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,850
Let's keep looking.

136
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,310
Now Shei was taken away,

137
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,040
the ledger was burned,

138
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,080
and Bai Suche said

139
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,880
you would die in Sword King City.

140
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,540
Fengliu Shop
must be planning something big.

141
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,150
Foxy Tang,

142
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,350
what should we do now?

143
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,860
Say something.

144
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,780
You want to go rescue Shei?

145
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,720
No matter what he's planning,

146
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,520
both of us have been waiting

147
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,940
for this moment

148
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
since Jinye Temple.

149
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,000
Going alone

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is too dangerous.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's go together.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,660
I'll go too.

153
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,810
I'm also responsible for this.

154
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:43,790
No need.

155
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,310
This is between him and me.

156
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,370
I don't want anyone to interfere.

157
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,870
You two

158
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,380
have something else to attend to.

159
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,930
What do we need to do?

160
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,990
Last night at the Qiongtai Banquet,

161
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,150
Liu Yan took advantage of me
being off guard

162
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,680
to attack Wanqiao Chamber.

163
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
He let Shen go

164
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,550
just to

165
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,950
reveal his hiding place.

166
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,680
Yu Qifeng is now in a dead end.

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,580
He hates me to the bone.

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,310
To defeat me,

169
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,270
he will certainly use any means necessary.

170
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,360
And Liu Yan

171
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,030
will definitely do something for him.

172
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,160
I'll leave Yu Qifeng

173
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,260
to you two.

174
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,490
Leave him to me.

175
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,000
I absolutely won't

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,590
let that old bastard Yu Qifeng

177
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,650
cause any trouble.

178
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,350
This is the last room.

179
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,610
Where is everyone?

180
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,790
Oh no.

181
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,830
Yu Qifeng will definitely
kill them to silence them.

182
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,890
Let's follow them.

183
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,790
Stop!

184
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:15,960
Zhong,

185
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,740
watch out!

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,120
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,580
are you alright?

188
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,170
Commander Yu,

189
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,050
don't put on a fake act.

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
You just intervened

191
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,670
to help them escape, didn't you?

192
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,400
How dare you!

193
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,940
Who were those people just now?

194
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,630
Everyone,

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,750
we discovered that

196
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,720
the disciples from various sects
in the west wing

197
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,670
were all taken away,

198
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,930
so we chased them here.

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,550
Suddenly losing track of them

200
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,120
naturally put us in a bad mood.

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,980
Please forgive us, Commander Yu.

202
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,740
Ms. Zhong,

203
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,000
from what you just said,

204
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,670
do you think those villains are connected

205
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,860
to Sword King City?

206
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,650
Whether they are or not,

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,080
we'll know soon.

208
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,870
Mr. Yu,

209
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,030
those villains couldn't have gone far.

210
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,320
Let's investigate ahead together.

211
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
We might find something.

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,080
Very well.

213
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
The city's security

214
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,250
is also my responsibility.

215
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,450
Sword King,

216
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,550
the Blood Ghost Pill

217
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,120
has been discovered by Tang Lici.

218
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,580
And Puzhu probably has...

219
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,870
Sword King City

220
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,390
might not be safe for us anymore.

221
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,960
Yes.

222
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,920
This is the Master's reward

223
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,420
for everyoneâ€”

224
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,240
the newly made divine pills,

225
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
even better than before.

226
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,120
Today,

227
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,800
let's have the divine pills together.

228
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,170
Here.

229
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,240
Here.

230
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,150
Here.

231
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,060
Is this the power of the divine pill?

232
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,080
My strength

233
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,540
keeps flowing endlessly.

234
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,550
My strength keeps flowing endlessly too.

235
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,150
Mine too.

236
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,080
Sword King,

237
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,600
the Blood Ghost Pill

238
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
has already been intercepted by Tang Lici.

239
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,050
Puzhu will eventually report this

240
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,720
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

241
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
So what?

242
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,240
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

243
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,300
has long been wary of Sword King City.

244
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,790
I've had enough

245
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,520
of those incompetent cowards.

246
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,960
And Fengliu Shop is now
at the height of its power.

247
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,480
If we

248
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,880
can eliminate Tang Lici,

249
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,750
we'll be doing Fengliu Shop a great favor.

250
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,440
One day when power shifts in jianghu

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,960
and Fengliu Shop
replaces the Sword Alliance,

252
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,550
I won't be

253
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,480
the only Sword King.

254
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,150
You,

255
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,880
you'll be Sword King Shi.

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
You'll be Sword King Li.

257
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,880
Each one of you

258
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,210
will be a Sword King!

259
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,410
-Sword King Zhao!
Sword King!

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,370
Sword King Zhou.

261
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,810
Sword King, since you said so,

262
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm willing to give my life

263
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
to serve you!

264
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,480
We are willing to serve you!

265
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,390
We're willing

266
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,630
to die for you

267
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,960
without hesitation!

268
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,320
What's going on?

269
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,200
Let's go take a closer look.

270
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,030
Sword King,

271
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,150
what are you doing?

272
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm not breaking my promise to you.

273
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,610
I'm letting you all become a part of me.

274
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,200
After today,

275
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,940
you'll all be Sword Kings!

276
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
It serves you right.

277
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,840
More!

278
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,440
More!

279
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,240
More! More!

280
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,840
Not enough!

281
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,790
Not enough!

282
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,589
Pale,

283
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
fragile,

284
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,550
and such beautiful legs.

285
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,680
With a slight twist, they'd snap.

286
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,430
Aren't you scared?

287
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,589
Of course I am.

288
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,650
Then why aren't you screaming,

289
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,720
hoping Mr. Tang will come save you?

290
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Help!

291
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Help!

292
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,880
Save me!

293
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Shouldn't that be what you do?

294
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,560
Mr. Tang

295
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,060
won't come.

296
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,070
He won't?

297
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,350
Mr. Tang cares deeply for you,

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,860
with such passionate affection.

299
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,070
How would he not come?

300
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,790
He...

301
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,400
won't come for me.

302
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,550
Even if he comes,

303
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,230
it'll be for Liu Yan,

304
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,270
not to save me.

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,310
Well,

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,210
does that mean I can kill you

307
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,970
right now?

308
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,950
Master said

309
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,110
someone like Tang Lici

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,110
would never

311
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,550
keep unimportant people

312
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,750
by his side every day.

313
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,880
I guess...

314
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,590
he must be deeply in love with you.

315
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,260
You just don't dare to believe it.

316
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,200
Whether you believe it or not,

317
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,720
to Mr. Tang.

318
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,000
I am insignificant.

319
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,670
Whether you're important or not,

320
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,200
we'll see.

321
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,810
I like your legs.

322
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,480
Why don't you...

323
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,600
give them to me?

324
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,750
Shei.

325
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,430
Shei!

326
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,790
Miss, you are so beautifulâ€”

327
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
why do you need someone else's legs?

328
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Mr. Tang, you care for this beauty

329
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,400
and are so devoted

330
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,750
that you came to save her.

331
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
You should be glad

332
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,680
you didn't truly act just now.

333
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,750
So you do care about that lady.

334
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,880
Do I?

335
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,520
You're wrong.

336
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,720
She means...

337
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
nothing to me.

338
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,010
You say one thing but mean another.

339
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,270
Then listen

340
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,880
to the piece

341
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I prepared especially for you.

342
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,490
The Six Paths of Descent...

343
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,530
and Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance!

344
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,310
Combined

345
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,040
with my Mist Flower Pollen,

346
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,920
this move will trap a person

347
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,580
in their deepest inner demon.

348
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,690
If one stays in it for too long,

349
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,140
they will sink into the depths
of their obsession

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,830
and never be able to wake up.

351
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,200
Tang Lici,

352
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,110
what is your inner demon?

353
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,710
What is the sin you're hiding?

354
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,310
What is your sin?

355
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,490
The great cause remains unfinished.

356
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,210
How dare you sleep?

357
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,480
Tang Lici,

358
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,400
you were born

359
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,400
to kill.

360
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,290
This is your purpose.

361
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,770
Why did you kill us?

362
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Why?

363
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,110
Why?

364
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
Their sacrifice

365
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,830
was to make you perfect.

366
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,790
And your perfection

367
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,590
is meant to allow more people

368
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,920
to survive.

369
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,790
This is your destiny.

370
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,590
You all defied destiny.

371
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,590
You're nothing but a monster!

372
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,920
Who are you to abandon us?

373
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,920
No! I don't want this!

374
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,110
If I really am him,

375
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
will they fear me?

376
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,890
I can't drag them down with me.

377
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,410
Come take a look!

378
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,420
Oiled paper umbrellas! Take a look!

379
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,360
Oiled paper umbrellas!

380
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,880
Lici!

381
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,960
Lici, stop.

382
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
Seven years have passed,

383
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,040
and you still want to leave?

384
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,810
I don't belong here.

385
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm different from you guys.

386
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,680
Enough.

387
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,170
Don't be trapped by your past.

388
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,160
A place you have forgotten
is not your home.

389
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,490
We all see you as family.

390
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
Come back to Zhoudi Tower with me

391
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,820
and continue your life there.

392
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,070
Jile Sect?

393
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,790
They are Yique Yinyang's subordinates,

394
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,990
a group that knows nothing but killing.

395
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,510
See?

396
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,680
Everyone fears people

397
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,880
-who know nothing but killing.
-Lici!

398
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,740
Hide behind me!

399
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,890
Take a good look.

400
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,350
How are you any different from them?

401
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,480
If they ever find out

402
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,610
you're the same kind of person as them,

403
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,960
they will surely fear you,

404
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,070
stay away from you,

405
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,200
and even...

406
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,200
kill you.

407
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,070
Fang Zhou,

408
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,790
the wound Chief left on your heart crystal

409
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,310
is acting up, isn't it?

410
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,130
No one will come to save you.

411
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
If my death

412
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,440
can save everyone,

413
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,790
then why not?

414
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,920
One life...

415
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,790
for all lives?

416
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,130
I did lie to you,

417
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,200
but if your sacrifice

418
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,880
can make everyone survive,

419
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,210
isn't that a good thing?

420
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
But I don't want to die!

421
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,400
If it weren't to save everyone,

422
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,800
you wouldn't have been born
in the first place.

423
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,400
Lici,

424
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,340
go now!

425
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,370
Go!

426
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
I need to save him.

427
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
The golden eyes and forehead mark?

428
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,750
The Chief is back!

429
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,680
-Chief.
-Chief.

430
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,400
This is...

431
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,920
your true power.

432
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,590
This is...

433
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,350
your true nature.

434
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,030
Lici.

435
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,920
You...

436
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,160
Mr. Tang?

437
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,510
Mr. Tang?

438
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,440
He's trapped in his inner demon.

439
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,150
You can't wake him up.

440
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,030
Dying in his inner demons

441
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,570
is better than losing everything
bit by bit.

442
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,030
Chi Yun,

443
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,880
Shen Langhun,

444
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,720
Zhong Chunji,

445
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,480
Gu Xitan,

446
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
and Miss Shei

447
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,680
in your armsâ€”

448
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,550
all your friends

449
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,050
will soon die with you.

450
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,180
My...

451
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,030
final mercy to you...

452
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,480
is...

453
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,070
No.

454
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
I need to save him.

455
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,960
Lici,

456
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,640
who are you?

457
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,350
He found your identity.

458
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,210
He found your identity.

459
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,030
No! I don't want to!

460
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,720
No! I don't want to!

461
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,340
you saw me get injured

462
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,960
and you saw it heal
right before your eyes.

463
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
I just think

464
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,350
everyone

465
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,510
might have secrets

466
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,160
they don't want others to know.

467
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,240
I only know

468
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,360
that even if wounds heal,

469
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,890
they still hurt.

470
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,120
Mr. Tang,

471
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
wake up.

472
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
The Sevenâ€‘String True Tune.

473
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,900
The Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

474
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,690
Trying to control me with my inner demon?

475
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,680
When did Liu Yan become so naive?

476
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,960
Didn't he tell you

477
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,200
that in his eyes, Tang Lici

478
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,690
is a ruthless, heartless demon

479
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,960
with no feelings?

480
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,510
How can a demon have inner demons?

481
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,960
Mr. Tang,

482
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,440
are you alright?

483
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,070
I'm fine.

484
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,639
Let me take you back.

485
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,010
No need.

486
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,630
But you're injured.

487
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,030
Shei, listen to me.

488
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,020
Chi Yun still needs me there.

489
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,840
Go back to Wanqiao Chamber
and wait for my news.

490
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,880
What is that

491
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
black crystal?

492
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,320
Yu Qifeng

493
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,780
is absorbing their power.

494
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,160
We need to stop him now.

495
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,400
Are you okay?

496
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,800
I won't die.

497
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,360
Black Tuli?

498
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,480
I saw it once in Dieban Chonghua's

499
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
collection room.

500
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,070
Legend has it that Yique Yinyang

501
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,800
was unbeatable

502
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,060
because of that thing.

503
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,630
Unorthodox.

504
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,520
I don't buy that crap.

505
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,060
Let's fight him first!

506
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,060
You know quite a lot.

507
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,630
Come on!

508
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,360
Impervious to weapons?

509
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,000
Shen,

510
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,590
why don't we use spells like Foxy Tang?

511
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,320
You know how?

512
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,610
I heard him use one once.

513
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What was it again?

514
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,440
How did his power

515
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
become so strong?

516
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,880
Let's kill him quickly!

517
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,810
Let's go all out!

518
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,360
You two have been fighting me

519
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,230
for so long,

520
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,270
yet your master hasn't shown up.

521
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,070
The Number one assassin?

522
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,580
The overlord of the underworld?

523
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,540
You're just his dogs.

524
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,590
I don't have time to waste on you anymore.

525
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,320
Go to hell

526
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,880
and meet Tang Lici!

527
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,000
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

528
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,850
Invincible!

529
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,670
Snake Fang!

530
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,700
Soul Breaker!

531
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,210
How dare a firefly
compete with the bright moon?

532
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
My nickname is Cloud.

533
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,480
You're the firefly!

534
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,880
You're asking for death!

535
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,760
Tang Lici?

536
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,070
Yu Qifeng,

537
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,960
were you waiting for me?

538
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,150
Tang Lici,

539
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,790
I will repay the humiliation
you've caused me

540
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,500
a hundredfold.

541
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,240
Master.

542
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,310
Tang Lici is fighting the Sword King.

543
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,710
We need to set off some fireworks

544
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,920
to liven things up.

545
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,910
The Tianyan Sword Wall?

546
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,090
Isn't Liu Yan here?

547
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,650
The Tianyan Sword Wall is collapsing?

548
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,990
Tang Lici!

549
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,880
This is Liu Yan's doing.

550
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,090
The mountain wall collapsing

551
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,000
will surely kill

552
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,360
many people at the foot of the mountain.

553
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,840
Shen,

554
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,840
go to Wanqiao Chamber and find Shei.

555
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,110
She knows who to seek.

556
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,110
Chi Yun.

557
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,220
I'll stay here!

558
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,000
Yu has absorbed a lot of people's power.

559
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,900
He's not easy to deal with.

560
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,340
No.

561
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,320
Go meet Zhong Chunji

562
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,360
and Gu Xitan

563
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,640
to evacuate the civilians.

564
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,290
This is my wager with Puzhu.

565
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,860
Help me hold it.

566
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,920
Okay.

567
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,210
Be careful.

568
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,150
It's just us now.

569
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,400
Tang Lici,

570
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,590
to defeat you,

571
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,030
Master

572
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,320
gave me a gift!

573
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,110
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual!

574
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,670
Puzhu forbade me to kill you.

575
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,550
If he knew

576
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,190
you've killed so many people,

577
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,550
he might regret

578
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,550
having shown you mercy.

579
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,020
What is that?

580
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,550
Chi Yun!

581
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,070
Chi!

582
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,480
What happened to the Tianyan Sword Wall?

583
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Where is Mr. Tang?

584
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,920
He's up there dueling with Yu Qifeng.

585
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,880
They caused the mountain to collapse!

586
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,810
Save the people!

587
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,660
Be careful!

588
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,670
Master?

589
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,320
Everyone, listen!

590
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,780
Follow me up the mountain!

591
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:22,690
Commander Yu!

592
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:23,360
If you leave,

593
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,620
what about the people of Sword King City?

594
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,110
Hurry!

595
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,190
Quickly!

596
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,480
It's dangerous here!

597
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,730
Disciples of Sword King City!

598
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,030
Follow me to evacuate the civilians!

599
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:36,550
Yes!

600
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,410
Such an explosion...

601
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,150
If it's really Mr. Tang...

602
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:41,760
Foxy Tang,

603
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,150
please be safe.
