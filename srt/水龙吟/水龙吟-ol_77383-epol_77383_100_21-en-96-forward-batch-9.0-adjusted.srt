Whatever works is a good strategy.

Why would I need

your approval?

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,630
Using money to buy loyalty

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,460
is not a good start.

141
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,710
Without any benefit,

142
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
you expect those disciples

143
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
to risk their lives fighting evil.

144
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Is that fair?

145
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,370
Using profit as bait

146
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,630
will lead to betrayal for profit.

147

The Evil Pill spreads its poison

148
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,770
precisely because of human greed

149
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,700
and delusions of instant success.

150
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,690
Pursuing benefits and avoiding harm

151
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,900
is human nature.

152

Isn't it a bit harsh

153
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,240
to hold ordinary people

154
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
to a sage's standard?

155
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,200
This is what they call,
"With great rewards

157

Eliminating evil completely
is indeed my wish.

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,510
It's so dark here,

174
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,600
making us look like

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,660
we're plotting something sinister.

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,850
Master Puzhu dislikes crowded places.

177
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,360
The deeper one is in darkness,

178
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
the more one craves for light.

179
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,830
With enemies at our doorstep,

180
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,100
if the Sword Alliance
needs anything in the future,

181
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,760
just send someone to inform me.

182
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,380
I will go to Wanhua Hall

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,840
to discuss matters with you.

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,390
Great.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,930
I never expected

186
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,690
Master Puzhu to be

187
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,180
someone who knows how to be flexible.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,490
To raid Fengliu Shop's strongholds,

189
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,620
I'll lead by example

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,250
and go ahead first.

191
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,750
Perfect.

192
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,550
Deputy Lord Yu

193
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,870
has just arrived at the Sword Alliance
with his people.

194
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,870
I'll go with you to see him.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
Master Puzhu,

196
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,450
is it really so unbearable for you

197
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,790
to work alongside me?

198
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,910
I've heard

199
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,920
that the disciples
of the Tianjing Pavilion

200
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,200
must practice meditation and tolerance.

201
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,670
How is it

202
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,040
that you don't need to practice these?

203
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,520
Farewell. Farewell.

204
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,570
I wish you good luck on your journey.

205
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,020
If Master Cheng

206
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,600
also wants to talk about

207
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,190
approval

208
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,410
or other clichés,

209
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,750
I already know it.

210
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,000
Perhaps you do have the skills

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,870
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

212
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,390
But with your personality,

213
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,790
you can't inherit
the Seven‑String True Tune

214
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,790
of Fang Zhou.

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Fang Zhou

216
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,610
was a man of integrity,

217
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,120
but in the end,

218
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
apart from people's respect,

219
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,410
what else did he get?

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Asking such a question shows

221
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,250
you don't understand
Fang Zhou well enough.

222
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,400
I don't want to be Fang Zhou.

223
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,290
You can't be him either.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
You're suspected of being Yique Yinyang.

225
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,790
Though after the battle at Biluo Palace,

226
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,690
this suspicion was temporarily dispelled,

227
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,620
but with your methods and actions,

228
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,030
no one can guarantee

229
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,750
that you won't become the next

230
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,750
Yique Yinyang.

231
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,080
You are a threat

232
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,770
to the Sword Alliance.

233
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,270
Tang Lici.

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,560
I'll be watching you.

235
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,970
You asked me before

236
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,000
if I've ever killed the wrong person
with my sword.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,860
Perhaps I have,

238
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
but I have no regrets.

239
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,370
For all my mistakes,

240
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,390
I will atone in hell.

241
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,410
Why are you laughing?

242
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,630
Master Cheng, your words

243
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,870
sound so resolute.

244
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:13,870
Have you

245
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,930
moved yourself with your own speech?

246
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,920
However,

247
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,560
your desire to atone is one-sided.

248
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,250
Have you considered

249
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,160
whether those souls in hell

250
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,870
are willing to give you

251
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,270
a chance for redemption?

252
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,360
Mr. Tang.

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,330
Master Shao, you haven't slept all night.

254
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,690
The turmoil in the jianghu hasn't settled,

255
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,620
making it impossible to rest easy.

256
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
Forgive my boldness,

257
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,490
are you and the owner of the Fengliu Shop
Liu Yan

258
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,210
disciples of the same master?

259
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,780
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

260
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
was our senior.

261
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,150
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

262
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,410
was a man of principle.

263
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,570
My master Jiangnan Feng and he

264
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,010
once fought fiercely at Tiandu Peak,

265
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,510
together resisting
Yique Yinyang's rebellion.

266
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,970
Mr. Tang,
since you've inherited his legacy

267
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,660
and are willing to join us,

268
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,760
you must also have the desire
to help the world.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
But my purpose

270
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
has never been peace in the jianghu.

271
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,720
That's not contradictory.

272
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,790
Didn't you once tell

273
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,080
Master Puzhu

274
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,790
that even those with different paths
can work together?

275
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,720
As long as our current goals align,

276
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,480
why not journey together for a while?

277
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,150
Rest assured,
since we're traveling together,

278
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,120
I will handle

279
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,310
all Sword Alliance matters properly.

280
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,240
However,

281
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,150
my methods in the future

282
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,550
may be even more unacceptable
to ordinary people.

283
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,080
You

284
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,940
might not have peace and quiet
for some time.

285
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,280
Everyone,

286
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,630
don't be hasty!

287
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,320
Let's talk things through slowly!

288
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Tang Lici!

289
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,280
Take it easy. Calm down.

290
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,060
Let's talk this through.

291
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,970
Sword Masters.

292
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,510
What's the matter?

293
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,800
You've made a mistake in this decree.

294
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,190
I'm in charge of the Service Hall,

295
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,720
not the Investigation Hall.

296
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,450
And mine too.

297
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,170
If you transfer me elsewhere,

298
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,230
what will happen to my cases
at the Investigation Hall?

299
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,950
Whatever you have received

300
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,000
is what you should follow.

301
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,510
You don't understand the Sword Alliance,

302
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,000
so please stop messing things up.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,910
If you turn

304
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,750
the Sword Alliance into chaos

305
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,790
and then just walk away,

306
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,250
what are we supposed to do?

307
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,080
Mr. Tang,

308
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,640
even though you were

309
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,120
invited by
our Ancestor's divine revelation,

310
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,320
you still

311
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,520
can't be so arbitrary

312
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,790
and autocratic.

313
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,920
Master Jiang,

314
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,870
during your supervision of disciples,

315
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,440
their efficiency was poor,

316
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,790
and complaints were widespread.

317
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,920
The reason for this,

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
in my opinion,

319
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,620
is that you prioritized
personal relationships

320
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,080
and lacked decisiveness.

321
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
Master Shangguan,

322
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
you were responsible
for the Sword Alliance's finances,

323
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,290
yet for all these years,

324
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,580
the Sword Alliance
has been operating at a loss,

325
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
due to your poor management skills.

326
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,360
Master Pu,

327
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,320
as for your Investigation Hall,

328
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,080
30 cold cases in the jianghu

329
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,980
show absolutely no progress in a year.

330
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,030
The Sword Alliance's reputation

331
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,430
has greatly diminished.

332
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,650
It's because you

333
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,170
failed to investigate even minor issues.

334
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,980
That's just empty talk.

335
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,790
The Sword Alliance's dossiers
for the past decade

336
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,520
are all here.

337
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,870
Every word I've said

338
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,390
is backed by evidence.

339
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,910
He's gone through 10 years of records?

340
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,510
Doesn't this man ever sleep?

341
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,920
I know.

342
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,130
You've all done your best.

343
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,840
However,

344
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,320
some matters,

345
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,310
like opposing the Fengliu Shop,

346
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,790
aren't just about effort

347
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,550
or determination to succeed.

348
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,550
Let's try this arrangement
for half a month.

349
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,550
Whether it works or is appropriate

350
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,910
will become clear

351
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,720
after that time.

352
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,970
What if your arrangement
proves even worse?

353
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I will step down

354
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,310
and leave the Sword Alliance.

355
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,569
That's not necessary.

356
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,800
Really not necessary.

357
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,160
You said it yourself.

358
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,060
Well then,

359
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,069
let's follow Mr. Tang's arrangement

360
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,730
and give it a try.

361
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,990
It's only half a month.

362
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,010
The time will pass quickly.

363
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,680
Fine.

364
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,000
Since I've come to the Sword Alliance,

365
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,420
I won't be leaving again.

366
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,620
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

367
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,790
Master.

368
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,340
We found that Tang Lici

369
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,030
has taken over the Sword Alliance.

370
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,290
He's gathering forces

371
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,650
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

372
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,440
Also,

373
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,750
the item you requested

374
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,920
is ready.

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,750
Tang Lici.

376
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,440
I know how to get

377
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,040
the Rebirth Scroll from you.

378
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I'll go to the Sword Alliance now

379
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,950
to bring you a special gift.

380
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,050
Let's go. Let's go.

381
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,750
Fan.

382
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,750
Are you also here
to join the Sword Alliance

383
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,070
to fight against the Fengliu Shop?

384
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,590
Yes.

385
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
There are so many martial artists

386
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,520
coming today.

387
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,590
This time we'll surely succeed.

388
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,210
This time we can definitely
stand against the Fengliu Shop.

389
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,200
He's blocked the road again.

390
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,880
Such a troublemaker.

391
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,350
Indeed.

392
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,480
You two can't even catch

393
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,340
a single child?

394
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,730
Stop, stop!

395
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,880
Stop, stop!

396
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,610
Leave this to me.

397
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,800
This is called martial arts.

398
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,860
You've built so many stone fortresses.

399
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,920
Are you trying to hide inside them
to protect yourself?

400
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
But

401
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,290
stones can't protect you.

402
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,690
You need to protect them instead.

403
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,050
I want to teach him to read first,

404
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,850
then teach him our martial arts.

405
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,270
One day,

406
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,400
you will use them

407
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,270
to protect what matters to you.

408
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,390
I can teach you martial arts.

409
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,170
With martial arts,

410
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,150
in the future,

411
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,630
you'll be able to protect these stones.

412
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,930
However,

413
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,920
you must promise me.

414
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,080
You can only stack stones here.

415
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,610
You can't block other people's paths.

416
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,150
You don't understand anything.

417
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,400
Then I'll teach you
the "Three Character Classic" first.

418
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,880
Men.

419
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,750
On.

420
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,750
Earth.

421
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,350
Good.

422
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,160
At.

423
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,010
Today I'll teach you
to recognize characters.

424
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,720
It reads "Man on earth, good at birth."

425
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,720
It means

426
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,850
when we are born,

427
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,830
we are all good people.

428
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,440
The reason some people become bad later

429
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,730
is that they are influenced by bad things.

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,830
So, Lici,

431
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,990
you must believe that in your heart,

432
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,950
there is always love.

433
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,110
Man on earth.

434
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,440
Man on earth.

435
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,680
Good at birth.

436
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Good at birth.

437
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,960
Lici,

438
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,100
you're learning very well.

439
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,200
Lici,

440
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,770
resist the urge

441
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,500
to knock over this sandcastle.

442
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,090
People do bad things

443
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,830
because they're influenced by bad things.

444
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,490
That's why they do bad things.

445
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,240
Understand?

446
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,270
Tang Lici.

447
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Damn the Central Plains Sword Alliance!

448
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,270
We've had several

449
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,200
of our strongholds raided!

450
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
And you just wait here
without doing anything!

451
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,000
East Palace Chief.

452
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,910
When will you understand

453
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,270
that anger solves nothing?

454
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,310
Am I angry?

455
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,880
Am I that angry?

456
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,370
Where is Master?

457
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Where has Master gone at a time like this?

458
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,700
Is our Fengliu Shop

459
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,720
just going to be bullied like this?

460
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,360
If you don't want to wait
for Master to return,

461
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,200
you can go face them yourself.

462
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,680
Fine, I'll go!

463
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,910
If I go,

464
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,350
what about you?

465
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,270
I'll stay here

466
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,950
waiting for Master to return.

467
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,750
Give me a break.

468
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Don't think that if Master and I died,

469
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,750
you could become the new Master

470
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,400
and be equal to Leader.

471
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,160
Keep dreaming!

472
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,670
What's all this noise about?

473
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,110
Greetings, Master.

474
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,770
Greetings, Master.

475
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,740
Fucui.

476
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,790
You thought I was dead just now,

477
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,780
didn't you?

478
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,550
No, no, no.

479
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,920
Not at all.

480
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,190
I just feel

481
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,550
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

482
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,030
is taking a mile when given an inch.

483
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,290
They're going too far.

484
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
I was just upset for a moment.

485
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,640
Fucui actually managed to say

486
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,930
2 idioms in one breath.

487
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,660
I guess pressure does
bring out quick thinking.

488
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,480
Xifang Tao!

489
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,710
You...

490
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,880
Master.

491
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,320
Since Tang Lici

492
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,830
became the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance,

493
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,510
he's raided our several

494
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,680
hidden places!

495
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,620
This time's loss is much greater

496
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,290
than that in Sword King City!

497
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,160
We can't just sit and wait for death.

498
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,360
We need to fight back!

499
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,530
What's the rush?

500
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,420
Hearts that can be bought with money

501
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,970
can just as easily be torn apart
by other means.

502
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,970
They've overestimated themselves

503
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,460
and also underestimated me

504
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,890
and the Fengliu Shop.

505
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,550
Take this

506
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,740
to mobilize our people.

507
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Master.

508
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,030
Chunji, you're back.

509
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,330
Let me have a look at you.

510
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,520
Very good.

511
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,280
Very good.

512
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,430
Chunji, your leadership of the disciples

513
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,750
in raiding

514
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,880
the Fengliu Shop's strongholds

515
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,210
is extremely well done.

516
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,660
Thank you for your hard work.

517
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,920
This is simply my duty.

518
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,270
However, Master,

519
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,430
recently,

520
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,340
the Sword Alliance's reputation
has grown tremendously.

521
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,560
Every day, there are many new people

522
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,960
in the martial arts world joining us.

523
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,880
These newcomers

524
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
don't understand the rules
of the Sword Alliance yet.

525
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,030
They need someone

526
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,510
to guide and lead them.

527
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,590
So can I...

528
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,160
It's time to return
to the Shanfeng Branch.

529
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,680
Yes.

530
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,650
Now everyone knows

531
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,140
that Mr. Tang is innocent.

532
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
So what I did back then

533
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,860
wasn't really wrong, was it?

534
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,830
Have you forgotten?

535
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,230
Didn't I tell you before?

536
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,590
I punished you because you

537
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,610
released a suspect without permission.

538
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,700
That wasn't releasing a suspect at all.

539
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,970
It was clearly some Sword Masters

540
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,880
trying to take advantage

541
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,080
to replace me with their own disciples.

542
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,480
Some things

543
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,880
are better left understood

544
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,790
but unspoken.

545
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,920
Alright.

546
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,350
Chunji,

547
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,750
the position of Shanfeng Branch Chief

548
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,880
is still vacant now.

549
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,240
As long as you take it step by step

550
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,580
and remain steady and reliable,

551
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,240
what's meant to be yours will be yours.

552
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
It's just not the right time yet.

553
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,070
Yes, yes.

554
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,570
I understand, Master.

555
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,340
I'm leaving.

556
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,540
I'm leaving.

557
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,530
Such a troublesome one.

558
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,970
Good. Next.

559
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,550
Thank you. Next.

560
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
What's your name?

561
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,720
How many people have come today?

562
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,750
Zhong.

563
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,760
You're back.

564
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,000
Ms. Zhong.

565
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,520
Today, we've had

566
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,070
160 people join

567
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,480
the Sword Alliance.

568
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,260
Including those still in line,

569
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,540
there are 200 more.

570
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
You can leave.

571
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,640
Our Sword Alliance

572
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,170
welcomes talented people,

573
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,830
but we don't accept just anyone

574
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,690
looking for free food and drinks.

575
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,810
That's not quite right.

576
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,610
I may be a nobody,

577
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,260
but I never cheat for food.

578
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,720
No sect, no martial arts skills.

579
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,690
[Master of Fate]
[Divine Fortune Teller]

580
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,110
If you don't mooch around
and cheat for a living,

581
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,240
what else can you do?

582
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,970
You really don't recognize me?

583
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,320
Should we know you?

584
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Are we supposed to?

585
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
No, no.

586
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,410
Good.

587
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,060
Since we're strangers,

588
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,710
let me tell your fortune.

589
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,450
What's going on?

590
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,230
Senior Zhong.

591
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,550
He's a jianghu con artist.

592
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,680
We'll handle it right away.

593
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,080
Got it!

594
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,240
Li Dayou, 18 years old.

595
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,050
Born in the Year of the Pig.

596
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,110
Wrong.

597
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,680
His surname is Zhang.

598
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,480
Wait.

599
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,700
My birth father's surname was indeed Li.

600
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,750
It was after my mother remarried

601
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,440
that I changed my surname.

602
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
How did you know that?

603
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,350
I also know

604
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,210
you had good luck with money today,

605
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,400
but unfortunately,

606
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,030
you lost it all at once.

607
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,270
Wrong.

608
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,000
He made a mistake this morning

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,640
and was just fined a month's salary.

610
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I did find a money pouch.

611
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,960
It's worth more than my monthly salary.

612
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,830
It was you!

613
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,960
So my money pouch

614
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,030
was picked up by you.

615
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,550
Give it back to me now.

616
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,590
I found this.

617
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,550
How can you prove it's yours?

618
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,150
What disgraceful behavior.

619
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,360
I've heard

620
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,400
that the Sword Alliance has welcomed

621
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,060
a Guest of Honor surnamed Tang

622
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,110
and issued a notice.

623
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,200
It states that anyone with a skill,

624
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,330
of good character,

625
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,270
and willing to

626
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,310
resist the Fengliu Shop

627
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,030
and contribute to the cause

628
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,260
can join the Sword Alliance.

629
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,160
Tell me,

630
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,510
I've traveled

631
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,550
over mountains and ridges to get here.

632
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,480
Doesn't that count for something?

633
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,750
The Sword Alliance's announcement
is certainly valid.

634
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,200
Please state your name first.

635
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,130
Thank you, Miss.

636
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,110
My name is Fang Zhou.

637
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,970
Pleased to meet you.

638
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
What's your name?

639
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Fang Zhou.

640
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,790
Fang as in square.

641
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,680
Zhou as in boat.

642
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,510
Do you know

643
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,270
Head Fang of Zhoudi Tower

644
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,880
had the same name?

645
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,000
Well,

646
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,810
there's nothing I can do about it.

647
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,410
My parents gave me this name.

648
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,590
It's my honor
to share the same pronunciation

649
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,070
as Head Fang's name.

650
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,000
Surely Head Fang was generous enough

651
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,750
to tolerate someone like me.

652
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,550
Besides,

653
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,200
Head Fang's "Zhou" means

654
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,350
encompassing the world,

655
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,460
while my "Zhou" is just

656
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,110
a lonely boat drifting

657
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,790
in this vast universe.

658
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
Even so,

659
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,630
I kindly advise you

660
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,360
if you meet Mr. Tang,

661
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,560
you'd better

662
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,830
not mention your name.

663
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,550
Why?

664
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,850
Just because my name is also Fang Zhou?

665
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,920
There are countless people
with the same name.

666
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,070
Besides me, there must be

667
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,750
thousands of other Fang Zhous.

668
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,720
Are you saying

669
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,850
Mr. Tang can't stand to see any of them?

670
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,600
Is he really that arbitrary
and domineering?

671
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,510
Yeah.

672
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,160
That's too domineering.

673
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,310
That's so unreasonable.

674
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,160
How is Mr. Tang being arbitrary
and domineering?

675
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,830
You don't know him,

676
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,230
so don't speak nonsense.

677
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,690
This is indeed my fault.

678
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,960
I apologize to you, Miss.

679
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,780
Alright, alright.

680
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,110
We don't stand on ceremony
at the Sword Alliance.

681
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,110
Go get your disciple uniform first.

682
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,400
Thank you very much, Miss.

683
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,030
Don't go! Read my fortune!

684
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,750
Tell my fortune!

685
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,480
Don't rush. Don't rush.

686
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,480
One at a time.

687
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,590
Good.

688
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,790
Obviously,

689
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,850
this is a diagram of human meridians.

690
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,740
So today,

691
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,890
I'll be explaining to everyone

692
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,590
how the modified version

693
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,640
of the Blood Ghost Pill
from the Fengliu Shop

694
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,300
causes harm to the human body.

695
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,070
Of course,
my explanation might be insufficient.

696
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,530
Shen will fill in the gaps.

697
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,180
What's the difference

698
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,590
between the current Blood Ghost Pill

699
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,960
and the poison pill
spread by the Jile Sect

700
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,220
from over a decade ago?

701
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,070
The former is more potent,
and its toxicity is more concealed.

702
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,920
The one who refined the poison pill
is not anyone else

703
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,680
but the current Master

704
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,000
of the Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

705
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,960
Fine, fine.

706
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,620
The underworld is giving a lesson
to the upright people.

707
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,070
Indeed, when you live long enough,

708
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,400
you'll see everything.

709
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,590
Among these people,

710
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,240
only Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

711
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,830
fought against people

712
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,960
who took the new Evil Pill.

713
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,490
The poison pill he modified

714
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,550
can make the user's power

715
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,790
increase more than tenfold.

716
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,880
You sneaky fox,

717
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,970
always appearing out of nowhere.

718
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,480
I heard

719
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,200
a fortune teller
joined the Sword Alliance.

720
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Why don't you go see him?

721
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,790
A fortune teller?

722
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,720
I saw you and Shei

723
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,790
whispering by the stream.

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,110
I'm saying you should go see him too,

725
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,640
to see if someone as ice-cold as you

726
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,900
can turn into a softie.

727
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,830
It's over. It's over.

728
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,270
It's all over. It's all over.

729
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
You'll soon face a bloody disaster.

730
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
How can I avoid it?
Do you have any magic charms?

731
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,000
Magic charms?

732
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,310
Of course not.

733
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,030
Just don't go outside,

734
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,090
and you'll be fine.

735
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,400
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

736
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,530
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

737
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,880
That won't work.

738
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,310
We have to get up at dawn

739
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,880
to practice sword formations.

740
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,750
This was arranged

741
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,880
by Mr. Tang.

742
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,510
He makes you get up at dawn?

743
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,640
-Yes.
-That's right.

744
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,340
Yes.

745
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,990
What is Mr. Tang thinking?

746
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,740
What's on Mr. Tang's mind?

747
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
How would ordinary disciples like us

748
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,960
know?

749
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,310
Could you decipher this for us?

750
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,370
Yes.

751
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,070
Please do us a favor.

752
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,830
Please.

753
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,680
Let me try.

754
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
If you want to know what's on my mind,

755
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,550
why don't you ask me directly?

756
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,940
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

757
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,230
You haven't paid yet.

758
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,380
Interesting.

759
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,510
Welcome.

760
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,830
Would you like your future read

761
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,430
or your lifespan predicted?

762
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,940
My surname is Fang,
courtesy name Pingzhai,

763
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,790
and nickname Carefree.

764
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,100
So Mr. Carefree Fang,

765
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,290
your profession is fortune-telling?

766
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,320
Just a humble skill.

767
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,000
It's not even one-tenth

768
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
of what I've learned.

769
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,910
By the way,

770
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,730
let me formally introduce myself.

771
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,310
My surname is Fang, given name Zhou,

772
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,870
and courtesy name Pingzhai.

773
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,720
Pleased to meet you.

774
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
What did you say your name is?

775
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,520
I am

776
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,270
Fang Zhou.

777
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,150
You don't stay in Fallen Shisan Tower.

778
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,710
Why have you come to the Sword Alliance?

779
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,389
You know,
the Sword Alliance is open to all.

780
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,790
If you can come

781
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
and Shen can come,

782
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
why can't I come?

783
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,630
I also wish to follow the righteous path.

784
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,480
What do you want?

785
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,710
Mr. Tang,

786
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,880
you have a supreme martial art technique

787
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
called the Rebirth Scroll.

788
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,070
Endless Secrets of Heaven and Earth,

789
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,280
Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

790
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
You've given yourself away.

791
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,320
Chief Fang.

792
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,320
Fallen Shisan Tower.

793
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,840
Chief Fang of Dieban Chonghua.

794
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,540
What do you want with the Rebirth Scroll?

795
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,030
You claim to join the righteous path,

796
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,880
yet you're here for

797
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,120
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique.

798
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,560
I've been exposed.

799
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,150
Why don't you just play along with me

800
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,840
for a while?

801
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,780
But come to think of it,

802
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,760
you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique,

803
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
and you've become

804
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,890
a Guest of Honor of the Sword Alliance.

805
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,540
Is there a problem?

806
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,300
Forget it.

807
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,320
Since the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance can't offer it,

808
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,800
I'd like to see

809
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,320
whether Master Liu
from the Fengliu Shop will give it to me.

810
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,380
Stay away from him.

811
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,150
Otherwise,

812
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll make sure

813
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,340
you'll get it but won't live to use it.

814
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,360
Mr. Tang, I've read your fortune.

815
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,450
The results are surprising.

816
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,340
You're not a human of this world

817
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,480
but a fox demon.

818
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,090
Then you should also know

819
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,030
that fox demons excel at

820
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,200
gutting humans

821
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,150
and digging out their hearts

822
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,930
to examine them closely

823
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,910
to see if they're loyal or treacherous.

824
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,690
Why is it you again?

825
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,230
We hired you

826
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,630
not to deceive others.

827
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,280
Mr. Tang,

828
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,000
did he

829
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,050
tell you any nonsense?

830
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,190
Ms. Zhong,

831
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,600
long time no see.

832
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,210
Long time no see.

833
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,570
Don't worry, Miss.

834
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,880
Mr. Tang

835
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,950
has found me a good job.

836
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I won't be fortune-telling anymore.

837
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,680
That's right.

838
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,380
A job very suitable for Mr. Fang.

839
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
During your time working
at the Service Hall,

840
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
I hope you

841
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,030
can think carefully

842
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,490
whether you want to be honest

843
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,600
with me or not.

844
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,190
You want me to do odd jobs?

845
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,190
Do them properly.

846
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,440
When did you return, Ms. Zhong?

847
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,690
About 2 days ago.

848
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,710
Master said you were busy.

849
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,920
If I hadn't seen you
while passing by just now,

850
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,880
I wouldn't have come to bother you again.

851
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,080
Even if we hadn't met,

852
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,810
I would come looking for you anyway.

853
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,960
I heard

854
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,530
that you lost your position

855
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,520
as Branch Chief
of the Shanfeng Branch because of me.

856
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,800
I lost my position

857
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,280
because someone else wanted it.

858
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,000
Mr. Tang, you don't need

859
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,930
to take everything upon yourself.

860
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,960
I just

861
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,800
feel it's unfair.

862
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,790
There's no such thing as fair or unfair.

863
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,670
It has always been about

864
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,530
whether others choose you or not.

865
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,630
I think

866
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,150
Master Shao must

867
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,680
have his own difficulties.

868
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,960
Ms. Zhong.

869
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,180
Come with me to a place.

870
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,120
Let's go.

871
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
The food is ready.

872
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,050
And the wine is here.

873
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,190
Did you twist your ankle, Miss Shei?

874
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,920
Take it easy.

875
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,320
Ms. Zhong.

876
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,230
Zhong.

877
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,030
Ms. Zhong.

878
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,510
Everyone's here.

879
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
Why are you so late?

880
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,590
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

881
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,590
Shen and I finished our lessons ages ago.

882
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,430
Those Sword Masters
kept asking us questions.

883
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,270
They asked me.

884
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,150
You couldn't explain it clearly.

885
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,630
Ms. Zhong,

886
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,980
please sit down.

887
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,340
Come, have a seat.

888
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,670

I

892
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,280

When we battle against the Fengliu Shop,

896
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,730
Yanmen Sect will lead the charge,

897

This is the finest wine from Yanmen.

Frosty Leaves' Red.

No.

I just feel

951
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,330

since I last saw everyone.

953
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,150
The last time we went to Sword King City

seems like it happened in a previous life.

955

I'd like to toast everyone.

we should always drink together.

958
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,290
You always know what to say.

959
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,530
You seem very happy tonight, Ms. Zhong.

960
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,180
Why is it you again?

961
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,710
Do you need something?

962
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,760
I asked you first.

963
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,840
So you should answer me first.

964
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,430
Of course I'm happy.

965
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,960
Your turn.

966
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,440
I don't have anything specific.

967
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,880
Why?

968
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,490
Can't I chat with you without a reason?

969
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,790
You're so strange.

970
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,760
If you came to the Sword Alliance

971
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,090
with other intentions,

972
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,250
I suggest

973
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,420
you leave now.

974
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,970
You're quite perceptive.

975
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,230
Fine.

976
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,390
I'll tell you.

977
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,480
I came to the Sword Alliance

978
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,960
to see

979
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,110
the true face of the fox demon.

980
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,590
Why?

981
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:07,820
Why?

982
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,760
Because...

983
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,290
Mr. Tang is indeed detestable and hateful,

984
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,960
but I must admit

985
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,000
that he does have a captivating charm.

986
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,150
It makes one unable to resist

987
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,000
falling deeply for him.

988
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,280
You dare to provoke Mr. Tang?

989
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,510
Aren't you afraid
that you'll bring disaster upon yourself?

990
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,880
It's the danger that makes it attractive.

991
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,880
You

992
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,210
understand this feeling best, don't you?

993
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,240
What are you talking about?

994
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,280
What I want to say is,

995
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,960
to get his attention,

996
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
you can't follow the ordinary path.

997
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,760
You need to be the most special person.

998
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,920
Don't let yourself need him;

999
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,690
make him need you instead.

1000
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,300
What's between Mr. Tang and me

1001
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,480
is none of your business.

1002
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,510
To be honest,

1003
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,240
I've read your fortune too.

1004
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,840
Your destiny shows weak family bonds

1005
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,510
and no power or wealth.

1006
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,630
What others are born with,

1007
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,230
you must fight desperately to obtain—

1008
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,630
only then might you stand a slim chance
of getting it.

1009
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,490
If you miss just one opportunity,

1010
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,320
you'll lose everything.

1011
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,440
Mr. Fang, do you think

1012
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,260
I would believe your words?

1013
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,170
It doesn't matter if you don't.

1014
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,230
But if I were you,

1015
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,440
with such a fate,

1016
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,480
I would contentedly

1017
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,880
be an ordinary disciple

1018
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,320
and marry a simple, honest man.

1019
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,370
Why struggle for more?

1020
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,320
What if I insist on struggling?

1021
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,960
Then I can help you.

1022
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,320
I don't need it.

1023
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,920
Think carefully,

1024
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,170
Ms. Zhong.

1025
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,770
A letter from Shisan Tower.

1026
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,650
The Peach of Three Hues in Pink Attire.

1027
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,190
She is Xifang Tao.

1028
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,350
Hand it to Godfather personally.

1029
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,370
Bring back his reply.

1030
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,020
Aren't you going
to ask what this is about?

1031
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,080
I don't have Chi Yun's curiosity.

1032
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,630
The more you know,

1033
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,090
the sooner you die.

1034
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,210
Sometimes,

1035
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,320
the more you know,

1036
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,280
the better your chances.

1037
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,320
Fang Pingzhai,

1038
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,000
your true identity

1039
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,480
is about to be revealed.
