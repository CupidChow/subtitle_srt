[Episode 9]

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,710
Rebirth Scroll?

4
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,430
Tang Lici's things may be disgusting,

5
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,440
but they still have some use.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,310
Die!

7
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,070
Looks like we're entering the next act.

8
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,729
Three Character Classic

9
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,010
You're back?

10
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Shen!

11
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,450
Did you find any clues?

12
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,079
I saw Liu Yan.

13
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,980
Where?

14
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,980
Shen, what's wrong?

15
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,329
There's something

16
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,030
on him.

17
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,590
Hiding behind a facade,

18
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,910
putting on a mysterious air.

19
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,360
Sound Killing Technique.

20
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,860
I should have known it was you.

21
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,910
It's been four years

22
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
and your methods are still so crude.

23
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,430
Crude?

24
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
You truly are cold-blooded.

25
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,070
In your eyes,

26
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,630
haven't I always been

27
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,760
a cold-blooded and heartless person?

28
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,600
What,

29
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,720
you're having doubts now?

30
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,159
Doubts?

31
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,710
No.

32
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,390
Since you killed Fang Zhou

33
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,520
right in front of me,

34
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,600
I've never doubted

35
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,460
that you're a cold-blooded
and heartless monster.

36
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,680
Yan,

37
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,900
listen to me.

38
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,600
That day,

39
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,540
-it wasn't what you think.
-Excuses!

40
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,510
Tang Lici,

41
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,510
four years ago, I slit your throat

42
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,970
with great satisfaction.

43
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,930
Today, here,

44
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,910
I'll kill you again.

45
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,600
Four years ago,

46
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
you couldn't kill me.

47
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,040
And now,

48
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
you only dare to face me

49
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
in this illusion.

50
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
You have even less courage than before.

51
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Claiming to do things you can't
is just boasting.

52
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,610
Tang Lici,

53
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,190
you're already a wandering ghost.

54
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,620
Why did you come back?

55
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,390
Yes.

56
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,130
Because you're an inhuman,

57
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
undying,

58
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,400
and ungrateful

59
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,270
monster.

60
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,280
Monster?

61
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,920
Yan,

62
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,360
if I am a monster.

63
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,680
then what are you?

64
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,159
You were so eager to see me.

65
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,010
Isn't it because you want to

66
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,600
take the other half
of the Rebirth Scroll from me?

67
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
What's wrong?

68
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Realized your days are numbered

69
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,000
and afraid to die again?

70
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,690
Sir.

71
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,270
Sir?

72
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,570
Does it hurt?

73
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,290
You couldn't kill me four years ago.

74
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,390
And four years later,

75
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,330
you still haven't improved at all.

76
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,370
You've switched to framing others.

77
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
Is it because
you can't bring yourself to kill?

78
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,290
Or have you finally discovered...

79
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,240
Your own helplessness?

80
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,270
Can't bring myself to kill?

81
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,510
That's absurd.

82
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,830
If this were truly a setup,

83
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,720
how could I let someone like you,

84
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,950
the world's biggest hypocrite,

85
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,840
escape punishment

86
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,390
and play the role of

87
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,520
a righteous savior?

88
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,600
To watch you continue this act,

89
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,440
it's not a waste for me

90
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,870
to postpone your death a little longer.

91
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,860
How long do you think
you can keep up this act?

92
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,150
You'll soon expose

93
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,100
your true nature,

94
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,190
because you don't know how to save people.

95
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,390
You can only destroy.

96
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,390
Everything that comes close to you

97
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,790
will be destroyed by you.

98
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,620
Zhoudi Tower should never have saved you.

99
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,960
Zhoudi Tower...

100
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
I had already forgotten

101
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,430
that place.

102
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,550
However,

103
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,190
since you brought it up,

104
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,980
I should still thank you.

105
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,610
Fang Zhou brought me back.

106
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,430
Yan,

107
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,790
it was you

108
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,740
who healed me.

109
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,850
I should never have saved you!

110
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,790
You shouldn't be alive.

111
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,860
Once you reveal your true nature,

112
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,190
no one in this world will want you

113
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,740
to live.

114
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,150
You know that, don't you?

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,640
Without you,

116
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,340
everyone in this world

117
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,750
would be better off.

118
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,100
Better off.

119
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,790
I regret it.

120
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,150
I regret saving you,

121
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,470
giving you the chance
to deceive Fang Zhou,

122
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,710
letting you harm him

123
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,030
and destroy

124
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,490
the Zhoudi Tower
we tried so hard to protect!

125
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,750
You're wrong.

126
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,860
What you regret is

127
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,150
that to kill me,

128
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,550
you've become

129
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,910
neither human nor monster.

130
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,740
You keep saying

131
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,070
you believe what you saw.

132
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,270
You're convinced

133
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,330
I killed Fang Zhou.

134
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,070
But deep down,

135
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,910
you shamefully have doubts.

136
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,670
What if?

137
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,450
What if there's the slightest chance

138
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,310
that you're wrong?

139
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,910
So,

140
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,910
you keep testing me,

141
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,700
trying to see

142
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,310
if I really am a cold-blooded

143
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,570
and heartless person.

144
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,200
Would killing me

145
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,740
really allow you to

146
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,860
serve justice?

147
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:50,860
Yan,

148
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,860
to kill me,

149
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,820
this evil being,

150
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,490
you became a fallen angel,

151
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,700
a lonely hero in the night.

152
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,100
But

153
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,500
you're afraid.

154
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,910
You fear that all of this

155
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,920
is just your imagination.

156
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,550
You fear it's all

157
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,460
just a false excuse

158
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,660
you made up to kill me.

159
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,670
You're afraid...

160
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,030
you'll kill the wrong person.

161
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,430
Am I right?

162
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,790
No.

163
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,740
No.

164
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,500
Stop trying to manipulate me
with your words.

165
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
You may have fooled Fang Zhou,

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,700
but you can't fool me.

167
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,460
You hypocrite and liar!

168
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,820
I really envy you.

169
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,820
You killed Fang Zhou,

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,220
destroyed Zhoudi Tower,

171
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,840
and still live so comfortably
with yourself.

172
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,980
This qin is in your hands?

173
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,700
Human nature is good at birth.

174
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,150
Lici.

175
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,580
This qin

176
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,440
is called the Heart-Moon Return.

177
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,310
The name's meaning

178
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,210
expresses hope that when you play it,

179
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,430
it can ignite the fire in your heart,

180
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,190
cleanse your mind,
and guide you to goodness.

181
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,270
However,

182
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,070
if you truly want to
follow the path of goodness,

183
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,930
you must persevere until the end.

184
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,730
To accomplish this

185
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,700
is indeed very,

186
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,150
very difficult.

187
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,460
Today,

188
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,100
I will

189
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,310
give this zither to you.

190
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,100
You don't do enough good
to be truly virtuous,

191
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,980
and when you do evil,

192
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,620
you can't commit great evil either.

193
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,100
Yan,

194
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,910
with your personality,

195
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,700
you can never reach
the extremes of good or evil.

196
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,460
In the end,

197
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,580
you're destined to accomplish nothing.

198
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,340
Give up.

199
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,150
You're still trying to
manipulate with words.

200
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,070
Raging Thunder!

201
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,000
Shattered Jade Across the Realms!

202
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,860
Joy.

203
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,100
Anger.

204
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,500
Sorrow.

205
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,730
Happiness.

206
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,460
Worry.

207
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,070
Fear.

208
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,270
Dread.

209
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,370
Tang Lici,

210
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,980
I want to destroy
all seven of your emotions

211
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,790
and atone for your sins before Fang Zhou!

212
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,910
Go to hell!

213
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,880
Shock the universe,
seven sounds extinguished!

214
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,510
White Dragon Taizhen Dance.

215
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,910
The one Fang Zhou chose
to inherit his legacy

216
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,910
was never you,

217
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,190
but me.

218
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,060
Yan,

219
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,020
the illusion is broken.

220
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,480
You must be feeling awful.

221
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,630
You woke up first.

222
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,150
How boring.

223
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,690
Move aside.

224
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,520
I congratulated

225
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,500
you and the Master

226
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,060
on a happy reunion.

227
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,910
Sir,

228
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,060
why are you so cold?

229
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,390
Shen Langhun,

230
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,820
the illusion,

231
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,870
and now, you.

232
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,520
These three useless moves

233
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,240
have already made me

234
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,980
lose my patience.

235
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,870
Useless moves?

236
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,380
If you want to be my opponent,

237
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,110
you're not good enough.

238
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,540
Your opponent

239
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,670
is not me.

240
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,590
Since you're so clever,

241
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,390
why don't you guess

242
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,870
what Master

243
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,880
will do to your friends

244
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,460
next?

245
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,450
What does he want to do?

246
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,870
Master said

247
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,950
you

248
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,480
must pay the price.

249
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,780
Master said

250
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,350
your physique is exceptionally strong.

251
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,910
No matter how severe the injuries,

252
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,220
as long as you don't die,

253
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,300
you can recover.

254
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,460
But the only wound

255
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,390
you cannot heal

256
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,690
is in your abdomen.

257
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,670
Master has deliberately

258
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,500
mixed something into the misty flower sea

259
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,700
that will trigger

260
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,780
your old wound.

261
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,220
And my blood

262
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,580
is the catalyst.

263
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,630
Trigger the old wound?

264
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,870
I was here first!

265
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,180
[Wanqiao Chamber Account Book Collection]

266
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,350
Everyone, please calm down.

267
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,780
Take it easy.

268
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,710
I was here first!

269
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,740
I was here first!

270
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,590
Don't push.

271
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,760
I was here first.

272
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,420
Everyone, please be patient.
One at a time.

273
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't rush.

274
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,780
We are here

275
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,740
because we want to get rich

276
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,600
with all of you.

277
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,190
Sir, look,

278
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,220
we've all been waiting

279
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,420
for quite a while now.

280
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,570
What kind of fleets

281
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,830
are worthy of working with you?

282
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,150
I see you all

283
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,600
have brought your account books.

284
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,990
Hand them over for us to examine.

285
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,670
Those who have worked with

286
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,730
major clients in the past three years

287
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,830
will have a chance.

288
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,160
In the past three years?

289
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,520
No...

290
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,720
No hurry.

291
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,230
No rush, no need to hurry.

292
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,430
Our account books

293
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,150
are our most valuable possessions.

294
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,540
That's right.

295
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,150
Exactly.

296
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,950
This wasn't the rule before.

297
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,980
If we hand them all over to you,

298
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,630
what if the information in our accounts

299
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,430
gets leaked?

300
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,150
How can we continue

301
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,630
our business at the docks?

302
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,630
So, we can't hand over
these account books.

303
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,220
We can't.

304
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,830
In this world, there's never gain

305
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,020
without sacrifice.

306
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,400
You may lose your former clients,

307
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,630
but you'll gain Wanqiao Chamber

308
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,630
as a new client.

309
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,170
This is a trade-off

310
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,520
that you all should understand clearly.

311
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,830
That may be true,

312
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,060
but I think...

313
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,430
Wanqiao Chamber

314
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,060
has mountains of wealth

315
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,150
precisely because our business

316
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,220
never loses money.

317
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,690
Yes, we understand.

318
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,630
Since you all

319
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,590
don't even have the courage
to submit your account books,

320
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,540
the exit is that way.

321
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,300
No, no, no.

322
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,910
We...

323
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,110
I'm willing to provide my account book.

324
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,300
Our fleet

325
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,830
is clean and honest.

326
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,260
We have nothing to hide.

327
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,950
That's why I say

328
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,950
you cowards

329
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,300
will never make big money.

330
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,220
But it doesn't matter.

331
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,150
This way, no one will

332
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,020
compete with me for this deal.

333
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,750
Everyone, the exit is that way.

334
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,300
This young sir

335
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,660
is so courageous

336
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,660
and straightforward.

337
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,110
You're the kind of person
Wanqiao Chamber appreciates.

338
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,150
Please, come aboard.

339
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,020
This way, sir.

340
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,830
Please.

341
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,250
Time to make money!

342
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,080
He's allowed to get on the boat already?

343
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,940
Will this work?

344
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,990
Relax.

345
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,390
Walk forward.

346
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:07,990
Let's go.

347
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,670
One.

348
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,630
Two.

349
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:09,950
Wait!

350
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,350
Three.

351
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,260
Wait!

352
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,350
Wait!

353
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,300
Sir,

354
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,220
our accounts are clean too.

355
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,700
Right?

356
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,220
Yes, they're clean.

357
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,350
We have nothing to hide.

358
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,300
That's right.

359
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,260
Sir, I've thought it through too.

360
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,910
We'll submit our books as well. Come on.

361
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,540
Yes, we'll all submit them.

362
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,670
Come on.

363
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,980
Everyone gets a turn.

364
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,240
Everyone has a chance.

365
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,030
Don't rush, don't rush.

366
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,390
Why are you dawdling?

367
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,260
Come on, one at a time!

368
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,020
One at a time.

369
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,020
Line up!

370
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,950
By order of the Sword King City's lord,

371
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,300
during the Sword Duel Festival,

372
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,630
all vessels on the canal

373
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,020
are forbidden from private gatherings,

374
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,740
banquets,

375
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,980
concealing weapons,

376
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,950
or engaging in combat.

377
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,150
Those who have not registered

378
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,740
are forbidden from conducting business.

379
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,020
Those without an official sword token

380
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,150
may not leave the city.

381
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,780
If Wanqiao Chamber wants to do business,

382
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,980
you must wait until after
the Sword Duel Festival.

383
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,110
These are the rules.

384
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,150
Mind your own business

385
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,350
and stay in your lane.

386
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,950
The rules of Sword King City

387
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,630
don't apply to

388
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,830
the Wanqiao Chamber.

389
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,820
Move them out!

390
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,080
What are you doing?

391
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,060
Chi, what should we do?

392
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,910
Stop!

393
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,830
Chi.

394
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,030
Chi Yun, are you okay?

395
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,420
As expected of Cloud.

396
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,470
Your belly is full of cotton.

397
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,780
I'm impressed.

398
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:27,740
Look, everyone!

399
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,220
Is this a scam?

400
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,540
Isn't this the same person from before?

401
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,600
Turns out he was wearing a fake beard.

402
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,300
Chi Yun!

403
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,190
Don't be impulsive.

404
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,950
We've been tricked.

405
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,500
Yeah!

406
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,380
Calm down.

407
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,740
Yu Furen, Commander of Sword King City,

408
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,740
pays respects to the Branch Chief
of Shanfeng Branch,

409
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,460
Ms. Zhong.

410
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,500
Mr. Yu,

411
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,060
the Sword Duel Festival in Sword King City

412
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,020
welcomes heroes from all over the world.

413
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,260
Wanqiao Chamber
is just running a business.

414
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,590
There's nothing wrong with that.

415
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,720
Why cause conflict?

416
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,750
You're right.

417
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,170
If that's the case,

418
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,350
Wanqiao Chamber should

419
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,080
return all these account books

420
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,960
and promise to follow
Sword King City's rules

421
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
from now on.

422
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,540
Then, I will immediately apologize

423
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,910
to Mr. Chi.

424
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,460
Mr. Yu,

425
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,700
right now, we're just

426
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,430
collecting account books for examination.

427
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,300
As for discussing business deals,

428
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,960
that may still take some time.

429
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,390
Sword King City is responsible for
imperial transport.

430
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,780
If any confidential information
about the imperial transport

431
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,910
were to be leaked...

432
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,430
Why don't we meet halfway

433
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,560
and compromise?

434
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,910
These people

435
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,870
mostly come from private shipping groups

436
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,330
and have nothing to do with

437
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,590
imperial transport secrets.

438
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,020
Mr. Yu, why don't you

439
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,980
leave these

440
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,630
non-confidential account books

441
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,630
with us?

442
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,990
This way, everyone wins.

443
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,390
On what grounds?

444
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,100
Give it to him.

445
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,630
So be it.

446
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,710
Take it away.

447
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,910
Are we just letting them

448
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,910
take away that box of account books?

449
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,980
What if all the clues

450
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,830
are in there?

451
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,220
With just these scraps left,

452
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,430
how can we investigate?

453
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,490
It's alright, Chi.

454
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,630
We're just avoiding confrontation for now,

455
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,030
right?

456
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,060
This might actually be a good thing.

457
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,710
What do you mean?

458
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,740
Mr. Yu's arrival

459
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,600
must be on Sword King Yu's orders.

460
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,150
I've observed Mr. Tang's actions.

461
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,590
They're all aimed at
pressuring the Sword King,

462
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,190
forcing him to make mistakes.

463
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,790
Whether those account books

464
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,670
actually contained

465
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,950
the evidence we wanted

466
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,810
was uncertain.

467
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,670
But judging from the Yu family's reaction,

468
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,910
doesn't it prove

469
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,300
there must be
incriminating evidence inside?

470
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,030
Take it away.

471
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,980
As for the box they took,

472
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,700
with Cloud's skills

473
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,670
and some shady tactics,

474
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,430
I'm sure we have ways

475
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,390
to get it back.

476
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,950
Shei,

477
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,470
you've learned some bad habits
from Foxy Tang.

478
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,020
Don't wait for me for dinner.

479
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,220
I'm going to give that guy some trouble.

480
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,390
Be careful, Chi.

481
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,420
This Yu Furen
isn't heading to Sword King City.

482
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Where is he going?

483
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,540
Master.

484
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,220
Is Tang Lici

485
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,950
really that powerful?

486
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,540
Not only did he force you

487
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,260
to nurture the Thousand Curse Needle
with your body,

488
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,520
but he also wounded you

489
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,600
in the illusion.

490
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,780
Today, I should've

491
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,380
sacrificed my physical body

492
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,230
to kill him completely
with the sea of flowers.

493
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,140
The song is halfway done.

494
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,590
The climax is coming.

495
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,760
All things cannot be rushed.

496
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,220
Besides,

497
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,790
what if you get hurt too?

498
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,690
Who will help me avenge this deep hatred?

499
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,680
I've planned every step

500
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,260
to finally lure him to this place.

501
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,050
How could I not enjoy this game?

502
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,740
The curse bug flower
can trigger his old illness.

503
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,350
But if he dies like this,

504
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,460
wouldn't that be too easy for him?

505
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,460
This time,

506
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,090
I'll make him die while abandoned by all,

507
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,620
with no one to bury his bones.

508
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,300
Give this to Yu Qifeng.

509
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,440
It's time for the curse bug

510
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,910
raised for Tang Lici

511
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,520
to be put into use.

512
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,220
Why did you only bring back
these account books?

513
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,550
-This voice...
-Madam.

514
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,890
Trying to retrieve all the account books

515
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,290
would be unreasonable.

516
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,150
Commander Yu,

517
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,090
you're still too merciful.

518
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,900
It seems this matter
will require more effort.

519
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,540
Please tell me, Madam,

520
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
what exactly is the relationship

521
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,460
between my Master and Wanqiao Chamber?

522
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,060
You don't need to know these things.

523
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,500
You only need to understand

524
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
that whatever the Sword King
wants you to do,

525
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,370
you should do it.

526
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,870
Are these account books

527
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,870
truly evidence planted by Tang Lici

528
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,060
to frame my family,

529
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,300
as Master said?

530
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,500
Also,

531
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,220
if Tang Lici is truly

532
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,150
the villain selling the Evil Pill,

533
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,350
then why doesn't Master Puzhu

534
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,060
just arrest him?

535
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,040
You don't trust me,

536
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,420
but do you not trust the Sword King?

537
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,710
I wouldn't dare.

538
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,700
Go back now.

539
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,420
Stay alert these days.

540
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,500
If there's anything else to be done,

541
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,100
the Sword King will find you.

542
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,110
Yes.

543
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:01,960
It's you.

544
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,670
Mr. Tang!

545
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,830
You sent everyone to look for Chi.

546
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,980
Did something happen?

547
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,580
Stay back.

548
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,500
You're hurt.

549
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,190
I'll go get a doctor.

550
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,980
Stop.

551
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,630
It's just my old illness acting up.

552
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,500
It's nothing.

553
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,670
Don't tell anyone

554
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,220
about this.

555
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,080
Understand?

556
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,250
But your injury...

557
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,060
Get out.

558
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,780
Mr. Tang!

559
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,630
I've been looking for you for three years.

560
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,760
Since you're alive,

561
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,830
why didn't you come find me?

562
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,030
I have nothing to do with you.

563
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,390
Why should I go find you?

564
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm your fiancé.

565
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,780
Your father made a vow
to the heavens and ancestors

566
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,910
for our engagement.

567
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
How do you have nothing to do with me?

568
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,340
I've torn up the engagement.

569
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,740
Now, I'm Sword King Yu's concubine.

570
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,020
Don't act like a lecher,

571
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,220
putting your hands all over me.

572
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,910
Nonsense!

573
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,670
You are my fiancée.

574
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,570
How could you be with Yu Qi—

575
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,350
How could you be involved

576
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,210
with Yu Qifeng?

577
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,120
I promised your father I would marry you.

578
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,520
No matter what's happening to you now,

579
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,220
I'm taking you with me today.

580
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,170
Bai Suche,

581
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,460
you're poisoning me?

582
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:33,980
Yes,

583
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,830
you will die here.

584
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,850
Madam!

585
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,480
No need to chase after him.

586
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,500
Cloud

587
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,800
isn't so easy to catch.

588
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,909
Butler Sen,

589
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,540
look there, look there!

590
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,510
-Mr. Chi!
-Chi!

591
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,980
Fang Zhou.

592
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,760
Fang Zhou.

593
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,430
Fang Zhou!

594
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,100
Fang Zhou.

595
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,580
Fang Zhou!

596
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,430
Fang Zhou,

597
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,290
don't leave again.

598
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,790
I'm about to fulfill

599
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,990
what I promised you.

600
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,060
Lici,

601
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,870
stop fooling yourself.

602
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,310
I'm already dead.

603
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,950
Fang Zhou,

604
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,440
trust me one more time.

605
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,000
I always succeed in

606
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,950
what I want to do.

607
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,700
I said I would bring you back,

608
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
so I will definitely do it.

609
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,900
I won't break my promise.

610
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,000
Why do you want to save me so badly?

611
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,910
I...

612
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,200
Your past

613
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,980
was full of killing,

614
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,140
betrayal,

615
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,450
and destruction.

616
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,560
You don't want this past,

617
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,310
yet you're not sure

618
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,570
about your own nature,

619
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,180
right?

620
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,310
I don't know.

621
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,660
I don't know.

622
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,230
Fang Zhou,

623
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,030
don't ask me anymore.

624
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,270
Lici,

625
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,880
do you regret it?

626
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,910
Regret?

627
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,570
Saving you?

628
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,990
I don't regret it.

629
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,730
My strength has returned.

630
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,140
Mr. Tang, you're awake.

631
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,910
Who let you in?

632
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,430
I saw you were injured

633
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,430
and was very worried about you,

634
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,960
so I gave you some medicine.

635
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,390
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,140
I...

637
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,710
Get out.

638
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,670
This medicine

639
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,310
can heal my old wound

640
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,560
and even neutralize the curse bug poison.

641
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,100
[Marriage Letter]

642
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,710
After the Bai family was massacred,

643
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,240
she suddenly disappeared.

644
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,230
I spent over a year looking for her

645
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,270
to no avail.

646
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,790
Now, she claims to be

647
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,120
Yu Qifeng's concubine.

648
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,430
She even poisoned me.

649
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,580
Tell me...

650
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,980
Have you recovered?

651
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,910
The remaining poison is gone. I'm fine.

652
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,430
Good.

653
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,830
Today, accompany me

654
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,790
to the Qiongtai Banquet.

655
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,910
Let's not talk about

656
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,910
that Qiongtai appointment now.

657
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,040
Help me analyze this situation first.

658
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,830
Bai Suche is my wife.

659
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,270
How can I just stand by and watch her

660
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,180
be with Yu Qifeng?

661
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,140
Just because you like her,

662
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,620
does that mean she must marry you

663
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,270
and can't marry someone else?

664
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,950
On what grounds?

665
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,710
Because we were engaged first!

666
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,660
Since we were engaged,

667
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
she belongs to me.

668
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,500
She doesn't belong to anyone.

669
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,660
She is free.

670
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,870
Even if you, Chi Yun,

671
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,020
believe yourself to be

672
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,620
a thousand times better than Yu Qifeng,

673
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,710
she still has the right not to choose you.

674
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,100
What?

675
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,580
Can the mighty Cloud

676
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,750
only hide behind parental arrangements

677
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,980
and matchmakers?

678
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,370
Tang Lici,

679
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,500
I've worked for you for a year,

680
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,310
serving you faithfully,

681
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,390
and there hasn't been a single thing

682
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,020
I've done to let you down, right?

683
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,060
Now, instead of speaking up for me,

684
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,020
you're defending that outsider, Yu Qifeng?

685
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,820
Do you even consider me a friend?

686
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,660
Friend?

687
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,030
When did I, Tang Lici, ever acknowledge

688
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,820
that we were friends?

689
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:31,790
Fine.

690
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,310
I'm not worthy of being your friend.

691
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:35,790
So now,

692
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,390
there's nothing left to say.

693
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,620
Let's not work together anymore.

694
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,550
Let's part ways!

695
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,410
Chi!

696
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,540
What?

697
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,240
Do you want to leave too?

698
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,020
She vanished without a trace a year ago.

699
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,750
A year later,

700
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,500
she just happened
to appear in Sword King City,

701
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,830
so you suspect Bai Suche

702
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,830
works for Liu Yan.

703
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,580
You're worried that Chi Yun
is too impulsive

704
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,660
and getting in too deep.

705
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,910
You're afraid he'll get hurt,

706
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,910
so you deliberately drove him away.

707
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,590
Desperate times

708
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,640
call for desperate measures.

709
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,620
Chi Yun is simple-minded.

710
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,890
Emotions cloud judgment.

711
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,230
If he finds out

712
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,890
that Bai Suche is connected
to the Fengliu Shop,

713
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,350
he'll throw everything down

714
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,660
to take Bai Suche away.

715
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,350
Rather than letting him

716
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,680
fall into another trap,

717
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,760
it's better to let anger

718
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,610
fill his mind first.

719
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,000
It's better than letting him
be manipulated now.

720
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,140
I'm afraid the one whose heart is troubled

721
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,430
isn't just Chi Yun.

722
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,630
You've been off

723
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,550
since you saw Liu Yan yesterday.

724
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,910
You're losing focus.

725
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,060
If this continues, you'll lose.

726
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,710
Is that so?

727
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,980
Liu Yan might win,

728
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,020
but Tang Lici

729
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,060
will never lose.
