00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,140
[Whispers of Fate]

2
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,920
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,500
This is a trace of sword energy

4
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,350
left by Ancestor Xuanqing
and sealed within

5
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,479
the Yanhuang Sword.

6
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,130
With this sword energy nurturing you all,

7
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,460
your skills will surely advance further.

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,860
The Westwind Slashing Wildfire

9
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,070
is too powerful and might hurt

10
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,400
my fellow cultivators.

11
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,360
So today, on the sword stage,

12
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,200
I shall use other techniques instead.

13
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,800
Victory or defeat doesn't matter.

14
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,259
Just a friendly exchange.

15
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,240
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

16
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,030
The Sword King reigns!

17
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,000
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
The Sword King reigns!

19
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,120
It's the Sword Duel Festival
in Sword King City.

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
Aside from allied shipping guilds,

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,590
entry into the city

22
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,990
requires an invitation.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,540
Told you you were late.

24
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,870
The Sword Opening has started.

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,470
To enter Sword King City now,

26
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,800
you need an invitation.

27
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,750
Looks like

28
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,270
I'm still too early.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,680
Too early?

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,870
You're late.

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,030
Watch and learn.

32
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,020
I am Chi Yun,

33
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,770
Chief of Huoyun Fortress.

34
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,750
I've come to pay my respects
to Sword King Yu.

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,420
However,

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
I left in a hurry and forgot

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,730
to bring my invitation.

38
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,520
Please,

39
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,810
do us a favor.

40
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,310
Huoyun Fortress?

41
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,310
Never heard of it!

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Some no-name sect

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,240
trying to freeload

44
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
in Sword King City?

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,810
Get lost!

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,360
Chi Yun,

47
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,030
it seems Sword King City

48
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,400
doesn't care much for your reputation

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
as the Cloud.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,870
Foxy Tang,

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,000
how big a scene should I make?

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
That depends on how capable

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,840
you are.

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,750
No private fights

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,810
in Sword King City!

56
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,850
Commander,

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,410
they're trying to force their way in
without invitations.

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,030
During the Sword Duel Festival,

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,400
no one enters
the city

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
without an invitation,

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,950
not even the Cloud.

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
I heard that

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,400
the Sword Duel Festival welcomes
heroes from all over the world.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,700
But now it seems there is

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,300
a clear hierarchy after all.

66
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,640
Go get your punishment.

67
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,190
Yes.

68
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,990
He acted recklessly.

69
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Please forgive him.

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,790
However, this is the rule
of Sword King City.

71
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,640
If you don't have invitations,

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm afraid

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,460
I cannot let you in.

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,630
What if I

75
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,950
insist on entering today?

76
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,970
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

77
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,560
Clear the way!

78
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,630
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

79
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,240
Clear the way!

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
The Master of Wanqiao Chamber

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,750
congratulates the Yu family
on the festival

82
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,310
and presents 10 baskets of pearls.

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,680
During the festival,

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,390
all purchases in the city's shops

85
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,600
are on the house.

86
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,000
What a show-off.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,630
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship
has arrived.

88
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,510
Sir, I think

89
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,630
you should step aside for now.

90
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,500
The winds are high,
and the waves are rough.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,830
Perfect for traveling.

92
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,130
Your small boat is packed with people.

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,330
Beware of capsizing.

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Watch out!

95
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,530
You're about to crash!

96
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,360
Stop!

97
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,600
Greetings, Master.

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,050
You're the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

99
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,390
Well,

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
since I can't enter Sword King City

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
as Tang Lici,

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,390
then I'll just have to

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,510
borrow the invitation

104
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,640
of Wanqiao Chamber.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Just now,

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,680
I didn't know
you were the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

107
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,010
I may have offended you.

108
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,000
I apologize.

109
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,320
But I don't understand.

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,200
Why would you, with an invitation in hand,

111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,070
still make such a big scene?

112
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,600
If I hadn't made a scene,

113
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,480
how else could I see

114
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,810
where the problem lies?

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,260
Commander,

116
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,120
have we just offended

117
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,630
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

118
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,760
Go tell Sword King Yu

119
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,800
that I'm eccentric by nature

120
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,700
and dislike being seen,

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,930
so there's no need to blame anyone.

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,390
Guys,

123
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,050
please get on board.

124
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,670
He's showing off again.

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,370
Foxy Tang,

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,240
this is

127
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
way too…

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,400
luxurious.

129
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,300
H-How much money

130
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,480
do you actually have?

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,210
I don't know.

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Never counted it.

133
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I remember you were never

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
interested in business.

135
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,670
What's your plan for running

136
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,190
Wanqiao Chamber?

137
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,440
Does one have to live

138
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,610
only for what one's interested in?

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,090
Tang Sen.

140
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes.

141
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,530
Help my friends settle in.

142
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,200
Make sure they feel

143
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,040
right at home.

144
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,490
Yes, Master.

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,480
This young man's talent

146
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,340
is impressive.

147
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,600
He's lasted 30 minutes

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,950
against Sword King Yu.

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,250
Impressive!

150
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
The Sword King is formidable!

151
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,000
You're too kind.

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,730
You have great potential.

153
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,960
Work hard, and you will

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,500
achieve great things.

155
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,230
Look at him.

156
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,990
The Sword King gave him personal pointers,

157
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,800
yet he just walked away without a word.

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,710
How rude.

159
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,890
What's talent worth

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,060
if you don't have manners?

161
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,610
Zhong, did you see that?

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,150
Sword King Yu just aimed for

163
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,080
his vital point.

164
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,660
And his angle was extremely tricky.

165
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,670
Good thing we had a clear view

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,320
from here.

167
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,870
If Mr. Lin hadn't

168
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,330
dodged at the last second,

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
he'd be crippled—

170
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
if not dead.

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,290
The path of martial arts runs deep.

172
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,490
Talent is like a small boat.

173
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,730
It can carry you or sink you.

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,120
One can't

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,920
rely solely on talent

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,180
and lose humility.

177
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,390
There are

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,390
no shortcuts.

179
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,440
But why did Sword King Yu

180
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,840
go that hard on him?

181
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,270
Perhaps out of jealousy.

182
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,270
Exactly.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,930
Does anyone else

184
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,730
wish to come up and compete?

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,580
Master,

186
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
here is the account book
for the six months

187
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
you've been away.

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,480
Any word from my foster father?

189
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,740
The imperial father-in-law says

190
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,970
everything in Wanqiao Chamber

191
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,100
is at your disposal.

192
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,470
By the way,

193
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,120
Miss Shei

194
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,720
seems interested in bookkeeping.

195
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,250
Got it.

196
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,400
Master,

197
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,160
Miss Shei requests to see you.

198
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,540
Now that you're in the city,

199
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,510
why not just visit Sword King Manor?

200
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,610
No need to visit in person.

201
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,720
The bigger the stir I made today,

202
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,200
the more attention I'd draw

203
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,780
to myself.

204
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,490
You don't just want the attention

205
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,220
of Sword King Yu, right?

206
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,360
Since I've come,

207
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,970
he'll definitely come too.

208
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,870
What's going on?

209
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,030
Yeah, it's so cold.

210
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,320
It suddenly got cold.

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,390
Indeed.

212
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,270
Why did it suddenly get cold?

213
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,910
Yeah.

214
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
It's snowing.

215
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,240
It's snowing.

216
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm Xue Xianzi.

217
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,510
I've long heard of your name, Sword King.

218
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,170
Please give me some guidance.

219
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,320
Xue Xianzi?

220
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,790
Is that really Xue Xianzi?

221
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,790
Is it an impostor?

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
He's acting mysteriously.

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,580
He must be an impostor.

224
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,800
What a surprise.

225
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,500
Xue Xianzi,
the Hermit of Snow, has come too.

226
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,630
You're a master of the sword.

227
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,090
I don't dare presume

228
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
to offer any guidance.

229
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,150
I can't say

230
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,280
you are wrong.

231
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,630
You flatter me, Sword King.

232
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,890
The Yu family has produced
ten generations of Sword Kings,

233
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,240
while I've only been known

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
for a few short decades.

235
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
How could my pale snow

236
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,190
ever compare to your blazing flame?

237
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,790
How arrogant!

238
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,910
Is he…

239
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,390
truly Xue Xianzi?

240
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,610
I've met him before—

241
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,550
once in the jianghu

242
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,720
with my senior.

243
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,320
That is

244
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,670
indeed him.

245
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Please,

246
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,240
do me the honor.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You flatter me.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,870
We both share a love for swordsmanship.

249
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,600
A friendly match

250
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,630
is all.

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,510
Please.

252
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,750
Then, Sword King,

253
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,480
prepare yourself

254
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,410
for this strike.

255
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,270
The Hermit of Snow.

256
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,970
It really is him.

257
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,770
Sword King, let's see if you

258
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,270
can withstand this strike

259
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,080
from me.

260
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,440
It seems

261
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,140
everyone has seen

262
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,050
Sword King Yu's
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

263
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,040
Are you alright?

264
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,600
Oh, no.

265
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,840
He lost.

266
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,090
He lost?

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,310
What's happening?

268
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,590
You really are

269
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,550
the top swordsman of our time—

270
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,010
Yu Qifeng, the Sword King.

271
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,790
I've

272
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,270
lost.

273
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,110
Looks like Xue Xianzi

274
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,780
is here to stir up trouble.

275
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,520
Yu Qifeng's Westwind Slashing Wildfire

276
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,530
truly lives up to its reputation.

277
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,700
I am

278
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,890
so impressed.

279
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,070
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

280
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,400
Miss Shei, please go inside first.

281
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I have some matters to attend to.

282
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,390
All right, Mr. Tang.

283
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,670
Shen.

284
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,510
It's time.

285
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,680
Let's go.

286
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:28,070
[Tianyan Sword Wall, Sword King City]

287
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,510
Tianyan Sword Wall.

288
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,910
So this is Yu Xuanqing's sword essence.

289
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
It's truly powerful.

290
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,510
What a pity.

291
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,880
This secret legacy exists,

292
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,440
yet there's no worthy successor.

293
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,040
The grand Sword King City

294
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,410
has long been blinded by greed.

295
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,680
Otherwise,

296
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
how could it have been tainted

297
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
by the Blood Ghost Pills?

298
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,109
Why did you

299
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,390
bring me here?

300
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,330
To rattle the grass…

301
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,450
and scare out the snake.

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
There's indeed more to it than it seems.

303
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,770
The essence of the Sword Phoenix?

304
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,890
You are not of this realm.

305
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,540
Why have you set foot in this realm?

306
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,800
Only when one abandons the mortal flesh

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,130
and comes between reality and the void

308
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,060
can one glimpse the past and the future.

309
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,280
I am Tang Lici.

310
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,480
Please grant me your guidance,
Sword Phoenix.

311
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,710
A golden eye on the forehead…

312
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,920
Yique Yinyang,

313
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,140
it's you.

314
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,420
You're actually still alive.

315
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,310
Since that's the case,

316
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,770
I shall take your life here!

317
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Such power…

318
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,520
That's the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

319
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,300
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

320
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,720
But

321
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,060
why is it different from the one

322
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Sword King Yu unleashed earlier?

323
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,550
Yeah, it looks different.

324
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,310
What's going on?

325
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,070
Indeed.

326
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
Sword King Yu's sword essence
is as dark as night.

327
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
Why is this one crimson red?

328
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,620
Who cares what color it is?

329
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,670
This sword essence

330
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,200
has heaven-shaking power.

331
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
Truly,

332
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,810
the young phoenix

333
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,120
outshines the old one.

334
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,970
Sword King!

335
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,820
Sword King,

336
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,780
an outsider breached
the Tianyan Sword Wall.

337
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,190
We're not powerful enough to get close

338
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,160
and don't know what to do.

339
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,360
We await your orders.

340
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,950
The Yu family's
most powerful sword technique

341
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,810
has been mastered by an outsider.

342
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,690
This is going to be interesting.

343
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,510
An outsider broke in.

344
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,550
Who was it?

345
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,510
Someone actually had the nerve

346
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,000
to break into Sword King City's
forbidden ground.

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,270
How audacious!

348
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,070
Sword King,

349
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,960
you must punish them

350
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,030
and teach that person

351
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,910
a good lesson.

352
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,700
The Yu family has
taken in disciples for a century—

353
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,630
all to pass on the way of the sword

354
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,060
and benefit the jianghu.

355
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,830
If someone

356
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,160
from outside

357
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,890
truly glimpsed its mysteries,

358
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,200
my ancestors' efforts

359
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,400
wouldn't be in vain.

360
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,920
However,

361
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,790
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire
is extremely profound.

362
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,640
Without years of diligent practice,

363
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,570
how could anyone

364
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,960
master it so easily?

365
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,690
To find out whether that person

366
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,220
has really mastered it,

367
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,440
we just need

368
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,570
to go and see for ourselves.

369
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,950
Exactly!

370
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,030
Sword King,

371
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,310
broaden our horizons.

372
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,200
Am I right?

373
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,680
Yes.

374
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,480
That's right.

375
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,010
Please broaden our horizons.

376
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
Since you all are so interested,

377
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,680
then follow me

378
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,940
to meet

379
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,680
this brave trespasser.

380
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,550
-Great!
-Great!

381
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,790
-Thank you, Sword King.
-Thank you, Sword King.

382
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,990
You're magnanimous.

383
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,060
Zhong,

384
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,580
there's really someone up there.

385
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,440
Everyone,

386
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,410
the winds here are too strong.

387
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,560
Please wait here.

388
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,030
I'll go ask

389
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,830
the friend up there to come down.

390
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,350
Darn it. I'm stopped here again.

391
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,100
Why could that person go up?

392
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
Friend,

393
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,400
understanding the sword essence
is dangerous.

394
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,920
I shall not disturb you.

395
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,090
Please turn around.

396
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,070
You entered Sword King City

397
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,350
without announcing yourself

398
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,900
and trespassed into the forbidden ground.

399
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,560
That's quite disrespectful.

400
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,160
No matter how you went up

401
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
the Tianyan Sword Wall by luck,

402
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,170
now that the master is here,

403
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,510
you should at least
turn around for a talk.

404
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,240
Indeed. He's not even turning around.

405
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,070
So rude!

406
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,240
You're actually

407
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,500
also a disciple of Zhoudi Tower.

408
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,280
Head Fang was a man of great wisdom.

409
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,160
He must have had his reasons

410
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,960
for accepting you as a disciple.

411
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,600
This is the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

412
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,730
Watch it carefully.

413
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,750
Whether you can master it

414
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,510
is up to you.

415
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,600
Ignorant brat,

416
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,960

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,780
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

451
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,920
I unleashed

452
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,880
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire just now.

453
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,370
What do you think of it, Sword King Yu?

454
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,840
It truly was
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

455
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,040
It was the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

456
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,730
Are you alright?

457
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,290
I spent 50,000 taels of gold

458
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,100
and fought my way into the tower
to get you.

459
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,430
I can't let you die here.

460
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,420
I thought I was mistaken.

461
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,570
It really is you, Mr. Tang.

462
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,770
Miss Zhong.

463
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,140
Zhong,

464
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,550
so this is Mr. Tang Lici,

465
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,960
the one you mentioned?

466
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,480
I recognize him.

467
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,070
He's the one
who summoned

468
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,920
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship

469
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
outside the city just now.

470
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

471
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,790
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

472
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,590
He's so young.

473
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,510
It's him.

474
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

475
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,070
Turns out Mr. Tang
is

476
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,510
none other than the famed

477
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,040
Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

478
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,720
Back in Yanmen,

479
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,410
when I captured Jiang Qingyu,

480
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
I didn't expect

481
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,910
our next meeting

482
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,370
would be like this.

483
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,540
Deliberately hiding your identity,

484
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,070
hiring a notorious

485
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,200
jianghu assassin,

486
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,350
and trespassing on
my family's forbidden ground—

487
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,920
was it

488
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,750
all to meddle in Jiang Qingyu's case?

489
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,280
Exactly.

490
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,290
The case will be judged fairly.

491
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,830
How could Mr. Tang abuse his power

492
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,030
and be so aggressive?

493
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Right.

494
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,830
He even brought an assassin.

495
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,230
Planning to use
both carrot and stick, huh?

496
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,550
Sword King Yu, in one statement,

497
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,350
you were wrong about two things.

498
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,200
First,

499
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,000
the one who captured Jiang Qingyu

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,960
was me.

501
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,120
Tang Lici captured him?

502
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:05,920
What?

503
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,240
Didn't Sword King Yu say

504
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,310
that he personally captured

505
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,110
Jiang Qingyu?

506
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,350
Second,

507
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,030
Jiang Qingyu was involved

508
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,530
in the Hao family massacre.

509
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,620
I'm a victim.

510
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,620
How could you say I'm meddling?

511
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,090
Mr. Tang,

512
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,930
are you doubting my ability
to handle the case?

513
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,520
I have my own leads,

514
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,600
but one person's judgment alone

515
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,060
can't convince everyone.

516
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,930
Then Sword King,

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,100
why not hold a public trial
for Jiang Qingyu?

518
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,440
Yes, a public trial.

519
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,970
Yes, a public trial!

520
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,440
Since the Master of Wanqiao Chamber

521
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,770
is involved in the case,

522
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,200
a public trial is the only way
to convince everyone.

523
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,440
Yes, bring Jiang Qingyu to trial!

524
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,920
Public trial!

525
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Try him publicly!

526
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,070
That's right.

527
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,870
Public trial!

528
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,720
Public trial!

529
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,160
Public trial!

530
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,350
Put Jiang Qingyu on public trial.

531
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,640
You're all correct.

532
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,310
He should be

533
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,880
interrogated in front of

534
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,320
all martial artists.

535
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,110
It seems

536
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,480
I've arrived at the perfect time.

537
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,830
Those with purpose

538
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,170
always arrive at the right time.

539
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,890
At the Qiongtai Banquet
the day after tomorrow,

540
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,830
I will publicly try Jiang Qingyu

541
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,410
and give the martial arts world

542
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,850
a satisfactory answer.

543
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,640
Anyone in Sword King City
is welcome to attend.

544
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,840
Let's try him together

545
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,830
and expose the mastermind behind him!

546
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,270
-Great!
-Great!

547
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,160
The Sword King is wise!

548
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,200
The Sword King is wise!

549
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,550
Mr. Tang,

550
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,830
do you dare to come?

551
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,170
If the Sword King dares,

552
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,130
why wouldn't I?

553
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,610
As a small punishment

554
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,360
for arriving late,

555
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,880
my friend.

556
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,040
The drizzle's just stopped.

557
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,580
The monk is tired of the journey.

558
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,510
The Go game is like the game of stars.

559
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,120
You always sought solitude.

560
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,750
I never thought

561
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,080
you'd be disturbed by worldly affairs

562
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,110
and go to Sword King City

563
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,710
for the Sword Duel Festival.

564
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,090
I'm no man of the mundane world.

565
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,770
With no attachments

566
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,720
or obstacles,

567
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,730
I come and go as I please.

568
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,100
You've been pondering for a long time.

569
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Something's troubling you?

570
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,830
Three years ago,

571
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,840
we played our first game
at Wenqi Pavilion.

572
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,600
Since then,

573
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,070
we've bonded through Go,

574
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,200
meeting once a year.

575
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,640
Though I call you my friend,

576
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,100
I've never truly understood you.

577
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,400
The path you seek

578
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,510
is the path of salvation.

579
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,760
But tell me—

580
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,420
is the one you're trying to save

581
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,960
truly

582
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,430
worth saving?

583
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,860
The six realms and three lives

584
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,320
all have their own karma.

585
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,230
Those I encounter

586
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,430
are those I must save.

587
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,570
I simply do what I can to save others

588
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,110
with a clear conscience.

589
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,449
It seems

590
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,630
you once made some choices

591
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,570
that trouble your conscience.

592
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,409
Just making conversation.

593
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
My friend,

594
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,260
don't take offense.

595
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,760
You're right.

596
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,330
If there is someone...

597
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,940
I am not listening to that.

598
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,300
You only have two hours

599
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,130
to rest here.

600
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,929
You came to play Go with me, didn't you?

601
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,030
Friend,

602
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,940
are you deliberately letting me win?

603
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,920
Then I'll accept your kindness.

604
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,270
Every time we play,

605
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,650
you always use your power
to protect the flowers.

606
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,850
I just wonder

607
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,340
how many people like you
exist in this world.

608
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,020
I just hope

609
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,560
the one you never meant to harm

610
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,060
won't die

611
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,330
because of you.

612
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,480
What the hell

613
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,740
is Fengliu Shop doing?

614
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
With your vast connections,

615
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,630
how could you not know

616
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,560
Tang Lici is
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

617
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,280
That brat

618
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,550
just seized
the Sword Phoenix's essence
just like that

619
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,950
and stole the spotlight!

620
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,360
Sword King, you rashly promised Tang Lici

621
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,960
a public trial,

622
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,120
and all you care about
is who stole the show.

623
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,250
The Fengliu Shop is so eager
to control me.

624
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,820
Sending Madam Bai wasn't enough?

625
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,990
Now they've sent you?

626
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,710
You only knew Tang Lici

627
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,370
went up the Tianyan Sword Wall

628
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,360
but didn't realize

629
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,230
he also sent Xue Xianzi

630
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,480
to test your limits.

631
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,950
Have you truly not noticed

632
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,590
that your secret—

633
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,760
using the divine pills
to improve your sword skills—

634
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,130
has already been exposed?

635
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,860
And instead of making amends,

636
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,140
you've walked right into his trap again.

637
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,950
He's likely already seen through

638
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,750
every one of your foolish moves.

639
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,320
Master is already on his way.

640
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,450
If you still can't think of something,

641
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,120
then prepare to die.

642
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,070
Sword King,

643
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,920
here is today's

644
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,150
guest registry.

645
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,590
[Puzhu, Tianjing Pavilion; Yin Sanxiao,
Dongfang Xu, Yinqi Alliance]

646
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,270
Tang Lici may be scheming,

647
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,720
but I'm not without a counter.

648
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,730
The one to stand trial the day
after tomorrow won't be Jiang Qingyu.

649
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,960
It will be Tang Lici.

650
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,720
All I need is for your master

651
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,550
to lend me an expert in disguise.

652
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,150
Master Puzhu, since you've been ordered

653
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,610
to investigate this case,

654
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,790
I'll speak plainly.

655
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,760
When I interrogated Jiang Qingyu,

656
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,710
he wouldn't reveal

657
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,710
who was behind him—

658
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,760
only that this person

659
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,690
held great power

660
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,760
and that revealing their identity

661
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,420
could doom his entire family.

662
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,590
Besides the imperial court,

663
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,850
who else could do that?

664
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,360
Second,

665
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,310
he said the Blood Ghost Pills

666
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,510
have already spread across the jianghu,

667
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,960
not just around Mount Tai.

668
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,560
Who else but Wanqiao Chamber

669
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,540
can have a merchant network

670
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,600
spanning the world

671
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,260
and also imperial backing

672
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,340
to sell the Evil Pills

673
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,900
everywhere?

674
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,690
You think Wanqiao Chamber

675
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,590
is secretly selling the Evil Pills?

676
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,360
Exactly.

677
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm afraid I've fallen into the trap

678
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,630
set by the emperor's uncle,

679
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,360
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

680
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,860
He's been pressuring me nonstop,

681
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,660
trying to interfere
in Jiang Qingyu's trial.

682
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,480
Sword King Yu,

683
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,290
you're trying to mislead me.

684
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,580
I'm merely stating the facts.

685
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,690
I only

686
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,030
look at evidence.

687
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,770
On the day of the public trial,

688
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,370
the evidence you want

689
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,510
will be revealed.

690
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,630
No need to wait.

691
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,280
I will

692
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,120
question Jiang Qingyu now.

693
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,760
Now?

694
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,050
Some things

695
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,870
are best said
when fewer ears are listening.

696
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,770
After all,

697
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,260
aside from Tang Lici,

698
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,550
the other person

699
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,680
with such reach and resources

700
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,880
is you, Sword King Yu.

701
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,810
The innocent have nothing to fear.

702
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,100
Sir, please follow me.

703
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,510
Please come in.

704
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,610
The treasure ship of Wanqiao Chamber

705
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,670
is truly luxurious and magnificent.

706
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,930
If you get oil stains on my clothes,

707
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,240
you'll wash them yourself as always.

708
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,550
Miss Zhong.

709
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
Miss Shei.

710
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,720
You've also come to Sword King City.

711
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,450
I almost didn't recognize you.

712
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:24,690
Right?

713
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
Shei looks prettier now, right?

714
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,620
I must thank you, Miss Zhong,

715
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,210
for saving me back in Yanxian.

716
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,290
Seeing you well now

717
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
puts my heart at ease.

718
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,230
Mr. Gu,

719
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,680
don't stand on ceremony.

720
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,700
This is Chi Yun, the Cloud.

721
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,890
This is Miss Shei.

722
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,760
This is

723
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,510
Mr. Gu from the Sword Alliance.

724
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,560
Nice to meet you.

725
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,280
So,

726
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,960
you're also here

727
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,690
for that so-called Sword King?

728
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,230
Yes.

729
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,840
But Master Puzhu

730
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,970
has already gone to meet Sword King Yu.

731
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,210
Please.

732
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,850
This way.

733
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,420
What's happening?

734
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,080
Shen Langhun,

735
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,850
it's you!

736
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,710
How dare you come here

737
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,910
to kill the criminal?

738
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,560
Put out the fire!

739
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,420
Protect Sword King Yu!

740
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,240
-Yes!
-Yes!

741
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,410
Why hasn't Shen come back yet?

742
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,880
The fire's already out.

743
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,160
Has something happened to him?

744
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,680
It was

745
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,360
a trap there.

746
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,250
As expected.

747
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,830
Did anyone see you?

748
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,360
No.
