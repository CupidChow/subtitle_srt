[Episode 2]

3
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,530
[Four years ago, in the peach blossom
forest of Zhoudi Tower]

4
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,070
A friend who would move heaven and earth

5
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
to kill me.

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
A friend whom I would search

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,380
to the ends of the earth

8
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,030
just to find.

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,920
Yan,

10
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,840
for the past six months,

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
you've been avoiding me.

12
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,670
Actually, that day...

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
Back then,

14
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,780
under the blossoms stretching for miles,

15
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,820
Senior Brother taught you,

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,570
me,

17
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,700
and Zhumei our craft.

18
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,370
It was warm in the spring.

19
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,460
What a beautiful time.

20
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,990
But now,
the flowers still bloom as they did,

21
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,130
yet the people are gone.

22
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,610
After Senior Brother left,

23
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,610
Zhumei vanished without a trace.

24
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,390
In the Zhoudi Tower,

25
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,510
only you and I remain.

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,190
Lici,

27
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,770
you composed this melody back then.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,650
Today, let's play it once more for him.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,120
What do you say?

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,010
A childhood composition

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,090
could never compare to

32
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,450
Senior Brother's masterpieces.

33
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,840
But I think

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,480
this melody

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,200
is the best I've ever heard.

36
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,250
Yan…

37
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
This is the only melody

38
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,250
worthy of sending you to your grave.

39
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,840
You used a curse bug on me?

40
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,690
If you hadn't come wounded,

41
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,040
I couldn't have
planted it in you so easily.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,990
Tang Lici,

43
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,300
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

44
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,650
Yan…

45
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,390
Yan,

46
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,490
it's been four years

47
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,870
since we parted.

48
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,790
Killing me once wasn't enough for you.

49
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,430
Now,

50
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,190
you're using the Hao family massacre

51
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,480
to lure me into your trap

52
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,430
to kill me again.

53
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,650
Since that's the case,

54
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,049
I'll play along.

55
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,330
Let's see if after four years,

56
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,549
you can still manage to kill me.

57
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,150
It was him.

58
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,330
It was Tang Lici.

59
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,680
It was Tang Lici!

60
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,570
It was he

61
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,440
who told me to say this.

62
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,840
It wasn't me.

63
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Please spare me.

64
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Let me go.

65
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,790
There's someone

66
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,960
so vicious in the jianghu.

67
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,300
How dangerous.

68
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,020
Stop playing dumb.

69
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,860
Why did you kill Lord Hao?

70
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,550
For money?

71
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,120
Or did he have something

72
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,750
on you?

73
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,670
It was because...

74
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,480
Who's there?

75
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,480
Chi Yun!

76
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,060
The Blood Ghost Pill?

77
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,290
Jianghu matters
should be settled in the jianghu.

78
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,350
Either you kill me,

79
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,650
or I kill you.

80
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,430
Masters and servants
can turn on each other for money.

81
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,070
Brothers can betray and kill each other.

82
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,720
In the end,

83
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,250
the heart is the hardest to see through.

84
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,730
Demons are everywhere.

85
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
Amitabha.

86
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,910
Right and wrong, good and evil—
they're just a thought apart.

87
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
What you can't let go of is obsession.

88
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,650
You're very wise, sir.

89
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,820
Salvation lies in your own hands.

90
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
I believe

91
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,150
you'll eventually reach the other shore.

92
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,910
Yan,

93
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,290
I'm coming for you.

94
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,170
When it comes to lightness skills,

95
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,870
who can compare to me, Chi Yun,

96
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,630
the Cloud?

97
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,910
Stop!

98
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,970
A messenger goose?

99
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,630
You're from the Yanmen Sect?

100
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,240
I forgot Yanmen had this trick.

101
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Had I known,

102
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,630
I'd have raised a hawk myself.

103
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,420
Where did Chi Yun go?

104
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,410
Miss Zhong!

105
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,390
Miss Zhong!

106
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,500
Miss Shei?

107
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,440
Where did this ship come from?

108
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,070
Miss Shei, why are you here?

109
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,350
Mr. Tang brought me here.

110
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,180
He said we'd meet you here.

111
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,520
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

112
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,700
You won't be able to catch up with him.

113
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,730
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

114
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,030
And why did Miss Shei come too?

115
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,700
Since we're hunting down the culprit,

116
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,890
it's natural to bring along the victim.

117
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,320
The person you're looking for

118
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,250
has already gone dozens of li west.

119
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,870
Taking the waterway would be faster.

120
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,530
You already know everything.

121
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,740
That man is incredibly agile.

122
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,250
He's no ordinary fighter.

123
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,510
With the Cloud,

124
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,390
we won't

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,760
lose him.

126
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
And we can

127
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,930
catch up with them.

128
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,590
I never expected

129
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,570
this pleasure ship
would have such mechanisms.

130
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,320
Wait.

131
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,480
Mr. Tang, why are you so certain

132
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200
that Chi Yun will come this way?

133
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm not certain

134
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,530
about Chi Yun's route.

135
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,030
I'm just certain
where the killer is headed.

136
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,390
You mean…

137
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,050
you already know
who the killer is?

138
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,480
Due to my personal affairs,

139
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,070
I have gathered much information.

140
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,510
And coincidentally, one clue

141
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,290
points right here.

142
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
Six months ago,

143
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,000
the Westwind Swordsman, Feng Chuanxiang,

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,600
vanished mysteriously
from Liulian Cottage.

145
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,790
Only his footsteps leading into

146
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,120
the cottage were found.

147
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,620
None leading out.

148
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
It is said that

149
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,910
in Liulian Cottage,

150
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,630
there were traces
of two people living there.

151
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,570
After Feng Chuanxiang disappeared,

152
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,090
his mysterious roommate

153
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,690
vanished too.

154
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,630
And the answer

155
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670
lies in this very item.

156
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,960
A goose feather?

157
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,590
Long and resilient;

158
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,320
lustrous and smooth.

159
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,480
This is no ordinary goose feather.

160
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Messenger geese?

161
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,610
Yanmen's messenger geese?

162
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,180
100 li east of Yan County

163
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,300
is the Yanmen Sect.

164
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,440
This river flows from east to west.

165
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,370
If the killer wants
to avoid implicating Yanmen,

166
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,300
he'll head west.

167
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,690
Even if something happens
and he turns east midway,

168
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,290
he'll run right into us.

169
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
But...

170
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,570
that's impossible.

171
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,860
Why do you say that, Miss Zhong?

172
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,330
What kind of sect is the Yanmen Sect?

173
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,580
The Yanmen Sect began as a bandit clan

174
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,750
but was granted amnesty
by the former dynasty

175
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,150
and became

176
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,270
the military guards of the Yanmen Pass.

177
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,870
Their goose-training skills
are remarkable.

178
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,620
10 years ago,
when the world fell into chaos,

179
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,840
the Sword Sect led many great fighters

180
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,240
to hunt down Yique Yinyang.

181
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,750
Yanmen provided

182
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,870
crucial intelligence.

183
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,390
Its leader, Jiang Feiyu,

184
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,330
has a fiery temper,

185
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,390
but he's extremely

186
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,960
protective of his own people.

187
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,910
That's why Yanmen disciples

188
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,570
value loyalty above all else.

189
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,500
There's a saying in the jianghu:

190
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,310
"Better to offend the King of Hell's men

191
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,310
than to cross someone from Yanmen."

192
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,440
It sounds like

193
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,020
a righteous sect.

194
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
It doesn't just sound like it—

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,250
it is a righteous sect.

196
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,860
Yang Shangqing

197
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,000
was also from a righteous sect.

198
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,870
I found this

199
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,120
on Yang Shangqing.

200
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,500
To be honest,

201
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,410
my master sent me down the mountain

202
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,200
not only for the Hao family massacre

203
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
but also for this matter.

204
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,380
These evil pills

205
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,820
haven't been seen again

206
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,750
since the death of Yique Yinyang.

207
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,360
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

208
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,730
I've paid attention

209
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,730
to the Blood Ghost Pills too.

210
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
My leaving the temple

211
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,390
should tell you what I think.

212
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,520
Then…

213
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,520
Miss Zhong,

214
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,170
don't worry for now.

215
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,090
Come have some refreshments.

216
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,030
Talk.

217
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,630
Who are you?

218
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,680
Who sent you to kill that guy?

219
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,750
You think staying silent will save you?

220
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,480
Don't…

221
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
Don't push me.

222
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,970
Don't push you?

223
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,000
Then why do you think

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,310
I chased you for over 100 li?

225
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,880
For fun?

226
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,920
Brat,

227
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,500
don't take poison!

228
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,869
Even an ant fights to stay alive.

229
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,329
Please don't take poison.

230
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,780
It's not poison.

231
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,230
What the hell is that?

232
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,190
This is getting difficult.

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,560
Chi Yun, you're not

234
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,960
as good as you used to be.

235
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,930
I haven't even gone all out yet.

236
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,440
Let's stop here.

237
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
He knelt right before you.

238
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,880
The assassin who killed Yang Shangqing

239
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,550
is actually

240
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,650
Jiang Cheng.

241
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,920
Miss Zhong, you know him?

242
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,560
Jiang Cheng is the young master of Yanmen.

243
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,270
He's upright and chivalrous,

244
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,860
a close friend
of the Westwind Swordsman.

245
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,030
They often went to the Huaxi region

246
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,160
in the Sword King City

247
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,520
to fight injustice and help the weak.

248
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,330
They're known

249
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,890
as the Twin Heroes of Huaxi.

250
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
Six months ago,

251
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,830
the Westwind Swordsman

252
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,240
vanished mysteriously at home,

253
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,080
and Young Master Jiang also went missing.

254
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,610
How did he become like this?

255
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,530
What are you murmuring?

256
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,300
Foxy Tang, what are you murmuring?

257
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,440
I still need to ask him

258
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,100
why he killed Yang Shangqing.

259
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,310
Is anyone hurt?

260
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Drop the act.

261
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,570
I really don't remember anything.

262
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,520
Young Master Jiang.

263
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,350
You…

264
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,390
You've got the wrong person.

265
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,820
I'm…

266
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,920
I'm not Young Master Jiang.

267
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,310
Over a year ago,

268
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,160
I met you and Mr. Feng

269
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,710
at the Sword Sect in the Central Plains.

270
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,710
I'm not mistaken.

271
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,280
Now that we know who he is,

272
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,000
there's no need for questions.

273
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll just take him

274
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
to the Yanmen Sect

275
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,200
and let his people

276
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,410
explain for him.

277
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,310
Watch out!

278
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,040
Mr. Tang.

279
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,970
You're injured.

280
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,240
You're injured.

281
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,190
Don't use this hand for now.

282
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,000
You wanted to take your own life

283
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,450
because you were worried that your actions

284
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,770
would disgrace Yanmen's name, right?

285
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,040
Foxy Tang,

286
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,660
you were right.

287
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,140
The so-called Yanmen Sect

288
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,850
is just a bunch of filth.

289
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,030
Watch your mouth!

290
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,350
You don't know anything!

291
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,510
What should I know?

292
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,430
The Blood Ghost Pills…

293
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,200
Those evil pills

294
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,540
have resurfaced in the jianghu.

295
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,990
I thought I had the wrong person,

296
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,600
but it seems I was right.

297
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,420
You do have the wrong person.

298
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,510
I'm not him.

299
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,070
The poison has spread within you.

300
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,240
Your energy flow is reversed.

301
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,370
You don't have long.

302
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,410
You're not afraid of death,

303
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,510
but you don't want to die now.

304
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,310
You still have unfinished business.

305
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,910
Am I right?

306
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,090
If you don't want to speak

307
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,190
with all these people here,

308
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,050
we can talk privately elsewhere.

309
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Hey!

310
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,310
What's so secret

311
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,110
that it can't be said in front of us?

312
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,920
Foxy Tang

313
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,680
is being so mysterious.

314
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,140
Miss Shei,

315
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,510
how is

316
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Mr. Tang's injury from earlier?

317
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,810
Miss Zhong, don't worry.

318
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,680
Once we get back,

319
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,130
I'll apply some more medicine for him,

320
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,130
and he'll be fine.

321
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,990
But, Mr. Chi,

322
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,720
what exactly are

323
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,980
the Blood Ghost Pills?

324
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,600
Why does everyone

325
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,110
go pale

326
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,510
when they're mentioned?

327
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,920
They were created by Yique Yinyang,

328
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,110
the former dynasty's Imperial Preceptor
and leader of the Jile Sect,

329
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,270
to control people.

330
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,680
To control people?

331
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,610
In the jianghu,

332
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,900
power has always been respected above all.

333
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,640
Who doesn't want

334
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,370
to excel and rise above others?

335
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,370
But not everyone

336
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,000
has the ability and talent.

337
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,390
Greed knows no bounds.

338
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,480
The weak crave power,

339
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,190
and the strong

340
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,720
seek shortcuts to become even stronger.

341
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,130
Those evil pills

342
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,070
can give your cultivation a huge boost.

343
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,070
So initially,

344
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,480
the Blood Ghost Pills

345
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
were treated

346
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
like a popular tonic.

347
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,350
But soon after,

348
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,200
people realized

349
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,260
they'd been duped.

350
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,830
Why?

351
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
Anyone who takes those pills

352
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,910
has to keep taking them for life.

353
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,260
If they stop, they go mad and die.

354
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,090
So whoever has the Blood Ghost Pills

355
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,890
controls those people's lives.

356
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,300
Yique Yinyang

357
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,130
used this very method to seize control

358
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,520
of half the jianghu.

359
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,130
More than a year ago,

360
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,180
after arguing with my father,

361
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,100
I went to stay with Chuanxiang.

362
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,150
We lived together on Mount Huaxi,

363
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,550
practicing martial arts

364
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,830
and fighting for justice.

365
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,500
[Liulian Cottage]

366
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,970
During that time,

367
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,170
my martial skills improved dramatically.

368
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,030
I thought it was because

369
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,890
Chuanxiang was training with me.

370
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,170
But little did I know,

371
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,030
he was secretly taking evil pills

372
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,680
and mixing them into my food.

373
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
After I found out about this,

374
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,510
I confronted him
about why he spiked my food.

375
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,680
He wouldn't tell me.

376
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,130
He only told me to trust him,

377
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,370
saying he'd help me.

378
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,660
Jiang Cheng,

379
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,000
please trust me.

380
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,440
I will help you.

381
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,310
But I didn't want

382
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,310
that kind of help.

383
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,030
And I didn't need

384
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,960
to improve my skills

385
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
through such means.

386
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,350
After that,

387
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,840
I refused to take the pills again

388
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,030
and asked Chuanxiang

389
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,030
to help me suppress the poison in me.

390
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,440
But that process

391
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,600
was agonizing.

392
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,930
It was so painful that just

393
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,330
thinking about it makes my mind go blank.

394
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,570
Then, six months ago,

395
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,360
Chuanxiang suddenly disappeared,

396
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,640
leaving me alone.

397
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,440
I searched everywhere

398
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,080
but couldn't find any trace of him.

399
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,860
So I carried
the remaining pills he had bought

400
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,440
and started

401
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,700
tracing their source,

402
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,990
which eventually led me

403
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,200
to Yang Shangqing.

404
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,470
So you feared

405
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,200
Yang Shangqing

406
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,530
might expose the truth,

407
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,790
ruining the reputation of Feng Chuanxiang,

408
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,790
the Westwind Swordsman.

409
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,440
That's why,

410
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,820
even at the risk of being

411
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,220
chased down by the Cloud,

412
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,780
you still killed him.

413
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,790
If I'd had

414
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,790
any other option,

415
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,920
I never would've taken the pill again.

416
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,350
Wind swept across the reed flowers;

417
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,790
moonlight shone on Mount Huaxi.

418
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,640
We...

419
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,580
we were such good friends.

420
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,680
Mr. Tang,

421
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,110
I want to find Chuanxiang

422
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,760
and ask him

423
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,920
why he did this to me.

424
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,990
We were friends who'd die for each other.

425
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,660
Why do we have to turn against each other?

426
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,910
Very well.

427
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,050
I understand.

428
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,740
You're fortunate.

429
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,640
Today,

430
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,030
I'm in a good mood.

431
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,010
I'll give you two choices.

432
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,860
Choice one:

433
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,420
you die now.

434
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,980
That way,

435
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,690
everyone in the jianghu

436
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,380
will immediately know

437
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,990
the Jiang family of Yanmen

438
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,640
colluded with the remnants
of the Jile Sect

439
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,800
and took evil pills.

440
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,790
Choice two:

441
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,840
I help you suppress the poison,

442
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,000
and you'll die in three months.

443
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,660
Then I'll consider

444
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,170
leaving Yanmen's reputation intact.

445
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,140
What's the condition?

446
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,380
That pipa player in black—

447
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,400
you've seen him, right?

448
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,610
He revealed clues

449
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,440
that led you to Yang Shangqing,

450
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,390
didn't he?

451
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,450
He looks exactly like you.

452
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,770
He killed a lot of people

453
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,560
and saved a lot of people too.

454
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
He's a madman.

455
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,360
Where is he?

456
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,950
He is nowhere

457
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,750
yet everywhere.

458
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,700
You won't find him.

459
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,030
He only appears

460
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,360
when he wants to see you.

461
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,600
Mr. Tang…

462
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,230
help me.

463
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,560
He can't help you.

464
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,230
Because he can barely protect himself.

465
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,070
Report!

466
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,080
Master Jiang,

467
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,030
we've spotted the young master

468
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,360
in the reed marsh ahead.

469
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,270
Foxy Tang!

470
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,470
Foxy Tang, what's going on?

471
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,680
Why is he dead?

472
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,470
Look.

473
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,890
What is that?

474
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,200
This is…

475
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,100
A curse bug.

476
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,680
Oh, no.

477
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,710
The Yanmen Sect

478
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,110
must think we killed him.

479
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,160
Mr. Tang,

480
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,790
we…

481
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,790
Foxy Tang,

482
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,120
Yanmen's goose formation

483
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,850
is quite famous in the jianghu.

484
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,910
Be careful. Don't…

485
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,750
Kill!

486
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,080
I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng.

487
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm willing to go with you for punishment.

488
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,310
I plead guilty

489
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,600
and surrender myself.

490
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
Master Jiang, please temporarily

491
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,510
uphold justice for the Sword Sect.

492
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,370
Are you insane?

493
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,720
What do you mean?

494
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,120
This guy

495
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,020
is my accomplice.

496
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:00,850
Master,

497
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,290
I've completed

498
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,120
almost

499
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,440
all the tasks you gave me.

500
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,070
Now, you are

501
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,390
the esteemed Master of Fengliu Shop.

502
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,710
Tang Lici is just a nobody

503
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,040
hiding in a ruined temple in Yan County.

504
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,710
You could even

505
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,310
kill Shao Yanping

506
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,510
from the Sword Sect

507
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,370
without breaking a sweat if you wish.

508
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,620
Forgive my ignorance,

509
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,400
but why don't you

510
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,060
just kill Tang Lici outright?

511
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,840
So why go through

512
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
all this trouble?

513
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,220
What's the point

514
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,680
in killing a monster like him?

515
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,400
He can't be killed,

516
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,010
and he has no humanity.

517
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Tang Lici is certainly a monster.

518
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,230
Hua Wuyan, am I right?

519
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,900
Miss Hong.

520
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,989
Master,

521
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,989
you can't let him

522
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,420
die so easily.

523
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,070
If I can kill him once,

524
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,730
I can kill him a second time.

525
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,850
Hong,

526
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,670
tell me—

527
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,469
how should I kill him this time?

528
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,969
Naturally,

529
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,440
you should make him feel what you felt,

530
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,940
suffer what you suffered,

531
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,250
ensure he's condemned by all,

532
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,580
and completely ruin his name.

533
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,330
In the end,

534
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,630
let him die miserably

535
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,840
amid the curses of thousands.

536
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,690
Someone help!

537
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,630
I'm not his accomplice!

538
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,990
I'm just a passerby!

539
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,070
Let me out!

540
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,220
I'm innocent, I swear!

541
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,440
Look at the Yanmen Sect.

542
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,890
People are in cages

543
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,320
while birds are outside.

544
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,190
It's truly a sect

545
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,650
with no respect for rules.

546
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,650
This really has

547
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,960
opened my eyes.

548
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,470
Chi Yun,

549
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,720
be quiet.

550
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,840
What?

551
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,050
You have a plan?

552
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,590
My ears hurt.

553
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,110
You…

554
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,030
Following you

555
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,960
has brought me the worst luck ever!

556
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
"I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng."

557
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,990
Are you insane?

558
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,190
If you wanted to come in here,

559
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,550
you could've come alone.

560
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,010
Why did you bring me along?

561
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,930
I was afraid of being bored alone.

562
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,670
Why are you still carrying that thing?

563
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,870
This is his curse bug.

564
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,030
Your mortal enemy?

565
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,070
Besides him,

566
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,630
who else could have

567
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,090
used something like this?

568
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,360
Even if that's true,

569
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,400
you can't be at the end of your rope.

570
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,160
Why don't you think about

571
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,930
what his plan might be?

572
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,920
To frame you?

573
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,470
He first framed you

574
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,530
for killing Hao Wenhou and his family

575
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,090
and then pinned
Jiang Cheng's murder on you.

576
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
That's right.

577
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,600
What's right?

578
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,520
Now, unless the dead come back to life,

579
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,370
no one…

580
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,070
can prove

581
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,400
my innocence.

582
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,530
What are they doing?

583
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,110
That...

584
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,070
Foxy Tang,

585
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,470
they're about to boil us alive.

586
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,030
You're too noisy.

587
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,970
I'm starting
to regret bringing you in here.

588
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,050
Stop carving that wood!

589
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,920
Think of something!

590
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,530
They'll cook you in a bit

591
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,990
and eat you in 18 ways.

592
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,700
Neither of us will escape.

593
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,860
Think of something?

594
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,390
Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

595
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,150
Then you...

596
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,320
Because I never planned

597
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,380
to get out on my own.

598
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,000
Tang Lici,

599
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,260
you're insane, aren't you?

600
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,470
You truly are insane! I'm certain now.

601
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,800
You are insane!

602
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,630
You…

603
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,890
Mr. Jiang, please believe me.

604
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,920
I swear on my honor as a disciple

605
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,850
of the Sword Sect

606
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,670
that I'm telling the truth.

607
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,320
Enough!

608
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,630
Miss Zhong,

609
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,110
what you're saying is

610
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,910
simply too shocking to believe.

611
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,160
Cheng…

612
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,110
he was my elder brother's

613
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,150
only son.

614
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,670
I practically

615
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,800
watched him grow up.

616
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,260
I know his character well.

617
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
How could he possibly

618
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,620
have taken that kind of evil pill?

619
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,250
The evil pills have begun to spread again.

620
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,550
Mr. Tang was

621
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,280
actually helping him

622
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
suppress the poison.

623
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,520
Miss Shei can testify to this.

624
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,110
Yes.

625
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,310
Are you done talking?

626
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,420
I know,

627
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,910
Master Jiang,

628
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,760
after losing your son,

629
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,320
you're very…

630
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,650
Have you ever lost a son?

631
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
Then what do you know?

632
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,990
You know nothing!

633
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,750
Brother.

634
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,070
Brother.

635
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,870
Master Jiang.

636
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,910
Master Jiang!

637
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,830
Master Jiang.

638
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,000
There must be a reason

639
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,640
why Jiang Cheng took the pills.

640
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,020
It's up to you to uncover the truth

641
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,110
and clear his name.

642
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,720
If you let grief blind you

643
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
to the truth and evidence,

644
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,960
aren't you just playing right into

645
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,360
the real killer's hands?

646
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,960
I saw with my own eyes

647
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,330
Cheng's body explode

648
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,550
in front of Tang Lici.

649
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,330
Tang Lici has admitted it herself!

650
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,630
What more proof

651
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,720
do you need?

652
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,800
Today, I'll make sure

653
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,190
that the murderer Tang Lici

654
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,760
will suffer Yanmen's

655
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,820
Three Cuts and Six Stabs Punishment.

656
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,840
If it turns out later that I killed

657
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,760
the wrong man,

658
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,960
I'll take my own life

659
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,840
to atone for it.

660
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,330
Light the fire!

661
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,630
If they

662
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,280
really put me on that burning stake,

663
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
I'll fight my way out of here.

664
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,630
Chi Yun,

665
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,250
a lot of times,

666
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,780
only when you hit rock bottom

667
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,440
does a way out finally appear.

668
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,690
What's happening?

669
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,700
Such a nice fragrance.

670
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,440
The scent of magnolia.

671
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,630
No,

672
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,510
not flowers.

673
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,500
It's sword energy.

674
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,660
Only one person
has this kind of sword energy.

675
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,880
Who?

676
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,630
The one

677
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,180
who vanished long ago—

678
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,920
the Westwind Swordsman,

679
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,730
Feng Chuanxiang.

680
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,850
Mr. Feng?

681
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,190
I heard

682
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,190
you'd gone missing,

683
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,450
and I found it strange.

684
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,570
With such exceptional skills,

685
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,360
how could you

686
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,490
have just vanished?

687
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,720
I did encounter some problems.

688
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,320
Are you here today

689
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,470
to see Cheng?

690
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,450
Cheng has been killed.

691
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,850
I know.

692
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,550
Then why did you

693
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,750
extinguish the fire?

694
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,360
I was going to

695
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
make the murderer

696
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,390
suffer the Three Cuts
and Six Stabs Punishment

697
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,670
before burning him to ashes

698
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,760
to honor Cheng's spirit in heaven.

699
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,670
Understand?

700
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,150
I can say with certainty,

701
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,990
Master Jiang,

702
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,110
that Cheng's death is part of

703
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,440
something much bigger.

704
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,940
Cheng and I were close friends.

705
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,200
I'd never deceive you

706
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,730
about something like this.

707
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,170
You know something?

708
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,840
There is indeed something off.

709
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
If you're willing

710
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
to trust me,

711
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,520
would you allow me

712
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,880
to investigate it?

713
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,840
Brother,

714
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,610
isn't that Cheng's…

715
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,770
Master Jiang,

716
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,040
do you believe me now?

717
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,200
What do you want?

718
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,360
I want…

719
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,430
Mr. Tang.

720
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,360
I need

721
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,990
to think it over carefully.
