"I Owe Her So Much That I'll Always Repay"

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,710
Ban Xiuchun's share

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,960
has been redeemed.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,240
Those forces who followed him

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
have also been finished off.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,870
It's been 17 years.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,790
Everything is finally over.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,200
In heaven,

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,570
they can rest in peace.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,480
The business is over.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,150
What about you and Miss Ruan?

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,710
Even the old Master

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,070
doesn't want to see the two of you

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,280
torture each other.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,710
Don't worry.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,230
I won't give up on her.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,350
I owe her so much

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,680
that I'll always repay.

27
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,640
Young Master?

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
Young Master,

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,760
it's really you.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why does everybody say

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,350
you've left Shangqing City?

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,190
What's more,

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
everything about you in Guxin Store

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
has been cleared out.

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,630
Did Gu Suizhi and Ruan Shu...?

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
How dare you laugh at me?

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,240
Don't get me wrong.

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,150
In any case,

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm on your side.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,910
But I never need a loser around.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,190
It's all because of Ruan Shu

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,750
and Gu Suizhi.

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,470
Ruan Shu,

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,520
I won't let you go.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's have a discussion.

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,680
It's the first day of the lamp show.

47
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,710
Shu's proposal is perfect.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
We got reported for plagiarism.

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,430
What?

50
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,280
(Guxin Store did plagiarism.)

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,580
(It's what they always do.)

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,000
It's our original design

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,030
and they plagiarized it.

54
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,280
Then, they accused us.

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,430
Some comments say,

56
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,960
if you dare to appear on the show,

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,150
they'll give you a lesson.

58
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,510
The lamp show is our hard work.

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm the designer.

60
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,120
I'll go and explain everything.

61
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,030
Shall we ask Mr. Gu for help?

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,870
He's your boyfriend and boss.

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,030
It's his duty to protect you.

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,030
We broke up.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,470
It's been days.

66
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,750
Miss Ruan...

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
Will you really not contact her?

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
I know what to do.

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
You do?

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
What can you do?

71
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,240
You don't even know why she's angry.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Oh, here.

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
I have

74
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,310
a ticket

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,630
to their new lamp show.

76
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,750
Would you like to go?

77
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,590
If you don't, I'll have to...

78
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,150
Hello.

79
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,040
OK. I get it.

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,560
Latest news from the lamp show.

81
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,120
Miss Ruan is injured.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
She's being bandaged in her studio.

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,800
She's all right now.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,950
What is wrong with that man?

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,830
He firmly accused you of plagiarism

86
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,240
as if he was practicing justice.

87
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,800
Does he know who you are?

88
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,270
Does he know what actually happened?

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
And you.

90
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,430
Don't do anything rash, OK?

91
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,390
What if you hurt him instead?

92
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,720
He's been arrested.

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,830
And it's not a big deal.

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,040
Don't be angry.

95
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,390
I have things to do with the show.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I should go.

97
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,070
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,160
It's not serious.

99
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,040
Why would I tell you?

100
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,600
How can you say it's not serious?

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,070
You're injured.

102
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
Do you know how worried I am?

103
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,510
Now, you're just my boss.

104
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,240
Do I have to tell you everything?

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,350
And...

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,800
You hid a lot from me

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,310
and kept me worried.

108
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
Sorry. I know you mean well.

109
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,390
Don't worry.

110
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,820
I was defensive.

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
He missed hitting me.

112
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,800
The cut...

113
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,800
He... He broke a bottle.

114
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
I got the cut when I cleaned it.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
I have things to do. I should go.

116
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,910
How's everything?

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
The plagiarism is being investigated.

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
That man is guilty.

119
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,430
He deleted related posts

120
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,870
and deactivated his account.

121
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,360
Public opinions are reversing.

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
We're still investigating

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
who leaked the design.

124
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,480
We'll find him out soon.

125
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,920
Any problems?

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,390
Think about it.

127
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,430
In such a big case,

128
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,800
why didn't she tell me anything?

129
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,600
You and Miss Ruan

130
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,830
are having problems, aren't you?

131
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,130
But when she doesn't tell me anything,

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,110
we'll only alienate each other.

133
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,870
I wonder

134
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,510
if I should say this.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Spit it out.

136
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
Keeping things from her

137
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,000
is what you're good at.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,120
Now, you know how it feels

139
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
when things are kept from you, huh?

140
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,830
So, this is why she's angry.

141
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,310
Why is it so noisy early this morning?

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,160
Who's that?

143
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Who's that?

144
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
Where's the knocker?

145
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
(Sorry to interrupt, new neighbor.
Hope we'll be friends.)

146
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,630
