"Let me tell you a secret, I like you"

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,500
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,560
I received the message

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,030
the Ming and Qing Exhibition
will be restarted.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,150
Does this have anything to do with you?

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,000
You said

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,760
you won't hide anything from me anymore.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,430
Alright.

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,920
Previously, Guxin Store

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,000
resold some business operations.

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,560
After we took over,

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
we worried that the matter with Guxin Store

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,600
would affect the art exhibition.

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,640
So, we had to temporarily halt it.

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,310
Now things have become clear.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
It should be restored.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Then,

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,510
aren't you afraid I might not do it well?

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,790
No, you won't.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,920
I trust my investment judgment.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
I believe you can do it.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
Thank you.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
That's all?

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,560
I did such a good job,

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,480
could you give me a reward?

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,150
So, what do you want?

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,510
I haven't decided what I want yet.

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,280
But I do miss the time

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,120
when you were drunk.

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,350
Don't mention this again.

39
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,400
Shu…

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,510
- This is Ruan Shu's Yuanbao Pavilion?
- Shu, are you at home?

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,640
How did they get here?

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,280
Quick, hide yourself!

43
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,430
No.

44
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,630
Am I someone who can't be seen by others?

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,280
No, it's just that you're my leader now.

46
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,630
Could you avoid suspicion, please?

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Shu, are you at home?

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,910
- Yes, I am.
- Hide yourself!

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,080
Mr. Jin, Meng.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,240
Why are you here?

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Didn't we agree to
have dinner together tonight?

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,240
We came to find you

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,710
and visit your Yuanbao Pavilion.

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,030
Sorry for the disturbance.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,190
Not at all.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Wen Yin, please take them for a tour.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll change my shoes.

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
Really nice.

59
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,630
Nice.

60
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,240
Gu Suizhi, Gu Suizhi.

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,310
What are you doing?

62
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,030
I am dissatisfied.

63
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,190
Why our honest relationship

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,870
seems like a stealthy affair?

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,710
How much longer
will you to keep me secret?

66
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,430
We came here in such a hurry today.

67
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,630
Will it disturb Shu's personal life?

68
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,590
Shh.

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
Mr. Jin,

70
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,910
you are overthinking it.

71
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,520
Shu is currently single.

72
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,560
Single?

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,120
I've seen Mr. Gu of
Baisheng Hall waiting for her

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,030
at the company entrance many times.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- Mr. Gu is a leader in our industry.
- Shh.

76
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,590
It seems Shu

77
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,150
should seize the opportunity this time.

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,990
Did you hear that?

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
Your colleague told you to seize me.

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Stop it.

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,470
When do you plan to

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,520
make our relationship public?

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
Let me think about it, okay?

84
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,590
Tonight, I will announce it.

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,000
Shu!

86
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,710
I'm coming.

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,630
Wait for me a moment.

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,430
I'll give you some time to confess.

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,430
I'll pick you up in the evening.

90
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Bye-bye.

91
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,120
The dishes are good.

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Yes.

93
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,680
How about we…

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Have a drink first.

95
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,750
- Cheers!
- Come, cheers!

96
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,520
Today,

97
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
we are not just celebrating

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,750
the completion of
Fengxian Tea House project,

99
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,590
but also to wish
the Ming and Qing Exhibition

100
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
goes smoothly.

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,190
The greatest contributor to
Fengxian Tea House project

102
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,270
is undoubtedly Shu.

103
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,360
Let's give her a round of applause!

104
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,270
It's all thanks to everyone's efforts.

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
Moreover,

106
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,040
I especially want to thank Mr. Jin.

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
You have taught me so much.

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,280
Thank you for your hard work.

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,430
Not at all.

110
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,240
The Ming and Qing Exhibition
will start in a few days.

111
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
Let's keep up the good work. Fighting!

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,510
- Okay.
- Come. Keep going.

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
Let's have another drink.

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
- Fighting!
- Cheers!

115
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,040
You drink so quickly.

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Cheers!

117
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,270
Cheers!

118
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,240
Wish everything goes well.

119
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,240
Listen, Shu,

120
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,240
- We definitely will…
- Be careful.

121
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,190
- get rich, very rich.
- Be careful.

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Mr. Jin,

123
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,270
Mr. Jin, thank you.

124
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,920
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Mr. Jin.

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
You are welcome.

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,830
Why did you let her drink so much?

127
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,240
I didn't know Shu would
be drunk so easily.

128
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Shu,

129
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,480
didn't you say

130
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,390
your boyfriend would come to pick you up?

131
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,510
Has he arrived?

132
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,160
Big Black Cat.

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830
Isn't he over there?

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,750
Come over here.

135
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
Come on.

136
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,630
The friend you mentioned

137
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,360
is Mr. Gu?

138
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
That's right.

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
Why don’t I think so?

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Let me introduce myself.

141
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
I am

142
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,560
Shu's boyfriend.

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,070
Thank you all for your help.

144
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,320
Let's go.

145
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,600
Goodbye, Mr. Jin.

146
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,040
- Be safe, Shu.
- Bye-bye.

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,510
They left.

148
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,060
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

149
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,910
Alright,

150
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,230
we're home.

151
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,790
Get down now.

152
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
No.

153
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
You are causing trouble again.

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,080
What do you want to do?

155
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,600
I want you to take me for a walk.

156
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,830
Let's go over there.

157
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,600
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

158
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,270
Go over there.

159
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,720
Go over there again.

160
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Are you satisfied now?

161
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,430
Gu Suizhi,

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,270
they all say

163
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,070
you are the most terrifying man in Shangqing,

164
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,070
why do you listen to me so well?

165
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,800
Do you know why?

166
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes,

167
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,240
because you like me.

168
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,870
I'll tell you a secret,

169
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,710
okay?

170
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,800
I like you, too.

171
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,000
I think

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
the best decision I ever made was

173
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,480
I signed the agreement with you
four years ago.

174
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,430
Alright, drunkard.

175
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,900
It's time to go back to sleep.

176
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,740
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

177
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,470
Awake?

178
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,390
I still want to sleep a little longer.

179
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,070
Last night,

180
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,510
I was harassed by a drunkard

181
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,830
for half the night.

182
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
Gu Suizhi,

183
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,550
how about I return
the Luminous Jade to you?

184
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,870
After all, it's the treasure of
the Ban Family originally.

185
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Nonsense.

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
My treasure

187
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,550
is in my arms.

188
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,840
I feel so happy now.

189
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,720
I want to stay happy
with you like this forever.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
(Unfortunately…)

191
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
Young Master,

192
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
you asked us to intentionally
tell Ruan Shu

193
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,790
that Gu Suizhi killed her father.

194
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,120
We did it.

195
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,550
Today, we were called here.

196
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,670
Is there something you need?

197
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,630
I heard

198
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
that recently, Gu Suizhi

199
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,670
has caused you a lot of trouble.

200
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,030
It's all because of Ruan Shu.

201
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,790
Let's not mention Ruan Shu today.

202
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,750
You were once married to Ruan Shu's father.

203
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,030
Regarding the Jade Guardian,

204
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,630
how much do you know?

205
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,120
I know a bit about it.

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,870
Do you know

207
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
why the Ban Family

208
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,150
has always needed the Ruan Family

209
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,720
as the Guardian of the Luminous Jade?

210
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Didn’t you know

211
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,720
the curse from a hundred years ago
on that Luminous Jade?

212
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,390
Curse from a hundred years ago?

213
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,440
