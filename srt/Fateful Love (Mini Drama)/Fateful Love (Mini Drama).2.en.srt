Young Master, it's confirmed.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,620
The item is with the woman called

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,970
(Four Years Later)
Ruan Shu.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Ruan Shu?

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,700
Ruan Xiaming's daughter.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,650
It's true the Luminous Jade cannot
be separated from the Jade Guardian.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,410
Luminous Jade is crucial to Guxin Store.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,660
How about we just take it directly?

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,880
(Ban Xiuchun, Young Master of Guxin Store)

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,300
Ban Ling said,

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,810
there is a curse on the Luminous Jade.

21
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,530
Without the Jade Guardian,

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,700
even if we get it,

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,450
it's a path to self-destruction.

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,050
But recently,
Gu Suizhi from Baisheng Hall

25
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,290
(Yuan Ying, Young Master's assistant)
always targeted us in secret.

26
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,370
Shouldn't we find a way to respond?

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,010
Of course we should.

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,060
We will get

29
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,650
Luminous Jade, too.

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,570
Isn't Mr. Gu getting married?

31
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,820
We Guxin Store

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,410
will send him a wedding gift.

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,570
Your heart disease

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,550
(Shangqing City)
has been occurring more frequently.

35
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,010
The curse of Luminous Jade
on the Ban Family

36
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,900
has come true.

37
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,050
Yes.

38
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,930
I'm almost thirty years old.

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,370
Without the heart blood of the Ruans',

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,620
you will die.

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,010
Then your four-year plan
will fall through.

42
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,850
You should tell Miss Ruan the truth
as soon as possible.

43
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,120
(Gu Suizhi, a hundred years later)
Half a month later,

44
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,540
(Manager of Baisheng Hall)
I will give her a perfect wedding.

45
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,570
Before this,

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,260
she needn't know anything.

47
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,540
How dare you sell counterfeit items

48
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,850
to an antique store.

49
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,210
You are Gu Suizhi?

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,820
Hand him over to the police.

51
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,250
What do you want to do?

52
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,300
I don't go to the police.

53
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,280
I don't go.

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,920
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu, I tell you.

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,340
The counterfeits on my hand

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,490
were released by Sun Ronghua.

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,460
Mr. Gu!

58
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,490
Behind Kungu Store

59
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,650
are the people from the Guxin Store.

60
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,900
These despicable scoundrels

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,060
have occupied Guxin Store

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,090
and your identity,

63
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,460
they dare to do such a

64
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,420
self-destructive thing.

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,690
Ban Ling's meticulous planning

66
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,650
is actually digging his own grave.

67
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,300
How has he been lately?

68
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,350
He has been claiming to be ill
for several months.

69
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,090
It should be his fake nephew

70
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,240
did something behind the scenes.

71
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,250
We are trying to get close to them.

72
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Even if we don't take the initiative
to get closer,

73
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,690
they might

74
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,860
not hold back for too long.

75
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,930
I said the veil

76
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,580
looks best when custom-made.

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,530
It will definitely be stunning
when the time comes.

78
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,080
Thank you, Miss Wen.

79
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,690
The porridge is burnt.

80
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,090
By the way, Wen Yin,

81
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,530
we'll need your help during the wedding.

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,140
Yutong,

83
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,210
the wedding ceremony is about to begin.

84
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,690
Why are you here?

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,770
Who are you?

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,690
Why do you look exactly like Suizhi?

87
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,530
Beisheng!

88
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,860

89
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,700
Beisheng!

90
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,860
Yutong,

91
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,100
my family did wrong,

92
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,690
I am willing to die

93
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,220
to repay,

94
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,570
to ease your pain.

95
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,980
No.

96
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,890
I won't let you die.

97
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,490
Luminous Jade.

98
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,860
Luminous Jade can save you.

99
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,250
The endless night extinguishes the stars.

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,740
The sun and moon
give birth to eternal light.

101
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,580
Stop.

102
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,220
You will be cursed.

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,020
Yutong,

next life,

105
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,620
would you be willing to guide me?

106
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,570
Beisheng.

107
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,620
Lover's Blood!

108
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,010
Enemy's Tears!

109
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,860
Lover's Blood!

110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,370
Enemy's Tears!

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,980
Why are you up so early?

112
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,330
I don't know why

113
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,690
I always dream about the legend of

114
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,300
the Ruan Family and the Luminous Jade.

115
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,210
It seems

116
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,220
you are too nervous

117
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,570
to become my wife.

118
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,660
It's not true.

119
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,370
Wasn't it you who was in a hurry
to marry me?

120
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,840
Otherwise, I think

121
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,450
the agreement between us

122
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
can continue for another generation.

123
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,490
Many people will come to our wedding.

124
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,010
At that time,

125
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,620
don't wear this jade.

126
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,180
Why?

127
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,620
After all, this is a relic left by your father.

128
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,850
There are many people and
prying eyes at the wedding.

129
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,370
I'm afraid it's not safe.

130
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,500
Alright.

131
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,130

Dad, can my illness really be cured?

138
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,220
I feel so uncomfortable.

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, it will be, as long as
we have Luminous Jade,

Be careful. Step on the brake.

Uncle,

152
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,370
even after lying for so long,
you are still restless.

153
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,900
But,

154
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,620

Only I know,

just like

160
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,300
you often told me when I was a child.

161

As long as you obey.

162
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,180

165
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,380
Mr. Ban,

166
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,890
Ruan Shu's stepmother
has been arranged well.

167
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,900
Shh.

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
Uncle,

169
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,330
as for the Ruan family's Luminous Jade,

170
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,330
I will use my own method

171
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,010
to take it back.

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

173
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,780
What a lousy place!

174
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,980
So it was you.

175
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,300
What are you doing here?

176
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,300
I asked Li to find someone
to repair the bracelet.

177
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,810
So it was you.

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,140
It seems that in these past years,

179
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,450
Gu Suizhi didn't treat you well either.

180
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,300
You need to make money from this.

181
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,500
I learned this craft from my Dad.

182
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,850
I don't like you.

183
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,200
As soon as my Dad passed away,

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,140
you went to great lengths to

185
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,880
get all the treasures of
the Yuanbao Pavilion to remarry.

186
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,540
Stop pretending to be so filial.

187
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,850
If you truly have integrity,

188
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,690
you will not marry your enemy.

189
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,730
What enemy?

190
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,970
I don't care if you truly don't know

191
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,020
or pretend not to know.

192
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,450
Wan, let's go.

193
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,170
Stop!

194
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,690
Aunt Chen,

195
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,210
since you are here today,

196
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,260
please return my Dad's seal to me.

197
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,900
I will use it to reopen Yuanbao Pavilion.

198
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,690
What a funny joke!

199
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,020
That thing was taken away
by your man long ago.

200
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
If you don't believe it,

201
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,380
just look for it yourself.

202
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,570
Come to supervise my work?

203
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,090
About the wedding matters,

204
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,810
I haven't relaxed at all.

205
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,540
It's not about the wedding.

206
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,570
It's about the reopening of
the Yuanbao Pavilion.

207
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,140
Have you thought about it?

208
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,330
I'm too busy with
the wedding preparations.

209
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,280
Why did you think of
the Yuanbao Pavilion again?

210
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,610
It's been four years.

211
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,210
Why every time I mention it,

212
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,260
you just brush me off?

213
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,450
This matter

214
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,770
can't be rushed.

215
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
Leave it to me,

216
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,530
alright?

217
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,960

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,330
