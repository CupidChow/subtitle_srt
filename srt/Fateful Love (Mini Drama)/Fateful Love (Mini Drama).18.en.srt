11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,280
According to Dr. Song,

12
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,350
Miss Ruan

13
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,230
is all right.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,640
The datura toxin is strong.

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,070
She had IV fluids.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,710
She needs some time
to regain consciousness.

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,070
Ban Xiuchun ran away.

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,280
Our men went to Guxin Store.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,750
They're still looking for him.

20
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,920
Keep looking.

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,400
Miss Ruan

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,310
was going to use her blood

23
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,920
to activate the Luminous Jade.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,590
It means she really loves you.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
You're her Mr. Right.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Whatever relationship we're in now,

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,840
in the beginning,

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,000
I did have selfish desires.

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,190
I wanted to use her.

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,150
So,

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,400
when she wakes up,

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,400
however we may end up,

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
it's fine with me.

34
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,990
You're awake?

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
How do you feel?

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Be careful.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,590
Drink the decoction.

38
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,680
When you're with me,

39
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,120
how do you feel?

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,190
Really great.

41
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you sure?

42
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,710
Why?

43
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,590
Because

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,960
it's you.

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
You're also injured.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Go back for some rest.

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,750
You don't have to stay with me.

48
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,920
I have to handle some business.

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,950
I'll be back soon.

50
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,750
On this thumb drive

51
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,750
is the proof
of Ban Xiuchun's guilt over the years.

52
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,800
Including how he imprisoned Miss Ruan

53
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,040
and injured her.

54
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,480
Now, we can give this

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
- to the police.
- No need.

56
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,630
Just make sure he won't return

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,950
or hurt Shu again.

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
You'll let him go?

59
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,870
But he did so many...

60
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,000
After all,

61
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,310
his family helped my ancestors.

62
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,270
From now on,

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,390
I no longer want to be stuck

64
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,310
in such hatred.

65
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,950
All I want is to live with Shu.

66
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,590
Fine.

67
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,110
Shu.

68
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,470
Shu?

69
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,560
Suizhi,

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,630
I wish you happiness.

(Yuanbao Pavilion)

73
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,160
- Wen Yin.
- Suizhi, don't do this.

74
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,240
Shu told me everything.

75
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,310
It's good for you
to give each other some time.

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Shu...

77
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,270
Where is she?

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
I don't know.

79
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Beisheng.

80
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Beisheng.

81
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
What's happening?

82
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,390
What are these?

83
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Young Master.

84
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
Young Master.

85
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,510
Why are you still here?

86
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
I heard Gu Suizhi asked you

87
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
to leave Shangqing City.

88
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,360
Why?

89
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,510
Why do I have to lose everything?

90
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Young Master,

91
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,670
let me see you off.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
No.

93
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,750
I still have things to do.

94
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,710
Young Master.

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,640
Leave me alone!

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
You're from the Ruan Family?

97
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,390
Don't look for me anymore.

98
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,990
Miss Ruan,

99
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
you get Mr. Gu wrong.

100
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you know what he did for you?

101
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,360
Half a month ago,

102
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,200
he transferred you his share

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
of Guxin Store.

104
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,710
And...

105
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,000
He's dying.

106
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Shu.

107
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,390
Go home with me.

108
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
It's dangerous here.

109
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't you have anything to tell me?

110
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,350
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
For what?

112
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,360
Mr. Liu just told me.

113
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,320
Half a month ago,

114
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,410
you transferred me your share

115
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,380
of Guxin Store.

116
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,790
But you kept it from me,

117
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,150
just like always.

118
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,990
I just...

119
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,550
I just wanted to do something for you.

120
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,480
Why did you never tell me

121
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,910
what you were going to do?

122
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,390
About my father.

123
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,240
About the Luminous Jade and your disease.

124
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,000
Why do you always deprive me
of my right to choose and know

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
in the name of protecting me?

126
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
Shu,

127
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,120
I just don't want you

128
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,600
to be hurt.

129
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,960
So, you make every decision?

130
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
Gu Suizhi,

131
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,360
you don't want a beloved woman,

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,320
but a clinging vine.

133
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,150
I'm not a clinging vine, though.

134
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Shu.

135
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,750
I will try hard

137
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,750
to make it up.

138
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,510
You'd better let me go.

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Sorry.

140
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,630
