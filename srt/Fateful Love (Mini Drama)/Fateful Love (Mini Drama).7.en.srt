Don't be stubborn.

You should at least tell Miss Ruan.

The Art Exhibition is suspended

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't you refuse her to
work at Guxin Store?

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,030
She is stubborn.

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,470
The things you don't let her do,

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,960
she will complete it at all costs.

If so,

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,560
I'd better let her work
under my supervision.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
It would be more convenient
to protect her.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Moreover, given her capabilities,

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,360
this case is a piece of cake for her.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,190

85
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,080
that it was you who…

86
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,310

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,870

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,390

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,070
It will be our focus in the upcoming work.

95
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,870

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes. I heard it's a new brand
of Baisheng Hall.

97
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,360
They have always been our competitors.

98
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
they give such a good project to us.

100
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,360

101
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,160

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,040
What gossip are you trying to spread?

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Is she afraid of me talking about it?

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Four years ago,

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,070
her father just passed away.

106
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,920
She voluntarily became Gu Suizhi's canary.

107
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,510
Otherwise, how could we

108
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,510
receive this project?

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
Of course, it is Ruan Shu's contribution.

110
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,680
Are you done yet?

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,510
My relationship with Gu Suizhi

112
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,680
has nothing to do with my work.

113
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,950
If you continue to gossip here,

114
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,560
I don't mind telling everyone

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
when my father was still alive,

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,390
how you and Chen Qiaoyin
emptied the Ruan Family

117
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,270
and contacted your stepfather.

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Nonsense.

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
Am I talking nonsense?

120
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,040
You know it.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,950
Ruan Shu,

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,750
about what you said,

123
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,720
you will have to pay the price.

124
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,040
Are you sure this will work?

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Sure.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
As long as you let her drink it,

127
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,800
the rest

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,680
relies on me.

129
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,950
Then I wish you good luck tonight.

130
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,920
However,

131
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
compared to her,

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,310
I am more interested in

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,070
you.

134
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll leave it to you.

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm going on a date.

136
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,350
Good luck.

137
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,240
Mr. Qian will come later.

138
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,390
Don't mess it up.

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,960
Got it.

It's already after work hours.

143
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,870
How about we have dinner together

144
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,430
and chat?

145
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,270
Mr. Qian,

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,950
I think we'd better talk about the work

147
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,510
at the company.

148
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Look.

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Miss Ruan,

150
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,430

151
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,870
How about

152
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,750
I take you home?

153
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320

154
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320

155
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,800
Let me take you home.

156
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,430
You can't walk?

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
You can't walk.

158
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,480
What do you want to do?

159
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,270
What do I want to do?

160
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,190
Let go of me.

161
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,800
Why are you worried?

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,870
Let go of me.

163
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
What are you going to do?

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,190
- Miss Ruan.
- Mr. Qian, what are you doing?

165
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,480
Qian Jinhong has been up there
for a while.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,560
Why hasn't Miss Ruan come down yet?

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,590
Let's take a look.

168
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,910
Little wild horse.

169
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,910
Here I come.

170
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,550
I'm coming.

171
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Don't move.

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,560
How could she be like this?

173
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,670
Nothing.

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,510
Speak.

175
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,510
Philter.

176
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,350

179
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,270

- Move.

180

Why are you here?

187
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Didn't you abandon me?

188
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
I never abandon you.

189
