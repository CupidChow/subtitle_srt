"I'll Have the Retribution for You"

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,470
You seem to have a hard time
pursuing your girl.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,240
Are you here

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
to say all that garbage?

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,520
We found out who leaked the design.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,150
Chen Wan had it stolen.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,350
Leave it to our lawyer.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,090
What did you say?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Chen Wan

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
brought Ban Xiuchun into Guxin Store.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,430
Now, he's in the old house.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
He requested

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,150
you and Ruan Shu should be there.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,760
Or he'll burn Guxin Store.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,200
Inside Guxin Store

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,640
is the smog of datura.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,350
No one dares to go near it.

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,820
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,640
Why is it you?

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,150
Sorry, Miss Ruan.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
But you have to go with me.

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,790
Immediately.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Lan Ze?

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,040
It seems to be Ban Xiuchun's handwriting.

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,400
Is it his?

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,350
Precisely,

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,230
it was left by Lan Ze a century ago.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,710
A century ago?

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,150
What else do you know?

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,400
You guys have to figure out the rest.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I just want him to have no regrets.

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
We guys?

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,350
Do you mean Gu Suizhi?

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,150
Gu Suizhi was poisoned with datura.

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,280
If he and Young Master burn the yard,

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,150
the smog will spread

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,800
and the whole city will be in danger.

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,470
For Gu Suizhi and this city,

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,030
help him untangle his mental knots.

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,940
(Lan Ze)

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Suizhi.

50
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,280
Suizhi.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Suizhi.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,430
Beisheng.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Yutong! Beisheng!

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Beisheng!

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Yutong.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Beisheng.

57
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,310
Yutong.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Beisheng.

59
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,150
Beisheng.

60
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,870
Lan Ze.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Finally,

62
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,360
you don't need
to be my scapegoat anymore.

63
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,310
Beisheng,

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,190
does the Luminous Jade

65
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,560
value more than the friendship

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,360
where we grew up together?

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,360
I used to be suffering every day.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,590
If one day,

69
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,470
I have to choose

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,030
among you, my family,

71
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,000
and Ruan Yutong,

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,710
what can I do to protect everyone?

73
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,560
Now, I no longer need to suffer.

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,870
But I've hurt everyone.

75
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,400
Without her family

76
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,630
and without you,

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
when Yutong wakes up,

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,150
how can she get through the pain?

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,190
Even if I stay by her side,

80
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,190
my family

81
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,680
will give her more pain

82
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,240
than facing this miserable life.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,630
It's the poison of datura.

84
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,590
Drink it

85
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,680
and everything will be a dream.

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
When you wake up,

87
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,310
you and Yutong

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,630
will live the life you've longed for.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,720
From now on,

90
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
I will have

91
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,390
the retribution for you.

92
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,070
Datura wine.

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,720
The ground is covered with lamp oil.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,920
Aren't you afraid

95
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,630
you'll be burned to pieces?

96
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,040
You won't do that.

97
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,920
You want me to see

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,630
how you destroy everything.

99
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
Not me alone.

100
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,430
We will do that.

101
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,870
Gu Suizhi,

102
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,630
you and I are the same person.

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,600
We don't have to live.

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,390
For either Guxin Store or the city,

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,510
destruction

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,680
is the beginning of everything.

107
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,950
Too bad.

108
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Ban Ling can't see this.

109
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,000
The wine in the flask

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,950
makes people drunk for years.

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Those who live on belief

112
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,070
mostly die in their obsession.

113
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,800
Sometimes,

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,720
to people who are alive,

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
staying conscious

116
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,830
is also painful.

117
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,670
Lan Ze,

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,270
this is the letter

119
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,600
Ban Ling left you before he died.

120
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,950
Lan Ze?

121
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,950
For a dozen years,

122
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,830
I haven't heard this name.

123
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,800
That year, Ban Ling brought you back.

124
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,360
In the beginning,

125
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,720
he took you as his own son.

126
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,120
Later, he had more love for you

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
and more mixed feelings.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
When he realized

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,510
the look in the young man's eyes

130
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,360
got more like his,

131
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,430
he began to fear.

132
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
He feared

133
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,830
he would turn you
into a version of himself.

134
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,480
So,

135
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,830
he pushed you away

136
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,270
and meanwhile,

137
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,750
he wanted to get salvation from you.

138
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,600
At last, Ban Ling

139
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,160
felt guilty for you.

140
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,240
He ruined himself.

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
He ruined you, too.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,920
It's funny!

143
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
The oppressor wanted salvation.

144
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,950
But none of that matters now.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,120
Lan Ze

146
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,800
is just a name I abandoned.

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,390
Nothing will stop my plan.

148
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,510
Gu Suizhi,

149
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
you and Ruan Shu

150
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,800
and this store

151
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,190
will be burned with me

152
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,630
