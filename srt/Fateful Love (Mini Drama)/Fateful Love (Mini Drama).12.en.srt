"I Like You, Too"

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,750
Aren't you here to take care of me?

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,600
Why do I compete with your work
for attention?

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,750
Thanks to you,

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,320
the Fengxian Tea House project
moved very smoothly

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
The Store's projects are increasing.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,840
I need to prepare for the next project.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,840
Now this has become my fault.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,560
So,

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,710
you decided to

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,950
stay at Guxin Store?

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,350
If I stay there,

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,760
will it cause you any trouble?

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,430
You and that fake Ban Xiuchun…

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,950
Wait until the time is right,

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,840
I will tell you everything.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
Alright?

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,790
Okay.

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,920
But

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
before that,

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,350
are you sure you won't

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,950
take me out of your blacklist?

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
0921, handle it yourself.

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,920
0921.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,200
What does 0921 mean?

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,270
None of your business.

35
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,120
Listen,

36
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,840
Now it's you who is chasing me.

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,680
Considering what you are acting,

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,920
I think it's quite impossible.

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,870
I've never pursued anyone before.

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,430
I don't know how to make you happy.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,560
So?

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
So,

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Miss Ruan,

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,310
can you teach me

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,710
how

46
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,400
I can return to your side?

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Why don't you answer it?

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Ignore it.

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,870
What about

50
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,750
we continue?

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,470
Hello?

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,840
Why did you hang up on me?

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,590
Ban Ling went to Guxin Store.

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,030
What's wrong?

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,750
The company matters.

56
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,000
I have to go there.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,980
(Guxin Store)

58
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,710
Uncle,

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
impressive!

60
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,800
I haven't found you yet,

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,680
you come out on your own.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,360
Ban Xiuchun,

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,280
you forged the transfer documents,

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
and illegally transferred

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,470
the assets of Guxin Store.

66
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,030
What

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
makes you deserve this position?

68
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,590
I don't deserve.

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
Do you deserve it?

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,800
Revealing what happened seventeen years ago

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,560
wouldn't benefit anyone, would it?

72
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,960
You have seen it.

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,150
The shareholders

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
have already voted for me as

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
the new manager of Guxin Store.

76
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,120
Uncle,

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,520
is there any need for you
to struggle further?

78
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,750
Overseas accounts

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,710
have already been frozen.

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,680
Guxin Store

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,800
is about to be ruined by Ban Xiuchun.

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,870
Everyone, please think carefully.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
Old Master,

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
we are all business people.

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,390
Now is the era of commercial society,

86
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,270
one must accept
the outcome of the competition.

87
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,680
We don't have the surname Ban.

88
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,680
We don't understand those old rules.

89
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,750
We only care about profit.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,390
Who is valuable to us,

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,630
we will choose him, right?

92
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,950
Do you agree?

93
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,790
Wait a moment.

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Gu Suizhi?

95
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,720
Guxin Store sold fake antiques

96
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
and conducted

97
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,390
illegal operations in Germany.

98
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,270
This severely damaged the reputation
of Chinese antique dealers

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
and the interests of collectors.

100
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,630
As the largest shareholder
of Guxin Store,

101
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,480
I announce that

102
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,720
today's meeting decisions

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,950
are all nullified.

104
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,430
These are the shares transferred
by Mr. Ban Ling

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
during his severe illness

106
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,950
and the contract of my acquisition

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,680
of Guxin Store's shares from Mr. Yin.

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,270
Isn't it Gu Suizhi from Baisheng Hall?

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
What's going on here?

110
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,360
Hasn't the Ban Family always been

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,390
the largest shareholder?

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,510
Starting from today,

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,160
Guxin Store will rectify
its overseas business,

114
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,870
close offshore transactions,

115
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,240
self-inspect the supply chain,

116
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,750
and restructure domestic businesses.

117
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,430
This is not a request for your opinions.

118
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,920
It is a notification.

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,390
Ban Xiuchun was right.

120
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,070
Mr. Ban is indeed formidable.

121
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,160
He was not only able to escape from me,

122
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,270
but also wanted to
rely on his own strength

123
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,240
to disrupt the Council.

124
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,310
Suizhi,

125
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,150
no,

126
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,360
Chun…

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Mr. Ban,

128
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,160
don't you think this name is ironic?

129
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,510
I know

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,560
I let you down.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,070
Even if I use my life,

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
I can't repay you.

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,120
If so, shut your mouth.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
Because of your desires,

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
you took away my parents' lives.

136
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Tell me, what exactly did they do wrong?

137
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,430
The car accident

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
seventeen years ago

139
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
always lingers in my mind.

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,750
That's a heart-wrenching pain.

141
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,750
Mr. Ban,

142
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,510
My hatred

143
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,480
shouldn't be tainted by your repentance.

144
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,950
After losing all power,

145
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,870
you finally remembered to regret it,
didn't you?

146
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,120
Ban Ling,

147
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,270
greedy people like you

148
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,430
deserve to live with nothing.

149
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,160
It'd be best if you lived a long life.

150
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,240
I will confess.

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,310
I will confess.

152
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,660
Miss Ruan, Mr. Gu is...

153
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,630
I come to find you.

154
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Find me?

155
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,870
Suizhi told me everything.

156
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,870
His illness

157
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,240
will require your continued care in the future.

158
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,630
Miss Ruan, please don't bluff me.

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,430
Mr. Gu just has a

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
bit of cold.

161
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
You said that I was bluffing you.

162
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,190
So, besides the illness,

163
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,120
he is hiding something else
from me, right?

164
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,670
Miss Ruan,

165
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,510
you just need to know that

166
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,720
everything Mr. Gu does

167
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,720
is for you.

168
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
That's from his perspective.

169
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,390
What about me?

170
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,550
I can't take one more thing

171
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,320
that he is hiding from me.

172
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,720
If you don't tell me, I'll ask him.

173
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Miss Ruan, please calm down.

174
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,720
The matter is completely…

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Hello?

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,040
Ban Ling

177
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,390
confessed his crime.

178
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,270
But,

179
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,110
Mr. Gu

180
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,360
seems to have disappeared.

181
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,240
Suizhi!

182
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,440
Suizhi!

183
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,040
- Looking for me?
- Where are you?

184
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,720
Outside your house.

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,560
Wait for me.

186
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,780
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

187
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,780
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

188
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,630
Little girl,

189
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,750
why are you so worried?

190
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Gu Suizhi,

191
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,790
how are you feeling now?

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,440
I thought I would be very happy.

193
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,080
Seventeen years of hatred

194
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,150
finally settled.

195
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,240
The burden in my heart
has also been lifted.

196

But

197
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,720
he had written a confession letter
very early on.

198
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,720
Over the past seventeen years,

199
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,870
he must have thought about it day and night.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,390
and have never felt at ease either.

201
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,790
You came to find me in such a hurry

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
just to ask this?

203
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,360
Your feelings must be
very complicated right now.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
I want to stay with you.

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,960
Shu,

206
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,000
go get some sleep.

207
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm leaving.

208
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,590
Don't worry.

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm fine.

210
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
