you are making a name for your shop.

190
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,510
But you don't have to

191
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,630
ruin my business, right?

192
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,670
Two beautiful ladies,

193
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,750
you look unfamiliar.

194
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,030
Is this your first day
in the antique business?

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,630
Old man,

196
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll let you off the hook today.

197
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,750
But as for you two beautiful ladies,

198
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,390
I'd like to have a good chat with you.

199
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,600
Why?

200
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,050
Are you planning to retaliate after
deliberately selling counterfeits?

201
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,560
Retaliate?

202
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,440
Today, I will teach you

203
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,390
the rules of entering the antique business.

204
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,230
