You are an excellent businessman.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,320
Baisheng Hall is the youngest and

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
the best auction house in Shangqing.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Kungu Store hopes to
pay twice the market price

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,350
to acquire your next season's
auction items.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,350
I am not interested

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,750
in dirty money.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,840
If your collection is sold
to Kungu Store,

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,110
we will circulate them in
the global secondary market,

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,600
and share half of the profits with you.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,870
Mr. Yin,

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,950
what you care about is

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,640
the collection of our Baisheng Hall

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,560
or the painting of Mountain and Half Moon

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,040
that was lost seventeen years ago?

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,790
Mr. Gu, what are you talking?

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,950
This is slander.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,040
Everyone knows

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,120
the authentic painting is in the
exhibition hall of Kungu Store.

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,590
How can you say this?

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,240
Hello?

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,520
Mr. Gu,

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,080
after identification and evaluation,

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,430
The initial public offering of

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,670
the Mountain and Half Moon collection

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,560
you commissioned at the
Liechtenstein Art Exchange

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,230
will take place at 9:00 this morning.

37
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,340
Each share is valued at
approximately one hundred dollars.

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,290
Once released,

39
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,410
the painting will be exhibited
in museums around the world.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,050
There is

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,060
half an hour left until your IPO.

42
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,570
You can stop trading fifteen minutes
before the market opens.

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,860
In fifteen minutes,

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,620
will Kungu Store

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
lose tens of millions of dollars

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,150
or be accused of

47
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,310
selling fake paintings in the world?

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,280
Mr. Yin,

49
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,870
you must make a careful decision.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Mr. Gu,

51
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,630
you really are

52
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,960
a master strategist.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,640
Mr. Yin,

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,240
since you have entered the game,

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,680
you must fulfill your duties.

56
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,180
(Company Mortgage Contract)

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,900
(Company Mortgage Contract)

58
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,960
Kungu Store's

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,710
efforts of five generations

60
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,590
cannot

61
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,910
end in my hands.

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Absolutely not.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,870
It seems

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
we need to

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
renegotiate the terms.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,310
Such an intact

67
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,680
hairpin from the Late Qing Dynasty

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,430
is really rare to see.

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,430
It's so beautiful.

70
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,960
With a phoenix goblet, jadeite,

71
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,470
and the finest pearls from the South Seas,

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,280
it applies the top-grade craftsmanship

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
of that time.

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
This hairpin is made of gilded gold.

75
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,710
Booths are so scarce.

76
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,550
I think

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,190
it can't be compared with

78
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,240
these official products.

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,150
But it has an intricate and detailed
phoenix tail pattern,

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,080
it must have been made
by a seasoned expert

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,190
spending a lot of time and effort.

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
How come you think

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,470
it only boils down to poor material?

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
Even if its craftsmanship is good,

85
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,840
it still can't hide

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
the fact that its materials are poor.

87
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,840
A piece of uncut jade

88
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,310
cannot become a great artifact
without carving.

89
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,280
A small piece of decayed wood,

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
if horned by skilled craftsmen,

91
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,360
can also shine brightly.

92
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,120
Ruan Shu is right.

93
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,520
This hairpin is very representative.

94
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,430
The story behind it

95
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,030
is also worth delving into.

96
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Chen Wan,

97
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,510
selected collections are
to show the background

98
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,920
and publicize historical culture.

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
If you are just trying to stand out

100
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,480
to get Mr. Ban's attention,

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
put in a bit more effort.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
Ruan Shu,

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,270
it's all your fault.

104
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
You jinx!

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Miss Ruan

106
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,000
has already started
the curatorial work.

107
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,720
Ban Xiuchun

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,160
hasn't taken any action for now.

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
- But…
- He knows I'm investigating him.

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,560
He is deliberately using Shu
to threaten me.

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,750
Should we temporarily

112
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,790
pause for a while?

113
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
A temporary solution

114
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,650
is not as effective as
a permanent solution.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
We need to take action

116
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,920
against Ban Ling in advance.

117
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,120
Who are you?

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Now, apart from Baisheng Hall,

119
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,510
who else

120
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,920
is willing to get involved
in your Guxin Store's affairs?

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,510
With your current physical condition,

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
this medicine can only keep you

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
awake for a few hours.

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,680
Help me.

125
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,950
Help me.

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,430
I can help you.

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
But I have a condition.

128
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
As the Master of Guxin Store,

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,070
you give me the shares of

130
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,480
the eldest son of the Ban Family

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
who passed away seventeen years ago.

132
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,680
Okay.

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,070
Okay.

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,830
Awake?

135
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,190
Yes, just two hours ago.

136
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,510
And as soon as the Old Master woke up,

137
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,950
he gathered his own team.

138
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,160
He finished the inspection just now.

139
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,120
Have you checked the surveillance footage?

140
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,190
Who has been here?

141
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,680
Surveillance

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,750
was deleted with the methods

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
I don't know.

144
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,680
But it should be that person, no doubt.

145
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,360
Since he's awake,

146
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,510
I'll go take a look first.

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,830
Uncle.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
How are you feeling?

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,510
Rest assured.

150
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,720
In the past decades,

151
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,560
in Shangqing,

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
many people wanted me to die.

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,510
In the end,

154
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
the winner

155
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,720
is me.

156
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Yes.

157
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,950
Seeing you in good health,

158
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
I feel at ease now.

159
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,510
What about

160
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Luminous Jade?

161
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
I have sent some people to look for it.

162
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,920
Xiuchun,

163
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,270
when I was ill,

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
you

165
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,870
managed the business well.

166
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
But,

167
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,950
starting from today,

168
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,560
you

169
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,000
should have a rest.

170
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
Don't forget

171
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,230
you

172
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,000
are just a substitute.

173
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,440
You should know what happened

174
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,630
seventeen years ago.

175
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,670
Yes, I know.

176
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,910
I

177
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,440
have booked your ticket to Germany.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,910
From now on,

179
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,600
the business in Germany

180
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,440
will be handled by you.

181
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,630
Tomorrow,

182
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,600
make a handover,

183
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,870
and leave here.

184
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
Yes.

185
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,270
You said I was showing off.

186
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,360
You come here

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,000
because you broke up with Gu Suizhi,

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,510
and want to seduce Mr. Ban, right?

189
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,840
If you're free,

190
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,390
go finish the remaining work.

191
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,150
Gu Suizhi calls off the Art Exhibition.

192
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
Why are you still pretending diligent?

193
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,590
What did you say?

194
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,320
It seems he has been hiding from you

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,150
not just one or two things.

196
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,790
Baisheng Hall and Guxin Store

197
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,670
are competing fiercely.

198
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,240
The morning news said

199
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
the Art Exhibition would be canceled.

200
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,550
It's probably the work of your Fiancé.

201
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,510
I think

202
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,510
we've been busy for nothing.

203
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,750
Maybe it's because of you.

204
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,870
I asked around.

205
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,630
This ornament is too badly damaged

206
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,710
to be fixed.

207
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,240
Go ask somewhere else.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,390
No matter how much it costs.

209
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,000
I just want this one.

210
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay.

211
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,910
I'll ask it for you again.

212
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,270
But don't get your hopes up too high.

213
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,840
It's broken.

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,150
It's very difficult to repair.

215
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,390
I'm leaving now.

216
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,630
Gu Suizhi,

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,700
the Art Exhibition of Guxin Store
was forced to stop.

218
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,030
Was it you who did this?

219
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
Yes.

220
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,390
Why did you do this?

221
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
You can go anywhere,

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,390
except

223
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,720
Guxin Store.

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
Four years have passed.

225
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,080
I can't believe I only found out today

226
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,200
that you could be so shameless.

227
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,360
If you don't leave now,

228
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,240
I can't guarantee
I won't do something

229
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
even more shameless.

230
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
It seems Guxin Store
is your Achilles' heel.

231
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Since it's something
you don't want me to do,

232
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,630
I will definitely do it.

233
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,720
Do you hate me that much?

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,560
Yes!

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I hate you to the core!

236
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,510
I will definitely

237
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,910
make you pay back.

238
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm back.

239
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,270
During this period,

240
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,080
did it keep you company well for me?

241
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,550
You think it's cuter than me?

242
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,630
Cheapskate.

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Alright,

244
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,870
I will always be by your side
from now on.

245
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,710
Okay?

246
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,030
Forever.

247
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,080
