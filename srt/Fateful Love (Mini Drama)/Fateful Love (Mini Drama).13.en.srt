(Tablet for the Late Parents

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,470
Uncle, Aunt,

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,960
the events of that year

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,670
were my father's fault.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,520
However,

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Suizhi and I

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,430
decided to look forward

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,590
and not be bound by hatred.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,150
Rest assured,

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,000
I will definitely

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,590
stay by his side forever.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,040
You should say something, too.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
It's okay.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
Take your time.

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,950
I'll wait for you outside.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,310
Seventeen years have passed.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,710
(Tablet for the Late Parents

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,400
I finally bring you home.

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Look,

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
that's your daughter-in-law.

30
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,060
(Tablet for the Late Parents
Ban Qingquan and Wu Jin)

31
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,840
Won't you go to the company?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,470
Didn't you say you would
stay with me forever?

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Why does it sound like

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,910
you want to kick me out?

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,630
I'm going to work.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,960
I will come to you after I finish work.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
How about you come back to
live in our old home?

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,990
No.

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,120
Dating has its own process.

40
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,710
If so, I'll stay here.

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,000
I refuse.

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
Staying together every day,

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,750
we might lose that feeling of excitement.

44
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
I need to keep an eye on you, okay?

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
So you won't attract
unwanted attention outside.

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,800
Unwanted attention?

47
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,520
Mr. Gu,

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,430
you are a leader in the industry.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,470
The young ladies around you

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
are quite numerous.

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you being childish?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,870
Then you let me stay here?

53
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,870
No.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,150
Gu Suizhi,

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,080
Yuanbao Pavilion

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,470
is too far from your company.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
As long as I can stay by your side.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Miss Ruan,

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
are you still worried about

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
you don't have feelings?

61
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,460
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,360
You like to drink red wine before bed,

63
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,510
but I don't have any here.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,800
I made you a bowl of
fermented rice dumplings.

65
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,300
Take it to nourish your stomach.

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
What's wrong?

67
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Nothing.

68
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,680
I just suddenly remember my time

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,160
with my parents seventeen years ago.

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,630
Thank you for the
sense of security you provide.

71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,310
Alright, sit up.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,120
You're so heavy, my shoulder hurts.

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,830
Take a few bites.

74
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,800
Is it tasty?

75
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll take a nap now.

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
What are you doing?

77
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
Sleeping.

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,510
The guest room is over there.

79
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,430
Didn't you say you want to start over?

80
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,320
Who sleeps together
right after starting a relationship?

81
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,100
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

82
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,720
This tea

83
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,240
is fragrant and sweet.

84
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,800
The color and fragrance are so good.

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
Is this the main focus now?

86
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,680
I heard that

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,870
after Chen Wan and her mother offended you,

88
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,430
Baisheng Hall never cooperated with them again

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,830
and their scandals were exposed.

90
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,510
Now they are completely over.

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,870
Thinking about it now,

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,920
they are quite pitiful.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
People

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
who do many unjust deeds
will surely destroy themselves.

95
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,920
But, have they really never
contacted you again?

96
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,190
No, they haven't.

97
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,430
Why are they contacting me?

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,630
I have a feeling.

99
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,120
They are up to something.

100
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,670
Young Master,

101
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,830
these are the shares transfer agreements

102
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,870
from retail shareholders of Guxin Store.

103
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,190
These shares, combined with yours,

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,830
you are already the largest shareholder
of Guxin Store,

105
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,390
apart from Gu Suizhi.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
Young Master,

107
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,040
the assets you have accumulated over the years

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
are enough for you
to establish your own business.

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,630
Fighting with Gu Suizhi is thankless.

110
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,390
Why should we continue?

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
What I am fighting for is not Guxin Store,

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,950
nor is it Gu Suizhi.

113
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,270
I am fighting for fate.

114
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,510
Why

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
was I born to use someone else's name

116
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,800
to stand here?

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Why

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,160
was I born to be a substitute for power?

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
but now Gu Suizhi

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
controls the Southern City Trade Port.

121
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
If he rises to power,

122
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,070
how can our contraband at the port

123
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,270
be sold out?

124
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,270
In Southeast Asia,

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,580
two new mines were discovered recently,

126
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,270
and the price of the raw materials
we stocked up on earlier

127
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,600
are surging in the market,

128
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,160
so, this month

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,360
our company's transaction volume
and foreign trade turnover

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,720
have significantly increased.

131
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,150
It seems that the previous adjustments

132
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,630
are effective.

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,430
Our company's business
has been very good.

134
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
By the way,

135
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,270
about Miss Ruan,

136
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,690
I heard that

137
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,560
her performance at the
Fengxian Tea House Press Conference

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
was highly praised by the industry.

139
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,430
Many people are trying to recruit her.

140
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,550
I've always been

141
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,220
clear about her capabilities.

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,030
Help me take a look at this.

143
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,030
You want to transfer
so many shares of the company

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,630
to Miss Ruan?

145
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,960
You just need to help me check

146
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,350
if there are any issues with the terms.

147
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,990
Yes.

148
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,870
Next month is your thirtieth birthday.

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
So,

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
you had planned this all along.

151
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,390
This is the last thing I can do for her.

152
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,960
It's a pity

153
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,910
I am still too selfish.

154
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,480
In my final time,

155
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,550
I still only hope

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
she can stay by my side.

157
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
Yuan,

158
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,510
keep this safe.

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
In this card,

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
there is eight hundred thousand yuan.

161
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,120
This is

162
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,200
the key to the Singapore apartment.

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
All these years,

164
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,000
you've worked hard for me.

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
The road ahead,

166
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,840
I will walk alone from now on.

167
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,120
I will not leave.

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,390
Ever since you saved me,

169
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,870
my life has been yours.

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
Over the years,

171
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
I understand

172
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,870
your intentions well.

173
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,630
But the cost of being myself

174
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,630
is too big.

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,870
The road ahead,

176
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,320
let me walk it alone.

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
I wish you

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
all the best in the future.

179
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,240
What about you?

180
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,720
I always feel like

181
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,670
I missed something in my calculations.

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
What do you mean?

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Why Ban Family

184
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,240
chooses its master

185
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,600
based on a cursed jade

186
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
since ancient times?

187
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,720
Young Master,

188
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,080
there was news that

189
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,150
a family doctor frequently
visited his home recently.

190
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,550
