"Time to End the Tangly Fate"

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,510
Hello.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,640
I got Ruan Shu.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,390
If you want her to live,

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,430
do what I say.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,680
What do you want?

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,430
Chill guy.

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,350
Boxes of cargo at the trade port...

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,880
Replace them with my cargo.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,070
The merchant ship docks at twelve.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
The Luminous Jade or Ruan Shu?

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,710
Make your choice.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,870
Miss Ruan,

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
you're awake?

23
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,950
Young Master?

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
Don't worry.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Gu Suizhi will come to save you soon.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,950
I may say I'm surprised.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,070
He tried so hard
to get back Guxin Store.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,310
But for you,

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,560
he gave it away.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,400
Gu Suizhi will not let you go.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Not let me go?

32
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,560
Don't worry.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,310
I won't hurt you.

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,680
After all,

35
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,520
only when you're alive

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,560
can I

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,080
threaten Gu Suizhi.

38
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,000
What on earth do you want?

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,190
What do I want?

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,870
I don't want anything.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,710
I can see

42
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,560
you care a lot for him.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,750
But anyway,

44
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,630
have you thought about this?

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,400
Since he came to you,

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,680
everything has been a conspiracy.

47
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,750
You...

48
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,120
You're just his pawn

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,750
and his fall guy.

50
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,470
What do you mean?

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,280
Didn't your father tell you

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,430
what happened 17 years ago?

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
Mr. Ban,

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,470
is that true?

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
The chief

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
will exchange my daughter's blood

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,150
for the Luminous Jade?

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,710
Do you dare

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,430
to risk your daughter's life?

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
What's up?

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
It's me.

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,750
Can you come to Guxin Store now?

63
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Then, Suizhi's parents

64
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,080
rushed to Guxin Store.

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
But Ban Ling tampered with their car.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,470
Sadly, they died in a car accident.

67
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,910
My father took away the Luminous Jade.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,400
But he blamed himself so much

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,360
that he had depression.

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
I knew this.

71
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,040
Anything else?

72
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,600
Then do you know

73
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,190
why

74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,480
the Bans' ancestral tablet

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
only reacts to your family?

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,480
What do you mean?

77
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,120
Because your family

78
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,000
has a long history
with the Luminous Jade.

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,310
Centuries ago, according to legend,

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
your family's Luminous Jade
was taken away by the Bans.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,750
So, they were cursed.

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,310
Only when the single daughter of your family

83
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,510
meets her Chosen One

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,510
can she use her blood

85
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,480
to awaken forces of the Luminous Jade.

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,310
Gu Suizhi

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,600
has a congenital heart disease.

88
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,120
Without the Luminous Jade,

89
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,310
he'll die

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
before 30.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Wait.

92
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,120
Are you sure you'll give him the Jade?

93
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,360
There are many ways

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,310
to save Miss Ruan.

95
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,240
He got Shu. I don't have a choice.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,830
Ban Xiuchun did this without warning.

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,630
He must be fully prepared.

98
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,480
Unless you die,

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,800
he can't be the real Ban Xiuchun. You know?

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,790
It's the only way

101
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,270
to see Shu soon.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,120
I can't risk her life
for one more minute.

103
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey, Suizhi.

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,870
Calm down.

105
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,680
You've lurked and planned for 17 years.

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Now, it's the last game.

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
It's my destiny.

108
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,270
I can't get away.

109
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,360
I owe her this.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,950
If I can't come back,

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
she will

112
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,310
be entrusted to you and Wen Yin.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Suizhi!

114
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,470
Sit down.

115
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,600
The Luminous Jade

116
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,720
was magic ore of the ancient times.

117
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,510
Together with 18 herbs,

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
it was refined into a crystal,

119
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,830
known as the Luminous Jade.

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
However,

121
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,430
because of the curse,

122
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,430
nobody can touch it.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
Only when a member of your family

124
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,120
wears it

125
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,830
can it relieve Gu Suizhi's heart disease.

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,000
Ban Yi was eager to get it.

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,390
So, your father got him killed.

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
What else?

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
Finish it all at once.

130
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,950
You just want to use me

131
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,310
to upset Gu Suizhi.

132
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,240
Any other stories?

133
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,870
Ruan Shu,

134
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,160
stop daydreaming.

135
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,270
His father died because of your father.

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,120
How would he love you without hatred?

137
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,830
What's worse,

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,630
he only takes advantage of you.

139
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,120
He wants your blood

140
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,950
for his heart disease.

141
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,040
Otherwise,

142
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,360
how would he keep you around

143
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
without revengeful feelings?

144
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,270
Do you think I'll suspect my beloved man

145
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,120
just because of what you said?

146
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,480
I don't expect you to believe me.

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,240
Then what do you want?

148
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,680
There he is.

149
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,680
You don't believe me, huh?

150
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,390
Then, I'll make you watch.

151
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,080
Ban Xiuchun, are you insane?

152
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,600
What did you feed me?

153
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,630
Just some datura poison.

154
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,390
Mr. Gu,

155
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,000
long time no see.

156
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,000
Where is she?

157
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,910
Ruan Shu...

158
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,230
She's good.

159
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't hurt her!

160
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,910
17 years ago,

161
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,000
you failed to protect your parents.

162
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,630
Now, you can't protect her.

163
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,550
I took away your family.

164
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,720
I can take her away, too.

165
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
Ruan Shu is your Achilles' heel.

166
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,270
Guxin Store is nothing.

167
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,510
