"The Past Shouldn't Trap Us Forever"

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,150
Gu Suizhi,

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,560
you and Ruan Shu

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,350
and this store

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,750
will be burned with me

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,280
as well as the old grudges

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,240
over the last century.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,790
It's not only a name.

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,760
It's you.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
So what?

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,000
Gu Suizhi,

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,510
do you know

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,510
how much I envy you?

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,480
Why?

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
Why are you the proud Young Master

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,230
while I can only be your shadow?

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,350
No one takes you as a shadow.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,240
The Ban Family

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,200
and people in Guxin Store

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,920
always admire Mr. Lan Ze.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,430
What's the point

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,840
of saying this now?

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,760
Names

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,120
are just masks.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,870
When someone wears a mask for too long,

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,230
how can people tell what a man he is?

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,710
Only when I end everything

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,000
can I be free.

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,310
Lan Ze,

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,310
everything isn't what you think it is.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
You've come at last.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me help you guys

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,150
end all this.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,710
You're taking this wrong.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,470
Your ancestor

44
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,280
became Lan Ze

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,430
just to help his best friend
to defend everything

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,960
and protect Guxin Store.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
After Ban Beisheng was gone,

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
Lan Ze supported his family all alone.

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
(Lan Ze)

50
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,560
This holding fan is the best proof.

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,150
He never complained about the Ban Family.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,840
He just...

53
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,910
He just...

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
He shouldn't have made a decision

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,120
for his descendants.

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,750
Lan Ze,

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,120
Guxin Store,

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,750
or the Luminous Jade.

59
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,590
Take whatever you want.

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,560
We owe you this.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
You don't owe me anything.

62
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,750
Whether I'm Ban Xiuchun

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
or Lan Ze,

64
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,590
I've defended

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,190
the Ban Family.

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,120
Gu Suizhi,

67
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,680
I've got

68
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,520
my answer.

69
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,120
We're even.

70
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,140
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,710
You're all right?

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,510
Don't you remember?

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,190
In the fire,

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,950
you carried me out of danger.

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,950
It's you who was tired out.

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
What about Ban Xiuchun?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Don't worry.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,510
The fire was put out in time.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,240
Guxin Store has been saved.

80
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,800
Ban Xiuchun was killed
by carbon monoxide poisoning.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
The curse that a Mr. Ban dies before 30

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,870
is just a rumor Ban Ling spread

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,070
to cement his place.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,120
You have the angina

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,680
because you've had
mental problems all the time.

86
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,830
The doctor said you're getting better.

87
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,270
Thank you for not leaving me alone.

88
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,560
I'll never leave you alone.

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,720
Get some sleep.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
The old house

91
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,720
was burned with Ban Xiuchun.

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,190
Most places in Guxin Store

93
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,240
have been unscathed.

94
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,830
The reconstruction has started.

95
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,870
It'll be finished soon.

96
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,800
How's it going with Chen Wan?

97
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,070
Miss Ruan wants

98
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,750
to sue Chen Wan and her mother.

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,430
They've done evil for years, after all.

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,270
Do all that Shu asks.

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,240
You care for Miss Ruan, like always.

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
You just woke up.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Then, you run around.

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
Ignoring your health?

105
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
One more thing.

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,630
Put Lan Ze's tablet

107
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,040
into my family shrine.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,050
But in your family shrine,

109
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,560
there's never been an outsider's tablet.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
A century ago, without Lan Ze,

111
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,510
Guxin Store wouldn't have survived.

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
He's the man

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
worth remembering.

114
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,560
(Tablet for Lan Ze)
Lan Ze right here,

115
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,120
hope you'll rest in peace.

116
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,920
Thanks for what you did
for the Ban Family.

117
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,740
(Tablet for Lan Ze)

118
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,750
Neither you nor I

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,190
should be stuck in hatred.

120
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
This is the best ending.

121
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,800
The past

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,560
shouldn't trap us forever.

123
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,870
What do you mean?

124
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,160
I forgive you.

125
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
When you were poisoned,

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,560
she was so worried about you.

127
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,420
She looked after you without leaving.

128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
She cares for you.

129
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,160
Why don't you try harder?

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
On what?

131
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,160
On your relationship with her.

132
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,510
I've never given up.

133
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,040
When I'm still single,

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
I worry about you.

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
You ate the food I bought you.

136
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,390
Do a good job later.

137
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,710
Do you hear?

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Tuanzi misses you.

139
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,950
Just the cat?

140
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,240
I miss you, too.

141
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,160
Tuanzi.

142
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm hungry.

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
