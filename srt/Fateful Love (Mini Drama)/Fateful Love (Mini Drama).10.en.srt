Shu!

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Sorry,

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,870
the number you dialed
cannot be connected now.

00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,590
Please try again later.

15
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,350
Young Master,

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,150
the business line in Liechtenstein
is crucial for expanding Guxin Store's

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,350
overseas business.

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,640
Its inspection by customs this time

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,840
doesn't seem like a coincidence.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,150
If this continues,

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,150
billions of funds will evaporate.

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,640
What is the background of this
company in Liechtenstein?

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,070
Did you find it?

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,480
This Wanmeng International Trade Company

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,280
has been established

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
for two years.

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,040
Recently, it started venturing into
the field of art,

28
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,560
and packaged itself for listing overseas.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,790
A company registered overseas

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,840
and

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,590
has been established for some time.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
Before this,

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,580
it had always been in a lukewarm state.

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,760
Recently, it has taken such a big move.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,230
This is not simple.

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,910
It seems to have special information methods,

37
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,960
and can conceal itself in an era

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
flooded with information.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,030
It is a very unusual opponent.

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,150
It targets Guxin Store so specifically.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,520
It must be someone familiar.

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,470
Pay attention to

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,620
Gu Suizhi.

44
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,240
Before the voting,

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,240
no mistakes should be made.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Yes.

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,590
You are looking for me?

48
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,470
Mr. Jin.

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
(Resignation Letter)

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
Resignation?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
Given my identity,

52
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,630
it is unsuitable for me to
continue working here.

53
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,710
Perhaps the entire antique circle
cannot accommodate me.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
So, I plan to

55
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,550
withdraw from the antique circle.

56
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,080
You chose the antique business

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,030
just for your father?

58
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,030
Isn't it your own dream?

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,960
I truly

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,310
love this industry.

61
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,310
I can see that.

62
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,430
In the Fengxian Tea House project,

63
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,870
you have done a great job.

64
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,960
It is now nearing completion,

65
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,030
can you reconsider it?

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,270
But…

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Ruan,

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,240
don't be held back by past events.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,590
Don't let it affect
the choices in your life.

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,460
(Gu Suizhi)

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
You blocked me and planned to resign?

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,360
If I had come a bit later,

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,870
would you have already left Shangqing?

74
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,680
I do plan to leave the antique business.

75
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,910
You come just in time.

76
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,120
I have something to tell you.

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,070
Today, I just want to have a good meal.

78
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,750
Everything else is not important.

79
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,520
If you want to say something,

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,110
follow me.

81
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,680
This is…

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,630
(It was the restaurant he took me to)

83
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,000
(on my first day meeting him.)

84
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Today is your birthday, right?

85
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,710
Happy birthday!

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
I hope

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,310
every day after you meet me,

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
you can be happy.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Why?

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
You don't remember it?

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,670
Yes, I do.

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
Last night…

93
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,950
It was just a moment of indulgence.

94
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,160
Do not mention it again.

95
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
Alright.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,430
Let's not talk about this.

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Tell me what you want to say first.

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,830
I've thought it over.

99
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,270
It is our Ruan Family
that has wronged you.

100
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,630
If you want it,

101
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,510
I can return the Luminous Jade to you.

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
In the future,

103
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
I won't meet you anymore.

104
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,390
You want to avoid me

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,630
and leave the antique business

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
all because of your father.

107
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
Four years ago,

108
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,950
also here,

109
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,950
you said you wanted to
revive the Yuanbao Pavilion.

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Are you going to give up now?

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Yuanbao Pavilion was founded by my father.

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
But he…

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,070
Yuanbao Pavilion belongs to your father.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,160
But your career is your own.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,390
Although I don't want you
to stay at Guxin Store,

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,510
but if you leave there at this moment,

117
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,920
are you planning to be a deserter for life?

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,950
You're right.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
My father's matters

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,560
and my career

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,600
are two different things.

122
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,510
Are you still leaving?

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
At least,

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,270
I'll complete the
Fengxian Tea House project

125
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,190
you handed over to me.

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
There's one more thing.

127
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,150
You forgot again.

128
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,580
(Happy Birthday)

129
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,500
(Happy Birthday)

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Happy Birthday!

131
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
Whether it was four years ago

132
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,910
or now,

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I hope

134
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
