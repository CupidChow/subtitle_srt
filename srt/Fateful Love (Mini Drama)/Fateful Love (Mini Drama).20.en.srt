"I Can't Trust You Anymore"

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,000
I finally see you, busy girl.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,240
Why do you look frail?

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,710
Thank you.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,790
You're welcome.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,880
Your work goes smoothly, doesn't it?

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,390
What are you all sour-faced for?

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,200
Gu Suizhi came that day.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,920
I said something that broke his heart.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
What's the big deal?

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,520
Every day,

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,640
I'd like to curse my ex a thousand times.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
You know it.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,430
It's not the same.

23
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,480
What's different?

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,070
This is actually a simple problem.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,840
If you really can't move on,

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,790
go back to him.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
Just don't give yourself a hard time.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,560
But I think we've been
hurting each other.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,950
I don't want to go down this road again.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,040
Stop, stop.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,400
It's such a happy day.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
Don't talk about men.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,350
Let's eat and drink a lot.

34
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,480
It's all for you. OK?

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,430
OK.

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Come on, Gu.

37
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,870
Don't go too far
when you pursue your girl.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,350
You placed so many orders.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
Miss Ruan will get suspicious.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,680
Then, let our men do this.

41
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,680
Ask every department

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
to purchase by request.

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
Generous, indeed. I love it.

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,920
You're a hopeless romantic.

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,950
Better than a single guy.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,710
Gu Suizhi, this is an insult.

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,270
Well, never mind.

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,030
It was so kind of me

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,630
to prepare this for you.

50
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,430
Whether I can get her back

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
counts on this.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Xiuchun.

53
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,310
Xiuchun,

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
that I framed Ruan Shu

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,430
seems to get out.

56
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,080
Gu Suizhi is checking up on me.

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,030
What do I do?

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,910
So, this is what you asked me out for?

59
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
I...

60
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,360
I did all this for you.

61
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,870
I really hate it

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,680
when they expelled you.

63
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
I almost forgot.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
You still work in Guxin Store.

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,910
Then,

66
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,080
you can do me a favor.

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,750
What favor?

68
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,630
Get me into Guxin Store.

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
I know

70
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,910
how to make Ruan Shu suffer.

71
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
I...

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,910
I only wanted to give her a lesson.

73
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,190
I never meant to kill her.

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,080
Who told you I would kill her?

75
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,380
(I'm away. Please look after Tuanzi.
Thanks, by your neighbor.)

76
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,840
So adorable.

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
You're Tuanzi, huh?

78
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm back.

79
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,410
Shu, you're finally back.

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,870
You have no idea how much work we have.

81
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,030
Meng,

82
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,910
finally some people
are interested in folklore.

83
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,560
We should grab our chance.

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
See?

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
There he goes again.

86
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
I think Mr. Jin is right.

87
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,190
It's a good chance to advertise us.

88
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,630
I shouldn't

89
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,150
have complained to gunners like you.

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,560
Come on. Work hard.

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
Oh, Shu.

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,120
You look much more energetic

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,510
than you were last time we met.

94
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,600
I guess it's because

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,560
I keep an animal now.

96
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,360
What kind of animal?

97
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,070
My neighbor's cat, actually.

98
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,910
Its name is Tuanzi.

99
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I keep it for a few days.

100
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,360
A fluffy cat?

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
Yes. Super cute.

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Shu,

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,870
there's been a lot of work lately.

104
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,630
We often have to work overtime here.

105
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,800
Then, who will take care

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
of that cat?

107
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,270
Wen Yin, Wen Yin.

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,950
No, no. I can't do that.

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,040
If I had known

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,970
you invited me for this,

111
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,830
I wouldn't have come.

112
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,870
Why can't you?

113
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,310
Look, it's adorable.

114
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,310
Have your parents

115
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,160
keep it for some days,

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
will you?

117
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,090
I... I...

118
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,510
I'm allergic to cat hair.

119
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,720
So is my mother. So is my father.

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,510
Everyone in my family has allergies.

121
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,160
Check if your neighbor is back.

122
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
You can return it to him.

123
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,750
It's not right.

124
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,870
When you came the other day,

125
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,000
nothing was wrong with you.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
Why do you suddenly have allergies?

127
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Allergy is something

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,870
I can't predict.

129
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
I should go.

130
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Wen...

131
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,670
Fine.

132
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,270
So, I have to give you back

133
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,600
to your original owner.

134
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Anybody in?

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,160
Is anyone home?

136
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,130
Hello?

137
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,350
Hello,

138
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,270
my neighbor.

139
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Why is it you?

140
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,050
Umm...

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,040
I have a leaky house.

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Liu Tingpei lent this house to me.

143
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,160
Do you even believe this?

144
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,070
In the past few days,

145
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,430
you've looked after Tuanzi.

146
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,160
I should thank you.

147
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
You don't have to.

148
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,790
I do.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,070
I have to.

150
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,270
You're quite pushy.

151
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,310
Your cat is here.

152
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,590
I should go.

153
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,270
Do you know what you're sorry for?

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,830
I shouldn't have hidden anything.

156
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,190
I should have told you everything.

157
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,270
Either old grudges

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
or future problems,

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
we should go through together.

160
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
You finally understand.

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
But my trust in you

162
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,630
is gone.

163
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,790
Shu...

164
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,270
You told lies

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
and kept things from me.

166
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
I can't forget.

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
Sorry.

168
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
