"We Finally Get What We Want"

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,750
You cook better now.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,280
Glad you like it.

12
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,480
Gu Suizhi,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,510
I don't want to order take-out anymore.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,310
I need a chef.

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,840
Would you like to be it?

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,210
Oh, chef.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,870
Shu, are you saying...?

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,790
Do I have to make it clear?

19
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,040
Shu,

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,760
will you marry me?

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,950
Yes.

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,400
Stop crying.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,430
Or it'll break my heart.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
In the darkest time of my life,

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
you saved me.

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,710
I've been waiting for four years.

27
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,800
Now, it is finally time.

28
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,980
This DR diamond ring

29
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,520
can be customized for the one and only.

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,680
It represents

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
the promise of unique love.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,710
For me, there's only you.

33
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,240
I'll love you only in my life.

34
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,360
It's just a wedding.

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,870
Does it have to be so complicated?

36
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,680
The wedding dress

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,870
and the wedding place.

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,470
They should be special, huh?

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,150
Most importantly, Miss Ruan Shu,

40
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,590
have you set your wedding date?

41
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,810
Not yet.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,030
Since yesterday,

43
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,400
we haven't set anything.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,030
For something like marriage,

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,840
we need a fortune teller

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
to pick a good day.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
A fortune teller?

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
Yes.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,430
That's so cumbersome.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
Excuse me for a minute.

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,840
Gu Suizhi, I have something to say.

52
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't you think you can slight Shu

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
just because you'll marry her.

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,560
If you dare to bully her again,

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,030
I'll fight it out with you

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,520
even at the cost of my family.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't worry.

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,030
I'll take good care of her.

59
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,520
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,120
Tomorrow, I'll get you a fortune teller.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,710
Don't be late.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,310
Everything

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,680
starts

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,280
with fate.

65
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,560
And fate appears

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
as swiftly as lightning.

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
This is great.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,870
I no longer need
to worry about your marriage.

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,710
Wen Yin,

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,700
since when do you believe in this?

71
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,420
Don't say that.

72
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,380
Or it can't be efficacious.

73
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,140
Here.

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,340
What did the fortune teller say?

75
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,780
He said,

76
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,500
everything has its fate

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,460
that appears like lightning.

78
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
What does it mean?

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,260
He means,

80
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,140
in this life,

81
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
we'll stick together.

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
You have me

83
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
and I have you.

84
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,580
That's really gross.

85
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
I just repeated it.

86
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,510
I'm kidding.

87
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,660
Oh, no.

88
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,100
We brought the lot back.

89
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,420
Will we have our retribution?

90
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,420
Do you believe in this

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,780
so firmly?

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
God bless us.

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,820
God bless us.

94
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
Please, please.

95
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,660
God bless us.

96
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,580
Traditionally,

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,820
the bride and the groom

98
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,420
can't see each other before the wedding.

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,180
Because at the wedding, we will

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,100
meet for the first time.

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,140
Then,

102
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,380
we'll fall in love.

103
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,540
We're in a different case.

104
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,620
Before we met,

105
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,300
we knew we would be together.

106
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,460
We're destined

107
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,180
to be a couple.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,820
We've been together for years.

109
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,820
Why are you still shy?

110
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm not as thick-skinned as you.

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,580
What's this?

112
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm not telling you.

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,220
Why?

114
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,260
To keep something from me?

115
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,220
I can't tell you.

116
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,700
It's my last dignity.

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,180
Something more?

118
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,500
Where?

119
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,340
Give it back to me!

120
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,300
(Movie Ticket)
What are these?

121
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,420
Ticket stubs

122
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,820
of the movies we watched together.

123
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,380
I've kept them.

124
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,580
In the future,

125
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,260
we'll watch more movies.

126
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,620
I love you.

127
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,020
You love me so much, huh?

128
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,540
My princess,

129
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
for this moment,

130
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,780
I've waited for four years.

131
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,660
Now,

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,900
we don't need to wait.

133
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,100
Before the wedding,

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,780

(he isn't as merciless)
