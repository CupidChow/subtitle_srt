"You've Always Been Lying to Me."

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,280
Four years ago,

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,760
weren't you the one who took me home?

12
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,710
How can you not take responsibility?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,040
You're awake.

14
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,350
Last night,

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,710
you were drugged
by that bastard Qian Jinhong.

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,710
Don't worry.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,350
Nothing happened.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,430
I called the family doctor.

19
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,560
He has already given you an IV.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,430
The toxins have been removed.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't think I will thank you.

22
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,950
Have you ever thought about

23
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,120
what if,

24
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,790
just if,

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,950
your father's death

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
has nothing to do with me?

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Will you still hate me like you do now?

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,760
Isn't your question ridiculous?

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,120
There's one more thing.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,910
Leave your Luminous Jade behind.

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
You are still eyeing it.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
If I were eyeing it,

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
while you were asleep,

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
I would take it off.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,150
Don't worry.

36
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,680
I only borrow it for one day.

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,520
Consider it a repayment to my favor.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Tomorrow,

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,150
I will return it to you.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,430
I can trust you one more time.

41
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,520
But from now on,

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,710
don't let me step in here again.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
You…

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,030
are you out of your mind?

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,870
The Luminous Jade

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,360
worn by Ruan Shu

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
can alleviate your symptoms,

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,840
but if it is directly placed on you,

49
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,080
it will backfire on you.

50
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,560
I can't worry about that anymore.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
Ban Xiuchun has already been forced

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,910
into a corner by me,

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,910
he will definitely target Shu.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,710
I can only find a way
to deceive him now.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Master, I sent you a copy.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
Please take a look and see if it's okay.

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,680
Sure, not bad.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,710
The antique industry

59
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,630
requires a broad knowledge base.

60
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,520
I didn't expect you to get the hang of it

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
so quickly.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,150
I've been influenced by my father
since I was a child.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,000
Our Yuanbao Pavilion

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
has showcased many antiques.

65
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Yuanbao Pavilion?

66
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,710
You are

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,190
Ruan Xiaming's daughter?

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,390
You know my father?

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
How could I not know him?

70
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,920
Your father did that thing back then.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,390
How could

72
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,750
Young Master allow you
to work at Guxin Store?

73
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,830
What do you mean?

74
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,000
What did my father do?

75
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,510
Sorry,

76
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,240
I didn't mean to offend your father.

77
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,830
I didn't mean that.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,390
Mr. Jin, Mr. Jin!

79
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,160
Young Master wants to see you.

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Young Master?

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Young Master.

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,830
Why are you still calling me
Young Master?

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,800
If Gu Suizhi keeps pressing me like this,

84
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,560
the entire Guxin Store
will belong to him.

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,390
I won't be the Young Master.

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Young Master,

87
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,240
I have already brought Ruan Shu.

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
But, are you sure you want to do this?

89
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,830
The most important thing right now is

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,040
obtain the genuine
ancestral Luminous Jade.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,120
I can no longer care about
curses or anything like that.

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Miss Ruan.

93
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,150
Young Master.

94
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,030
It's okay.

95
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,670
Sit.

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,630
Young Master,

97
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,510
I just happen to have something
to ask you

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,950
Mr. Jin Xu seems to know my father.

99
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,390
He just said,

100
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,240
my father did something back then.

101
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you know what it was?

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
Did Gu Suizhi say something to you again?

103
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,750
He…

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Why would he say anything to me?

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
You said

106
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,560
you wanted to seek revenge on him.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes.

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Good.

109
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,400
Now, I will

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,070
give you a chance for revenge.

111
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,480
Give me the Luminous Jade,

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
I can avenge your father.

113
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,870
You want the Luminous Jade?

114
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,870
Give it to me.

115
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,310
The Luminous Jade

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,240
was taken by Gu Suizhi.

117
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,680
The Luminous Jade is already
in Gu Suizhi's hands.

118
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,390
I should have taken it earlier.

119
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,480
I will assign more people

120
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
to find that jade.

121
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,910
Hello?

122
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,310
Why is the Young Master so furious?

123
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,870
Are you looking for something?

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
I guess it's this.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,070
Without it,

126
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,950
The position of Young Master

127
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,390
won't belong to you for long, right?

128
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,870
The item is in your hands,

129
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,390
but Miss Ruan

130
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,160
is still in my hands.

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
You'd better not hurt her.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
Originally, I didn't plan to,

133
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,190
but seeing you so nervous,

134
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,120
it seems I made the right bet.

135
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,360
Mr. Gu,

136
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,800
there is a long way to go.

137
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
Your father did that thing back then.

138
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,600
How could

139
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,920
Young Master allow you
to work at Guxin Store?

140
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,140
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

141
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Take it.

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,270
But remember,

143
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,000
don't let Ban Xiuchun know

144
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,510
this jade is on you.

145
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,650
Isn't this jade

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,550
very important to you?

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,350
Why are you giving it back to me?

148
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,910
Because this is the only thing

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,750
your father left for you.

150
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,270
Since you mentioned my father,

151
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,750
let me ask you,

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,550
last time you said

153
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,960
my father's death has nothing
to do with you.

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
Is it true?

155
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,240
I just said it casually.

156
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,360
You are really easy to fool.

157
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
Alright.

158
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,200
Tell me everything in detail.

159
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,600
Four years ago,

160
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,150
how did you drive my Dad to death?

161
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm not interested in

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,630
looking back at this matter

163
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,750
(Yuanbao Pavilion)
You are lying again.

164
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,750
Why, whether in the past or now,

165
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,670
you've always been lying to me?

166
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,550
What exactly is it that

167
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,270
you'd rather be hated by me
for a lifetime

168
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
