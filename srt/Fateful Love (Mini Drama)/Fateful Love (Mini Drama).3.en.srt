Why aren't you sleeping?

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,360
You had a nightmare again?

12
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,480
I dreamt that

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,710
this mole of yours

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,920
grew for me.

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,030
That means

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
we are destined.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,320
In my dream,

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
we are enemies.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,590
You kept me in the dark

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,880
and did something that betrayed me.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,670
If so, wouldn't you tear me into pieces?

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
What about now?

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,110
Are you hiding something from me?

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,230
What are you imagining again?

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,480
How could I possibly
hide anything from you?

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,280
Don't show this jade of yours

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,840
in front of outsiders.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Remember,

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,150
make sure to always keep it close to you.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,110
In the past four years,

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,630
why did he repeatedly emphasize

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,150
that no one else should know

33
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,670
this jade is on me.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
It's so strange.

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
You took the initiative to invite me here.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Tell me the reason.

37
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,840
Don't waste my time.

About my father's death four years ago

39
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,360
and Gu Suizhi's matters,

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,360
how much do you know?

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,070
Even if I know,

42
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,320
why should I tell you?

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,880
If you tell me,

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
I can give you this jade.

45
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,400
A cursed jade!

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,480
Besides the Ruan Family,

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,920
who do you think will take it as treasure?

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,400
Curse?

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,190
What do you mean?

50
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,550
What do I mean?

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
You forgot,

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
when we were kids, I was

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,590
interested in this jade.

54
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,160
But after wearing it for just half a day,

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,320
I developed a persistent high fever.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,550
Even if you gave it to me,

57
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,670
I wouldn't want it.

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,280
But seeing you like this,

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm satisfied.

60
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,630
You just remain ignorant like this

61
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,400
and obediently marry Gu Suizhi.

62
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,630
Keep this jade safe.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,710
Many people will come to our wedding.

64
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,280
Don't wear it.

65
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,510
If you truly have integrity,

66
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,510
you will not marry your enemy.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800

you drove him to his death,

102
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,590
right?

103
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,630

Shu, all of this…

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,710
You meticulously kept me by your side

109
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,150
not because you love me,

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,440

of the Luminous Jade.

113
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,360
so you chose me.

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
No, Shu, Shu, listen to me.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,510
Gu Suizhi, go away.

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,630
These four years of mine

117
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,320
are so ridiculous.

118
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,710
