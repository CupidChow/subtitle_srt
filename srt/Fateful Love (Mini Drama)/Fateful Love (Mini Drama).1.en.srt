Ruan Family's young daughter

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,150
will get married today.

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,600
Mutual trust will benefit both people.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,790
Wish you happy and harmonious forever.

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,000
Ban Beisheng,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,650
(Ruan Yutong, Jade Guardian of
Ruan Family a hundred years ago)

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,430
you want this marriage

17
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,950
to offset my hatred to your Ban Family

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,650
for killing my father and brother
fifteen years ago?

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,420
(Ancestral Tablets of Ruan Clan)

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,940
(Ban Qingquan, a hundred years ago)
The stubborn members of the Ruan Family

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,350
(Master of Guxin Store)
would never have thought that

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,480
(Joy)
the Luminous Jade they desperately guarded

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,840
would ultimately belong to the Ban Family.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,260
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,950
(Luminous Jade, Heirloom of Ban Family)
(Because the Ban Family)

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,520
(Only the heart blood of the Ruans')
(holds the Ancient Divine Jade,)

27
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,490
(can lift its deadly curse)
(Luminous Jade,)

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,710
(it dominates the Antique World.)

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
(Although Luminous Jade
possesses great power,)

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,710
(it carries a deadly curse.)

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,590
(Only the Ruan Family)

32
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,200
(can guide it for generations.)

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
With Ruan Yutong's heart blood,

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,040
the Luminous Jade will be awakened.

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,430
Murder!

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,590
Murder!

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,870
Murder!

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,520
Back then, for the Luminous Jade,

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,710
you didn't hesitate to
kill a dozen of Ruan members.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
(Ban Beisheng, a hundred years ago)
Now, I will make you pay with your life.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
(Young Master of Guxin Store)
Yutong!

42
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,960
Put the sword down first.

43
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,560
I know

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,030
it's all the Ban Family's fault.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
So you knew it.

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
How can you comfortably enjoy

47
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,870
the wealth and glory at the cost of

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
the blood of our Ruan Family?

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,470
Suizhi!

50
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,460
(Ruan Shu, Jade Guardian
of Ruan Family a hundred years later)

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,280
What

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,190
does this dream exactly signify?

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,910
Suizhi.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,430
I thought

55
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,120
you came here to try on wedding dresses.

56
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,800
But you travel such a long distance

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
to restore ancient paintings.

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
Do you need to be so career-driven?

59
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,520
This is called balancing
marriage and career.

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I said,

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
one day, I would revive
my Dad's Yuanbao Pavilion.

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,430
Thank you

63
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,160
for taking care of this place these days.

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,870
Don't mention it.

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,200
By the way,

66
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,480
I really didn't expect

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
four years ago

68
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,650
Gu Suizhi

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,160
used an agreement

70
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,560
to get such a good wife like you.

71
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,240
Some people

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,510
are destined by fate.

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
Give me.

74
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,100
(Four years ago)
Aunt Chen,

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
these antiques

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,020
are all my Dad's treasure.

77
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,430
How can you sell it off?

78
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,000
(Chen Wan, Chen Qiaoyin's daughter)
Ruan Shu,

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,700
(Chen Qiaoyin, Ruan Shu's stepmother)
Yuanbao Pavilion has gone bankrupt.

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,080
Your Dad is dead.

81
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,310
Do you expect me

82
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,360
to repay these debts for the Ruan Family?

83
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
From now on, you are an orphan.

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,720
Ruan Shu,

85
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,070
I wonder how you compete with me.

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,950
Little girl,

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,040
if you know what's good for you,

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
give me the jade.

89
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Dream it.

90
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,720
Quite stubborn.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
You are reluctant to part with the jade?

92
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,240
Then how about

93
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600
exchanging it with you?

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,000
- Who?
- Who?

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Ruan Family's daughter?

96
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,830
You want this jade?

97
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,160
What a rat!

98
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
Beat him!

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,310
You win. Let's go.

100
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,040
Are you okay?

101
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,630
Keep this jade safe.

102
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,720
This is what

103
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,870
your father fought for you.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Who are you?

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,310
The one who hurt me,

106
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
I will always remember.

107
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,310
The one who helped me,

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,870
I will repay him.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,680
If you really want to repay me,

110
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,190
sign an agreement with me.

111
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
This is the menu.

112
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,070
Thank you for saving me last time

113
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
and inviting me out today.

114
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,950
You order something first.

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
I can eat anything.

116
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,720
I want to go to the restroom.

117
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,070
If you're not trying to sneak away,

118
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,000
the restroom

119
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,390
is over there.

120
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,950
This, this.

121
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,790
This.

122
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,310
Okay, got it.

123
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,830
What exactly do you want to do?

124
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,240
Your father just passed away.

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,270
I, a complete stranger, suddenly appears.

126
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,310
It's normal for you to be suspicious.

127
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,750
But now you are all alone.

128
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
What if

129
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
you leave?

130
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,670
I don't need to rely on anyone

131
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,720
to reopen my Dad's Yuanbao Pavilion.

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Antique business

133
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
is not something you can master overnight.

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,550
Do you really think you can do it?

135
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,870
You don't believe me.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,080
You can test it.

137
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,200
This is a counterfeit.

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Go ahead.

139
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,480
Look,

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
the ox-hair grain on this surface

141
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,630
is somewhat coarse.

142
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,080
It appears to have a natural texture.

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
People who create fakes usually tend to

144
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,910
make these textures more detailed.

145
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,150
By going against the norm,

146
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,550
they indeed deceive some people.

147
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,910
It's good to have some sandalwood inside,

148
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,670
but it's blood sandalwood.

149
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,390
Rubbing it a bit longer,

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,670
the scent inside will come out.

151
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,320
Good.

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,360
You indeed have some skills.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
I passed your test.

154
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,510
Now tell me

155
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,670
who exactly are you?

156
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
Why are you helping me?

157
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,270
What exactly is

158
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,510
the agreement you mentioned?

159
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,120
I am your father's

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
old friend.

161
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,030
I originally wanted to find you to sign

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,100
the acquisition agreement for Yuanbao Pavilion.

163
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,240
But just now,

164
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,750
I changed my mind.

165
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,240
What do you mean?

166
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
I fell in love with you

167
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
at first sight.

168
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,840
My Baisheng Hall

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,630
needs a capable hostess.

170
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,990
Are you willing to take on this role?

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
You don't need to answer it right away.

172
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,910
One more thing.

173
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,350
From now on,

174
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,390
you live here.

175
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,910
You

176
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,440
ask me to sign this agreement

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
just to let me stay here.

178
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
Stay here

179
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,870
with me.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,630
With you?

181
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,470
Dream it.

182
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,960
What are you thinking, young lady?

183
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Don't worry.

184
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,320
According to the agreement,

185
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,320
I won't lay a finger on you.

186
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,320
So, what do I need to do?

187
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,630
Don't leave me.

188
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,080
- What?
- I don't care what you do.

189
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,270
But before you leave me,

190
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,510
you need to tell me.

191
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,620
(Coming up next: Next Stop - Your World_06)

192
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,840
Why don't you go to bed?

193
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,120
The thunder outside is too loud.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,390
Are you afraid of thunder?

195
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,790
No, I am not.

196
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,670
I just want to watch some TV, can I?

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
Then I'll watch TV too.

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,750
(Is he)

199
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,670
(intentionally keeping me company?)

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,040
Give you.

201
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,360
Didn't I tell you

202
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,390
the maidservant would collect them?

203
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,030
I'm not someone
who eats and lives for free.

204
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,320
Take these back by yourself.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
Ruan Shu.

206
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
Your

207
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,670
this.

208
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,270
Gu Suizhi,

209
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,030
are you back?

210
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,910
Gu Suizhi!

211
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,030
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

212
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
It hurts.

213
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,630
It seems like it's twisted.

214
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,550
Where to go?

215
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,120
Nonsense, go to the hospital.

216
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,960
- What are you laughing at?
- The doctor said

217
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,270
I have to

218
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,790
take good care of my leg these days.

219
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,870
I want to watch TV.

220
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,720
I want to go out and play.

221
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,670
As per your instructions,

222
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,080
everything has been arranged
for Miss Ruan.

223
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,790
But why do you live with her?

224
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,240
Approaching her and the Luminous Jade

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,390
is the only way I can find a solution

226
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,470
to lift the Ban Family's curse
of not living past thirty years old.

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
I still have four years left.
