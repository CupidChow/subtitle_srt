11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,600
Oh my, my friend,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,750
why are you still sleeping?

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,710
Get up!

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,800
Get up.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,560
Wake up.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,470
Wake up!

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
- Wake up!
- Why did you come so early?

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,960
Isn't today the Fengxian Tea House's
Press Conference?

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,110
You are the Display Designer.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,030
Won't you be there?

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,560
You need to get up
and get ready quickly.

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,920
I didn't forget.

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,310
I haven't slept so soundly

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,640
for a long time.

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,920
Yesterday was your birthday.

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,950
I sent you a message,
why didn't you reply?

27
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,230
Yesterday,

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,070
I had a meal with Gu Suizhi.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,920
Does he have any shame left?

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
The fact that he caused your Dad's death
has already been exposed.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
- How could he still bother you?
- No, he's not.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,070
That was a misunderstanding.

33
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,430
In fact,

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,840
he is the victim.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,310
Shu,

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
actually,

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,040
I don't understand the love

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,150
and hate between you two,

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,790
But tell me, do you still love him?

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,950
It's been four years.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,870
How can I say I don't love him anymore?

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Then, give him a chance.

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,680
This is also a chance for yourself.

Why are you here?

51
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,240
Fengxian Tea House is
the new brand of Baisheng Hall.

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I am the boss.

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,470
Of course I should be present.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Don't worry.

55
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,240
I won't be a deserter again.

56
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,750
About the work,

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,750
I will take it seriously as always.

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,800
I never said

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,870
I am here for business purposes.

60
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,240
The Fengxian Tea House project has ended.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Are you planning to make me
leave Guxin Store again?

62
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,030
If it's the things you want to do,

63
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,520
no one can stop you.

64
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,190
Why should I let you hate me?

65
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,710
It's your own matter,

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
you decide by yourself.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,150
I have something to do.

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm leaving now.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,080
Gu Suizhi,

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,750
no matter what,

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,080
thank you.

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Young Master,

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,480
the runaway legal officer
has been captured.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,470
Handle it secretly.

75
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,870
There is one more thing.

76
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,360
The Old Master disappeared
in Germany this morning.

77
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,560
We found out that Liu Tingpei

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
had trips to and from Germany.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,630
Ban Ling even causes trouble abroad.

80
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,600
Handle the transfer documents first.

81
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,730
But

82
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,040
what if the transfer documents we forged

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
are discovered

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,950
by those old directors?

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
There is no "what if".

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,390
I spent so much time on this.

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,510
How could I hand over
the position of Old Master so easily?

88
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,160
I fed them so much money.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
Even if those directors have doubts,

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,830
how could they refuse money?

91
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,190
Given Ban Ling's physical condition,

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,830
he shouldn't have gone far.

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
You send someone to look for him.

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll arrange it right away.

95
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,120
Gu Suizhi,

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
You are determined to oppose me,
aren't you?

97
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,430
Ban Xiuchun?

98
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,950
Yes.

99
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
I have disappointed you.

100
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Uncle.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,160
Impossible.

102
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,040
Impossible.

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,830
The truth will soon be revealed.

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,480
How could this show

105
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,510
leave you behind, Uncle?

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,270
Isn't it too easy on him to
just keep him like this?

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Moreover, he knows your identity.

108
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,870
Because of him,

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,160
I have lived incognito
for seventeen years.

110
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,040
My parents have been wrongfully dead.

111
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,360
I want him to live,

112
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,510
tormented by past events every day,

113
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,680
with constant fear,

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
pain and suffering.

115
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,150
What's wrong?

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Medicine.

117
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,270
Here.

118
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Your illness occurs more frequently.

119
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,150
Suizhi,

120
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,070
if you don't use Shu's heart blood

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,830
to activate the Luminous Jade

122
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,120
before you turn thirty,

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
- You may…
- I told you

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,190
I would never hurt Shu.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,830
What about you?

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
If you don't take her heart blood,

127
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,390
you will die, do you know that?

128
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,350
To put it bluntly,

129
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,950
between the two of you,

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,480
one will have to make a sacrifice.

This person

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,830
cannot possibly be Shu.

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,430
Don't mention it

134
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,800
