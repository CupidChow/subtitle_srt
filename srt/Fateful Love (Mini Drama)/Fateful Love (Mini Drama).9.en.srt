"Why Do You Always Appear?"

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,430
Dad, I want to play with this.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,070
- Want to go up?
- Yes.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,560
- Come, let me help you.
- Okay.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Be careful.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,640
Shall we get it running first?

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,350
Be careful.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,560
Watching you.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,880
So dangerous.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
Wipe off your sweat.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,030
You are so naughty.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,790
Why don't you criticize him?

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,000
Just let him do what he wants.

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,310
Don't let him fall.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,150
Don't worry about it.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,270
Dad,

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Mom,

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,710
today is your wedding anniversary again.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,070
I come to see you.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,870
These seventeen years

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,150
have been hard on you.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,150
I don't know if you
still hold any resentment.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,840
In these seventeen years,

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
everything I have done

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,150
has been for revenge.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
I won't stop.

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,680
But the only person
I don't want to hurt is Shu.

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,480
No one can forgive

37
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,680
what her father did,

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,920
but I hope

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,790
she never finds out about this.

40
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,220
(Guxin Store)

41
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,470
Tomorrow,

42
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,240
I plan to

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,750
send Ban Xiuchun

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
to Germany

45
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,310
for a one-year market arrangement.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
The Guxin Store

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,750
will be under my management again.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,710
Everyone,

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
do you have any objections?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
- No.
- No.

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,630
It's a demotion instead of a promotion.

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,190
This is to eliminate dissenters,

53
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,800
to kick the Young Master's
power out of Shangqing.

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,030
But you know,

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,910
in the six months since
the Young Master took charge,

56
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,910
we've made the most money.

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,280
In my opinion, who would refuse money?

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,080
- Everyone,
- Who would refuse money.

60
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,190
do you have any objections

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,750
about the resolutions of today's meeting?

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,910
I have an objection.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,120
Ban Xiuchun?

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,960
Uncle,

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,710
you should make way.

66
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,470
This seat should be taken by me.

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,030
This is outrageous behavior.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Here

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
is not a place for your jokes.

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
This is the record of Guxin Store's

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,870
smuggled cultural relics
over the past three years.

72
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,080
If it were to be exposed,

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,470
everyone

74
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,910
can't escape, right?

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,310
This…

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
This is not a place for your nonsense.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,560
You need to understand,

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
You

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,280
are just the Young Master.

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,390
But don't forget,

81
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,120
Guxin Store

82
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,720
is not your place to decide.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,830
It's not your place either, Uncle.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,270
Do you remember what happened
seventeen years ago?

85
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,120
Only the one who holds the
ancestral Luminous Jade can wield power.

86
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,830
How much longer can this fake

87
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,190
ancestral jade help you cover up?

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
If you go for a fight to the death,

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,920
be careful not to ruin the rest of your life.

90
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
You…

91
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,750
How do you know?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Because I have already found

93
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,270
the Guardian of the Luminous Jade.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,190
The real ancestral jade

95
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,240
is with her.

96
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,950
Impossible.

97
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,510
Impossible.

98
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,910
Uncle,

99
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,390
you are truly a master of strategy,

100
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,560
but all in vain.

101
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,160
Alright.

102
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,310
Everyone has worked hard today.

103
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,510
Meeting is over.

104
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,160
In a few days,

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,190
I'll invite you to attend Guxin Store's

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,920
voting to decide the successor.

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
Who dares to leave?

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,870
Old Master, Old Master!

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Old Master!

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,120
- Old Master!
- Uncle,

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,120
you just recovered.

112
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,920
You'd better not to get angry.

113
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,020
By the way,

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,680
The ticket

115
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,510
to Germany,

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
keep it for yourself.

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I will send someone

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,630
to take good care of you.

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
Meeting is over.

120
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,710
This…

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
Let's go.

122
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,360
Let's go, let's go.

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Young Master,

124
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,640
how is it going?

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
That's good.

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
We are burning our boats this time.

127
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,190
Ban Ling has already
been sent abroad by me.

128
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,160
Forge the share transfer document.

129
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,310
In three days,

130
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,000
the voting for the successor will be held.

131
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,510
Once you inherit Guxin Store,

132
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,600
Gu Suizhi can do anything to you.

133
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,750
He is the greatest hidden danger.

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,810
He must be dead.

135
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Mr. Jin,

136
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,350
Mr. Jin,

137
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,720
you don't need to avoid me.

138
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,800
The Young Master has told me

139
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,510
what my father did.

140
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,920
I've found the way to apologize.

141
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
Young Master…

142
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,480
Since what my father did

143
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,270
is so unacceptable in the industry,

144
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,750
as his daughter,

145
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,070
I should repay on behalf of him.

146
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
Repay?

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,270
Don't do anything foolish.

148
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,240
Even if it's a life debt,

149
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
- how will you repay it?
- Life debt?

150
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,480
You are cheating me?

151
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,270
Mr. Jin,

152
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,310
I'm sorry,

153
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,630
but now,

154
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,160
only you can tell me the truth.

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,510
I beg you.

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,190
Please tell me.

157
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
Shu,

158
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,590
what happened?

159
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,920
My father

160
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,830
is a person from Guxin Store.

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,950
The Ruan Family has been
the Jade Guardian of the Ban Family.

162
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,830
But seventeen years ago,

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,750
it was he who betrayed your parents,

164
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,040
and caused your parents
to die tragically, right?

165
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,830
Who told you these?

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,950
So it's true?

167
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,680
Why did he do this?

168
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
He was influenced by my Uncle

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,160
Ban Ling's manipulation.

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
To obtain the Luminous Jade

171
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
and acquire Guxin Store,

172
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,240
Ban Ling devised this entire plan.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
Your father

174
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,190
has been tormented by guilt ever since,

175
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,360
which led to his depression.

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,190
So that's how it is.

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
This is the truth.

178
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
That fake Ban Xiuchun

179
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,320
didn't want you to return to Guxin Store
to reclaim your identity,

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
so he deceived me.

181
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,240
And you didn't want me to find out

182
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,790
my father is a murderer,

183
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,750
so you kept it from me.

184
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,720
Shu,

185
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
this has nothing to do with you.

186
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,630
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

187
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,080
You did nothing wrong.

188
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,910
It is the fault of our Ruan Family.

189
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,510
Mr. Gu,

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
no,

191
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,990
Mr. Ban,

192
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,750
I apologize on behalf of my father

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,670
to all of you.

I'm begging you.

197
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,750
Dad,

198
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,320
have you ever regretted it?

199
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,390
You must regret it a lot, right?

200
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,750
No wonder

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,960
I rarely saw you smile afterward.

202
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,150
It's so ridiculous

203
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,240
that I took the person

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,270
