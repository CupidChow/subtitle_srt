Mr. Gu?

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,550
Mr. Sun,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,640
what are you planning to do?

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,600
Are they under your protection?

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,520
You sell counterfeits in the market.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,840
Now, you are involved in fighting.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,880
Kungu Store's development path

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,600
is truly eye-opening.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,150
Mr. Gu, if you want to protect them,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,790
I will let them go.

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,310
The antique business is very complex.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,230
You shouldn't have rushed in recklessly.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,490
Mr. Gu,

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,790
you're playing the hero again, huh?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Unfortunately, this trick

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,430
doesn't work on me anymore.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
Shu,

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,150
about the previous matters,

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,480
I can explain to you.

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,870
Let go, Gu Suizhi!

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,070
You carry the Luminous Jade

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,750
without someone protecting you,

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,280
you will become the target
of the entire antique world.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,840
I don't need anyone's protection.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,230
And you don't need to

35
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,640
play affectionate anymore.

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,040
It is not only disgusting,

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
but also makes me hate you more.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
- Let's go.
- Shu.

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
(Guxin Store)
A few days ago,

40
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,350
a crisis of counterfeit circulation
in the antique market

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,190
made Guxin Store suffer a blow.

42
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,310
The current Master of Guxin Store
Ban Ling is critically ill.

43
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,080
Who spread this fake news?

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,030
Have you found it out?

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
There are no traces at all.

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,430
Young Master, these old shareholders
are so stubborn.

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,470
Should we dismiss those
who do not obey you?

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Considering the current situation,

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,310
don't act rashly.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Use money

51
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,240
to stabilize those old shareholders
with dissenting opinions.

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
My uncle is seriously ill,

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,710
but he has not lost the people's support.

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,190
If we act rashly now,

55
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,840
we may cut off our own path.

56
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,710
Yes.

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
About Ruan Shu…

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
You know what to do.

59
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,310
After this half-true news

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,310
was released,

61
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,280
the people at Guxin Store
were taking action.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,470
Ban Ling's life

63
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,710
was probably ended by his own people.

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,710
I haven't avenged the grudge
seventeen years ago.

65
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,520
How could I let him die like that?

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,000
You mean we are invited for an interview?

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,910
Yes, I just received the message.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Ming and Qing Folk Legends
Art Exhibition.

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
He said he received our materials.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
He gave me the address,

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,190
asking us to go there tomorrow.

72
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,470
(Yuanbao Pavilion)
Great!

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,910
This is the biggest exhibition of the year.

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,630
Heaven still has eyes.

75
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,470
Heaven bless us.

76
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,120
We can definitely reopen
the Yuanbao Pavilion.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,340
(Yuanbao Pavilion)

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Go.

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,180
(Guxin Store)

80
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,310
Guxin Store?

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
What's wrong?

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
Is there a problem?

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,470
(Guxin Store)
Miss Ruan?

84
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,240
Mr. Ban would like to
chat with you first.

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
Please come inside.

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Young Master.

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,270
Sit.

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,470
Have some tea?

89
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,360
You know me?

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,910
Gu Suizhi's woman.

91
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
It's not surprising

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,190
to know you.

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
You should wonder

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,070
who I am.

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,430
You are the Manager of Guxin Store,

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,430
and also the one who sent me the email.

97
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,800
You are Ban...

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,750
Ban Xiuchun.

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,720
Don't be afraid.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,390
I have nothing to do

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,830
with your father's matter.

102
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,040
You should be able to guess it too.

103
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,070
I am not the real Ban Xiuchun.

104
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,600
However,

105
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,160
I invite you here

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,920
because we have a common enemy,

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,680
the other Ban Xiuchun.

108
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,510
You want me to deal with…

109
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,310
Why should I help you?

110
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,750
Because you want to
reopen the Yuanbao Pavilion.

111
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,240
In the entire Shangqing City,

112
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,310
only I can help you.

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,750
What exactly is the grudge

114
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,040
between you and Gu Suizhi?

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
That's not what
you should get involved in.

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,480
You only need to consider

117
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,870
whether to cooperate with me

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
or not.

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,190
You just need to come to
work at Guxin Store.

120
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,270
As for other matters,

121
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,830
I will take care of them for you,

122
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
including

123
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,480
avenging your father.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Master,

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,310
please take a look at this plan.

126
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
No problem.

127
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,160

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,040
Why are you here?

130
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm here for work.

we are colleagues from now on.

My biggest regret

190
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,550
is

191
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,750
take her my cure.

192
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
I just received the news.

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Miss Ruan

194
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
went to work at Guxin Store.

195
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,870
What?

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Mr. Gu,

197
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
I can tell.

198
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
Miss Ruan has feelings for you.

199
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,550
You can tell her the whole truth.

200
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,910
Maybe she will agree to give you the jade.

201
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,670
Even if she agrees, I won't agree.

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,750
She cannot bear

203
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,030
the so-called truth.

204
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,910
But you only have three months left.

205
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,600
With Ban Family's Curse,

206
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,840
before you turn thirty,

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,240
you must use Luminous Jade

208
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,670
and the heart blood of the Ruans'
to extend your life.

209
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,390
If you can't do that,

210
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,000
- you…
- Using her heart blood

211
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
can extend my life,

212
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,360
but she might be hurt
by the Luminous Jade.

213
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,870
I have already hurt her enough.

214
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,790
I can no longer take advantage of her.
