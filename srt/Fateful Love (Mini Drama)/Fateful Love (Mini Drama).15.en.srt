00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,070
Mr. Gu is indeed talented and handsome.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,710
Here, Mr. Gu.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,880
Hello, Miss Ruan.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,560
Hello.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,430
Let's have a drink too.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,520
Mr. Gu, you are still so handsome.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,070
Come on, Mr. Gu,
let's have a drink together.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,000
Beauty,

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,230
are you alone?

20
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,230
Yes, I'm so lonely.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Could we have a toast?

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,070
Mr. Gu, when will you come again?

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,760
This exhibition is so successful.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,480
Everyone is praising you.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Not really.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
It's all thanks to everyone's efforts.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,000
So humble.

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,710
Hello, Mr. Gu.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,310
I am a reporter from Shi Qi Culture.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,950
This exhibition is truly spectacular.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,350
Let me toast to you first.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
You can tolerate this?

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,920
If it's yours, no one can take it away.

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,070
I hope you feel good.

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,310
Could you please leave a contact number

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,000
and explain it to me privately?

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,120
Sorry about that.

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,190
Excuse me for a moment.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
I thought you would come over.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Why?

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,840
Do you want to see me angry
and kick people out?

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
You can do this.

43
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,990
However,

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm a bit tired of things like this.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,430
Mr. Gu, what

46
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,430
do you mean by this?

47
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,120
If I were married,

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,310
I believe it will reduce a lot of trouble.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
So, Miss Ruan,

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,590
when exactly do you plan to

51
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,080
give me a title.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
It depends on your performance.

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,430
It seems good things are coming soon.

54
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,900
(Tablet for the Late Parents Gu)

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,910
I've waited for seventeen years.

56
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,870
Finally, I can bring you
back to Guxin Store.

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,710
You won't be angry, right?

58
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,190
(Tablet for the Late Parents Gu
Ban Qingquan and Wu Jin)

59
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,120
For so many years,

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
you've always been working hard for this.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Uncle and Aunt definitely won't be angry.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,190
They will only feel relieved for you.

63
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,710
By the way, the Restaurant you chose

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,910
has already been booked for you.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,630
Are you planning to…

66
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,190
I am planning to propose to Shu tomorrow.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,710
Propose once more?

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
Didn't you propose before?

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,380
Is it necessary to be so troublesome?

70
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,080
Since we've decided to start over,

71
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,840
none of the required procedures

72
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,590
should be missing.

73
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,030
Alright.

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,750
I wish you

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
all the best in the future.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,190
Why is it this dream again?

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Who exactly are you?

78
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,720
I am you.

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,390
You are me.

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Don't you want to know

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
the whole truth?

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Truth?

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
You had a nightmare again?

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
It's okay.

85
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,680
These are fresh pastries

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,990
made by your favorite pastry shop.

87
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,910
Thank you.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
You bought so many!

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Why did you come back so late today?

90
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,830
I've been preparing something important.

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,930
You are so capable.

92
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,550
You will definitely
handle everything smoothly.

93
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
It smells so good.

94
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,870
Try it.

95
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,870
It's really good.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
You are so annoying.

97
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,800
If you think it's unfair,

98
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,390
you can return it to me.

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Fine.

100
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,190
Feeling balanced now?

101
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,630
If it's not enough,

102
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,950
I can make another sacrifice.

103
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,720
You want to take advantage of me.

104
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm not falling for it.

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Shu,

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,160
well,

107
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,430
are you free tomorrow evening?

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
What's wrong?

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,720
Didn't you say
you want to see my performance?

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Alright.

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Shu,

112
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,680
I had someone take a look at it.

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,000
Your design is very good.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you, Mr. Jin. I will work hard.

115
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,270
Shu,

116
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,750
you dressed up so beautifully.

117
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,070
Are you going on a date with Mr. Gu?

118
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,240
You all know about it?

119
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
Did you forget that day you got drunk?

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,390
It's Mr. Gu who came to pick you up.

121
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,870
Let me tell you more.

122
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,600
According to my insider information,

123
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,160
we might attend a wedding banquet soon.

124
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,480
Oh my.

125
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,270
It seems Shu has managed it quite well.

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Bless you.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,430
Thank you, I will leave first.

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
She's feeling shy.

129
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,360
- Hello?
- Where are you?

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
I'll pick you up.

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Don't bother.

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,310
The entire company is talking about

133
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,870
our situation.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
I can go by myself.

135
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,310
Alright, be careful.

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
Good.

137
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
Wear this outfit.

138
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,470
Why?

139
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,840
Your heart is uncomfortable again.

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,160
I feel like

141
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,750
something is about to happen.

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,550
What else could it be?

143
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,600
Your condition...

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,550
will be helpful if it doesn't worsen.

145
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,670
Can't you not be like this?

146
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,000
You just finished the phone call.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
You're too sweet.

148
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,790
