It's still early for god's sake!

No.

Can we speak inside?

Eh.

Wait.

Ms. Xiang, did you have a rough night?

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Nothing.

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,520
You see nothing.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
Mr. Chu.

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,040
What can I help?

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,000
I need you to sign the documents

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,040
from B.O. and Ruide.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
That's all?

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
This shouldn't require you to visit me.

28
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,600
The other party doesn't usually

29

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,920
I'll sign it.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll sign it now.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,040
I won't waste your precious time.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,640
Don't show your handwriting

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
to anyone easily from now on.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,840
Why?

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Because your handwriting is different.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,040
How can it be?

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,960
I have seen your handwriting before.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Although it is similar to yours now,

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,360
the pauses are different.

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
Are you Xiang Wei?

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,160
I am.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
It can't be any clearer.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,520
For real?

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,040
It's quite likely that you won't

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,480
believe what I'm about to say.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Right.

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,400
You are Xiang Wei

49

50

Wow.

What on earth.

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,360
How do you know?

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,240
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Chu Yumo,

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
is there sanity

57

in your brain?

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
I believe you.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
I believe

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
whatever you say.

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,680
Oh.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Now that you have signed it,

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,080
I should go.

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,800
I'll see you off.

65
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,920
No need.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,680
Okay.

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,000

68

and sees the mess
I make out of her life,

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,120
she will scold me.

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,600

some time alone

allows me to do a lot of thinking

122

I was too eager.

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,320
I asked him

to give me the love

But the dust has settled.

127

You should take a break.

128

But this moment of peacefulness

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
feels like

130
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,280
the calm before the storm.

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
You still work as hard

as before.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,040
What about your love life?

for a long time,

when you resurface,

breathless.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
But after the breathlessness

139
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,120
is rebirth.

140
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,640
We play golf for three years.

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,880
I didn't know a golf genius like you

to my mind suddenly.

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Golfing

151
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,120
is to force you
to act against your nature.

152
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,560
When we can defy

the soil provides a greater hindrance
