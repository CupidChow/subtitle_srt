Where is the barrister called Xiaoai?

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,760
She resigned last Saturday.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
She was just a part-timer.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,320
Last week?

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,560
Hello?

(when others see these photos.)

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Are you blackmailing me?

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,120
(I'm just helping you make a choice.)

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,280
(Have you thought about
the deal last time?)

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Okay.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,160
You have my word.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,040
Now is the time to retaliate.

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,440
(Good.)

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
(I will reinstate you in Lingrui)

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,560
(and you will help me
get the Xiang Group.)

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,080
Don't worry.

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,040
(I like people
who can deliver their promises.)

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,760
(I won't send those photos to Xiang Meng)

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
(so put on a good show out there.)

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
Other than you,

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,320
do I have other options?

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,640
(Hmph.)

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I have always felt

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
that there are
too many coincidences lately.

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,920
When I needed money,

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,560
someone bought all
of Xiang Meng's shares.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,920
When I needed
to restructure the company,

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Ruide swooped in to help me.

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,520
I couldn't fathom why

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
you were doing that

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
until you asked your people
to short the Xiang Group.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,240
You and she

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,960
are so different.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
You are more shrewd

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
and decisive.

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
When I first met you,

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
I had a notion that you weren't her.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
Eyes don't lie, you know.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,160
No matter how hard you pretend
to be her,

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,640
you cannot hide the ambition
in your eyes.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,400
Time can harden one's shell

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,240
but when one cares for something,

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,320
you start to think twice.

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,640
When you reclaimed Lingrui,

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't notice it.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
But when we played golf last time,

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
the error you made out of reflex

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
confirmed my suspicion
that you are not her.

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
The Chus are one of a kind.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
You would believe something abnormal.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
But why are you helping me?

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
Because someone asked me to.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,360
I gave the person my words
so I had to deliver them.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Then why are you reneging?

59
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
I am a businesswoman.

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
I maximize profit.

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
It's the Queen's Gambit.

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
The game just began.

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Life is like an arena ring.

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
The current you

65
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
are not good enough to be my enemy.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,120
What if

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
I insist on meddling?

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,040
You're running out of time.

69
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
Each pawn you sacrifice

70
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
is another grave you dig for yourself.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
It serves no purpose.

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,200
One will never know

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,440
if you never try.

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,920
Oh, the youth.

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
So bold. So impulsive.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Play some golf if you can.

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
The biggest obstacle in golfing
isn't others,

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
but yourself.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Your arrogance
will blind your technique.

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,080
But you

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,080
desperately grasp for salvation

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
when you make a swing.

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
You're still in the mood to golf?

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,640
My enemy suggested I do that.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
I have to give it a try.

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,920
Know your enemy, they say.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
You need some polishing.

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
Mrs. Chu is right.

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,840
I am too impatient.

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
I am not

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
on her level now.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,680
You have made some progress.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
A 5cm error in putting

94
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,440
is better than landing 200 yards away
from the target.

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
All things

96
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
leave a trace.

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,360
But tell me.

98
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240
How can the same individual

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,280
have such a huge discrepancy
in golfing skills?

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,400
Whatever.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
I'll call it a day here.

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,960
Why did you come to me?

103
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,560
Oh.

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
My housekeeper made it

105
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
and told me to give it to you.

106
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
Nice.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
How kind of you.

108
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
Is there anything you want to tell me?

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
Why didn't you go to the office today?

110
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Why should I?

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
There are so many restrictions there.

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,040
And Mrs. Chu

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
is staking out with a sniper rifle,

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
to show up.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
Don't beat yourself up.

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,280
Everyone has a weakness.

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,280
Observe carefully

119

it's been showing up
