Xiang Tianqiang begged me
to protect the Xiang family.

I heard you are sick

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
so I came to visit you.

Leave.

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,960
I don't need your pity.

Don't get too worked up now.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,040
A woman who leeches off another family.

to criticize me like that?

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120

Mengmeng and I can't live

Do you know?

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,240
Will you be happy if I die right now?

20

I want you and your daughter

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,120
to live with this pain forever.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Cruel witch!

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
More than ten years ago,
you ruined my family

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
and caused my mother to die in sorrow.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Are you not cruel?

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,720
Not enough.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,760
I regret it so much now.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I shouldn't have spared you.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,480
You talk about the injustice
your mom suffered.

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
Mengmeng's hardship,

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,920
my humiliation,

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,720
my pain. What about them?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Tell me.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Therefore,

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,120
you let the seed of hatred fester
in Xiang Meng's heart.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,640
You want her to think that I
took her father away,

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,640
that I took away her chance
at living like a proper child.

Xiang Wei,

42

I will not let you off the hook.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,680
Hmph.

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
Save that when you actually
stand a chance to fight me.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't worry.

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,080
I won't do anything to her.

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
She needs to live

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,600
to serve her punishment.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,160
Do you know why Jiang Fengyan
betrayed you?

51
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,960
Because you refuse
to get off your high horse.

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
It is suffocating.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Congratulations, by the way.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Two wrongs

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,920
don't make a right

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
but they sure make a matching couple.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
No need to provoke me.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
My child and I

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
will not repeat your mistake.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,320
Speaking of your child,

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
do you think

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,320
you ran into Cici

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
by chance that day?

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
What do you mean?

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,880
You orchestrated it?

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,520
You lured me into this trap

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
so that

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,720
I would force Jiang Fengyan
to divorce you.

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,520
And then you can reclaim Lingrui.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
A cheating man

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
doesn't care

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,960
about his wife,

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,160
let alone his mistress.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
He only cares

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
about his desire.

76
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,960
It doesn't matter

77
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,840
which woman he's with.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,560
So if you didn't have anything
that could threaten him,

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
he wouldn't get a divorce with me.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
But I have his baby now.

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,320
I am now who you used to be.

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Oh, Xiang Meng.

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,320
You hired people

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
to release those info
and photos, didn't you?

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
So what?

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
Thank you then.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Just when I was wondering

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,520
how I could divorce Jiang Fengyan quickly,

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,480
you

90
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,280
gave me a solution.

91
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
You plotted everything

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,320
to force Jiang Fengyan

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
and drag me down along with it.

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
But he is the Jiang Fengyan.

95
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,320
If I didn't intercept the news cycle,

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,680
your plan

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
will be foiled.

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
Look at this innocent face of yours.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
I truly don't have it in me
to break it to Jiang Fengyan.

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,840
After all,

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,080
he just lost his career and his family.

102
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,960
He can't afford to lose
his mistress too.

This

104
