Where are you going?

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,600
Erm...

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm going home.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,400
What about the bags and the sunglasses?

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,160
You left them aside
and you don't use them.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,640
So, I thought about borrowing them
for a few days.

Hey.

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,360
Why do you argue

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,120
early in the morning?

Fengyan.

Jiang Zijie.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
Do you think you're right
to take my things?

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
They are old clothing and bags.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
Just give them to Zijie.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
You can buy new one.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,960
That's right, Wei.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,640
You're so kind to me over these years.

24

You didn't snap

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,600
when I took
the red trench coat last time.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
It turns out the Celine coat
is taken by you.

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,280
Oh my.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,760
I won't take the blame for this.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,960
Aunt liked that coat

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
and she asked me to take it.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,280
Plus, you didn't wear it though.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,720
I thought you didn't want it.

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
Aunt?

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,520
It seems your family has regarded
my house as a shopping centre.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
Enough.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
Quit arguing over old clothing.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Zijie.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,800
Go home now

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
or you'll miss the railway.

40

Go now.

41

I'll get going.

See you, Fengyan.

See you, Wei.

What's wrong with you?

47
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,640
Are you letting her leave like this?

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,760
You're her sister-in-law.

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,160
Go easy on her.

50

I'm going on a business trip.

Get me the luggage.
