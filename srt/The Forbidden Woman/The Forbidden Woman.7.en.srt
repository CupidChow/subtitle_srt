3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
You must be waiting for him
for a long time.

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,280
Not really.

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
I really appreciate that you sent me
the photo last time.

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,400
It's just a small deal.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,920
All men are the same.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,920
They never stay loyal

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,880
when they encounter many women.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,520
Likewise, they always hesitate

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
when it comes to benefits.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
Do you have a similar problem too?

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,160
It's already history to me.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,520
Anyway,

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,840
humans have to go all out

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
to pursue what they desire for

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
and leave no regrets.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,520
People said, "waiting for someone
with all her life"

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
"and loving someone
with a pure heart."

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
I think one can't get the person
she wants

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
if she's just waiting for it.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Ms. Xiang.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,200
Will you feel uncomfortable

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,720
with my words?

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,680
No.

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,880
What you said

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
has cheered me up.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,560
It's been a long while

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,800
since I met someone I could confide in.

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,200
Let's raise our glasses.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,320
We should've met
with each other earlier.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,840
Perhaps we're destined to meet now.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Just call me Mengmeng.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,440
It's a bit formal
when you call me Ms. Xiang.

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,320
Mengmeng.

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,200
There's something

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
I shouldn't tell you.

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,480
But I think

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I feel so bad

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,240
if I keep it from you.

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,880
It's fine.

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,320
Go ahead.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
Please don't deem me a busybody.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,280
No, I won't.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,880
I heard

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,040
that Mr. Jiang has always wanted a child
of his own.

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,160
So, he's been taking Chinese Medicine
for a long time.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
However, his wife

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,000
can't get pregnant.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,440
A wedge is formed between them
because of this.

51
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,040
How did you know about this?

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,400
Let me show you one thing.

53
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,800
My colleague ran into this
and took this photo a few days ago.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,440
It's a small world, Mr. Chu.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,440
My sister-in-law wanted
to introduce new friends to me.

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,680
Unexpectedly,

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
it'd be Ms. Xiang

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,880
and Mr. Jiang.

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Oh, we met each other briefly

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
during the banquet at Xiang's residence.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,120
I was impressed

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
by your young and
accomplished demeanour.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Indeed you have

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
outshone us.

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,320
You flattered me.

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
Lingrui and Xiang Group

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
are excellent corporates.

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
And both Ruide and B.O.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,640
have to depend on corporates like you

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,680
to make money.

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,440
It's our pleasure

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
to collaborate
with a successful entrepreneur like you.

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,240
I just lucked out.

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,880
Without Weiwei,

75
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
the company wouldn't have come this far.

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,800
A harmonious family is the cornerstone
of a stable career.

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
Lingrui has a promising future

78
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
because of both of you.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,480
Let's raise our glasses.

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
(Mr. Jiang has always wanted a child
of his own.)

81
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,880
(However, his wife)

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
(can't get pregnant.)

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,440
(Let me show you one thing.)

84
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,320
Xiang Wei.

85
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,040
Everything you possess now

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,320
will belong to me one day.

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
Thank you so much.

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Dear.

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,040
Look at this.

90
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,840
It's a gift for you.

91
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
I put it on for you.

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,800
Are you tired?

93
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,440
No.

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,280
Dear.

95
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,720
It's been some time
since we've travelled.

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Let's go to the resort house

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
and relax tomorrow.

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,480
Good call.

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll follow everything you plan.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,160
All right.

101
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,920
It suits you very well.

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Dear.

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,480
It's a call from the office.

104
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,280
I need to answer it.

105
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
Dear.

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Erm...

107
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
It's a work looking for me.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
I need to go now.

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Don't wait up.

110
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,880
All right.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
Go ahead.

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Don't strain yourself too much.

113
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,160
Sure.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm worried about you.

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,120
All right.

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,480
Go to bed early.

117
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,760
Good night.

118
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:48,880
Sure.

119
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,280
Mengmeng.

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,080
Mengmeng.

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,280
Mengmeng.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
Why are you so drunk?

123
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Fengyan.

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,440
Huh?

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes.

126
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,360
Don't touch me.

127
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm good to be alone.

128
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
Let me carry you to your room.

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,880
No.

130
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,240
Leave me alone.

131
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,160
Mengmeng.

132
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
You're drunk.

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
I'll give it back to her.

134
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll give Xiang's property

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
and you

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,000
back to Wei.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,680
What?

138
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,400
What are you mumbling?

139
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,520
Why

140
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,920
am I the laughingstock
of Xiang's family?

141
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm a lowly child
who was born out of wedlock

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
and nobody has noticed me.

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
I've been working

144
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
so hard all the time.

145
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,360
Yet, what I've done is covered
by my identity.

146
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,680
Perhaps only a few people
who share your situation

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
can understand you.

148
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Fengyan.

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,640
(Though I'm determined to avenge
Xiang Wei of this time-space,)

150
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,680
(however, my love for Jiang Fengyan
accumulated over the years)

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,200
(always halts me from hurting him.)

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,280
(Being in a relationship with someone)

153
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,200
(is like keeping a lemon shark with you.)

154
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,720
If one doesn't go forward,

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,920
he'll die.

156
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
(In the previous time-space)
I feel that our relationship

157
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,160
(Xiang Wei, 25 years old)
is like a dead lemon shark.

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,680
What are you trying to say,
Jiang Fengyan?

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Let's end here.

160
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
Jiang Fengyan.

161
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
We're only in our twenties.

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
We still have time
to put everything right.

163
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
Let me interpret what you said.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,680
You're implying,

165
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,640
"Xiang Wei."

166
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,600
"I've squeezed anything of value
out of you."

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,320
"What I want now is freedom."

168
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,520
"Please give me freedom now."

169
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Am I right?
