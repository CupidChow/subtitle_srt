What I can offer Fengyan

19

is something you're incapable of.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040

It's not important what I can offer him.

The thing is, he can't leave the family.

You've been with him together
for a long time,

value your feelings,

I'll leave Jiang Fengyan immediately.

Do you really want to keep this baby?

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,840
Of course.

Thanks to you,

172
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Fengyan

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,920
gave me a ring yesterday.

174
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,960
Are you sure everything you do
is worth it?

175
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
Of course.

176
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,680
I've been waiting this moment

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
for five years.

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Five years?

179
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Did you break your ligament
five years ago

180
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
on a purpose?

181
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,160
Because you wanted
to approach Jiang Fengyan?

182
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
You just realised this today?

183
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
As expected from the great daughter
of Xu Qing.

184
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Using your dance career

185
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
and five years of youth

186
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
for a chance

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,960
to intrude into other's family
in return.

188
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,200
Speaking as someone
who's been through a lot,

189
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
obtaining the love of Jiang Fengyan

190
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,240
isn't the best choice for you.

191
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,120
Don't you worry about me.

192
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,320
You should care about yourself instead.

193
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,680
My

194
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
dear sister.

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Both of us know very well

196
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
that Jiang Fengyan regards marriage

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
as a tool to pursue what he wants.

198
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,000
And you've been trapped in the mire.

199
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,760
This is

200
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
a present for you.

201
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
A wedding present.

202
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Isn't it something you've coveted?

203
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,600
Mr. Chu.

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,000
Mrs. Chu has offered you

206
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
a lot of benefits.

207
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
Why did you know about it?

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
It's easy.

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,800
And I know

210
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
more about you too.

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
What do you want?

212
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
You're merely a pawn in the game.

213
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
If the plan is exposed,

214
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,120
do you think

215
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
Mrs. Chu would still keep you in check?

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm not interested in
what she wants to do.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
But, don't you lay your finger
on Xiang Wei,

218
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
otherwise, you'll regret
for what you do.

I'll let you go♪
