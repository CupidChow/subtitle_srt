Fengyan has been working
around the clock

(Five years ago)

He has nothing to do with me now.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,840
Fengyan broke up with you

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,160
because he wanted to protect you.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,400
Do you think

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,160
I'll believe in what you said?

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,960
Actually,

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
the funding from Mogen

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,120
is crucial to Lingrui.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
However, Fengyan is aware

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,520
that you've offended many people

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,120
to get the funding from Morgan

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,000
and it might affect your reputation.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Between the company and you,

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,000
Fengyan chose
to protect your reputation.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,920
That's why he had to break up with you.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
It's out of the question for Mogen

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,800
to invest in a company
without potential.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Besides, Fengyan's ability

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
is the reason why I went to persuade
Mogen.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
People's words are dangerous.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
Fengyan didn't wish to drag you
into trouble.

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Does the situation in Lingrui

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,960
turn better?

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
Had the situation turned better,

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
Fengyan wouldn't have
to work finger to bone now.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,520
Jiang Fengyan is so silly.

38

He can just tell me if he's in trouble.

But, the media caught you

holding that woman's hand

not to do medical checkups
