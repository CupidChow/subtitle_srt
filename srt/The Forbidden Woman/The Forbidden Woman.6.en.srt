Mr. Jiang.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
We're bleeding money for the launching.

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm afraid that the company will go under

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,640
if we keep bleeding money on this

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,360
before the company goes public.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,880
What's the attitude

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,720
of the shareholders?

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
After Ruide Group pulled out,

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,560
the other shareholders falter.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
Keep this between us.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,080
Understood?

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,440
You may go now.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,800
Sure.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,800
Wei.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,000
This is the material you requested.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,080
Haven't you decided to make any moves?

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,520
Lingrui would be gravely affected

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,920
if I start the plan now.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,080
But Xu Qing and Xiang Meng

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,080
have already been in motion.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
It's fine.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,000
Hunting

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
needs perfect timing.

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,920
Alright.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,720
Anything you say.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,320
Wei.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
I have a doubt.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,160
Well.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,240
You're a woman with a thinking brain.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,080
Why would you be controlled emotionally
over the years?

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,480
Dear, dinner time.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,640
All right.

(Property Ownership Certificate)

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Dear.

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,320
You...

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,040
Why give me this?

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
You need this now. Take it.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
We just bought this downtown house.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
The layout and the interior design

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,360
are to your liking.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
If you sell it now,

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,240
we won't buy a wonderful house
as such again.

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,560
A house without love
is merely a lump of soil.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Husband and wife should face
the trouble together.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,400
Besides,

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
not only Lingrui is your life's work,

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,760
but the livelihood of thousands
of families depends on it too.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Dear.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
You've done so much for me

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
over these years.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
After the company goes public,

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,480
I'm going to make it worth your while.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
No, dear.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
You've weaved me a dream
for the past five years.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,400
That's enough for me.

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
As for the child,

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,080
let's not persist on it.

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
We can live happily
without child too.

61
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
(Do you know what PUA means?)

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,720
It means mind controlling.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
It's not only a simple behaviour.

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Someone who applied this technique
influences one

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,640
through a process of resisting,

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
compromising and
finally getting used to it.

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
I understand you're upset
about the child.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
I feel the same too.

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,240
You can lock your husband down

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,280
if you have a child.

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,880
For example, the process begins with

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,080
"May I"

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
"sit beside you?"

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Then, it becomes

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,880
"I like it when you sit beside me."

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,000
"I want you to sit beside me."

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,520
Finally, it turns out as

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,600
"I don't allow"

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,360
"you to sit next to anyone but me."

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,640
To be fair,

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,280
I can create a similar misunderstanding,
can't I?

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,800
What do you mean?

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,440
Once you sink deep into the mire,

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
you won't get out of it.

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,240
According to your medical reports

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
for the past five years,

87
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,600
nothing is wrong with your health.

Weiwei.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
I sense something changing in you.

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,560
You seem

91
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
to have returned to your past self

92
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,000
when we just got married.

93
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
No, I didn't return to the past,

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,400
I do it for the sake of the future.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,120
Right.

96
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,000
For the sake of the future.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,440
Here.

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Let's drink the medicine

99
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,800
for the sake of our future.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
It's bitter.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
(You've left the mire.)

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm really happy

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
to see your real self return.

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,240
This is just

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
the beginning.

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,280
(I suppose Xiang Wei
made a deal with me)

107

Darling! Reply to me now. Are you there, Darling?)

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
It's the group chat of the company.

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,920
Gosh, please give me a break.

Yes.

118

It's a crank call.

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes.

What time are you home tonight?

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
I think I'll be late tonight.

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
I have several meetings to attend.

125
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
I invite Mrs. Chu of Ruide Group

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,240
for dinner at home tonight.

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
She's my senior at my business academy.

128
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200
I want to present you to her.

129
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
Mrs. Chu?

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,960
Mrs. Chu is the board member of Ruide.

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
When did you know her?

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
She used to stay low-key.

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,880
I overheard something
about Lingrui and Ruide

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,840
when I went to the office last time.

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,400
That's why I requested to meet with her.

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
I didn't expect

137
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
she'd attend to my request so soon.

138
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
What time does Mrs. Chu come?

139
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Around seven.

140
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
Seven.

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
There'll be so much traffic tonight.

142
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,120
Well.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,680
I come back earlier.

144
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
I leave the office at four

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
and I'll reach home at around five.

146

Good.

170
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,560
Hey.

171
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,280
Have you eaten yet?

172
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,080
I'm getting off now.

173
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Do you want to join me?

174
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,680
Sure.

175
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,000
I go and pack my things.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,320
Sure.

177
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
It's Chateau d'Yquem.

178
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,560
You still remember this, Weiwei.

179
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,000
What's the story

180
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
behind this?

181
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,920
We worked on the chateau merger

182
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,400
when we were in college.

183
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
During the marketing research,

184
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,880
we analysed the red wine
from different chateaus

185
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,800
but of the same area.

186
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
We were drinking a lot

187
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,240
(Darling, I've been waiting for you downstairs!)
and got hammered every day

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
(I'm having a meeting. You go back first.)
during that period.

189
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
After that project,

190
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,920
we named each other

191
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,440
with the brand of the wine.

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
What an enviable experience.

193
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,280
I envy what you've been through too.

194
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,120
You start a business from scratch

195
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
and develop Lingrui into a top-bracket
company within a few years.

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,880
Thanks to Weiwei

197
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,400
who granted me the luck.
