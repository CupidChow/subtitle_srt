I was not looking at you.

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
You were in the way of my sunlight.

Don't tell me this is a coincidence.

It is a coincidence.

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,800
I just got my routine check-up

11

and I saw you get pushed in here.

Be mindful when you eat now.

he's my brother.

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,280
His Chinese is bad

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,200
and he can't read.

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,480

can I get a brain scan?

Why?

58

I haven't been able to sleep well lately

59

and I keep having hallucinations.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
I think I might have

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Alzheimer's.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,280
Don't overthink it.

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,160
You're fine.

64
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,720

What?

67

Let's wait for Cici outside.

69

Make sure you take the meds.

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760
So many meds here.

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
How am I supposed to take them?

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,840
Well, Wei.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,920

No.

84

She was sent here in an emergency.

105
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,000
Apparently, she got into a shock
from a food allergy.

Food allergy?

107

She is a cautious person.

108

She wouldn't
ingest something carelessly.

It's Fengyan's child.

you are the only one who gets me.

130
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
But now, you're forcing me too.
