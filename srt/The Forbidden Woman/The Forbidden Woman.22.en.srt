(Lingrui Group)

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,520
Ms. Xiang sent everyone an e-mail
yesterday for a meeting

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,960
but why is she late?

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Why is Jiang Fengyan here?

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,240
Ms. Xiang is beside herself lately.

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,600
No idea.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,560
Should I ask around?

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,360
Hey.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,560
Do you know what happened to Ms. Xiang?

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Beat me to it.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
How odd.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,240
It's about time.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,360
Let's begin.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,960
Okay.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,360
Today,

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,440
I gather everyone here

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
to convey the latest structural changes

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
in the upcoming quarter
as instructed by the board.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,480
We have successfully weathered
our financial crisis

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
and the instability engendered
by our IPO

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,640
has been dealt with
under the leadership of Ms. Xiang.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
Due to a recent change
to our internal strategic direction,

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,840
considering the company's
long-term development,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
the board has voted

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,880
that Ms. Xiang Wei is to step down
as the CEO of Lingrui Group.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,680
Her position will be succeeded
by Mr. Jiang Fengyan.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
I have another announcement

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
to make.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
The board has already passed the vote

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,280
to appoint Ms. Xiang Wei

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,920
as the company's

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,360
executive chairperson.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,440
A round of applause, please.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,800
You're back.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Surprised?

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
You won this round.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,480
Xiang Group

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,880
has submitted evidence of your
disruptive market manipulation

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,440
to the court yesterday.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,920
She did all that?

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,760
Yes.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,640
You made a mistake
by underestimating her.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,080
She isn't on your level

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
but she will keep you in check.

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,840
How did she manage
to convince Jiang Fengyan?

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
When you put yourself
in Jiang Fengyan's shoes,

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,320
you'll realize

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,320
that his safety isn't his priority.

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,760
It's whether the people around him
are on the same page or not.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
In this world,

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,920
no one wants Lingrui to be strong

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
as much as Xiang Wei and he do.

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,320
It seems like I have to be serious now.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,720
I didn't expect to face you one day.

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Everything can change in business.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
Just like Jiang Fengyan and you.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Both of you are not going to live
in harmony in Lingrui.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
You targeted the Xiang Group and me

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,440
because you are afraid that I
will pose a threat to the Chu family.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Your husband has passed away.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Mrs. Chu,

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
people and business, they are the same.

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
A scrutiny

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,680
will reveal all the ugly sides.

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,600
But I have to thank you.

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
Thank you for showing mercy

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
in the first half of the game.

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
You should thank

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,320
Chu Yumo instead.

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
It's getting windy.

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,720
Indeed.

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,640
How long has it been

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,200
since we last watched a sunset together?

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,720
Five years?

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Or perhaps seven years?

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,680
I can't remember.

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,520
You have changed a lot

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
and you made me reflect upon myself.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,240
When life exposes you repeatedly,

82
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,040
after countless injustices
I went through,

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,920
I thought I couldn't do anything
to fight back.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
Until she came.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,680
Her bravery, kindness,
ingenuity, and boldness

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
allowed me to find my true self back.

87
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Weiwei.

88
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Weiwei.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,960
From our marriage

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,240
to when we were dating,

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
my love for you is real.

92
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
But I made a lot a mistakes.

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,800
I blamed my low self-esteem on you.

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,120
I ruined our marriage.

95
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
I ruined your youth.

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,960
No one

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
can ruin me.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
Can we be what we used to be?

99
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Jiang Fengyan.

100
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,920
I don't hate you

101
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,040
but I will never forgive you.

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Sorry.

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
I know

104
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
this apology came too late.

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
But perhaps
this is the best ending for us.

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,160
See you.

107
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,160
Take care.

108
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,160
Take care.

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,680
I will help you obtain the shares
Jiang Fengyan owns.

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
But in return,

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,520
you will ask the Xiang Group
to drop the charges on me.

112
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,400
What makes you think

113
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,880
that I will betray my husband for you?

114
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
What if I let everyone know

115
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,280
that the baby isn't Jiang Fengyan's?

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Your husband isn't worth your help

117
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,160
but shouldn't a man like him
be punished?

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Are you happy?

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,040
He betrayed Xiang Wei for you

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,720
and he will betray you
for another woman.

121
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,760
You once lost everything
for Jiang Fengyan

122
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,000
but I can make sure he doesn't get
a single penny after the divorce.

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,920
For your child,

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,080
reclaim

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
your life.

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
Be careful.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Thank you.

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,240
This is for you.

129
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Do you know me?

130
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
I guess so.

131
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
One morning,

132
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
I saw a rainbow in your eyes

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
and it's seared in my memory.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,760
I will never forget it.

135
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,280
Hi,

136
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm Xiang Wei.

137
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,400
Hi,

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm Chu Yumo.
