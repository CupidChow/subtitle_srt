Xiang Meng told you?

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Why? You can't believe it?

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,200

I might make some mistakes

but that doesn't mean I'm gullible.

24

What did you expect me to do
when I learned the truth?

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,480
Divorce my wife out of spite?

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,080
Impossible.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,680
I need a child

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,880
and a happy family.

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,640
The truth is worthless.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,160
It is insignificant.

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,400
It's only used when we weigh
the pros and cons.

32

You can't give them the love they need.

I, on the other hand,

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,120
love them more than I love myself.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
So what?

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,000
She chose the marriage

37

didn't she?

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Stop fighting back.

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,600
It's useless.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,880
No, I won't give up.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
They are my wife and my baby.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,640
So how long do you want to wait?

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,520
Ten years?

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
20 years?

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Or 50 years?

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,640
It's not that you won't give up.

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,920
It's just that you can't let go
of yourself in this relationship.

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
You know very well

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
that if you two were made for each other,

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
you wouldn't have broken up
time after time.

51

Jiang Fengyan,

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
even if I can't have Xiang Meng
and my baby,

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
you won't be able
to have anything you want.

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
You mean Mrs. Chu?

55
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,280
Aren't you working with her for money?

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,880
You defied her.

57
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,560
Do you think you still can get paid?

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,040
Leave this city.

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
I can give you a sum.

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,600
A sum big enough to restart your career.

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,960
In exchange, don't bother Xiang Meng
and the baby anymore.

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080

is about to return.

71

In fact, I'm aware of everything.

72

You made a deal with Mrs. Chu
so that I could come back to Lingrui.

I read Xiang Wei's memory and found

that you two met for the first time
five years ago.

79

Back then,
you worked in the office across.

80

I worked overnight for three days
in a row and couldn't go home.

I met her at an investors' dinner.

She was drunk
and mistook me for someone else.

So you knew

she was drunk and yet, you still
went to the hotel with her?

It's just a small misunderstanding.
