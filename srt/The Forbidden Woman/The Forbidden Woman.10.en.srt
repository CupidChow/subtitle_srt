Gosh.

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,160
You need to leave now.

What has happened?

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,280
He's coming back.

Oh.

15
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Why do you come back?

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
Did I leave my handphone
in your bag?

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,240
I knocked on the door just now.
But you didn't come.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,320
I thought

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,400
you were sleeping.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,880
No, I'm watching drama.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,920
Let me look for it.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,040
Here.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
I have to take this.

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,720
Sure.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,320
Hello.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,440
(Hello, Mr. Jiang.)

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
(I'm Mr. Gu's executive assistant
of Ruide Group.)

(After heeding the suggestion
from Mrs. Chu,)

29

(our company decided to reconsider
the investment plan with your company.)

to meet up at 10 a.m. tomorrow.)

Yes, I am.

Sure.

(See you tomorrow.)

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
All right.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,280
I made it.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,120
I made it.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,160
Ruide decided to relaunch
the investment plan.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Lingrui can definitely go public.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,120
Really?

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,800
That's great.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,680
That's great.

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,560
Dear.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,160
Dear.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,920
You're home.

45
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,720
Yes.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you worn out

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
from the journey back?

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,960
No.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
My dear wife is waiting for me at home.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Why would I be tired?

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Dear.

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,200
I've bought your favourite snacks

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
and a wishing token.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,080
Let's go there again

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
to hang the wishing token

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,720
on the tree next time.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,440
Look at this.

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,600
Do you like it?

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,760
Oh.

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,280
I remember it.

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,160
Dear.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,000
Since you couldn't go this time,

63
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
I've drawn a portrait of you.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Dear.

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
This is a nice drawing.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,720
Oh.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,680
Didn't you bring

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,600
a portrait of yours not long ago?

69
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,720
We can hang them up together.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
Where should I hang them?

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
Let's hang them over there.

72
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,280
You can look at them every morning

73
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,640
when you're having breakfast.

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Well.

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,560
Sure.

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,720
It's your call.

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
Dear.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
I have good news.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,280
Ruide decided to relaunch the investment
for our company.

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
The company can go public very soon.

81
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,840
Glad to hear that.

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Everything that's going to end

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,000
starts again.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Right.

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,960
Tianqiang.

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,880
I have something to tell you.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
What's it?

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Go ahead.

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
I heard

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,320
that Weiwei and Fengyan
are on bad terms.

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
Don't believe in

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,280
groundless rumours like such.

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
I went to the madame's gathering
yesterday.

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Those madames said...

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't care where you all got the news.

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
Just cut it out.

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
Weiwei hasn't gotten to have children
over these years.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Without children to strengthen
the marital bond,

99
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,280
Fengyan will fall out of love with her
sooner or later.

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
What should Weiwei do then?

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
If Fengyan wants to marry another woman,

102
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,200
can Xiang Group continue
the collaboration with him?

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,280
How would Xiang Group carry on then?

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,840
Would you stop?

105
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,120
Every one has their own designed path
to go.

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
If that really happens,

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,200
I wish Xiang Wei won't dwell on misery.

108
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
(We're destined to be together forever.)

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
To me,

110
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
you're the irreplaceable and only one.

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
I love you.

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
I love you deeply.

113
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,480
Say no more, Mengmeng.

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,880
(Seven years ago)

115
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
(Seven years ago)
I'll never approve of you and this fellow.

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,560
What's your name?

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,320
Mrs. Xiang.

118
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm Xu Xuan.

119
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,240
Leave now.

120
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
You're not a good match for each other.

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,240
I...

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,000
Mum.

123
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
How could you shut him off?

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
It's raining outside.

125
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,800
You're the second daughter
of Xiang's family.

126
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,200
You can't be with this penniless sod.

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
If you insist to be with him,

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
I'll disown you.

129
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
Pick your poison.

130
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,080
Xu Xuan.

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,640
Mengmeng.

132
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,680
Don't come out.

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,480
Should I cut my hair short?

134
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,280
Oh, no.

135
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,760
You said you like my long hair.

136
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Why are you staring at me?

137
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm going abroad next week.

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Why is this sudden decision?

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,760
It's a good opportunity for me.

140
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
I might make a good fortune

141
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,960
if I go abroad.

142
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
I can get your parents' approval

143
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,760
after I become wealthy

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
and we can be together then.

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,160
But I don't care about all that.

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,040
Please take me with you.

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Get me out of the house.

148
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't care about wealth or property.

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,360
I just want to stay with you.

Mengmeng.

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
I can't take you.
