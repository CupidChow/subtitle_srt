Did I do well?

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,440
Why are you here, by the way?

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,160
Cici said you were practicing here.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
As your friend,

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,680
I came to pay you a visit.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,760
Visit?

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,040
Are you here to visit

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,440
or to mock me?

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,800
Want to grab some drinks?

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,040
No.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,840
You're a bad influence to my training.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
The consequences are too dire
for you to handle.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,280
I can.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
As an investor,

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,120
I have to make sure the founder is

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
safe.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,160
My safety?

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,280
Hey.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,120
Chu Yumo.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Are you implying that my technique

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
is so bad that I might hurt myself?

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,440
How hardworking of you.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,080
It's a huge loophole.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,560
I can't let everyone know

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
that I am not the original Xiang Wei.

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,200
I ruined my life

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,200
so I can't ruin hers

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,640
in her universe.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Kiddo,

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,080
not everyone believes in a multiverse.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,280
Kiddo?

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm older than you.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,240
You should call me

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,160
Sister Xiang.

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,160
Come eat with me.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,080
That's your meal?

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm not at this stage in life

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
where I have mastered

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
culinary art.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
What was the dinner
last time about then?

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I ordered takeouts

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,240
and plated them.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,440
Unbelievable.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,840
I can teach you how to golf.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
However,

48
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
you need to call me Master.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
I might as well find a coach then.

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,360
Eh.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,720
He might not be as good as me.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
Do you like me?

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,360
Wait.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Do you like the Xiang Wei
in this universe?

55
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,640
I can't believe it,

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,520
Mr. Chu.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
You like older women.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,160
You look mean but deep down,
you want people to dote on you.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,040
I can very well

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,720
remove you and Lingrui

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
from the list of my business partners.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
My, my.

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
Did I step on your tail now?

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,600
You know, I am grateful for you.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
At least I have

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,680
a confidant now.

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,680
Otherwise, I will have to wear a mask

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,160
every day and live

69
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
on thin ice.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
It's tiring.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,680
Do you know why golf has 18 holes?

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,120
Why?

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,040
Because winter in Scotland
is cold and humid.

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
When the shepherd guides his sheep,

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
he will bring liquor with him

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
to keep himself warm.

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Whenever he hits a rabbit hole

78
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
with a pebble,

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
he takes a shot.

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,440
Then, he finds the next hole.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
After he hits 18 rabbit holes
with his pebbles,

82
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,480
he will have

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,000
finished 18oz of liquor.

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Slowly,

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,600
it became

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
the reason

87
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
why golf has 18 holes.

88
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,160
Xiang Wei.

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
I look forward to when you finish
your 18 holes.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,200
Hey, Cici.

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
(Hi, Wei.)

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,400
(I have bad news.)

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,200
(Someone is shorting Xiang Group.)

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,120
(Your father got worked up
and had a heart attack)

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
(but your stepmother insisted)

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
(that the family doctor treats him
at home.)

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Call a private hospital

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,000
and ask them
to send an ambulance there.

99
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll be there now.

100
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Xu Qing, let me in.

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,760
He needs to receive hospital aid now.

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
It's about his life!

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
We can't afford to dally.

104
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Let's say he makes a full recovery
in the hospital.

105
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
What about us then?

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,680
You want me to remain lowly

107
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,560
in the Xiang family forever?

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,720
God finally gave me this chance.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
From now on,

110
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,920
I do not care about the Xiang family.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
But I won't hand over what

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
belongs to my daughter.

113
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,280
The rest

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
is not important.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,040
Do you understand?

116
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
You are crazy

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
and unreasonable.

118
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
Whether you like it or not,

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,040
I will

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,960
send Mr. Xiang to the hospital today.

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
No need.

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,200
Delaying patient's treatment

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
is a crime.

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,720
Both of you

125
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
will not have a place
in the Xiang family anymore.

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,680
This file

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,400
contains the evidence
of your extramarital affair.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
You sold the Xiang Group's assets

129
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
while your lover boy here

130
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,840
exploited his position
as a family doctor

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,120
and embezzled public funds.

132
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,960
How did you find out?

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,680
I will find any trace you left behind.

134
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Whatever pain my mother felt,

135
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,000
you will receive the double dose.

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,920
The ambulance is here.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,960
I shall get going.

138
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,280
Good luck, you two.

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Hey.

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,440
Xu Qing.

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,240
Xu Qing.

142
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't put Lingrui in a tough spot.

143
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
Because it's Xiang Wei's work?

144
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
Give me a valid reason.

145
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
I will not return home for five years.

146
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,280
You will still be Ruide's chairman.

147
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Five years.

148
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,600
That's enough for you
to groom your son, isn't it?

149
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,960
You won't regret it?

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,040
Not at all.
