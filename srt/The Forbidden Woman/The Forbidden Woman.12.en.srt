what has happened to the company

Mr. Jiang.

11

The value of the company
has shrunken.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Board directors requested you
to explain about it.

Mr. Jiang.

Ruide Group sent a lawyer's letter.

that our company
involves in financial fraud.

Mr. Jiang.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,280
The press is in front
of the company now.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
You ought to launch a press conference

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,000
and explain it.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,520
Hello.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,840
What?

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,960
All right, got it.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,600
Mr. Jiang.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
The company valuation dropped

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
by billions just now.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,480
If the value keeps decreasing,

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm afraid the company will go under.

36

Xiang Wei.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Where's Xiang Wei?

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,320
Can you reach her?

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
No, I can't.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,880
You can't reach her?

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
Tell me

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,440
how did they know about this?

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Mr. Jiang.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,840
It's impossible for outsiders

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,640
to catch wind of your private life

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
except for those who're close to you.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,840
Given Wei's character,
she'll never do this.

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
She has no reason to do so.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
The person opposing us must
have a hidden intention behind this.

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,240
Hidden intention?

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Cici.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,920
Tell the board directors

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,840
that I'll shoulder the consequences

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
all by myself.

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,680
It has nothing to do with the employees.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
You may go out.

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,880
Get out.

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
Can't you listen to me?

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,560
There are many reporters downstairs.

I'm sorry.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,080

for you and the company.

64

I'll send the staff

65

to take care of you.

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,760
I'll come back to you

67

What can I do to help you?

70
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
Should I

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,800
explain this to the press?

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,120
No.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
No need, Mengmeng.

74
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
You don't have to do anything.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,320
I don't wish you
to be involved in this.

76

Fengyan.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
I know you very well.

how long are you going
to keep me waiting?

Mengmeng, your plan works.

Just wait and see.

will only stay beside me willingly.
