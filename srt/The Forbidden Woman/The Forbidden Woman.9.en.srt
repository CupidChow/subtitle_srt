3
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,680
Hello.

4
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,480
Weiwei.

5
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,520
Dear.

6
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
Mrs. Chu called me just now.

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,640
She wanted to take me to a gathering

8
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,160
and introduce some new friends to me.

9
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
I feel bad to turn her down.

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,520
I see.

11
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Mrs. Chu's invitation is more important.

12
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,680
It's fine.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,440
Go ahead.

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,040
What's your plan today?

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a waste if I call off
the resort house reservation.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,280
I'll go there and relax for two days.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,600
Well, then.

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,200
Go and relax.

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,800
Little girl.

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,480
You're awake.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,560
Yes.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,600
It's for you.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
Don't palter with me.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
I haven't punished you
for what you did to me yesterday.

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,120
It's the cold medicine you ordered.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,760
Mengmeng.

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
Did you order the medicine?

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,200
Huh?

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,080
No, I didn't.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
I didn't order anything.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,800
Perhaps they got the wrong address.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
Nothing's wrong with the address.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Are you Mr. Xu? The last four digits
of your number are 6673, right?

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,000
No.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm not.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,720
Perhaps the resident downstairs
wrote the wrong level.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,760
I see.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,360
Well.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
Mengmeng.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,600
Have you done packing?

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Right away.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,020
(Xu Xuan, did you order
the cold medicine?)

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,640
I filled in the wrong address.

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
I'll go and take it from you.

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,480
If you're not in now,

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,160
I'll order another medicine.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
How can you be sure

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
that I'll come?

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Yes.

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
A wise hunter

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
will show up as prey.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,240
Our alliance is formed

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
at the moment you called
my sister-in-law.

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,640
I've heard about how B.O. does
in investing.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,920
But why did you put faith in me?

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
Though both companies
belong to Chu's family,

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,680
however, Ruide aims
at the potential company,

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,240
while B.O. aims at potential people.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
And this is the reason I asked
to meet you.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
People change.

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,440
Aren't you afraid that I change my mind?

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
Human relationship

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
is like a pool of water.

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,160
The water level changes

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
when a grain of sand falls in

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,520
even though the surface

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,080
still seems calm.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,400
I didn't know you were thorough

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,640
even though you spoke harshly.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,720
Mutual recognition

71
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,760
is the prime point of collaboration.

72
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
You seem to have agreed to my terms.

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,760
I have to turn you down

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,880
this time.

76
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,360
This time?

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,920
What about next time?

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,160
Not only you're thorough,

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
but also sensitive.

80
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
As the odds are different,

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,080
the terms for future collaboration
will be different as well.

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,760
Ms. Xiang.

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,080
I have a personal question.

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,400
What's it?

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,360
Are you,
the one from five years ago back

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
or you've gotten out of the mire
finally?

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
Take a guess.

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Mengmeng.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
We're home.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,840
Yes.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
What time is it?

92
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,020
(Mengmeng, why don't you reply to me?
Where have you gone?)

93
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,780
(I came to you as soon as I got back.
Can we meet?)

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
I can go upstairs myself.

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Wei will be suspicious

96
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,960
if you go back late.

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,160
Well.

98
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
Tell me when you get home.

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,480
Sure.

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
How did you get in here?

101
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
We've been together
since we were nineteen.

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,520
How would I forget the passcode
you set?

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
We've ended the relationship
a long time ago.

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
If you insist to stay here,

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll call the police right now.

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
Do you think
we can split with each other?

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,640
Mengmeng.

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,200
Have you ever wondered

109
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
why I came to you

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,280
as soon as I got back?

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Why have we been hooking up
with each other

112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,120
on and off all these years?

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Let me tell you this.

114
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
It's all written in the star.

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,960
We're destined to be together forever.

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
Are you done?

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
It was you who turned your back on me.

118
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,080
Calm down.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Consider the thing

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm going to tell you now.

121
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,080
Listen.

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
To me,

123
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,880
you're the only and irreplaceable one.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,080
I love you.

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,240
I love you deeply.

126
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
I'll wait for you

127
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
with the rest of my life.

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
I know you're afraid of darkness.

129
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
Allow me to accompany you

130
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,520
when you're under the shadow,
all right?

131
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,680
Where's my handphone?

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,480
This.

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Your shirt.

134
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,080
Gosh.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,240
You need to leave now.

136
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,520
What has happened?

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,240
He's coming back now.

138
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Mengmeng.

139
