00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,280
I'm getting some fresh air up here.

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,800
Dear.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm fine.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,040
Hmph!

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,760
Fengyan.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
You may go in.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,520
All right.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,400
Wei.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Did you see anything just now?

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,400
What was it?

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
No, I didn't.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,520
You better stop doing such silly acts.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,520
You've embarrassed Dad

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,680
and Fengyan.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,280
You're right.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
After all, I'm the elder daughter
of Xiang's family

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
and the rightful successor.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,000
Mengmeng.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,160
I really envy you sometimes.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,480
What do you envy me?

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,440
Because you're born out of wedlock.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,960
No one will notice you

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
no matter what you've done.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
Clive Christian.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
This high-end fragrance
doesn't suit you well.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,200
It's not slutty enough.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Xiang Wei.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,480
I'll claim everything

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,880
from you.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Ms. Xiang.

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,920
How could

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,760
a woman who can't even uncap a bottle

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
have enough strength
to fight with others?

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm curious about something.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,040
Do you have a girlfriend?

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,640
No.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,440
You're being mean to a woman
you meet for the first time.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
This explains why you're single.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
This is not our first time meeting
each other.

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,040
Oh.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,160
I remember it.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,480
You're the successor of Chu's family.

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
My name is Chu Yumo,

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,120
not Chu's successor.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,640
I need to leave now.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,680
By the way,

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,480
as for what you did just now,

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,840
thank you.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Were you really jumping off the balcony?

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Of course not.

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,640
I think so.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
Had you killed yourself,

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
you wouldn't have chosen
a low-level building.

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,080
You...

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,760
When I converse with you,

58
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
I feel like I've travelled back
to five years ago,

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
somehow I sense something different.

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
(Five years ago?)

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,080

62

64

Let go of me.

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,200
(Five years ago)
Don't be mad.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,040
I met her

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
at a dinner with other investors.

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
She was drunk

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,040
and mistook me for someone else.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,440
Why did you go to the hotel with her

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,560
when you knew she was drunk?

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
It's a misunderstanding.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,200
Why do you act tough on me?

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Well, to be fair,

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I can create a similar misunderstanding,
can't I?

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
What do you mean?

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,040
I never expected

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
Jiang Fengyan has been cheating on me

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,040
after we got married.

80

(I have some work to deal with
in the office.)

81

83
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,440

84

Fengyan.

85
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,280
Do you think

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,440
Wei was aware of our relationship

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,440
but she chose to stay silent?

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
It's impossible.

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
Why?

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,920
She isn't that smart.

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,080
When can I possess you as a whole?

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
No rush.

93
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
After the company goes public,

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll belong to you.

Wei.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
You made no sound when you came in.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
Why are you here

106
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,400
at this late hour?

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,640
I thought someone broke into

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,160
my house.

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
Do I have to inform you
before I come to my brother's place?

110
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Isn't it necessary?

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,560
Wei.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
You act strangely today.

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
You're different.

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
You haven't told me

115
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
why do you come here at this late hour.

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Well.

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
I'm going to prepare
for my wedding tomorrow.

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,640
So, my mom asked me
to sleep at your place tonight.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,640
By the way,

120
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
she passed me this Chinese medicine.

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
It helps you to give birth to a son.

122
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,260
(Mother-in-law)

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Stand right there.

124
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
Clean up the rubbish.

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Wei.

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,400
The cleaner is coming tomorrow.

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,400
Sleep with the rubbish then.

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,600
I'll ask the cleaner

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
to sweep out you and the rubbish
tomorrow morning.

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,440
I...

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,320
What has gotten into her?

132
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,400
Weiwei.

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Have you reached home?

134
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,920
The medicine works if you drink it
at 10.30 p.m. sharp.

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,360
This is your priority now.

136
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,600
After all, Fengyan works finger to bone

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,760
(Mother-in-law)
and he needs his own child to take over it.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Otherwise,

139
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
everything he owns
will go to outsiders.

140
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh, right.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
Regarding the payment, I've talked to
the property sales office.

Ta-da.

149
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,280

Whoa.

151

Did you draw this?

I drew this for you.

Well.

157

Put it in your bedroom.

158

So it can remind you of me
