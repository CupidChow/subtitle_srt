Don't you think that Jiang Fengyan

merely copied and pasted

staying in this comfort zone of his.

we needed to renew several insurances.

either you or the other will get hurt.

Come down here.

I heard your phone call yesterday.

110

They say once a cheater, always a cheater.

111

Let's end this.

112

I don't want to head
to one bad ending from another.

113

It's different.

We are parents now.

126

We love our child more than ourselves.

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
The child is innocent.

128
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,880
Can you give the child
a sense of security?

129
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,480
I stood up for you against everyone

130

I...

132

I'll have my attorney
draft an agreement now.

133
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,840
If I became the party at fault
in this marriage,

134
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
I will get nothing.

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
I will leave everything
to you and the baby.
