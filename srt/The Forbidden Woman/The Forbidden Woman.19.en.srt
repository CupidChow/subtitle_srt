=Episode 19=

3
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,380
(Ward 303, Bed: 05-06)

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,120
Why are you here?

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
If I weren't there,

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,520
you would have been dead.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,480
Weiwei.

8
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
In the past,

9
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,400
for money and connections,

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,520
I married into the Xiang family
and even took their surname.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,320
Once I made a successful career,

12
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
my low self-esteem started to act up.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
And your mom

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,680
had the quick temper
of a spoiled princess.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,640
We loved each other

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,240
but in the process,

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
we also said a lot of hurtful words
to each other.

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
I know you resent me.

19
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,560
It's all my fault.

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
They say

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,400
time will heal all wounds

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
but it doesn't mean it isn't painful.

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
I already have one foot in the grave.

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,800
I don't want us to keep hurting
each other anymore.

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
For many years,

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,800
have you tried being a father?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
Forgive you?

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,600
I don't have the right to do that.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
I came today

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
so that

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
I won't regret it in the future.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
As for Xu Qing and her lover,

33
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,440
the evidence is in the file.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
You decide how you want to handle it.

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,240
In addition,

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,240
I want the shares my mom owned.

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
I don't want yours.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,000
I will investigate who

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
is shorting the Xiang group.

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,480
Okay.

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
I promise you.

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,280
You can have anything you want.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Now that you feel better,

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,040
I should go.

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
What's the matter?

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,560
Feeling under the weather?

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Xiang Tianqiang said something

48
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,280
I can't yet come to terms with.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,040
I can't let go of my grudges against him

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,920
nor the pain he inflicted on my mom.

51
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
But the doctor said

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
he might have less than a year to live.

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
I can't stay out of it.

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
My life

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
is not just my life.

56
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
My past,

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
present, and future.

58
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,200
What would the Xiang Wei

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,400
you know do?

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,320
The Xiang Wei I know is you.

61
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,280
You are a prideful woman.

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,880
You won't falter

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
nor need my answer

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,160
because you already have one.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,480
This sounds a bit wrong.

66
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,000
Like a consolation
with a hint of sarcasm.

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Get some air.

68
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
It will clear your mind up.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,600
I have a complicated family too.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Like what they say on the internet?

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
My childhood

72
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,960
is just as bad as yours, if not worse.

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,200
Wow, Chu Yumo.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
Revealing your wounded past
to comfort me.

75
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
I appreciate that.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
I wish we met when we were younger.

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
That way, I could keep you company

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
when you were upset.

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,880
Don't worry.

80
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
When we're 100 years old,

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,760
"younger" will mean now.

82
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
You're awake.

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
I bought you some milk.

84
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Chu Yumo.

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,640
Yes?

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,440
Nothing.

87
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's go.

88
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,920
I'll send you back.

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
Can't have French Connection

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,080
without Hunter.

91
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
