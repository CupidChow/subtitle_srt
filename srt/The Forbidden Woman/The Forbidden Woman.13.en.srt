3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,560
My dear.

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,720
Where did you go?

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's get a divorce.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,800
Divorce?

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,080
What do you mean?

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
We've been married for five years.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,360
For whatever is left of our marriage,

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,160
sign it.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Is this your true purpose?

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,040
Why?

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,440
Scared now?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,880
You're scared that everything
you have will go down the drain.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
Poor Xiang Meng.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,240
She waited five years

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,680
for nothing.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
Do you truly love her

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,640
or is she a tool for you
to escape reality?

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,040
Are you 100% sure

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,280
that she is pregnant with your child?

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Enough.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I...

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
For five years,

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,200
I trusted you.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,560
I loved you. I hated you.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,120
I have never

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,360
felt this disappointed before.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,520
Jiang Fengyan.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
You don't deserve me.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
Jiang Fengyan.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,000
Every mistake here
is the result of your action.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,360
Sign it within 24 hours.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Let's not waste more time
in this marriage.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Not only did you have an affair
with Jiang Fengyan,

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,760
you even resold Xiang Group's shares
behind my back.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,840
You are an idiot!

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,340
Yes.

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,200
I bring dishonor to your family.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,320
Did you forget?

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
I am your illegitimate daughter.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,360
Why only Xiang Wei got to live properly?

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
Why do you always blame me and not her?

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,200
Why do I have to take up
the surname of Xiang Wei's grandfather?

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,560
Don't you dare talk back!

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,440
Mengmeng had a lapse of judgment.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,680
Mengmeng,

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,600
it's 3% of the company shares.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Your dad and I went through many hoops

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,920
to get you that

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,160
so that you can feed yourself

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,200
when we pass away one day.

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
But you...

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
You sold the shares at a cheap price.

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
You let us down.

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,640
Why should I live

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,200
on the charity of the Xiang family
and Xiang Wei?

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Ingrate!

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
Stop hitting Mengmeng.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,520
It's all Xiang Wei's fault.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
Mengmeng wouldn't have become like this
if not because of her.

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,960
I shouldn't have brought

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,120
you two back home.

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Jiang Fengyan is a goner now.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
Break up with him at once.

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,640
Impossible.

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Mengmeng,

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
listen to your dad.

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
Break up with Jiang Fengyan.

70
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
You know you can

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,680
get any man you want.

72
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm pregnant with his child.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,040
What?

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
What?

75
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
What the hell?

76
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
You're out of your mind.

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Go to a hospital tomorrow

78
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,480
and get an abortion.

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Just what exactly

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
is in your mind?

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
You don't know

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,960
what I'm doing?

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Seven years ago,
you took Xu Xuan away from me.

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,200
You also told me
to approach Jiang Fengyan.

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you regret it now?

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,000
Mengmeng,

87
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
Jiang Fengyan has no value to you now.

88
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,600
I won't let him tie you down.

89
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,960
Mom,

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
you disappoint me.

91
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,640
All of you

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,840
pretend to be virtuous

93
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,800
but deep down, you're corrupted.

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
So both of you

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,160
were secretly sabotaging Weiwei's
relationship with me all this time?

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Tianqiang.

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,800
No.

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,480
It's not like that.

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,960
Exactly.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
That's the truth.

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,040
Now that you know it,

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,960
there's no need to act anymore.

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't need to pretend

104
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,680
to be your obedient daughter.

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,320
Leave now.

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,640
Now!

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Leave the Xiang family now!

108
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
After you brought me home,

109
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
I have never

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
been happy.

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,480
Because in your eyes,

112
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
no matter what I do,

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,800
I won't hold a candle to Xiang Wei.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,080
Mengmeng!

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,080
Xu Qing?

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Xu Qing?

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
You're pregnant?

118
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes.

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Fengyan didn't tell you?

120
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm pregnant.

121
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,320
Wait.

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll inform mom now.

123
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,440
Hello.

124
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,720
Mom,

125
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Xiang Meng is pregnant.

126

With Fengyan's child!

127
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,840
What?

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,640
Xiang Meng is pregnant
with Fengyan's child?

129
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Yes.

130
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,880
Mengmeng also bought you
a golden bracelet.

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
She asked me to give it to you.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Hold on.

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,600

(How could Fengyan hide this from us?)

137
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
Fengyan might have wanted

138

to wait until the pregnancy
is stable before telling you.

139

173
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,600
(I'll have Jie give you two silk chickens
that we raised.)

174
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,520
(For your nourishment.)

175
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Senior Chairman Meeting?

177
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,440
Why did no one

178
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
inform me of such an important event?

179
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,000
Ms. Wei proposed to have

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,440
this meeting

181
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,920
and the timing was too tight

182
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
to inform you prior.

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,040
Ms. Wei?

184
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,640
I thought she stays out
of the company's activity.

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,000
What is happening this time?

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,760
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

187
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,040
Ms. Wei remains a mysterious figure.

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,600
As we continue
to look for external funding,

189
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
Ms. Wei now only owns 10%
of the company's shares.

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
(Lingrui Group)

191
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,920
I see.

192
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Ms. Wei?

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
I should have seen this coming.

194
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Who would have known

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,160
that I would be back-stabbed
by a woman I loved for years?

196
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
Who would have known

197
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,240
that I would be betrayed by a man
I devoted myself to for five years?

198
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Fengyan,

199
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
brace yourself now.

200
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
I am not the only one

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,160
who has a surprise for you.

202
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
Did you plan everything?

203
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,520
The moment I saw you

204
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,080
cheat on me with Xiang Meng,

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
I decided to have my revenge.

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
So the bet-on agreement
I signed with Ruide

207
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,080
is part of your plan too?

208
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm just giving you
a taste of your own medicine.

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,840
You...

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,960
I came here today

211
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,080
because considering
the company's latest development...

212
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,520
The board believes that

213
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,440
the CEO of Lingrui Group

214
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,720
is incompetent enough

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
to further nurture the company's growth.

216
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
From now on,

217
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,360
all your privileges as the CEO

218
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,880
of Lingrui Group will be revoked.

219
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,920
Xiang Wei,

220
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
you're crazy.

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
You hold 8% of the company's shares.

222
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
Your other identity, Ms. Wei, owns 10%.

223
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,720
You can't oust me.

224
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,480
Unless

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
it was you who bought

226
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,280
those individual shares in the market?

227
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,480
No.

228
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
They only amount to 7%.

229
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
I am still the company's
biggest shareholder.

230
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,600
Give up now.

231
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,040
That won't be enough, of course.

232
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
(File)
Yesterday, Mr. Fang transferred

233
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
all his shares to me,
which amount to 6%.

234
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Considering I have 31%
of the company's shares

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
and Ruide Group owns 20%...

236
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
Sorry then, Mr. Jiang.

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,480
You're

238
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,760
out.

239
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,200
You think other shareholders
will stay put

240
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,480
when you blatantly manipulated
the share ownership like that?

241
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,080
Of course, not.

242
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I never plan to convince

243
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320
those who have followed you for years
otherwise.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,600
On the contrary,

245
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
I respect their choices.

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,960
But we're talking about business here.

247
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Is our relationship built

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
upon profits and losses?

249
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
We're about to have a meeting.

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
I don't think Mr. Jiang

251
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,160
should stay here.

252
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Weiwei,

253
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,160
we're both
at the center of this debacle.

254
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,920
Let's see how long you last.

255
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Fengyan,

256
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,080
don't do something reckless now.

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
After all, you can no longer

258
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,920
afford any missteps.
