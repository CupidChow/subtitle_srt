It's Fengyan's car.

I thought he was attending a meeting
at the company.

How come the car alarm keeps beeping?

Did he forget to close
the boot again?

67

How careless.

68

Whose underwears are these?

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680

Why do you come back early?

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Because I miss you.

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Really?

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,440
Of course.

75

Hey.

If Xiang Wei finds out this,

78

you'll be doomed.

79

No, she won't.

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
She's having a screening test
at the hospital right now.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
You wanted to hang out
with your mother, didn't you?

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,800
This card

83

is loaded with thirty thousand.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,840
The password is your birthday.

85
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
Far from wanting this material wealth,

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,440
I want only you.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Give me some more time.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
After the company goes public,

All right?

91

Then,

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
what if Xiang Wei refuses to divorce?

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,320
Who cares?

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Ahem.

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080

Xiang Wei and Jiang Fengyan
have been married for years,

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
but they don't have any children.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,880
She'll be abandoned sooner or later.

103

Now that Xiang Group is encountering
a hard time.

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,520
And Jiang Fengyan might be the biggest
supply source for Xiang Group.

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Go seize Jiang Fengyan.

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,400
Xiang's property

107
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,080
will belong to you one day.

108

Fengyan

109
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
will belong to me one day.

Let me make a toast.
