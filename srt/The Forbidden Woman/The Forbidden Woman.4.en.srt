I should keep
my feelings for you inside

Can you stay with me tonight?

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm afraid of staying here alone.

65

Good girl.

66

everything'll be fine soon

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,800
if you wait for a while more?

69

Then,

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,840

I'll deal with it some other time.

I thought you were supposed
to fly back tomorrow.

90

Why did you come back early?

91

What's wrong, Dad and Mom?

After a discussion with your dad,

we decided to have you return to Xiang Group

But,

I thought Wei is the rightful successor
of Xiang Group.

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
It's inappropriate for me
to take the share.

133
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,880
Wei has been keeping her nose
out of the family over these years.

134

She's in no place

I'm scared

that I'm not capable enough

139
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,440

Your dad's blood

is in Wei's and your veins.

You'll do better than Wei

144
