3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,960
The fire is on, drink Jia Duo Bao.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,440
The hard-working force is to protect the new power.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,520
This program is sponsored by

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
the two hard-working, strong, and beautiful families.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,840
My life's song

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,240
You should cherish your life

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,840
My family's song

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,960
You should cherish your love

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,680
I want to say that

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,000
I just wanted a sense of security

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm the one who got caught in the trap

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
I was

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,720
I sang because it was hard

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,160
I sang because it was sad

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,200
I sang because I wanted to live

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,720
I was just a part of the ego

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,200
I can't save someone

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,560
with such a song

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,360
But I

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
I wanted to be your god

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm your god

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm the one who got caught in the trap

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,960
I was

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
I sang because it was hard

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,880
I sang because it was sad

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,520
I sang because it was sad

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,960
I wanted to be your god

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
But I

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm the one who got caught in the trap

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,600
Wow, so cool

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,040
BIG amazing

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,480
It can catch my

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,880
I can't

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
I can't

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
Then counted

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,980
How many ever

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,060
It can't

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,820
带着我来救自己的心情

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
这种心情的心情

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,540
只能在我身边

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,020
只能在我身边

44
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,620
只能在我身边

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,620
这种心情的心情

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,620
只能在我身边

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,180
只能在我身边

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,780
只能在我身边

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
只能在我身边

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,780
只能在我身边

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,300
触 launching

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,120
I cry

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,360
What did you do

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
It would change

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,840
Having cried for so many years

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Give me another chance

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,240
Now, it's just a fear

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,860
But I want you to learn

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,740
I am fearless

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,140
My breath is a little dense

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,780
生命的歌詞是想要的嗎

62
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,280
想要給誰的答應是想要的嗎

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,780
這樣的話就不太重要

64
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,780
總是要死掉的命

65
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
想要救誰的歌詞

66
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
想要保護誰的歌詞

67
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,780
想要救你的歌詞

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
無意的

69
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
如果你是你

70
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
如果你是你

71
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
能夠成為幸運

72
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
如果你的手腳

73
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
腿會變成瘋子

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
想要把你拋死

75
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
想要解決

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
想要把 all your wounds

77
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,780
and all your wounds

78
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
想要救 you

79
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,780
想要 take you to the front

80
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
想要救 you

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
想要救 you

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
想要 把 your wounds

83
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
your weakness

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
your heart

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
my song

86
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
my song

87
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
my song

88
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
my song

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
my song

90
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
my song

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
my song

92
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
my song

93
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
I couldn't understand the meaning of your voice

94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,780
I'm helpless

95
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I'm helpless

96
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm helpless

97
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
I'm helpless

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,780
I want to save you

99
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
That's so great

100
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,780
I want to save you

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
You're so lucky

102
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
You're so young

103
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,780
This song is so intense

104
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Her voice and breathing

105
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,780
I feel like they are all in this song

106
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
In the prelude

107
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
You know

108
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,780
I think it's all a kind of emotion

109
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,780
I think it's a kind of emotion

110
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
I think it's a kind of emotion

111
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,780
I think it's a Japanese cartoon

112
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
There is a very lively young girl

113
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
in the movie

114
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
She tells her own story

115
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,780
A very lively performance

116
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Please introduce yourself

117
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm Xiaobao

118
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Hello, everyone

119
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,780
Thank you

120
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
It was wonderful

121
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
Thank you

122
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,780
At first, she was singing while talking

123
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,780
And she was going to the chorus

124
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,780
The emotion and the sound

125
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
How to adjust

126
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
It's not related

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
I'm helpless

128
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm helpless

129
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm helpless

130
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
I'm helpless

131
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,780
I want to save you

132
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,780
You can say you're singing

133
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
You have to sing

134
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,780
You have to sing

135
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
You have to sing

136
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
You can say you're singing

137
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
You have to sing

138
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
It's a little

139
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
I think it's a little

140
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
emotional

141
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
It's a little

142
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
calm

143
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
I think it's more wonderful

144
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
I think it's a little

145
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
Thank you

146
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,780
When I was watching the performance

147
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,780
I was thinking about a question

148
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,780
Is it in the process of singing

149
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,780
Is it perfect and important

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Or is it more important to express emotions

151
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
I think the first goal of music

152
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
Is to convey emotions

153
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
When I like a song

154
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,780
But it's not necessarily in my control

155
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,780
But I fully expressed

156
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
I express my emotions

157
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
For example, sometimes we like to sing in the bathroom

158
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
When we're taking a shower

159
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Or say

160
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Any opening place on the balcony

161
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
Or suddenly

162
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Maybe a few days ago

163
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
I was standing in front of the boat

164
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
No one

165
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
I have no control

166
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
On the sea

167
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,780
To express my feelings at that moment

168
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Sometimes I even feel

169
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Some of them are in the plan

170
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Even out of the plan

171
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,780
As long as the emotions can really hit you

172
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
So I don't want to use good words

173
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
Express my personal preference

174
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
I want to say

175
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
I like you very much

176
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
The state of your investment in this song

177
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Thank you

178
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
Thank you

179
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Was it a little harsh?

180
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Are you okay?

181
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm okay

182
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
There will be a singer

183
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
In the background

184
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,780
Who will challenge you

185
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
What do you want to say to the person who challenges you

186
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I sang it with all my strength

187
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
So if you come

188
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,780
I would be happy if you can give me a good response

189
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
So the singer in the background

190
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Is ready to sing

191
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,780
The singing starts now

192
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780
He got it in one second

193
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
It's your decision

194
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Three, two, one

195
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Come on

196
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
The performance of Gu Hanna

197
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Will make me think of myself

198
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Because I was also blind when I was on the live

199
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
At that time, I was blinded

200
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
I was not confident about myself

201
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
I had a sense of honor

202
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,780
If I sing

203
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,780
I won't be loved by many people

204
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
When I saw the song

205
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
I think we have

206
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
The common things

207
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
I want everyone to hear

208
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,780
The simplest and pureest

209
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Music I want to express

210
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Do you know

211
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
You are the best

212
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
I have lost the light

213
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I have not sung

214
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
And I am too nervous

215
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,780
I put the key in first

216
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
It's a mess

217
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,780
I must have realized that I am on the edge of elimination

218
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
What should I do to face so many high-level singers

219
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
How much practice do you have

220
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I am not afraid of the wind

221
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
I am not afraid of the wind

222
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I am not afraid of the wind

223
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
Adjust the state of the song

224
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Prepare to take all the challenges

225
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
The sky is dark

226
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,780
I am not afraid of the wind

227
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,780
For the next stage

228
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
I am still a little worried

229
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
Because I want to try something that is not good

230
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,780
Or something that I have not tried

231
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
I am so nervous

232
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I am so nervous

233
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
This song is good

234
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,780
It's cute but the baby is dead

235
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,780
I am so nervous

236
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,780
I can't

237
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,580
Sing

238
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Sing

239
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,780
Guys, they are not making sure

240
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,920
Fighting!

241
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,560
Fighting!

242
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

243
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

244
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

245
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

246
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

247
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

248
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,780
I'm afraid of the storm and the storm

249
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,780
La la la la la la la...

250
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,780
La la la la la la la...

251
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,780
In the sky there's no stars

252
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
There's no one on the earth

253
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,780
The story of love and hatred

254
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,780
Is the answer for life

255
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,780
On the journey we've walked through the fields

256
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,980
I'm afraid of the hurt and fear of being drunk

257
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm afraid of the wind blowing in the distance

258
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,780
I'm afraid of the light of the light

259
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,780
I'm a little girl who loves you

260
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,780
I'm a little girl who loves you

261
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm a little girl who loves you

262
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Li Chen

263
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
Thank you

264
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
You are so good

265
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Thank you

266
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
He Liu is the real Kofi Liu

267
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
His new model

268
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,780
His second song is much better than the first one

269
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Very stable

270
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,780
Ying Jun is also very good

271
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
I feel very happy for him

272
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,780
I finally see the real Kofi Liu today

273
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Thank you, teacher

274
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Because of your expression and state of singing

275
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
I can clearly hear you

276
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,780
Enjoy your performance today, right?

277
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
Yes

278
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,780
Yes, this is you

279
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Really, you sang very well today

280
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,780
All details, strength, emotions, including your expression

281
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,780
Can make people feel you are playing

282
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
And I like you very much

283
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
The sweetness in the voice

284
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,780
And the feeling of a little bit of sorrow in the subtle sweetness

285
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
I'm sorry, it's that sorrow

286
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,780
It's that he will bring some depth

287
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
In the light color

288
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Some imagination

289
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Some eyes closed to the world

290
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
So I really like it

291
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
You are in a very good condition today

292
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Thank you, teacher Liao Ying

293
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
Yes, so you can have a chat today

294
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Let's go

295
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Very good

296
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Thank you for your beautiful song

297
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,780
I first heard it from the beginning

298
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
First of all, I received all the courses

299
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,780
of the French cuisine

300
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,780
And the last dessert

301
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,780
The last singing method is also very good

302
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
It's very good

303
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
I think

304
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,780
For example, if you can sing in French

305
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
It was a very wonderful course

306
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
Thank you, teacher

307
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,780
So let's invite Xiaohua to come back to our stage

308
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
I'm very happy

309
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780
I'm also very happy, it's you

310
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
So now

311
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
For the two singers

312
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,780
Choose one of the two

313
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
I will feel sorry for you

314
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
I'm confident

315
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,780
I still don't want to stop here

316
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I want to stay on this stage

317
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
I don't want to lose

318
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
So please, teacher Wei

319
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Make your choice

320
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Congratulations to KeLou for getting one vote

321
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
I just like her very much

322
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
And her condition today

323
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
I don't think she's singing

324
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,780
I think after she stood on the stage

325
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
The whole person's state

326
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
I can feel that she is more and more enjoying this stage

327
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
I like her very much

328
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
This vote for KeLou

329
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
Okay, thank you, teacher Lian Ying

330
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
Teacher Gong Teng

331
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,780
Happy birthday

332
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Thank you, teacher

333
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Congratulations to KeLou for leading the show

334
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,780
Let's pay attention to the final result of the online judges

335
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
I voted for KeLou

336
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I heard her progress

337
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,780
She also chose a small song

338
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Very pure acting

339
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,780
And her emotions are very sincere

340
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
For example, when you watch Ice Skate

341
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
The show

342
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,780
Mr. Ko Hanna has three rounds

343
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,780
There are a lot of moves

344
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
It's a little bit difficult

345
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
I think KeLou's acting

346
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Is more like a song in the middle

347
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Or in the theater

348
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
That's what I can hear

349
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
Maybe in the rhythm

350
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
And the combination of the arrangement

351
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
I think it's worth watching

352
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
As for KeLou

353
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
I think it's a super-cool performance

354
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
It shows her another side

355
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
For this round

356
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
I let KeLou win

357
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Because of the good singing

358
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
The technical details

359
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Is to keep the communication going

360
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,780
To the core

361
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,780
Make people understand

362
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,780
The song's rhythm

363
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,780
The result of the online judges' voting is

364
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,780
KeLou won 22 votes

365
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,780
KeLou won 1 vote

366
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
21 votes

367
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
That's great

368
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
That vote is a little bit

369
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
That's great

370
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Congratulations to KeLou

371
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,780
You won this round

372
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Congratulations to you

373
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
You can have the chance to be the king

374
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Brave KeLou

375
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
No fear of difficulties

376
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
Go

377
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
The new singer team won the round

378
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
3-1

379
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
The last one

380
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Let's welcome the last one

381
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
The singer team

382
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
First of all

383
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,780
I lost confidence once

384
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,780
I really have to work hard

385
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,780
I'm doing my best

386
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Because I'm experienced

387
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,780
It's a very good choice

388
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm so happy

389
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
I'm so happy

390
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,780
I'm so happy

391
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm so happy

392
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
I'm so happy

393
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
I'm so happy

394
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
I'm so happy

395
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm so happy

396
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
I'm so happy

397
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,780
I'm so happy

398
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
I'm so happy

399
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
I'm so happy

400
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm so happy

401
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,780
I'm so happy

402
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Finally

403
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Just like when you're going to lie down

404
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,780
You'll lie down

405
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,980
If you don't lie

406
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,780
You'll, when you're sleeping

407
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,780
you will be 1967

408
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,580
i can't

409
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,780
Light-å

410
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,780
Yeah

411
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
Hi

412
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
Hi

413
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Is it my life?

414
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
天天的一人

415
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
别过来

416
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,780
春天的一人

417
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,780
这一种独特的花

418
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
真是不错

419
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,780
真是不错

420
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,780
Ah, it's been a long time since I've heard your song

421
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,780
It's been a long time since I've heard your song

422
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
Your spring is about to start

423
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,780
Bye bye bye bye, thank you for coming tonight

424
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,780
I think it's the last time

425
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,780
It seemed fun, I was happy

426
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,780
I was able to laugh, I was able to move forward

427
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,780
I realized that time had come

428
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:37,780
See you, see you, see you, wait for spring

429
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:05,780
I can hear it

430
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,780
I saw different teeth

431
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
I think the first teeth

432
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,780
The song is in its protective color

433
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,780
This song is its color

434
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Thank you for the singing of Zhong Ling's teeth

435
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
When I sing in the middle

436
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
I can see the color

437
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,780
It's popping

438
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Like popping candy

439
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
When it's rustling, it's popping

440
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,780
I think it's important to have an image in the song

441
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
It's a wonderful stage

442
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Thank you

443
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
I'm happy

444
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,780
First, I want to say

445
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,780
I still feel the same way I see on the stage

446
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,780
I feel full of confidence

447
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,780
I like the feeling of being on the stage

448
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Actually, the last time she said

449
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Why did she come to this stage

450
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm very impressed

451
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,780
She said she wanted to give more people motivation

452
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Then she can make more young people

453
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,780
More determined to be on the stage

454
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,780
And I have a question

455
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Actually, it's not the first time

456
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
She's on this stage

457
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
I heard other new singers' performances last time

458
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Then we have two left

459
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Do you want to see if it's Zhou Fei or Pan Hong?

460
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,780
This question

461
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Does she remember?

462
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,780
I don't want to challenge

463
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
It's Pan Hong

464
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,780
But I want to challenge it

465
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
It's Pan Hong

466
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Pan Hong

467
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,780
I want to tell you that the emotions are still in the music

468
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,780
So I don't want to end here

469
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Please get ready

470
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Sing now

471
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
It's scary

472
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,780
What will happen?

473
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
One, two, three

474
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
The wall is successful

475
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Let's welcome the challenger

476
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
How can it be?

477
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
I can do it

478
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
This one

479
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Good

480
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
She's on the stage soon

481
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
How do you feel?

482
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Are you nervous?

483
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,780
I choose to challenge the challenger

484
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
Because I want to break through myself

485
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
But I'm not afraid

486
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
What are you going to do?

487
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
I'm ready

488
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,780
I'll try to grow up

489
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
And break through my side

490
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
And I'll protect the new power

491
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
And I'll be with my family

492
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Nothing can be done

493
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
You can't reveal recorded 2lol

494
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Boss, can you go leave?

495
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
I don't feel comfortable

496
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Can you go there?

497
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
I'll cover for you

498
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
OK

499
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
Hello

500
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Do you hear me?

501
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm not afraid of the world

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780

00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
I'm not afraid of the world

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm not afraid of the world

515
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Spread your umbrella

516
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
give me a kiss

517
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Focusing on the water

518
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,780
How to swim

519
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,780
So beautiful

520
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780

I'm not afraid of you.

527
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,780

I'm not afraid of you.

534
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,780
No matter how hard I tried to live

535
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,780
The fishtime has informed me

536
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,780
I was ever scentless

537
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,780
He meant to do so

538
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,800
Many hate or fate

539
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,780
Someone in my heart

540
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Can never shut down

541
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Everything

542
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Dangerous

543
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,280
Anyone who's ready to hold

544
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm afraid of the water in the river

545
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
The water in the river

546
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
The water in the river

547
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
The water in the river

548
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
The water in the river

549
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
The water in the river

550
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
The water in the river

551
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
The water in the river

552
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
The water in the river

553
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
The water in the river

554
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
The water in the river

555
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
The water in the river

556
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
The water in the river

557
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
The water in the river

558
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,240
Dangerous

559
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Who does not need to guard the reputation

560
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,440
careful on

561
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,040
arem differently

562
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Dangerous

563
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,680
Anyone who slays

564
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,600
the bankers

565
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
or flow

566
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:24,580
there is no Regel

567
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,620
So cool.

568
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
So cool.

569
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
So cool.

570
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,620
So cool.

571
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
So cool.

572
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620

So cool.

576
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,620
When I knew my opponent was a Jofei girl,

577
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,620
I was like,

578
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,620
wow.

579
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
And when I saw the stage,

580
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
I was so cool.

581
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,620
I was shocked.

582
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
How do you feel?

583
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
I'm so happy.

584
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
I feel so happy.

585
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
But on the ground.

586
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
But on the ground,

587
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,660
there are many prepared moves.

588
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,660
So what moves are you going to show us?

589
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Okay.

590
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
I just...

591
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
I'm going to look back, but I'm afraid I'll fall.

592
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Feng Shui has turned the stage into a little bit of a slide.

593
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,660
But I think he has succeeded in his performance tonight.

594
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
But I really looked at him and saw him.

595
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
I suddenly wanted to laugh.

596
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Because...

597
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
He's looking for him again.

598
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
He's always looking for him.

599
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Do you know that?

600
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Always.

601
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,700
But you can feel that he's on this stage.

602
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,740
He's very natural and very enjoying.

603
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
And his voice is stable today.

604
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,740
He suddenly comes back and sings.

605
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
He's very quiet.

606
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
He only keeps his voice alone.

607
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
And then he comes back to the whole band.

608
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
I really like it.

609
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
I really enjoy your performance just now.

610
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Thank you, teacher.

611
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
When I went to the high-pitched,

612
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
my chest was dancing.

613
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,740
I thought that there was a great way to give out high-pitched.

614
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,740
I thought that there was a way to attract people.

615
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
It was fun. Thank you.

616
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Thank you, teacher.

617
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Please welcome Ms. Zhong Lingya back to our stage.

618
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
Awesome.

619
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
No.

620
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Please vote for the two singers.

621
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Mr. Liangying, your choice is...

622
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Brother Zhou Fei. Congratulations.

623
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Brother Zhou Fei got one vote.

624
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Congratulations to Mr. Jingxiang.

625
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Brother Zhou Fei. Congratulations to Brother Zhou Fei.

626
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
The first place is 2-0.

627
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I'm so happy.

628
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Let's immediately pay attention to the 21 judges'

629
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,820
final vote result.

630
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
I chose Ms. Zhong Lingya.

631
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,860
In fact, after watching the show,

632
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,860
the five Japanese contestants were actually very touched.

633
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,860
When they were on the stage,

634
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,860
they would have a spirit of concentration.

635
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,860
They were easily touched by everyone on the stage.

636
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Brother Zhou Fei, I think it's so comfortable to hear him sing.

637
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
His voice is so sharp.

638
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
And his body matches the music.

639
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I think he is born to be on the stage.

640
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,900
I think his voice is relatively good at singing rock,

641
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
and he can sing the kind of music that is better at fighting.

642
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
But I didn't expect that he chose this kind of music today.

643
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,900
His singing style is so good.

644
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,900
And his stage skills are so good today.

645
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Maybe the Japanese character,

646
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,900
he can easily use his mouth to speak.

647
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,900
But Zhong Lingya, he made me hear his chest.

648
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
So it's very wonderful.

649
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
His voice is very good.

650
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
And he is very strong.

651
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,940
The final vote result of the judges' final vote is...

652
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
The final result is...

653
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Brother Zhou Fei, 18 votes.

654
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Zhong Lingya, 5 votes.

655
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Congratulations to Brother Zhou Fei for winning.

656
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Thank you.

657
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
So great.

658
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I think it's still very happy.

659
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Actually, I have a good time this time.

660
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
I will take a good time to talk to the teachers.

661
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
Last time, I gave an advice.

662
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,900
Actually, the song I like is a kind of singing character.

663
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
A kind of singing me.

664
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,900
You just need to really delve into your signature energy

665
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
and performance on stage.

666
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I will look forward to your control of Jia Ying.

667
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
There will be more subtle skills on the stage.

668
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
For me, the biggest thing that I would say

669
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
is wear something that you can move in.

670
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
But don't play it too safe.

671
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
OK, thank you, Sister.

672
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
The energy of the spiritual level.

673
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
You just need to really delve into your signature.

674
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
The transformation of Jia Ying and Jia Ying.

675
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Wear something that you can move in.

676
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Don't play it too safe.

677
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I think the biggest benefit of this journey is that

678
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,900
if you can absorb the advantages of foreign singers,

679
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,900
you can listen to the advice of the professional teacher.

680
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
And then you have the courage to change yourself.

681
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
After this set,

682
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
I think you will not let yourself down

683
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
with a new exhibition.

684
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
The new singer team wins this round.

685
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
4-1 battle challenge singer team.

686
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Hello, judges.

687
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Hello, everyone.

688
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
The most important moment of the year of the Asian New Japan Battle

689
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
has come.

690
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
After the first five rounds of competition,

691
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
now there are five singers to win.

692
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Now, sister Wei Pingshen,

693
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
from these five singers,

694
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
will vote for the one who represents the various musical styles.

695
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,900
This will determine who is the singer-goer of the Japanese battle.

696
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,900
She will be qualified to challenge the final level of the Amusa,

697
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
the singer-goer of the Japanese Battle.

698
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Thank you, everyone.

699
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,900
The result of voting now

700
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,900
has been recorded in the third episode of Huawei in my hand.

701
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Among the five singers,

702
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
four of them are Chinese singers.

703
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
We got the song king this time.

704
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,900
I think the probability of the probability of the song will be higher.

705
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Let's welcome the two teachers on the stage to announce

706
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,900
the things that sister Liang Ying chose.

707
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Mi Yunnan.

708
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,900
Thank you.

709
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
Welcome, teacher Jingxiang.

710
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
Your choice is...

711
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Mi Yunnan.

712
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Mi Yunnan, please.

713
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
I say...

714
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Mi Yunnan, please.

715
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Now, the result of voting

716
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,900
on the online judges' headsets.

717
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Ke Lou.

718
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
Zero votes.

719
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Wang Honghao.

720
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Zero votes.

721
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Zhou Fei.

722
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Four votes.

723
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Change.

724
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
I heard the score.

725
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
It might be between me and Mi Yunnan.

726
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
I know Mi Yunnan is a very strong singer.

727
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,900
But in fact, I also want to compete with the name of the song king.

728
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Aishin Juelomei.

729
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Zero votes.

730
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Mi Yunnan.

731
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Twelve votes.

732
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
I think the result of voting

733
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
is very similar to the result of voting.

734
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Twelve votes.

735
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
Plus, the online judges' votes are...

736
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
Congratulations, Mi Yunnan.

737
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
14 votes.

738
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
The winner is...

739
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Jado Bao.

740
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
The new Asian singer,

741
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
the Japanese singer, the song king.

742
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Congratulations.

743
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
Congratulations.

744
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Thank you.

745
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
And I think I will do my best

746
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
from Mi Yunnan.

747
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
Mi Yunnan.

748
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
We choose Huang Jia Meisu and Jiao Er.

749
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,900
50% of them are naturally protected by Yin Ziqun.

750
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,900
They can reach 30-level gold-gray-high-power-like iron protein.

751
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Why can't you grow up?

752
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Huang Jia Meisu and Jiao Er.

753
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
I have met them both.

754
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
They are very strong.

755
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,900
I am too strong.

756
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Really.

757
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
The two of you are the song king.

758
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Yes.

759
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Then let's welcome the song king,

760
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,900
the song king, Amusa.

761
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
S.O.M.A.C.E.

762
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Ada.

763
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
She will be here tomorrow.

764
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
His voice is like Michael Jackson.

765
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Yes.

766
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,900
His voice is like what the teachers said.

767
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,900
Amusa's singing is really hard to be touched.

768
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
The song king, Amusa.

769
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,900
The song king is really hard to be touched.

770
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Amusa.

771
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
The song king, Amusa.

772
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
My love for you

773
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Really.

774
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Thank you.

775
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Thank you.

776
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Great.

777
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Thank you.

778
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Great.

779
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,900
Great.

780
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
I want to sing a good song.

781
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
A good song.

782
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
A good song.

783
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,900
What does he sing in Japanese?

784
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
I am here right now.

785
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
Yes.

786
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
The kind of music.

787
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Amusa.

788
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,900
I have heard this song for the first time.

789
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
It is a very crystal voice.

790
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,900
It is like a song that was born from heaven.

791
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
It is very healing.

792
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,900
Welcome the Japanese king and the challenger,

793
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Li Younan.

794
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,900
She will sing a good song.

795
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
She is a good singer.

796
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,900
She is a good singer.

797
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,900
She is a good singer.

798
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,900
She is a good singer.

799
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,900
She is a good singer.

800
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,900
She is a good singer.

801
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,900
She is a good singer.

802
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,900
She is a good singer.

803
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Thank you.

804
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
So beautiful.

805
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,900
Listen to this song.

806
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,900
Mr. Kong Teng.

807
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
Your eyes are a little tears.

808
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,900
Thank you for your performance.

809
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Please come back to the stage.

810
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Please come to the judges.

811
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,900
Mr. Zhang Liangying and Mr. Kong Teng Jingxiang.

812
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,900
In these two,

813
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,900
write down the song king's choice in your heart.

814
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
What did he sing?

815
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,900
A song?

816
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,900
I say A Musa first.

817
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,900
You show off your performance today.

818
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,020
I like this song very much.

819
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,980
Your understanding of lyrics

820
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,180
is one word by one.

821
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,660
Every voice comes out of it.

822
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,780
No matter if you sing alone

823
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,220
or you're not in the middle of music,

824
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,700
you still have to sing from the beginning.

825
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,140
Then you have to turn to the middle

826
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,940
and slowly move to the middle.

827
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,180
The whole song has no voice.

828
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,340
It makes me think

829
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,060
there's something not right

830
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,780
or even better.

831
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,540
Thank you for bringing us

832
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,820
such a shocking performance.

833
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
Thank you.

834
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Thank you.

835
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,860
So, Mr. Liang,

836
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,460
your choice is...

837
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,900
Congratulations to Ms. Mi Yonah

838
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,460
for winning Ms. Zhang Yang's vote.

839
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,340
First of all, Ms. Amisha

840
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,380
is a very crystal voice.

841
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,020
She's very beautiful.

842
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,700
I was so moved.

843
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,860
Her expressions and Japanese

844
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,220
were also very beautiful.

845
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,140
I was very moved

846
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,380
and very moved.

847
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,900
Thank you.

848
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
Thank you.

849
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,740
And Ms. Mi Yonah,

850
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,860
you didn't choose a song

851
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,540
that was completely different from the one

852
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,540
you sang earlier.

853
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,340
But I just wanted to hear

854
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,820
the slow and emotional song

855
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,340
that you sang just now.

856
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,500
Ms. Mi Yonah's voice.

857
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,700
It was so beautiful.

858
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,100
Thank you.

859
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,380
I was moved.

860
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,380
Thank you.

861
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,220
So, Mr. Gong Teng,

862
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,820
your choice is...

863
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,180
Mi Yonah.

864
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,380
Thank you.

865
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,180
Mi Yonah is temporarily leading.

866
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,180
Now, let's pay attention

867
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,220
to the voting results of the online judges.

868
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,380
The new judge, Jia Doubao,

869
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,180
will be with you.

870
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,180
Ms. Mi Yonah is a very, very good singer.

871
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,180
The perfect singing method

872
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,660
between each English and English

873
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,180
is actually very difficult.

874
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,180
The whole performance is very comfortable.

875
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,180
She's enjoying the performance.

876
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,180
It's hard to sing Ms. Mi Yonah's six songs.

877
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,180
When I heard it,

878
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,180
I was so excited.

879
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,180
Ms. Mi Yonah's cover song

880
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,180
also has its own world view.

881
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,180
She sang a ballad

882
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,180
for me.

883
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
It was very good.

884
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,180
Ms. Mi Yonah is a great singer.

885
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,180
She can sing well

886
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,180
even without any instruments.

887
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,180
She can also easily

888
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
catch your heart.

889
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Let's welcome the new judge, Mr. Zhang Liangying,

890
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,180
to announce Jia Doubao,

891
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,180
the singer of the Japanese battle.

892
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,180
The final vote of the professional judges

893
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,180
plus the result of the vote of the two of us is

894
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,180
1 vote is 22 votes.

895
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,180
The person who will be the new judge

896
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,180
of the Japanese battle tonight,

897
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,180
is Mi Yonah.

898
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,180
Congratulations.

899
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,180
Congratulations.

900
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,180
Congratulations to the new judge,

901
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
Mi Yonah.

902
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,180
Congratulations.

903
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,180
The singer of the Japanese battle

904
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,180
let's welcome Jia Doubao,

905
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
the singer of the Japanese battle,

906
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
to have a look at the new judge, Jia Doubao.

907
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Let's welcome the new judge,

908
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,180
the singer of the Japanese battle,

909
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,180
Jia Doubao,

910
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,180
the singer of the new judge,

911
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,180
to have a look at the new judge, Jia Doubao.

912
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Let's welcome the next judge.

913
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,180
After winning,

914
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,180
I called the staff

915
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,180
of Mi Yonah

916
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,180
who is the first one to be seen in Tokyo.

917
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,180
I said,

918
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,180
I'm happy

919
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,180
to be the new judge.

920
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,180
I was very happy.

921
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,180
My mother

922
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,180
was confused.

923
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
I became the champion

924
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,180
of the Japanese battle.

925
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
I didn't understand

926
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,180
how to be a judge.

927
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,180
I was a mother.

928
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
But after that,

929
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,180
she said,

930
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
I'm tired.

931
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,180
She said, I'll buy you a present.

932
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,180
She said that.

933
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
I was very happy.

934
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,180
I was very happy.

935
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,180
I want to give my best

936
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,180
to all of you.

937
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,180
I want to sing it well.

938
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,180
Congratulations to everyone

939
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,180
for the challenge today.

940
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Give yourself a round of applause.

941
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,180
But you know that

942
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
Jia Doubao is not just

943
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,180
a journey of music.

944
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,180
We also went to

945
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,180
the journey of

946
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,180
the scenery and culture of various places in Asia.

947
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,180
Tomorrow,

948
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,180
we will go to the ship to relax.

949
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,180
But it's not just a journey.

950
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,180
There is also

951
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,180
a mission.

952
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
Mission?

953
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,180
What is that?

954
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,180
Tomorrow,

955
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,180
we will perform

956
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,180
special performance in Okinawa.

957
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,180
There are two songs.

958
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,180
The first song is

959
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,180
a song that everyone sings.

960
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,180
The Chinese song is

961
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
Zui Tu Da Mon Shan.

962
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,180
Yes.

963
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,180
The Japanese song is

964
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,180
the song of the silver dragon.

965
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
Please do your best.

966
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,180
I will do my best.

967
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,180
I know that

968
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
in the past,

969
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,180
the teacher of the public

970
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,180
sang the original Chinese version of the song.

971
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,180
I don't know if it's possible

972
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,180
to hear you sing the Japanese version of the song.

973
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,180
I can do it.

974
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,180
I will do my best.

975
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,180
Adame.

976
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,180
This kind of feeling?

977
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Zui Tu Da Mon Shan.

978
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,180
comunicai.

979
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,180
Are you mayonnaise?

980
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,180
My face is getting red.

981
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,180
You're so cute.

982
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,140
I have a mission to release

983
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,180
This song was originally

984
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,260
A famous singer

985
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,580
The author was in 1964

986
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,940
The East Street Olympic Games

987
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,940
Because he saw that

988
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,620
On the screen

989
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,420
Everyone is running and crying

990
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,580
Smiling and hugging each other

991
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,100
He felt this scene was very touching

992
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,540
So as the inspiration

993
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,860
Wrote a song called

994
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,460
Chinese version

995
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,620
called Flower Heart

996
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,940
Flower heart

997
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,620
I sing in the rain

998
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,940
I have made all the flowers

999
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,540
So this time

1000
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
Don't miss the flower season

1001
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,940
Let's enjoy the flower season together tomorrow

1002
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,380
Leave the memories of this common good

1003
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,940
The familiar music

1004
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,460
Can we talk about ourselves

1005
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,620
Who sings Flower Heart

1006
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,700
Teacher An

1007
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,460
Teacher An, I didn't sing the song today

1008
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,740
Next

1009
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,260
Okay, I'm starting to

1010
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,060
Looking forward to our performance tomorrow

1011
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,860
Everyone, have a good night's rest

1012
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,300
Let's cheer up tomorrow

1013
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,420
Cheer up

1014
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,460
Come on, see you tomorrow

1015
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,220
See you tomorrow

1016
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,420
Hello, everyone

1017
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,820
Hello

1018
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,180
Because today is the appearance of the outside

1019
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,220
So the feeling

1020
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,860
Must be different from the performance on the stage

1021
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,620
I want to ask the senior of the public

1022
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,940
Is there any experience

1023
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,460
Before everyone left

1024
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,100
Can you share with us

1025
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,340
It's not a live show

1026
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,300
It was when I was 14 years old

1027
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,900
No one came to see me yet

1028
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,700
When I was in the department store

1029
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,620
The top was very high

1030
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,660
If no one was there

1031
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,820
I thought that the people in the department store

1032
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,980
Would be sad

1033
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,220
The kind memories that everyone came to see

1034
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,660
Amazing

1035
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,540
But one of them

1036
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,460
I still have a letter

1037
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,300
Wonderful

1038
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,380
This is so beautiful

1039
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,140
Really

1040
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,620
No matter how many people are there

1041
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,860
No matter how many people are there

1042
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,660
If there is a person who is listening

1043
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,700
If there is one person

1044
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,180
It should be 100%

1045
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,540
Even if there are few people

1046
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,660
Even if there are many people

1047
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,820
Nothing will change in my performance

1048
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,340
Mr. Gong Teng

1049
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,020
Is a memory of me

1050
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,780
When I was in college

1051
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,620
Just took a performance

1052
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,700
In a mall

1053
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,940
Do that kind of activity

1054
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,140
I think it's funny that day

1055
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,300
The song I sang is called the actor

1056
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,540
When I sang the chorus

1057
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,740
I didn't play the song that I should cooperate with you

1058
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,340
Then that mall is very chaotic

1059
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,340
Many children are all on stage

1060
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,700
I stand on it and sing the actor

1061
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,580
It's very sad

1062
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,940
He's behind me

1063
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,540
And then I just took it

1064
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,820
Outman

1065
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,140
And then I just took it

1066
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,660
Outman

1067
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,380
I was playing it here

1068
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,780
I was having fun

1069
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,060
It's funny

1070
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,380
It's funny

1071
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,100
Did you not react to that child?

1072
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,540
Did you sing it properly?

1073
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,020
Or did you sing a sad song

1074
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,300
It's like you're touching the child

1075
00:58:59,300 --> 00:58:59,940
Which one?

1076
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,180
The interaction must be impossible

1077
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,260
The interaction

1078
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,540
Give him the microphone

1079
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,100
And I just

1080
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,060
I often broadcast

1081
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,700
Will act outdoors

1082
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,500
Then once

1083
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,660
I just wear our hanfu

1084
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,060
Then I also took the street in the city center

1085
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,820
While walking and singing

1086
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,300
Then there are many people who are closed

1087
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,580
Then I also prepared a lot of

1088
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,300
Chinese

1089
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,660
Little gift bear cat

1090
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,860
Or a special

1091
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,260
Something colorful

1092
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,540
Give it to those travelers

1093
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,620
Then they will also appear in my live broadcast

1094
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,740
Tell them Chinese and so on

1095
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,620
Then I think it's quite meaningful

1096
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,580
Because you can show them

1097
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,900
Like some of our Chinese culture

1098
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,620
And songs

1099
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,740
I sing all Chinese songs

1100
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,740
Including some songs of play

1101
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,220
All are in there

1102
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:46,940
Great

1103
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,860
I'm so sorry

1104
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,260
Anyone else wants to share?

1105
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,300
Is there any teacher

1106
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,580
On the stage

1107
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,260
Music

1108
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,900
This is the teacher behind

1109
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,860
Did he call you cute?

1110
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,820
Yes

1111
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,660
No, he sent in the news

1112
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,500
Me

1113
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,420
Because I have liked to sing since I was a kid

1114
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,300
Then I just grew up

1115
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,620
Then as long as there are stages

1116
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,780
Then if there is a chance to sing

1117
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,660
I will go

1118
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,940
Whether it's singing competition

1119
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,940
Or the performance of school

1120
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,420
I have met that kid

1121
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,180
It's very strange

1122
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,940
I remember when I sang

1123
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,420
A song is a disabled person

1124
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,540
A disabled person

1125
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,180
He is a sad song

1126
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,220
But you see

1127
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,020
He is just on the stage

1128
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,660
Turn around next to you

1129
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,460
Yes

1130
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,020
He is like this

1131
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,820
Because

1132
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,740
But I think the interesting thing is

1133
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,020
Because of the distance between the audience

1134
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,820
I think it's the most disabled person

1135
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,220
Because he will see the feedback for the first time

1136
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:47,540
Yes

1137
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,260
He is good or not

1138
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,660
Or there are many temporary situations

1139
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,620
So his advantage is here

1140
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,100
And the disadvantage is

1141
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,740
I think he is particularly disabled

1142
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,260
The heart of every singer

1143
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,380
How do you see these

1144
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,420
After the return

1145
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,660
Good but the best

1146
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
But when I face the bad things

1147
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,300
How do we enter

1148
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,700
A state of forgetting me

1149
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,420
Just like a disabled person

1150
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,100
Then completely

1151
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,340
Put yourself in this music

1152
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,860
I think this is a very good

1153
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,780
A chance to practice yourself

1154
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,860
Yes

1155
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,940
But as far as you can see yesterday's performance

1156
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,740
Already very confident people

1157
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,340
And when you go in front of people

1158
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,380
Just immediately

1159
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,260
Only people who can bloom their flowers

1160
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,900
But from now on

1161
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,940
I will sing with everyone

1162
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,020
After all, everyone's feeling

1163
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,580
I want you to enjoy while caring

1164
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,540
Is there a new star in the performance later

1165
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,740
Yes

1166
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,100
What's going on

1167
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,780
After the shooting last night

1168
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,900
A whole night is preparing the song for the performance

1169
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,460
The other girls are almost dying

1170
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,540
Didn't you drink the Jadobao

1171
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,540
This is the Changbei of the cooking night

1172
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,380
I only know how to eat and drink Jadobao

1173
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,140
I don't know how to cook and drink Jadobao

1174
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,140
This is our traditional Chinese culture

1175
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,620
The wisdom of the old group

1176
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,460
Scared of上火 and Jadobao

1177
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,940
Or well-risen taste

1178
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:12,900
So good

1179
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,740
Here is a toast

1180
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,100
Look at Jiayou

1181
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,460
The rope

1182
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,060
Pull back to Weiaining looking for the找er in the East Sea

1183
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,340
Hทำ hù not long hanging king 해야上文明

1184
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,140
The ancient dance of the ancestors

1185
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,340
is said to be the childhood poem of the kingdom

1186
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,340
and every song is the dialogue between the sea wind and the soul

1187
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,340
The melody of the three lines flows under every street

1188
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,340
and the track of the train

1189
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,340
connects the traditional and modern ideas

1190
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,340
Music is the sound of the drum in the ancient dance

1191
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:10,340
In the ancient dance, history is the music of the music

1192
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,340
Let's go to the martial arts park of the city

1193
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,340
I'm so happy

1194
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,340
Is it so fly?

1195
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Fly

1196
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,340
So this is really the shape of a bitter melon

1197
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,340
Is it a bitter melon circle?

1198
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,340
I'll take a picture of you with Huamin's phone

1199
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,340
OK

1200
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,340
The wallet

1201
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,340
It's so beautiful

1202
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,340
And the glasses

1203
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,340
I'll take a picture of you with the phone

1204
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,340
OK

1205
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,340
We can take four pictures here

1206
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,340
Let's put the snake on your body

1207
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,340
No

1208
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,340
I don't want to

1209
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,340
I want to

1210
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,340
I want to

1211
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,340
I want to

1212
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,340
I want to

1213
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,340
Really?

1214
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,340
What are you doing?

1215
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,340
We four

1216
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,340
First, I want to explain to you

1217
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,340
I'm not afraid

1218
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,340
I just want to give you a chance

1219
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,340
Everyone

1220
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,340
Yes

1221
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,340
Sister

1222
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,340
It's here

1223
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,340
I saw it

1224
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,340
So big

1225
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,340
So big

1226
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,340
Huamin

1227
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,340
My god

1228
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,340
It's so big

1229
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,340
No

1230
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,340
My god

1231
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,340
My god

1232
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,340
It's still fine

1233
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,340
So heavy

1234
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
It's like a dragon's tail

1235
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
Dragon's tail

1236
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,340
My god

1237
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,340
I like it

1238
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,340
So cute

1239
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,340
It's so shiny

1240
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,340
Yes

1241
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,340
So long

1242
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,340
So comfortable

1243
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,340
So comfortable

1244
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,340
So comfortable

1245
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,340
Happy New Year

1246
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,340
OK, students

1247
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
We're not done yet

1248
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,340
Let's continue to the next journey

1249
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,340
OK

1250
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,340
Bye

1251
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,340
Bye

1252
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,340
Thank you

1253
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,340
The fish are all gone

1254
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,340
It's so big

1255
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,340
My pants are all wet

1256
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,340
Let's go to the place

1257
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,340
where we're going to go later

1258
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,340
Because it's raining so hard today

1259
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,340
It's hard

1260
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,340
I don't know how to continue

1261
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I'm a little worried

1262
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,340
It's not just our recording

1263
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,340
And all the staff

1264
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,340
Because under this condition

1265
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,340
It's a very difficult thing

1266
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,340
And the wind is really very big

1267
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,340
It's too big

1268
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,340
Dragon

1269
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,340
So I don't know if we can

1270
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,340
finish the recording successfully

1271
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,340
Be careful, it's a little slippery

1272
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,340
But

1273
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
I have a plan

1274
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,340
Either it's a rain song

1275
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Or it's a umbrella song

1276
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,340
Anyway

1277
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,340
Our song

1278
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,340
Must be played with full of energy

1279
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,340
I heard the sound of the drum

1280
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,340
There's still a song

1281
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,340
Our stage seems to be in the front

1282
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,340
Let's take a look again

1283
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,340
We're here

1284
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,340
That's the song of the three-way line

1285
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
the road

1286
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,340
We might play an umbrella

1287
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,340
with a small rain

1288
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,340
Not half the time

1289
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:51,480
& In the spring & summer in autumn and winter Mountains of green

1290
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,320
& Pants of spring start bloomingando

1291
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,300
& & Other the essa

1292
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:07,440
are passing by

1293
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:12,080
Atlas' Wells

1294
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,340
I like it.

1295
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,340
I'm not a girl.

1296
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,340
I'm a girl.

1297
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,340
Thank you.

1298
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,340
Thank you.

1299
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,340
So great.

1300
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,340
You are so good at acting.

1301
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,340
Can you introduce yourselves to us?

1302
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,340
I'm the 3rd singer of the day.

1303
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,340
I'm Yuka.

1304
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,340
Thank you.

1305
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,340
Thank you.

1306
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,340
Hello.

1307
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,340
I'm Yamato.

1308
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,340
Thank you for coming.

1309
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,340
Thank you.

1310
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:54,340
We are the sisters of the stage.

1311
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,340
We are the 3rd and 4th singers of the year.

1312
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,340
We are the 1st generation of Chinese.

1313
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,340
Thank you.

1314
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,340
We are the 3rd singers of the year.

1315
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,340
I'm Iwata Nakana.

1316
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,340
Thank you.

1317
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,340
We have a mission.

1318
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:16,340
We want to act in a small show here.

1319
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:22,340
I wonder if we have time to do it together.

1320
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:26,340
Please.

1321
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,340
Great.

1322
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,340
We will stop the rain.

1323
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,340
We will set up the stage.

1324
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,340
OK.

1325
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,340
Let's go.

1326
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,340
Let's do it.

1327
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,340
Let's go.

1328
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,340
I'll do it here.

1329
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,340
I'm afraid I can't do it.

1330
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,340
I'll do it.

1331
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,340
You should do it.

1332
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,340
I was worried about the rain.

1333
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,340
I think it's because of the music.

1334
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:04,340
I think someone is lucky.

1335
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,340
I think everyone's power is gone.

1336
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,340
Wow.

1337
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,340
When we arrived at the stage,

1338
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,340
I think it's like a band or a group.

1339
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,340
The music of the big bag and the small bag.

1340
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,340
The scene is not warm.

1341
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,340
Because the ground was cold.

1342
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,340
I think it's warm.

1343
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,340
It should be a beautiful scene.

1344
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,340
We are all trying to complete the same stage.

1345
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,340
The friendship is still beautiful.

1346
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:40,340
How is it?

1347
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,340
You are here to test, right?

1348
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,340
Yes. I'm here to check the homework.

1349
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,340
Hurry up.

1350
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:50,340
Let's see Hua Xin sit down first.

1351
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,340
OK.

1352
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,340
It's special to sing in this environment.

1353
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,340
Yes. It's close.

1354
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,340
Let's officially start.

1355
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,340
Are you ready, Hua Xin?

1356
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,340
Yes.

1357
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,340
No more.

1358
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,340
No more.

1359
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,340
Please get ready.

1360
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,340
The score is three.

1361
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,340
Three.

1362
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,340
Two.

1363
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,340
One.

1364
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,340
Tao Shi Teng.

1365
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,340
I will sing this song for you.

1366
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,340
Choose a song

1367
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,340
When I'm about to leave

1368
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:09,340
I want to bloom as a flower

1369
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:14,340
I want to bloom for you

1370
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,340
Cry

1371
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:24,340
Laugh

1372
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,340
When the sun rises

1373
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,340
I want to bloom as a flower

1374
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:40,340
Cry

1375
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,340
Laugh

1376
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:50,340
When the sun rises

1377
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:55,340
I want to bloom as a flower

1378
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:00,340
Cry

1379
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:05,340
Laugh

1380
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:10,340
When the sun rises

1381
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:15,340
I want to bloom as a flower

1382
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,340
The tears of the flower fall in the wind

1383
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,340
The most beautiful night is gone

1384
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,340
The different taste

1385
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:32,340
The color of the sea in my heart

1386
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,340
Is there a dream?

1387
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:40,340
Why don't you hold my hand

1388
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:45,340
The color of the sea in my heart

1389
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:50,340
The tide rises and falls

1390
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,340
The world is long

1391
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,340
The spring comes

1392
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:05,340
The flower will be in the sky

1393
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,340
As long as you're willing

1394
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:15,340
Let me take your heart

1395
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:20,340
To the sea

1396
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:25,340
The story won't be forgotten

1397
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:30,340
As long as you're willing

1398
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,340
Let me take your heart

1399
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,340
To the sea

1400
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:44,340
The flower will be in the sky

1401
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,340
I want to bloom for you

1402
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,340
I want to bloom for you

1403
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,340
I want to bloom for you

1404
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,340
The color of the sea in my heart

1405
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:03,340
The song is very cold

1406
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,340
It's a song that we like very much

1407
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:11,340
But it's very big together

1408
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,340
It feels like they're singing this song like sisters

1409
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:19,340
You can see the tacit understanding and enjoying this song

1410
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,340
It feels like they're singing this song like sisters

1411
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,340
You can see the tacit understanding and enjoying this song

1412
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,340
Okay, so let's get ready

1413
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,340
Let's get started

1414
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,340
Let's go

1415
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,340
Come here for a trip

1416
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,340
Where do you come from?

1417
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,340
Do you want to sit in front?

1418
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,340
Come on

1419
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,340
Welcome

1420
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,340
Who wants to sit here?

1421
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,340
Come on

1422
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,340
But I feel like

1423
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,340
Other than those four ladies

1424
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,340
I'm very shy

1425
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,340
So I don't come here

1426
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,340
If you're alone

1427
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,340
You can come out for 100%

1428
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,340
Are you ready?

1429
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,340
Yes

1430
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,340
Are you ready?

1431
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,340
Yes, I'm ready

1432
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:28,340
The cable car istheme

1433
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,340
The wettestました

1434
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,340
I remember

1435
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,340
We talked the day after yesterday

1436
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,340
I'm so happy

1437
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,340
I'm so happy

1438
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,340

I'm so happy

1443
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,340
I'm so happy

1444
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,340
I'm so happy

1445
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,340
I'm so happy

1446
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,340
I'm so happy

1447
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,340
I'm so happy

1448
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,340
I'm so happy

1449
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,340
I'm so happy

1450
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,780

1452

Your shame is mine

1453
01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,600
No.3

1454
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,120
I'm trying to语ッ

1455
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,120

The dream of the world will come true

1484
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,100
The dream of the world will come true

1485
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:27,100
The dream of the world will come true

1486
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,100
The dream of the world will come true

01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,100

01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,100
Awesome

1492
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,100
The difference between people and culture

1493
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,100
The difference between language

1494
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:09,100
I think there is something special about music

1495
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,100
I think we are in the same mood

1496
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
Because of a special fate

1497
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,100
We are singing the same song

1498
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,100
We are expressing our feelings

1499
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,100
But we are doing something special

1500
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,100
I think it is very beautiful

1501
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,100
I hope this song will come true

1502
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,100
Let's continue

1503
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,100
Music is beautiful

1504
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,100
I'm really saving my mother

1505
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,100
She can turn to the heaven

1506
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,260
The most popular singer in Thailand

1507
