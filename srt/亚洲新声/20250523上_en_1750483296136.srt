I want to speak directly to the performance that is about to come out and sing for us

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,460
I know how nervous they are right now

31
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,460
And I want them to use those nerves

32
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
Nerves are the best thing you can have

33
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,460
You can use them to have power and control and passion when you sing

34

I think there are many different countries or regions

45
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Different clothes, different luck

46
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,460
We can exchange different music in this journey

47
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460

48
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460

50
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,460
The new-born and rising singer, Zhang Xingzhe

51
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,460
I hope that all the musicians who are passionate about music

52
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460

53
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,460

I love this song

62
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
You said that I was like a flash of light

63
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,460
How can I catch up with the light in my heart

64
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Because I am full of wind and waves

65
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I will be able to fly

66
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
The sun shines brightly

67
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
How can I get back to the dream

68
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Give me your light

69
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
Give me your light

70
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,460
The moon is shining, now it is worth looking forward to it

71
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,460
My hands are shaking, I want to start dancing

72
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Give me your light

73
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Give me your light

74
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
I see the shadows alone, beneath the mountain tops

75
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
No, I'm not afraid

76
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
When the rain won't stop

77
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Because you're lying away

78
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Yeah, you're lying away

79
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,460
You're lying away

80
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,460
Because I am full of wind and waves

81
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,460
I will be able to fly

82
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,460
The sun shines brightly

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,460
How can I get back to the dream

84
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460

The moon is shining, now it is worth looking forward to it

87
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,460
My hands are shaking, I want to start dancing

88
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Give me your light

89
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Give me your light

90
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,460
I see the sun shines brightly

91
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
How can I get back to the dream

92
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
Give me your light

93
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Give me your light

94
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Give me your light

95
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Give me your light

96
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I see the shadows alone, beneath the mountain tops

97
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
No, I'm not afraid

98
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,460
My hands are shaking, I want to start dancing

99
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Give me your light

100
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Give me your light

101
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Give me your light

102
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Give me love

103
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I'm so tired of this

104
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,460
I'm so tired of this

105
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
I'm so tired of this

106
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,460
I'm so tired of this

111
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,460
I'm so tired of this

112
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
I'm so tired of this

113
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm so tired of this

114
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,460
I'm so tired of this

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm so tired of this

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
I'm so tired of this

117
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm so tired of this

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
I'm so tired of this

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
I'm so tired of this

120
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,460
I'm tired of this

121
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Don't be too aggressive

122
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
I'm very fat

123
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,460
You are not lucky

124
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,460
But I've a positive life

125
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,540
Mr. sometimes

126
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,060
Before we start

127
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,240
let me introduce you the competition

128
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,220
Six drum strawberry singers from China

129
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,620
perform each song

130
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,980
Every one of them

131
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,340
six singers from different countries in Asia

132
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,260
will ä adjusted by�

133
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,940
roll for a challenge

134
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,620
they will have six singers

135
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,780
The Making por coloured

136
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,220
are the three teachers

137
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,580
сown officials

138
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,860
among 31 other countries on the mountain

139
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,700
of Asia

140
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,900
especially a musician

141
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,220
Now let's look forward to the new singer

142
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,460
who will be the first to come on stage.

143
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,340
Who will she be?

144
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,780
Who will be the first?

145
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,820
I think we should choose

146
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,740
a high-pitched voice

147
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
with a good explosive power.

148
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,340
Yes.

149
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,580
The first performance

150
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,460
will be more stressful.

151
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,780
I think I still need more

152
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,740
energy.

153
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,260
Let me do it.

154
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Really?

155
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,420
Yes.

156
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Good.

157
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,700
You can do it.

158
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,660
Let's take a shot.

159
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,940
And you wear red.

160
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,220
Yes.

161
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,180
You look very good.

162
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,740
You are still impressed by Mr. Jessi.

163
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,860
I think

164
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,700
it's not bad at first.

165
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,020
After you finish singing,

166
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,220
you can enjoy

167
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
the performance of the 11 players.

168
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,740
As the first Chinese singer

169
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,980
to come on stage

170
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,260
as a singer of the Asia Star Show,

171
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,100
I think I don't need any of them.

172
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,940
The hometown of Song Fei is Jiangshan City, Zhejiang.

173
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,380
It has the natural beauty of Jiangshan.

174
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,780
It has the history of thousands of years.

175
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,620
Hi, I'm Zhou Fei.

176
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,140
I'm 22 years old this year.

177
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
I'm a young,

178
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,700
and outstanding singer.

179
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,940
I will sing and play the keyboard.

180
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,060
I'll play the guitar.

181
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,700
To me,

182
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,980
every step I take

183
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,500
is the music that I take.

184
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,180
This time,

185
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,820
I want to see

186
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,660
what kind of music

187
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,460
the colleagues of all Asian countries are playing.

188
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,260
I also want to try

189
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
the position of the Asia Star Show.

190
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,060
I'm Zhou Fei.

191
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,500
We are on the run.

192
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
It's my favourite song from Arkan.

193
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
What?

194
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,780
She dance in a team.

195
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,500
I be a journey in love

196
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,980
Let her take aiggers

197
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,900
I will tell her that I'mover

198
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,060
After taking off my coat,

199
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,180
the sun prevent the clouds from coming

200
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
I'm not afraid of you.

201
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I'm not afraid of you.

202
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm not afraid of you.

203
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
I'm not afraid of you.

204
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
I'm not afraid of you.

205
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm not afraid of you.

206
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
I'm not afraid of you.

207
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm not afraid of you.

208
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,180
I'm not afraid of you.

209
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
I'm not afraid of you.

210
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm not afraid of you.

211
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
I'm not afraid of you.

212
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
I'm not afraid of you.

213
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
I'm not afraid of you.

214
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Don't be sad anymore.

215
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,180
Don't forget.

216
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Even if you cry, you will always be afraid.

217
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,180
Even if you reach the time, you can't find it.

218
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:15,180
If the flying bird is flying,

219
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,180
don't look for it anymore.

220
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Give me a hug.

221
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Just forget it quietly.

222
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm very good.

223
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
So good.

224
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Thank you.

225
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Thank you, Brother Zhou Fei.

226
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,180
I think it's a very good beginning today.

227
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Like the opening of her dress today.

228
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Yes.

229
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,180
So beautiful.

230
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,180
Actually, I don't know much about this song.

231
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
But when it comes to the second chorus,

232
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
I really want to see which direction the moon is.

233
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Because today's stage can really see the moon.

234
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
We are now in the sea.

235
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
We are the endless sea.

236
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,180
So I think this stage is perfect with nature.

237
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
It's a very good beginning.

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
Thank you, Lanyang.

239
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,180
I want to ask a question that is a little private.

240
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Have you ever sung a song on the boat?

241
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Actually, I have never sung a song on the boat.

242
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,180
I haven't seen the sea in fact.

243
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Yes, because you know that when you come out early,

244
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,180
there will be a sound that will directly blow you out.

245
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
And the same key with this song.

246
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Is it very small?

247
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Very small.

248
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,180
I personally had no idea what you were saying.

249
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,180
But I felt every word.

250
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,180
And that's how amazing and beautiful your performance was.

251
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
I could really feel what you were singing.

252
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,180
And your tone, your pitch was A1, 10 out of 10.

253
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Bravo. So good.

254
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
Welcome.

255
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
Thank you, teacher.

256
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,180
And I'm 23 as well, so we have that in common.

257
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Actually, when I was studying,

258
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,180
I have sung the version of Jay-Z's version of Never Too Much.

259
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Never too much, never too much.

260
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
But I didn't sing it at that time.

261
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,180
I failed.

262
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,180
Can I challenge you? We sing that.

263
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:57,180
A thousand kisses from you is never too much.

264
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,180
And I just don't want to stop.

265
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,180
Never too much, never too much, never too much.

266
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
I'm just eager to know who's going to challenge you.

267
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,180
For the singer who will challenge you soon,

268
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
do you have anything to say to them?

269
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Actually, I'm not very polite.

270
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
That's it.

271
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
I'll give you the biggest courage.

272
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
Congratulations.

273
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Congratulations.

274
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Come on.

275
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Let's start.

276
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Start.

277
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Why are you so good?

278
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Can you cut it?

279
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Can you cut it?

280
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,180
I want someone who's more difficult.

281
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
6

282
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
1

283
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
2

284
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,180
3

285
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
2

286
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
1

287
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
What a coincidence.

288
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
It seems that our international friends

289
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
are not afraid at all.

290
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Come on.

291
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Let's welcome the first challenger.

292
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
Good luck.

293
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
Good luck.

294
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Go.

295
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Actually, what we want to do is

296
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
to challenge the best.

297
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,180
We are confident.

298
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Yes, we are confident.

299
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
And ready to go back to our times.

300
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Thai music with its unique colors,

301
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
rhythm and cultural fusion.

302
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
It has the golden structure of the palace music.

303
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,180
It has the vitality of the people and the music.

304
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,180
It is a unique experience of Southeast Asian cultural interaction.

305
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,180
Hello, we are Soi Boy Asia.

306
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
This is a very big place.

307
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
And in the water, it is a Thai character.

308
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,180
We are very excited and proud.

309
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Hello.

310
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Hello.

311
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
We are Soi Boy Asia.

312
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
We are Soi Boy Asia.

313
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Hello.

314
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Hello.

315
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Hello.

316
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,180
We are so many.

317
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Hello.

318
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Three people.

319
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Hello.

320
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Hello.

321
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
Hello.

322
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Go to the next stage.

323
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Hello.

324
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
It's just a small thing

325
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
Just a small thing

326
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
I'm just a little girl

327
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
I'm just a little girl

328
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
I'm just a little girl

329
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
I'm just a little girl

330
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
If you want to know

331
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
I want to know

332
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
I'm just a little girl

333
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,180
I'm just a little girl

334
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Just a little girl

335
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Just a little girl

336
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Just a little girl

337
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Just a little girl

338
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Just a little girl

339
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Hello, everyone

340
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
We are Boy ASEAN

341
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,180
We are

342
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Xiao Tian

343
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Lan

344
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
Is it a small elephant or a elephant in a elephant?

345
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,180
I think it's a elephant

346
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Is it a big elephant?

347
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,180
I may listen to the song of Tai Yu

348
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Can you introduce this song?

349
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Actually, it's a song

350
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
Pop, easy to listen

351
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
It's called Oc Leg

352
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
It's a song that

353
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
The story of the elephant

354
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
Is a song of love

355
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
We love one woman who doesn't love us

356
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
But we have a heart for her

357
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
And that woman loves another man

358
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Who is better than us

359
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
We have nothing good except for the love

360
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Love that makes her beautiful

361
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
That little elephant

362
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
It's like a big elephant

363
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
We are too rich

364
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Hi

365
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Hi

366
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
How are you?

367
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
I'm fine, thank you

368
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Thank you

369
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
The Chinese are moved

370
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
One thing that I thought was wonderful about your performance

371
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Is the joy that I felt

372
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
You guys, I could see how much you enjoyed

373
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Performing

374
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
And that is so contagious

375
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,180
So always keep that in any situation that you have

376
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
I think you have three completely different voices

377
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I would have loved to hear you sing more

378
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Really good for you

379
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Thank you

380
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,180
I think we can really

381
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
See from their songs

382
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
Very youthful

383
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
A feature of the attitude, humor and Thai music

384
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
With some joy

385
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
But if we want to talk about

386
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
The cruel words of the competition

387
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
The cruel words

388
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
I will look forward to

389
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Seeing if you guys have more

390
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
The harmony

391
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
OK

392
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Now let's welcome Fei

393
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Back to the stage

394
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
Oh my god, they are going to decide now

395
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
Please go to the judges' group

396
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
To vote

397
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Please the three teachers

398
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,180
Write down your favorite

399
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Song name

400
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Please the three teachers

401
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
To decide

402
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
This is my choice

403
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Zhou Fei

404
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Thank you

405
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
My decision is based purely

406
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Just on technique

407
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
And range and performance

408
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Pitch and feeling

409
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
I also choose Fei

410
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Liang Ying

411
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Your choice is

412
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Zhou Fei

413
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Thank you

414
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
These two songs are actually

415
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Very different

416
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
I really enjoy

417
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
The performance of the boy

418
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
But what I want to say is

419
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Zhou Fei is really a genius

420
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,180
Including the performance on the song

421
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,180
I think today I like

422
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
His performance

423
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,180
21 judges

424
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,180
The final result

425
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,180
The final result is

426
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
Zhou Fei's choice

427
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Congratulations Zhou Fei

428
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Congratulations to the king

429
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Thank you

430
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
Thank you

431
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Is that

432
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
I like the boy

433
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,180
That he brought the song

434
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
That is a country

435
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Or a song that has a history

436
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
He found a story

437
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,180
To make it more interesting

438
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
And this time

439
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I have been to the stage

440
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
And I was surprised

441
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
The voice is very attractive

442
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I felt the depth of the adult's color

443
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,180
The quality is great

444
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,180
I was impressed by the singing voice

445
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,180
of Steve Perry

446
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Zhou Fei is really beautiful

447
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
From his main song

448
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Then go to the chorus

449
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,180
That whole melody

450
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
I am very impressed

451
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
I was moved by their three performances

452
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
There are many

453
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,180
The sound of the 12-picture green

454
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,180
The quarter tone is very good

455
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
The chorus is very good

456
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Nice

457
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Please play

458
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,180
Please play

459
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
Yes

460
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I accept the answer

461
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,180
But if you don't accept the challenge

462
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
What kind of singer should the 12-picture green be?

463
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
I think I can go

464
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
I can go too

465
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Then you two

466
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
The steps

467
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
The straight cut

468
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
The straight cut

469
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
I won

470
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
I feel that

471
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
I lost to him

472
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
But I said I won

473
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
And then I went up

474
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
They will take a big shot next round

475
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Wait a minute

476
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
Let's keep this energy

477
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,180
OK, I will go

478
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
Come on

479
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Everyone wants to

480
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Let the rhythm of our team

481
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
So I think I have to win

482
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Wang Honghao's hometown Sichuan Deyang

483
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
The original story of the ancient

484
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
The beautiful city of Zhongchang

485
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Sichuan has left a message since ancient times

486
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Sichuan's voice is like a treasure

487
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Now Sichuan is singing

488
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
The new voice of the movie

489
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Become the popular music place in China

490
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Hello, everyone

491
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
I am Wang Honghao, the young and ordinary

492
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
I have been close to ordinary

493
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
And I am usually ordinary

494
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
I am ordinary

495
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
I like singing since I was a kid

496
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Because I like to sing in the sea

497
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,180
I like singing in the sea

498
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
I like singing in the sea

499
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
I left my hometown when I was 17

500
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
I went to Chengdu to study music

501
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,180
I have been going to now

502
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
I want to make a dream

503
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,180
I want to make a dream

504
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,180
This is my first time

505
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180
I went abroad for the first time

506
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,180
I want to make a tour

507
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,180
There is a horse carriage on it

508
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
You can take a look

509
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
This should be the stage

510
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
New voice of Asia

511
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
The feeling of singing here is great

512
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
The position I am standing now

513
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Is the center of our stage

514
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
Very excited

515
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
It must be beautiful tonight

516
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
No matter if I win or lose this time

517
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
I think I will adjust

518
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
My emotions

519
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
I am a very emotional singer

520
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
I am moving others with my emotions

521
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,180
No matter it is for myself

522
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Or for our team

523
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,180
I must win

524
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
I don't know why I suddenly started

525
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I feel like I am busy

526
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Maybe the cold has a little relationship

527
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Because we are competing

528
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Who is having theSu's words

529
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
It must be different

530
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,140
Maybeän

531
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,180
Can we respond with it

532
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,140
Nice

533
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Wash hands

534
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Wash hands

535
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Wash hands

536
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Wash hands

537
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,140
Retro

538
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,420
Change PEN

539
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,620
Wow!

540
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,700
Organizer

541
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,700
No matter how much I push

542
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
It's actually really good

543
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Who else can I trust?

544
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
How many days

545
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
How many years

546
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,700
I only found the end of the makeup

547
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,700
How many painful heart

548
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,700
Love is not leaving the side

549
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,700
How many lies and lies

550
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Are also not perfect

551
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,700
How many songs do you want me to see

552
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:58,700
I'm going to sing everything

553
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,700
I walk in this city

554
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,700
The familiar and unfamiliar face

555
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,700
My heart can comfort me

556
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,700
I'm the angel of life

557
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Maybe he can understand

558
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:28,700
This helplessness makes me so tired

559
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,700
I walk in this city

560
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Who else can I trust?

561
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,700
How many days

562
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,700
How many years

563
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,700
I only found the end of the makeup

564
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
How many painful heart

565
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Love is not leaving the side

566
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
How many lies and lies

567
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,700
Are also not perfect

568
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,700
How many songs do you want me to see

569
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm not available

570
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,700
I'm not able to think of the end

571
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I'm not able to fly

572
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,700
I try to follow the wind

573
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,700
I can't find a absolute

574
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,700
All the time

575
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
How many days

576
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,700
How many years

577
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
I only found the end of the makeup

578
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
How many painful heart

579
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Love is not leaving the side

580
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
How many lies and lies

581
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Are also not perfect

582
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,700
How many songs do you want me to see

583
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,700
I'm not able to think of the end

584
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,700
How many songs do you want me to see

585
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I only found the end

586
00:36:48,700 --> 00:37:00,700
What little years

587
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Actually, he used his dance back then

588
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Thank you

589
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,940
I love

590
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,500
First of all, I want to say that I really like

591
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,740
the performance of the song she just sang.

592
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,260
Because...

593
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,100
Although she was on stage,

594
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,140
I saw her hands were still shaking.

595
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,860
I could see that she was nervous.

596
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,300
But from the first song,

597
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,460
she was very aggressive.

598
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,580
And she was actually

599
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,820
very delicate

600
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,380
in dealing with the emotional

601
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,660
and emotional feelings

602
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,220
during the singing process.

603
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,500
Including the last part,

604
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,460
the first word after the break,

605
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,260
the feeling of being a little bit agitated.

606
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
In a kind of

607
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,100
like a lost control,

608
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
but without a lost control,

609
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
she was very aggressive.

610
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,900
I think her voice

611
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,300
is her personal strength.

612
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,180
Because

613
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,380
I think there are not many

614
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,060
male singers who are good at listening.

615
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,460
In addition, her voice is actually

616
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,420
a little bit

617
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,700
silly and sad,

618
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,500
but not bad.

619
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,820
If I give some suggestions,

620
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,860
I think you can

621
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,980
strengthen your falsetto part.

622
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,300
Thank you, Mr. Xing.

623
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
Hi.

624
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,780
Hi, Mr. Xing.

625
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,380
Firstly, it's so nice to see you smile.

626
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
It's the first time you've smiled.

627
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,300
And that would be my only thing I'll say to you

628
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,260
is enjoy it more.

629
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,900
I can feel that you focus on technique.

630
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,140
And I think if you just focus more on emotion

631
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
and feeling it and enjoying it,

632
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,060
I think that your performance will naturally

633
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,340
just get to the next level.

634
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Thank you.

635
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,500
What do you want to say

636
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,980
to the singers who will give you a challenge soon?

637
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,180
Come on.

638
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,980
Come on.

639
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,820
Come on.

640
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,620
The auction is starting now.

641
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,460
Oh my god.

642
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,700
It seems that

643
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,260
many people want to challenge you.

644
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,260
Really?

645
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,500
Are you confident now?

646
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,140
Yes.

647
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,940
I'm sure.

648
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,700
I'm sure.

649
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,300
Yes.

650
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,460
I just heard the first second.

651
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,380
Now, let's start.

652
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
Ten, nine.

653
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,340
So fast.

654
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,380
You know, pumped with energy.

655
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,780
I was just so excited that it's just gonna

656
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,580
it's just gonna happen right now.

657
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm gonna do that.

658
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,140
I'm gonna stand everyone and leave the stage.

659
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,940
The New Generation of Kazakhstan

660
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,740
The new generation of Kazakhstan

661
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,700
is used to form the origin of grassland.

662
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,060
The traditional image of the old times

663
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,020
was taken in the modern era.

664
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,740
He was a full-time kid.

665
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,580
I've been here for ten years.

666
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm thirteen.

667
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,740
I'm just fourteen.

668
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,220
I'm sixteen now.

669
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,820
But genius will grow up.

670
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,140
He has been an official champion.

671
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
He has won many world-class stages.

672
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,940
Danelia to the show now.

673
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,780
Danelia, you're amazing.

674
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,940
You hit every note.

675
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,580
This was perfection.

676
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,340
You got real determination.

677
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,460
Love the song choice.

678
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,260
On and on.

679
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,180
His talent

680
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,620
was not only recognized by the world-class.

681
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,580
He has been on the world stage.

682
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,060
Now he's back in Asia.

683
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,980
This time, he's going to use music to tell the world

684
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,740
that he's grown up.

685
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,780
I'm really interested in competing with

686
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,380
the best singers in Asia.

687
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
【⁉⁰】

688
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:50,580
Happy

689
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,460
【PBU】

690
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,420
Really great.

691
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,660
Fourteen years in the past

692
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,940
Junya has been the leading single host for the country.

693
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,900
Open in the future,

694
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I'm not sure if I can sing it right.

695
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I'm not sure.

696
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
I'm not sure.

697
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
I'm not sure.

698
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I'm not sure.

699
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
I'm not sure.

700
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm not sure.

701
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm not sure.

702
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
I'm not sure.

703
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
I'm not sure.

704
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I'm not sure.

705
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
I'm not sure.

706
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
I'm not sure.

707
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I'm not sure.

708
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
I'm not sure.

709
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm not sure.

710
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,900
I'm not sure.

711
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
I'm not sure.

712
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm not sure.

713
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm not sure.

714
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
I'm not sure.

715
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
I'm not sure.

716
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm not sure.

717
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
I'm not sure.

718
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm not sure.

719
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm not sure.

720
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
I'm not sure.

721
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
I'm not sure.

722
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm not sure.

723
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
I'm not sure.

724
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Okay.

725
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Is this...

726
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Can we use it together?

727
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
No.

728
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Let's try that with the music.

729
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
This is awesome.

730
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Thank you for watching my video.

731
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
I'm a new age

732
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,900
I'm pretty white dim

733
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Pretty white dim

734
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:16,900
Oh, I'm pretty white dim

735
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Wow

736
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
Finally

737
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Finally

738
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
I raise my flag

739
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
And turn my clothes

740
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
To revolution

741
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
I suppose

742
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
We painted red

743
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
To federate in

744
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:54,900
I'm breaking and shaping up and checking out all the prisoners

745
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,900
This isn't about cause

746
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,900
But I'm waking up

747
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,900
I feel like I'm my ghost enough to make my system grow

748
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,900
Welcome to the new age, you're the new

749
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Welcome to the new age, you're the new age

750
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Pretty you like it, pretty you like it

751
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:41,900
All systems go, the sun hasn't died

752
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:50,900
I'm deep in my bones, stray from inside

753
00:43:50,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Oh

754
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,900
Welcome to the new age, you're the new

755
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Welcome to the new age, you're the new age

756
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Pretty you like it, pretty you like it

757
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Pretty you like it, pretty you like it

758
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,900
Thank you

759
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Yes, you made it, you made it

760
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,900
She's our team, she's our team

761
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,900
She's a little girl, she's really good

762
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
Luckily, the last five people didn't choose me

763
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,900
I think she's very strong

764
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,900
If I meet Li'er, I'll be in the mood to sing

765
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
Wang Ge, Li Daoyang

766
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Thank you

767
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,900
The first song of Danyi Liya just sang is

768
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,900
The weather is so cold

769
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Actually, her song can make everyone feel warm

770
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,900
It's very cold in that place

771
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,900
The body is cold, the heart is cold

772
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
Welcome, how do you feel

773
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
I'm feeling great

774
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Hi everyone, my name is Donelia Tuleshova

775
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,900
I'm from Kazakhstan originally

776
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
To kind of get more freedom

777
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,900
And now this is where it got me

778
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Basically

779
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,900
So yeah, I'm very excited to be here

780
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
What's this guy's following on the hook

781
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
Oh really?

782
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,900
Yeah, look at their faces

783
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
First of all, congratulations

784
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,900
Thank you so much, I'm so excited to see you

785
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
I'm excited to see you

786
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,900
I feel like this is as surreal for you

787
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,900
As it is for all of us being on this ship

788
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,900
It's so amazing experience

789
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Your voice is really good

790
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,900
It's really strong

791
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,900
If you just smiled a little bit

792
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,900
Because of the radioactive

793
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,900
Instead of radioactive

794
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,900
You hear the difference

795
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,900
So if you just smiled

796
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,900
It would have brightened the sound just a little bit

797
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,900
You know, you're 18

798
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,900
And your whole life is ahead of you

799
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,900
And these moments are so powerful

800
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,900
You're a young woman

801
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
And this is a great opportunity for you

802
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
To be heard and to grow and to learn

803
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,900
So I'm happy that I'm here in this moment with you

804
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Thank you so much, yeah

805
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Thank you

806
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
You want this?

807
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,900
It's a beautiful song

808
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,900
So would you like to talk more about this song?

809
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,900
Well, I've been a fan of

810
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,900
Imagine Dragons

811
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,900
Ever since I was young

812
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,900
And this song kind of

813
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,900
Defines power and energy for me

814
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
So this is the exact energy that I have

815
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,900
To come in with for the first round

816
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
So yeah

817
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,900
You already have a great voice

818
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,900
But I think the chorus

819
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,900
Of the whole chorus

820
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,900
If you can give her

821
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,900
Some more different layers

822
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,900
On the design

823
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,900
Thank you so much for your comment

824
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Thank you

825
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
Let's let Wang Honghao

826
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,900
Come on

827
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
Wang Honghao, please come on the stage

828
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
Wang Linan, you're under a lot of pressure

829
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Her voice

830
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,900
That kind of energy

831
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
That kind of atmosphere

832
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,900
I feel like

833
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
I just got me down

834
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
But in my heart

835
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,900
The next thing is

836
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
I'm still competing

837
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
I want to give my team

838
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Another point

839
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
I wasn't getting too nervous

840
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
Yeah, I think I did

841
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Ten out of ten

842
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,900
Mr. A'Zao, your choice is

843
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,900
Denelia

844
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Lian Yungjie, your choice is

845
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
Thank you, Mr. Liang

846
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,900
Mr. JC, your choice is

847
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
So I too have won with Denelia

848
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Denelia

849
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,900
The final result of the 21 judges

850
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
When Denelia

851
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,900
The moment she sang

852
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,900
She proved it

853
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
I was really impressed

854
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,900
That she felt it

855
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
I felt it was fun

856
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,900
The performance was

857
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,900
As for Wang Honghao

858
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,900
I think her voice is also good

859
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,900
I think she is not confident

860
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,900
She didn't have

861
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,900
The stage that she can put her head up

862
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
The part where the audience is all over

863
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,900
The final result of the judges

864
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
The final result is

865
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,900
Wang Honghao

866
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,900
Three votes

867
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
Denelia

868
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
21 votes

869
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Congratulations to Denelia

870
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
You won

871
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,900
I'm a little bit upset

872
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Thank you so much

873
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
I think the most important thing

874
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,900
For the performance

875
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,900
Is to have your energy

876
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,900
And your whole self

877
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,900
Present it into the song

878
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,900
And into the performance

879
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
So yeah, I think I did

880
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
I did want to lose

881
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
But I didn't expect

882
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,900
To have such a big nose

883
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
It's a little bit sad

884
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,900
Wang Honghao is going to fall

885
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Wang Honghao

886
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
Wang Honghao can't do this

887
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,900
Wang Honghao

888
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,900
It's okay

889
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
It's too violent

890
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,900
We have already said it

891
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,900
Let's not break the rhythm

892
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Then after going back

893
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,900
It's broken

894
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,900
And then in my heart

895
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,900
Still very

896
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Very guilty

897
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,900
Very

898
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,900
I feel sorry for my little friends

899
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,900
Wang Honghao's opponent is very strong

900
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Honghao may be a little bit nervous today

901
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,900
I think he didn't

902
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,900
The best state of the performance

903
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,900
You stand up and you're shaking

904
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,900
I just

905
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,900
The heart is beating

906
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
I feel like someone is going to be demonized

907
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
Don't be afraid

908
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,900
Stay strong

909
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,900
Get used to it

910
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,900
You must be familiar

911
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Because I never sang in the tour before

912
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,900
I think this is a new experience

913
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,900
I think the various environments

914
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,900
This state is good

915
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,900
You have to adjust it slowly

916
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
Get used to it slowly

917
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,900
He's just a little nervous

918
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,900
If you're a little bit more

919
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,900
Relax a little bit

920
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
Relax a little bit

921
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,900
Even if he's a little bit more confident

922
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,900
I will be more confident

923
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Challenge the singer team

924
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,900
Winner of this round

925
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,900
1 to 1

926
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
The score is equal

927
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,900
Let's welcome the next new singer to the stage

928
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,900
I really want to go up

929
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,900
I really want to go up

930
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,900
I really want to sing when I see other people sing

931
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,900
I also want to sing

932
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,900
I also want to go up

933
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,900
I also want to feel that stage

934
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,900
I think it's me

935
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,900
Come on

936
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
The hometown of Aisin Juelomei

937
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,900
Is the capital of China, Beijing

938
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,900
Beijing is a traditional Chinese culture world

939
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,900
And it has the traditional Chinese tradition of Beijing

940
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,900
At the same time, Beijing is also a popular Chinese music city

941
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Many non-native singers and artists

942
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Have grown up here

943
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
My name is Aisin Juelomei

944
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,900
I'm 24 years old this year

945
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
Many people think

946
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
The girl looks like an outsider

947
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
But how can she speak so well in Chinese

948
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,900
I was born in Beijing

949
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
But because of my dad's work

950
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,900
I moved many times

951
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,900
I lived in five countries

952
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
I have read 14 different schools

953
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,900
With all over the world

954
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,900
Different people from all over Asia

955
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
Become classmates

956
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,900
Become friends

957
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
I watched the music of childhood

958
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,900
And the two movies of the first half of the green moon

959
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,900
And then I liked music

960
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,900
I think I will sing first

961
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Talk to him again

962
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
People who will give me a home

963
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,900
Perform

964
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,900
People who will say

965
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,900
I want to sing

966
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,900
I want to sing

967
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,900
I only have one thing to do in school

968
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,900
Is to go home

969
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
Find a partner to sing

970
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
I can sing for five or six hours every day

971
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
The purpose of coming to this world

972
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Is to sing

973
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,900
Only this thing has ever been

974
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,900
So I think music is my choice

975
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,900
My music is unique

976
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,900
As long as I speak

977
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,900
I will be here

978
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Come on

979
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Come on

980
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
I'm a little nervous now

981
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
But I want to cheer for myself

982
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
And then take a deep breath

983
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
Sing well

984
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,900
Talk more

985
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,900
Feel the mood

986
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
I saw her many times

987
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
She is great

988
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,900
All the scenery has changed

989
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,900
Don't worry about me

990
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,900
I've forgotten you long ago

991
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,900
Time is not a problem

992
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
I will remember you

993
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
I will remember you

994
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,900
I will remember you

995
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
I will remember you

996
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
It's not too long

997
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,900
I've never put my heart into it

998
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,900
The promise you said has long been unfulfilled

999
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,900
The past is my time

1000
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,900
It's not hard to forget

1001
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,900
What will you do if you are gone?

1002
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
Wait for the next one

1003
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,900
To be strong for me

1004
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
Wait for the next one

1005
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
To be with you

1006
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,900
The place we once said we would go

1007
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
It's the same as the past

1008
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,900
Will we be in a panic?

1009
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,900
I remember the way we were

1010
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,900
We were a little bit like strangers

1011
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,900
You wanted to make each other go

1012
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,900
It's okay, I'm very desperate

1013
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,900
I've never put my heart into it

1014
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:22,900
The promise you said has long been unfulfilled

1015
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,900
The past is my time

1016
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,900
It's not hard to forget

1017
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,900
What will you do if you are gone?

1018
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,900
Wait for the next one

1019
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
To be strong for me

1020
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,900
Wait for the next one

1021
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,900
To be with you

1022
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,900
The place we once said we would go

1023
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,900
It's the same as the past

1024
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,900
Will we be in a panic?

1025
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,900
I remember the way we were

1026
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,900
The place we once said we would go

1027
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,900
It's the same as the past

1028
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Will we be in a panic?

1029
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,900
Wait for the next one

1030
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,900
To be strong for me

1031
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,900
Wait for the next one

1032
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
To be strong for me

1033
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,900
Wait for the next one

1034
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
To be with you

1035
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,900
The place we once said we would go

1036
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,900
It's the same as the past

1037
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,900
Will we be in a panic?

1038
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
Wait for the next one

1039
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,900
Will we be in a panic?

1040
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:16,900
Will we be in a panic?

1041
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,900
Ma Wan

1042
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,900
The broadcast is � conjugated

1043
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Ma Wan

1044
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
I was really surprised.

1045
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,580
The song that I sang

1046
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,180
was

1047
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,980
The Moon of the Routine.

1048
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,780
The Moon of the Routine.

1049
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,140
Hello, everyone.

1050
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,820
I'm Aisin Juelome.

1051
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,580
I'm 24 years old.

1052
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,660
I'm a Chinese singer.

1053
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,220
I want to say

1054
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,260
your performance just now

1055
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,780
is as strong as your performance.

1056
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,980
Thank you.

1057
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,900
I have only one word

1058
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,580
for you on this stage.

1059
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,180
This is the performance

1060
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,620
I like the most tonight.

1061
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,100
So high.

1062
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,500
Thank you, teacher.

1063
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,620
Thank you.

1064
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,740
I think she has

1065
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,020
a unique charm.

1066
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,380
Especially on the words.

1067
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,220
This is not a feature

1068
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,460
that all singers can catch.

1069
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,820
Thank you.

1070
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,580
Your tone is so unique.

1071
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,620
You know, that attitude that you have

1072
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,740
is so natural to you.

1073
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,940
You can feel that.

1074
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,780
Because I think it's such an amazing power

1075
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,300
that you can play with.

1076
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,340
For me, the biggest thing that I would say

1077
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,580
is wear something that you can move in.

1078
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,980
Ditch the heels.

1079
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,740
I don't often wear dresses when I perform.

1080
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,420
But if I do, they have to be stretchy.

1081
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,580
I need to be able to move.

1082
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,260
I like to have something.

1083
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,060
I can throw around,

1084
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,540
including a hand warmer

1085
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,380
that looks like a giant teabag.

1086
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,860
That would have elevated your performance

1087
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,060
because it felt like you were stuck.

1088
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,340
You know, but you're great.

1089
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:12,940
Thank you.

1090
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,660
Actually, I am the idol of Jessie J.

1091
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,820
When I was 12,

1092
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,820
I watched the first concert.

1093
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,580
I watched Jessie J's concert in Beijing.

1094
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,700
I really, really, really like her.

1095
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,900
I also really appreciate this opportunity

1096
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,900
to see her.

1097
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,220
Can I give you a hug?

1098
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,780
Yes.

1099
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,700
Oh, my God.

1100
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,980
Hi.

1101
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,380
You're actually so cold.

1102
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,500
Thank you so much.

1103
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,220
You're so good.

1104
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:45,820
Seriously.

1105
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,660
I hate mine so much.

1106
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,780
I hate so much respect for you.

1107
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,940
It means so much.

1108
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,900
But we're the same.

1109
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,820
Being a woman as well.

1110
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,820
You're so sweet.

1111
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,180
I can't believe that you were 12

1112
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:53,780
and you came to see me.

1113
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,500
That makes me feel so old.

1114
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,540
My first concert ever

1115
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,220
and I watched you Coco two nights in a row

1116
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,380
when you did the acoustic set.

1117
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,380
This is real.

1118
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:00,980
This is fake.

1119
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,580
Can I dream about it?

1120
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,740
She said I

1121
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,620
must be a strong woman.

1122
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,060
Yes.

1123
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,700
She said that to me.

1124
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,980
Okay, enjoy your moment.

1125
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,340
Do you have anything to say

1126
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,900
to the singer who will challenge you right away?

1127
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,140
Come on, challenge.

1128
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:21,980
You can do it.

1129
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,180
Okay.

1130
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,500
Do you have anything to say to the singer who will challenge you right away?

1131
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,260
Okay.

1132
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,580
The battle starts now.

1133
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,580
I want to cheer for Sun Boy.

1134
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,620
I'm so happy.

1135
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,020
I'm sorry.

1136
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,260
I thought I could fight with Ami.

1137
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:59,100
I thought I could win her.

1138
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,020
So I'm very confident.

1139
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,140
I will make everyone know me.

1140
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:55,060
事ある像

1141
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,900
Palace for the 쌘戀

1142
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,620
I think she must have won.

1143
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,700
But when Flour came up,

1144
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,540
did she say...

1145
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,740
She was very, very strong.

1146
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,300
She might be the most afraid

1147
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,620
to meet that kind of singer in my heart.

1148
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,540
Flour.

1149
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,220
My first priority, alright.

1150
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,660
In my future,

1151
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,220
I don't know where to put you.

1152
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,820
I love you, love you, love you.

1153
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:11,020
Honestly, I think it's better to love you.

1154
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:17,220
Let's get married now.

1155
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:22,420
Why do you have to wait for me to love you? Baby please.

1156
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,460
This good night,

1157
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,020
and the happiness of mothers

1158
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:30,680
症犀夫 扂要也要

1159
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,400
离开 豁指

1160
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,940
Closing the eyes

1161
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,180
and mind

1162
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,380
This good night

1163
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,260
So clean, how well you work here

1164
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,580
I can let you be my first pie

1165
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:58,980
Oh, really, what can I do?

1166
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:02,220
I don't want to be a bad person

1167
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,260
I don't know if you understand

1168
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,220
I don't want to hurt you

1169
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,340
I want to be your partner

1170
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,380
I don't want to waste my time

1171
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,380
I can't be your partner

1172
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,380
I can let you be my first pie

1173
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:32,380
Oh, really, what can I do?

1174
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:36,380
I don't want to waste my time

1175
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:41,380
I can't be your partner, baby

1176
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,380
I can let you be my first pie

1177
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:53,380
Oh, really, what can I do?

1178
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,380
I don't want to waste my time

1179
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,380
I don't want to waste my time

1180
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:14,380
I can't be your partner, baby

1181
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,380
Hello

1182
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,380
Hello, my name is Flower Fan

1183
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,380
Hello, my name is Flower

1184
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,380
I love you, I love you all

1185
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,380
Welcome

1186
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:56,380
For Flower, I saw Liang Ying has a bit of a painful face

1187
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,380
We didn't vote for this part, right?

1188
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,380
Impossible

1189
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,380
Hello

1190
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,380
Are you so cold right now?

1191
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,380
Do you want this?

1192
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,380
I'm giving up my blanket

1193
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,380
Please let it fall

1194
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,380
I want you to take me with you

1195
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,380
I've been singing since I was young

1196
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,380
I've been in the cold and I've been in the dark

1197
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,380
I've been through so much

1198
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,380
It's the first time

1199
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:28,380
I've been in the cold and I've been in the dark

1200
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,380
When I was your age

1201
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:34,380
I used to do a lot on stage

1202
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,380
I want to show everything I had

1203
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,380
And sometimes it's not always needed

1204
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,380
It's like a firework display

1205
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,380
You want to do a little

1206
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,380
And then a

1207
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,380
But you would just

1208
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,380
Which is good

1209
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,380
But you have to have light and shade

1210
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,380
But tonally and ability

1211
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,380
You are so talented

1212
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,380
So I say it from a place of love and support

1213
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,380
I think it's fair for a singer to sing it

1214
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,380
To be honest and help you grow

1215
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,380
You know

1216
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,380
I love you

1217
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,380
I love you too

1218
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,380
I think the performance of Hua Hua

1219
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,380
And the whole song

1220
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,380
It's a very mature skill

1221
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,380
If I really

1222
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,380
I have to pick the bone in the egg

1223
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,380
If I'm not good at it

1224
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,380
I think this song

1225
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,380
There are some too many

1226
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,380
The doubt of the performance

1227
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,380
The成分

1228
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,380
But I think

1229
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,380
This part is still in the acceptance

1230
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,380
It's a very good performance

1231
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,380
Right

1232
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,380
Now

1233
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,380
Please welcome Aixin

1234
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,380
The girl who is in love

1235
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,380
Back to the stage

1236
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,380
Amazing

1237
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,380
Both are 24 years old girls

1238
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,380
How do you feel to meet the chef

1239
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,380
Feel

1240
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,380
She is beautiful

1241
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,380
Just right

1242
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,380
Because it's really singing

1243
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,380
Very very very good

1244
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,380
Then between girls and girls

1245
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Do you want to play the game together

1246
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,380
So I think it's really singing

1247
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,380
Very very good

1248
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,380
I don't know but

1249
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,380
I want to say thank you

1250
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,380
I want to say thank you

1251
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,380
OK

1252
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,380
Please come from the online

1253
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,380
The judges

1254
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,380
Make a vote

1255
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,380
Then please

1256
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,380
The three of us

1257
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,380
The teacher at the scene

1258
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,380
Aze

1259
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,380
I choose Mei

1260
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,380
Thank you

1261
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,380
Thank you teacher

1262
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,380
Thank you teacher

1263
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,380
Liangying

1264
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,380
Your choice is

1265
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,380
Aixin

1266
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,380
The girl who is in love

1267
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,380
Thank you teacher Zhang Liangying

1268
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,380
Thank you

1269
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,380
So I too

1270
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,380
Have gone with Jasmine

1271
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,380
Thank you teacher

1272
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,380
Thank you so much

1273
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,380
I find this really difficult

1274
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,380
As a woman myself

1275
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,380
And two young men

1276
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,380
Are both incredible

1277
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,380
I don't think it's a matter of

1278
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,380
Who is better

1279
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,380
I just think that

1280
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,380
In this moment tonight

1281
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,380
I think your performance

1282
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,380
Felt more rounded

1283
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,380
But I think you're amazing

1284
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,380
I really do

1285
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,380
I think you have incredible attributes

1286
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,380
That you can work with

1287
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,380
Really do

1288
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,380
Let's immediately pay attention

1289
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,380
From 21

1290
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,380
The voting result of the online judges

1291
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,380
The entire green hole

1292
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,380
Will be more powerful

1293
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,380
This time

1294
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,380
I got it from Mr. Luo Mei

1295
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,380
The unique way of singing

1296
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,380
Very fresh

1297
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,380
I heard it

1298
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,380
I was involved in the world of nature and her

1299
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,380
Aixin's choice is beautiful

1300
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,380
Whether it's in the voice

1301
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,380
Or in the overall

1302
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,380
I think it's more attractive

1303
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,380
Until now

1304
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,380
I think Mei's performance is

1305
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,380
The best I've heard tonight

1306
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,380
The final voting result is

1307
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,380
The final result is

1308
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,380
Aixin won 17 votes

1309
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,380
Hua Hua won 7 votes

1310
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,380
Congratulations to Aixin

1311
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,380
And Mei

1312
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,380
Youanga

1313
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,380
It is good

1314
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,380
His voice is like music

1315
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,380
You can use that

1316
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,380
Yes

1317
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
My voice is like a mulled competition

1318
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,380
I must say everyone

1319
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,380
Way more artistic

1320
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,380
People quilt that

1321
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,260
I'm lost.

1322
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,060
I'm lost.

1323
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,260
I'm lost.

1324
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,140
Sorry.

1325
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,940
Sorry.

1326
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,460
It is so great.

1327
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:51,900
No, it actually looks perfect.

1328
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,540
It's not bad.

1329
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,740
It's not bad.

1330
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,300
It's not bad.

1331
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,660
It's not bad.

1332
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,580
Newlyweds are winning this round.

1333
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,380
2 to 1.

1334
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,340
They are leading again.

1335
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,260
Cheers.

1336
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,060
Cheers.

1337
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:13,980
No one is picking up.

1338
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,940
Sister just left.

1339
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,460
I wanted to teach you.

1340
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,260
Why are you going?

1341
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,780
Stop.

1342
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,860
Wu Yuan, the instructor is here.

1343
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,860
Sister, you are here too.

1344
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:39,660
You are here too.

1345
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,020
The show is on.

1346
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:43,980
The show is on.

1347
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,860
The show is on.

1348
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,060
The show is on.

1349
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,700
The show is on.

1350
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:51,980
The show is on.

1351
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:52,780
The show is on.

1352
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,500
Welcome the next new singer.

1353
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,300
Because we are challenged.

1354
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,980
Yes, we are countered.

1355
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,140
Yes, so we chose

1356
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,300
to be more passive.

1357
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,900
I am too stressed.

1358
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:14,540
So nervous.

1359
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,060
Because the previous foreign singers

1360
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,340
were so aggressive.

1361
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,340
I think we can go up.

1362
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,420
But we can wait a little longer.

1363
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,100
Don't be nervous.

1364
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,380
Don't be nervous.

1365
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:28,780
OK?

1366
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,060
Be strong.

1367
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,740
Brother, how about me?

1368
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,860
OK, you go.

1369
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,540
Just do it.

1370
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,180
Come on.

1371
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,180
The old building in Ke Lou

1372
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,940
is so sweet.

1373
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,940
It's the famous Huachiao.

1374
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,060
The local singer

1375
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,580
has a long history

1376
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,180
in ancient and Chinese music.

1377
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,940
He pursue the culture of the country.

1378
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,620
The story of the country.

1379
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,980
Hello, everyone.

1380
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,180
I am Ke Lou.

1381
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,140
I am 22 years old.

1382
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,980
I am from Qingtian, Zhejiang.

1383
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,900
I have been on the boat.

1384
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,780
So excited.

1385
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,220
Look, my friends.

1386
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,900
This is my room.

1387
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,220
It feels so retro.

1388
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,900
Do you like it?

1389
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,100
Welcome all the new friends in the show.

1390
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,460
Long time no see.

1391
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,780
I am from Qingtian.

1392
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,780
The fan number on my social media

1393
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,540
is about more than 3 million.

1394
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,820
I am also from

1395
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,940
the number of fans

1396
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,180
and gradually accumulated.

1397
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,580
Zhihua Jia.

1398
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,460
My god.

1399
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,620
Zhihua Jia.

1400
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,820
Oh my god.

1401
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,540
My music

1402
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,500
is the highest light time.

1403
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,860
At the same time,

1404
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,820
more than 20 people

1405
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,260
listen to my song first.

1406
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,380
My fans say

1407
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,460
I am the most famous Chinese singer

1408
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,740
and the top singer of the country.

1409
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,220
I see Ke Lou.

1410
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,820
But my real dream

1411
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,860
is to become a singer like

1412
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,540
Shan Yichun.

1413
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,980
A popular singer.

1414
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,700
So this time,

1415
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,220
I am here in the sea.

1416
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,220
I think I am a little nervous.

1417
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,380
But our cruise team is a team.

1418
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,740
So I must win this round.

1419
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,620
Beautiful.

1420
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,500
Beautiful.

1421
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,180
Is this the first time?

1422
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,140
I have seen her.

1423
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,940
Really?

1424
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,660
Yes.

1425
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,540
Wow.

1426
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,580
So pretty.

1427
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,740
So cute.

1428
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,460
The first woman's feeling

1429
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,460
I'm not afraid of the wind

1430
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1431
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1432
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1433
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1434
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1435
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1436
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1437
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1438
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1439
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1440
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1441
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1442
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1443
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,460
I'm afraid of the wind

1444
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:12,760
Youそんな

1445
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,760
Dirty

1446
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,260
Injured

1447
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:17,960
Suffered

1448
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,300
Joy

1449
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,340
Slender

1450
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,380
My

1451
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,380
rival

1452
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:26,660
Troubles

1453
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,960
For you

1454
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,740
For you

1455
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,840
จ causes

1456
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,640
Dream

1457
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:37,700
Insignificant

1458
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,700
I will always be with you

1459
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:47,700
I will always be with you

1460
01:17:52,700 --> 01:18:00,700
Don't listen to the sound of the bell

1461
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,700
The End

1462
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,700
Thank you

1463
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,700
You are so nice

1464
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,700
Maybe Klaan

1465
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,700
Yes, it was perfect

1466
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,700
I thought that Klaan's performance

1467
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,700
sang perfectly

1468
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,700
I was so stunned by her voice

1469
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,700
She also looked like

1470
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,700
watching a princess performing

1471
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,700
Thank you, Ke Le's performance

1472
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,700
Welcome to

1473
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,700
Jia Luo Bao's new stage

1474
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,700
Thank you

1475
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,700
Thank you

1476
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:33,700
Thank you

1477
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,700
Hello, everyone

1478
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,700
My name is Ke Le

1479
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,700
I am 22 years old

1480
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
I am from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province

1481
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,700
So funny

1482
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,700
Is it your first time singing on the boat

1483
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,700
in the sea?

1484
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,700
Yes, it's my first time

1485
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,700
singing so far away

1486
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,700
Where did you originally sing?

1487
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,700
I originally sang on the balcony

1488
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,700
I played the live broadcast of the social media

1489
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:01,700
and I liked to sing

1490
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,700
It's quite different

1491
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,700
I thought that

1492
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,700
It's so casual

1493
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
It's so natural

1494
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,700
Do you want to try

1495
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,700
playing the music on the balcony?

1496
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,700
It's very comfortable

1497
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,700
I can lie on the bed

1498
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,700
Thank you

1499
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,700
I just want you to relax

1500
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,700
Thank you

1501
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,700
Because you usually play the social media

1502
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,700
I think your personality

1503
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,700
should not be

1504
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,700
a child with such a deep personality

1505
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,700
Maybe we should share the river

1506
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,700
So cute

1507
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,700
For me, what I enjoyed about your performance

1508
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,700
there was such a beautiful combination

1509
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,700
of tradition and Disney

1510
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,700
It felt like you're a Disney character

1511
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,700
Like a hug

1512
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,700
It felt warm and inviting and safe

1513
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,700
There's always room for improvement

1514
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,700
with technique and breathing

1515
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,700
I don't really feel like that

1516
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,700
needs to be focused on

1517
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,700
I think that

1518
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,700
you just need to really delve into

1519
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,700
your signature energy and performance on stage

1520
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,700
I think that will really help you excel

1521
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,700
Thank you so much

1522
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,700
Right now, in the new battle room

1523
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,700
the singers who want to challenge you

1524
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,700
Do you have anything you want to say?

1525
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,700
You're coming

1526
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,700
OK

1527
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,700
You pretend that we're not here

1528
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,700
We're not all here

1529
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,700
I actually don't have much to say

1530
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,700
OK

1531
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,700
Come over here

1532
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,700

1533
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,700
That was the cutest way to

1534
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,700
Yes, you should too

1535
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,700

Why did you change the word?

1537
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,700
It was you who came over

1538
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,700
But I think

1539
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,700
we should be more careful

1540
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,700
so we don't have to be with you

1541
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,700
It was a nice sound

1542
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,700
Next, let's give him a candy

1543
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,700

1544
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,700

01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,700

1554
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,700

01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,700
like a warrior

1558
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,700

1568
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,700
Six years ago

1569
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,700
I studied in China

1570
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,700
This industrial university

1571
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,700
I found out that

1572
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,700
Chinese people are so kind

1573
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,700
like a pure hearted

1574
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,700
Chinese people

1575
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,700
