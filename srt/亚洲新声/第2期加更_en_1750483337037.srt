Hello, good morning

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can see that

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There is a combination of bitter melon and egg

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
on our table

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are three different ways

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Before that

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can taste it

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and see how it tastes

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So good

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

What the real set up is?

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
This?

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,240
This.

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,920
This is...

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,600
Wait.

45
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,760
Is it because I saw

46
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
the fish-shaped fish on the top?

47
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
This is a foul.

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,760
It has Japanese tofu.

49
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,000
It has Japanese tofu.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Yes.

51
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,680
It has Japanese tofu.

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,160
OK.

53
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,040
I want to ask

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
Mr. Gong Teng,

55
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
do you know

56
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
the special way

57
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,440
of being a god?

58
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,840
Yes.

59
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
But when you enter the park,

60
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
it feels like you're in Okinawa.

61
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,240
Do you have

62
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,880
any experience

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
of being a god?

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Yes.

65
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Yes.

66
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Who would like to share

67
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,760
the special experience

68
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,840
of being a god?

69
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
I'll do it.

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,480
OK.

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,600
But I was in the park

72
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
before I got out of the park.

73
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,200
When I was still studying,

74
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
I went out to get a living

75
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,600
and make money.

76
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
And I was on the grass field

77
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
outside the park.

78
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,600
And we were in the rain that day.

79
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
They asked me

80
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,420
if there was a very simple

81
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,000
pot in the field.

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
And the pot

83
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,600
was not able to stand on its own.

84
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,440
So we had two musicians on the stage.

85
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,240
The three of us stood on the pot

86
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,360
and held our heads

87
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
on the top of the lotus.

88
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Only if we stood there,

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,400
the pot wouldn't fall.

90
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,080
So we kept holding our heads there.

91
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,400
So we held the whole field.

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Yes.

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
We were assistant.

94
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
We were assistant.

95
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,400
We were holding our heads on the top of the lotus.

96
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
And we finished singing.

97
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
But we still have a little time left.

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
It's live.

99
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,760
I was still working in the cultural community.

100
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,040
We had a summer vacation.

101
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,640
We went to some very townships.

102
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,920
We performed in some places.

103
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
And I remember very deeply

104
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
that one night,

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
many old people were sitting there.

106
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
And we would take a break earlier.

107
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,640
I remember that once we performed,

108
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
only a few old people and a dog

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
watched our full-length performance.

110
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,520
Yes.

111
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
So only a few old people and a dog

112
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,440
watched our full-length performance.

113
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
After watching our full-length performance.

114
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
It was very impressive.

115
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,760
I often perform outside the show.

116
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,560
And then one time,

117
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,400
I was wearing our Han clothes.

118
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,720
And I was walking along the street

119
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
in the middle of the city.

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
And there were many people coming.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,120
And I prepared many Chinese gifts.

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360
Like a bear cat.

123
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
Or a special color.

124
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
So cute.

125
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,200
And I gave them to the people on the street.

126
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,240
And they would show up in my live broadcast.

127
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,400
And teach them Chinese.

128
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
And I think it's meaningful.

129
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,240
Because it can show

130
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,280
some Chinese culture and songs in our show.

131
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
I sang all Chinese songs.

132
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,880
And some songs including

133
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
some musical elements are in there.

134
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,800
Great.

135
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,920
Mr. Gong Teng Jin Xiang

136
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,280
also prepared some gifts for us.

137
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,680
Right?

138
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Yes.

139
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,840
Wow.

140
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you.

141
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Thank you.

142
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Black-and-white.

143
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
Black-and-white special gift.

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,520
Thank you.

145
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,720
This is my favorite company in Okinawa.

146
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
There is nothing like

147
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,600
water rain or something like that.

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,920
It's a pure water.

149
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
There are a lot of minerals.

150
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
It's good for your body.

151
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,680
And you need a lot of energy from now on.

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
So I hope you can try your best.

153
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
Wow.

154
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Thank you.

155
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,160
Thank you.

156
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Thank you.

157
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,400
How is it?

158
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
I'll give it to you.

159
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
Thank you.

160
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,480
Is it okay?

161
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,200
It's okay.

162
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Here you go.

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
Thank you.

164
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Thank you.

165
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Thank you.

166
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,840
Thank you for the gift.

167
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

168
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
Thank you.

169
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
Thank you.

170
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Thank you.

171
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Okay.

172
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
The students, it's getting late.

173
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
We are going to the scene now.

174
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
Before we go,

175
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,440
do you want to take a rest?

176
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you.

177
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's go.

178
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Wow.

179
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,400
Let's go to the snake park.

180
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,160
It's so cool.

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
It's like a snake.

182
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,400
It's inside.

183
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
Oh my god.

184
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
I saw it.

185
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
So big.

186
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I saw it.

187
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
So big.

188
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
So big.

189
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
So big.

190
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,720
Wait.

191
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
No, I'm with you.

192
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Protect me.

193
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Oh my god.

194
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Oh my god.

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
It's so dirty.

196
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
No.

197
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Oh my god.

198
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
Oh my god.

199
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
It's still very dirty.

200
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Ready, go.

201
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Go.

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
So heavy.

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
It's like a lotus tree.

204
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
A lotus tree?

205
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Oh my god.

206
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I can't believe it.

207
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
It's so smooth.

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Come on.

209
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
One.

210
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Come on.

211
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay.

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Wow.

213
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
So funny.

214
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Wow.

215
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
So funny.

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
So funny.

217
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
So funny.

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
You have to give him a magic card.

219
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
It's a rare chance.

220
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll give you a chance.

221
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
It's a chance.

222
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I'll give you a chance.

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'll give you a chance.

224
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm scared.

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm scared.

226
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I can't even look at it.

227
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Yeah.

228
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I've been touching snakes for 10 years.

229
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm so lucky.

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
You can do it.

231
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
So weird.

232
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Let them touch it.

233
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I've been touching it for 10 years.

234
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
No.

235
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
You really can't try it.

236
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
You can try it.

237
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
No.

238
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I'll give up.

239
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I'll give up.

240
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm so lucky.

241
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Amusa.

242
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Amusa.

243
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Give it to me.

244
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Come on.

245
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
No.

246
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Come on.

247
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
No.

248
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
No.

249
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Come on.

250
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
No.

251
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
No.

252
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
No.

253
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
No.

254
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
No.

255
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
No.

256
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm so lucky.

257
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm so lucky.

258
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm so lucky.

259
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
No.

260
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
No.

261
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
No.

262
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
I really can't do it.

263
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Come on.

264
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Come on.

265
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Come on.

266
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Okay.

267
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Okay, students.

268
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Let's continue to walk down the road.

269
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Okay.

270
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Bye.

271
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Bye.

272
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Okay, students.

273
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Let's set up the stage.

274
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Okay.

275
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Let's go.

276
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
I can't reach it.

277
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll try it.

278
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
I'll try it.

279
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Try it.

280
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Try it.

281
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Try it.

282
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay.

283
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
It's still Pan Hong's height.

284
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
It's all butterfly wings.

285
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
It's still easy to remove.

286
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Our memory is so small.

287
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm afraid I can't reach it.

288
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
What should I do?

289
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I'll do it.

290
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
You do it.

291
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
You have to remove the top two fingers.

292
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Okay.

293
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
You have to put this in one side.

294
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
You have to fold it.

295
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Fold it in one side.

296
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Is this okay?

297
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
I think it's okay.

298
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Come here.

299
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Okay.

300
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Fold it in one side.

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Okay.

302
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Let's take a look.

303
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Mr. Liang has come to the stage.

304
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
How about the rehearsal?

305
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
How is it?

306
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Are you here to do the assessment?

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Yes, I'm here to check the performance.

308
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Let's take a look at the song.

309
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
The Flower Star.

310
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Go.

311
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Go.

312
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Okay.

313
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Please look at it.

314
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll look for a position.

315
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I'll look for a position.

316
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Please add a line.

317
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Thank you.

318
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
She's so cute.

319
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Come here.

320
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
It's so special to sing in this environment.

321
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Yes, it's so close.

322
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
I think

323
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
we should add

324
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
the little sister

325
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
who just did the three-string dance.

326
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Is it okay?

327
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Joy.

328
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Thank you.

329
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Thank you.

330
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Thank you.

331
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Thank you.

332
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Thank you.

333
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Thank you.

334
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Let's officially start.

335
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Sing well.

336
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Sing well.

337
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
The sound is very good.

338
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Yes.

339
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Sing well.

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Sing well.

341
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Sing well.

342
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Sing well.

343
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
So hungry.

344
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Let's go.

345
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
It looks good.

346
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Do you want to eat?

347
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Yes.

348
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,040
Wow, look at that.

349
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,420
Also good.

350
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,900
Feel so good spray.

351
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,760
Let's eat.

352
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
Please eat.

353
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,760
For this whole life.

354
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,640
Here is only one meal a night.

355
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,760
What will you eat?

356
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,280
instant noodles.

357
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,460
You like instant noodles?

358
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,720
Yes.

359
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,360
I want hot pot to be popular.

360
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,040
400 for 4 days?

361
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,360
You eat hot pot since you were a kid?

362
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,620
You're not boils conception.

363
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,740
It's like you can't stand the feeling of eating the hot pot.

364
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,220
Really?

365
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,740
No one can eat the hot pot.

366
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,220
So last time we ate the hot pot together,

367
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,100
did you feel bad about the hot pot?

368
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,500
No.

369
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,380
What's the word you eat the hot pot for?

370
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,220
Hot pot.

371
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,020
There are three different ways to eat hot pot.

372
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,420
The first one is the hot pot.

373
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
The second one is the sausage.

374
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,460
The third one is the empress.

375
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,660
The first time I ate the hot pot.

376
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,540
Really?

377
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,260
Yes.

378
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,100
The first time I ate the hot pot,

379
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,620
they gave me some and I didn't dare to eat it.

380
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,780
I closed my eyes and ate it.

381
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,140
How is the taste?

382
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,100
It's not good.

383
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,220
It's not good.

384
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,780
It's not good.

385
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,020
I feel like it's like eating a mother's cloth.

386
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,700
Right?

387
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,100
Do you like to film?

388
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,220
I like to film.

389
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,100
You can film too.

390
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,820
Film.

391
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,060
Actually, I often film when I was young.

392
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,860
What's the word?

393
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,220
I like to film when I cook outside.

394
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,660
Really?

395
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,620
Is that the word?

396
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,420
Yes.

397
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,900
I think it's a little bit awkward to film outside.

398
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,860
Yes, it's not convenient.

399
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,500
No.

400
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,660
It's just that it's not convenient.

401
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,500
The word is the word.

402
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
You mean the word?

403
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,740
When I was young,

404
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,820
I always found the word.

405
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
I made a pot myself.

406
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,740
I made a pot myself.

407
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,420
I made a pot myself.

408
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,260
You must make a pot yourself.

409
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,460
I must make a pot myself.

410
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,620
And the rice noodles.

411
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,220
The rice noodles are in the stove.

412
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
No rice noodles.

413
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,340
Right.

414
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,140
It's your own life.

415
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,460
Where is the rice noodles?

416
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,220
That one.

417
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
You just cut the wood.

418
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,860
Yes, cut the wood.

419
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,780
Really.

420
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,140
You cook by yourself.

421
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,180
I cook by myself.

422
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,740
I cook by myself.

423
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,460
I thought...

424
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
I thought it was like this.

425
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,180
You guys try it.

426
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,340
You can use the fire chicken.

427
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,940
It's not like...

428
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,580
You just come here.

429
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,260
You use the fire chicken.

430
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,060
If so,

431
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,780
it's called the wild ball.

432
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,540
Frident,

433
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
so cool.

434
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
How about you,

435
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,340
Tiaー.

436
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,980
Let's see what you've got there.

437
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,940
I use schlimmdc,

438
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,900
Lem pillow Rab configuration

439
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,740
I was doing that in Beijing,

440
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,940
or whether we met us in Beijing one day.

441
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,620
Yes.

442
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,460
So,

443
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,660
Her expression and emotions are very important.

444
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,380
It's just a small joke.

445
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,900
The main thing is that the part on the rhythm

446
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,820
is too exciting.

447
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,020
I thought there was a little bit of a fast part.

448
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,340
The other parts are very good.

449
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,180
But I think the state of her performance

450
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,620
is enough to remove the small details of her.

451
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,900
Yes, it's also a great performance.

452
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,700
The shadow is so lovely

453
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,300
It's a dream

454
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,300
When Wang Hao comes up,

455
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,700
I think how he can

456
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,540
sing in a positive way

457
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,860
and be able to stand up to such a small boy

458
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,420
But he's also a bit steady today

459
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,540
to complete his song.

460
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,020
Call her

461
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,020
The tension that spreads before the rain

462
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,020
I can't say it for the two of us

463
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,020
The decision to have something similar is very difficult

464
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,020
It was very difficult for both of you to hear it

465
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,020
The part between Mi Yona and Yang Renze

466
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,020
I and the most entangled group of Mr. Jin Xia

467
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Yang Renze has improved a lot

468
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Compared to the last time, his voice is very beautiful

469
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,020
But today he really touched Mi Yona

470
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
There is no way

471
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Mi Yona is really too strong

472
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Where are you going?

473
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Yu Wei and Mei

474
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Both songs are good

475
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,020
But both are very difficult to sing together

476
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:01,020
I think it will change depending on the song you have chosen

477
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:08,020
But both are very fun to sing together

478
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Mei is still very good

479
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,020
I still like her performance today

480
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:20,020
The way she sings and the way she sings

481
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,020
I still think she is very good

482
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I like the confidence in her music

483
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
The details of her singing

484
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,020
When she sings, you can feel the pride in her heart

485
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Very good

486
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,020
I think she has confidence

487
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
I said it on the stage

488
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:07,020
But if she has a lot of chorus, she can add some color to the chorus

489
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,020
She can sing a little bit more

490
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
She can sing and change

491
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,020
But I think she is also a part of other people

492
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,020
There is no one to猜

493
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
The lyrics should be relaxed a little

494
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Or maybe it's not a most Sny abide

495
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I want to see how she can play in a relaxed and subscribingki

496
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,020
She knows what she likes

497
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,020
She is not really independent

498
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,020
She can sing in a comfortable mood

499
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
It was very good today

500
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,020
I've made a lot of progress today

501
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:42,880
What I like most about it is that the performance is very important

502
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,680
The performance is like

503
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,960
a performance

504
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
or a way of staging

505
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,680
It's very similar to

506
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,760
the way of attracting people who are watching

507
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,960
I really can't find her

508
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,680
because of the front

509
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
I haven't found her for a long time

510
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,480
I haven't found her for a long time

511
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,160
Then I saw that

512
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,040
I almost sang a little part

513
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
It's the second time

514
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
I found the pocket

515
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
She didn't put it in

516
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,880
She saw my anxious

517
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
I asked her what she wanted to do

518
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,960
She said she really wanted to find the pocket

519
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,560
The first time I saw her

520
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,280
Miuna

521
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
When Miuna was in the first place

522
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,840
and she was in the first place with the winner

523
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,800
At that stage

524
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
when she was in the first place with Amisha

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,400
At first, she sang a song on the rock

526
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,120
like a song on the rock

527
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
And when she was in the first place with the winner

528
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,920
She sang a slow song

529
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,320
I think she knew herself

530
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,760
It's great

531
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
So beautiful

532
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,040
So good

533
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,760
This is my life

534
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,280
The sun is falling

535
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,960
The waves are blowing

536
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,360
The end of the ordinary

537
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
What's this?

538
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,560
It's a joke

539
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,960
My shoes are jumping

540
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Have a look

541
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,200
It's so nice

542
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,040
Love in the heart

543
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,200
What

544
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,320
Why there is so��house?

545
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
If we should take a look at it

546
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,520
it means so

547
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,600
It's so nice

548
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,700
Yummy

549
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,320
Second place

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,900
This is really good

551
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,020
Super good

552
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
You two you are so pushing

553
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,000
We are очень

554
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,180
大家

555
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,360
Well done

556
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,580
You two

557
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,160
Next

558
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,520
Feel so strong

559
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,160
I can't stand what you are doing

560
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
The talented girl of Thailand, Fu Le Hua

561
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
The hottest girl in Thailand, the singer and the singer

562
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Feng Si Te, the famous boy group of Thailand

563
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
We've prepared ourselves for you

564
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
We're ready

565
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Come on

566
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Whether it's the details or the performance

567
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,160
It's great to bring this to the audience

568
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Actually, the dance is very impressive

569
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,160
When you sing the first verse

570
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
In any technical and musical aspect

571
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
It's very unimaginable

572
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
And the performance is very good

573
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Congratulations

574
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Yang Run Ze's self-sacrifice

575
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Can it be successful?

576
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
We look forward to it
