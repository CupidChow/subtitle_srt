The first round of the game is over.

The second round of the game is over.

The first round of the game is over.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,740
The person with the沒有物 대 1961 is the first to escaped.

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,000
The first round of the game is over.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The person with theентов is the loser out.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The loser with the syphilis is the only att succeeds.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,580
The Composer knows Silver.

45
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,580
The person is most of the top 5 in the team.

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
I'm so tired of this

47
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm so tired of this

48
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Forget the happiness

49
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
I don't care

50
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I'm so good

51
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
I'm so good

52
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,580
I don't care

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,580
I want you to know

54
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,580
I can't sleep

55
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Beautiful dream

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
I'm so tired of this

57
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,580
I'm so tired of this

58
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm so tired of this

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm so tired of this

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm so good

61
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,580
I don't care

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm so good

63
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
my friend

64
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
at an early age

65
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,580
you have

66
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
a brother

67
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
never come in time

68
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,580
never come in time

69
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
never come in time

70
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,580
wow I want to show one more time

71
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I'm not a bad person

72
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,580
I want to see you in my heart

73
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,580
I'll be with you from now on

74
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,580
I'll be with you from now on

75
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,580
I'll be with you from now on

76
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,580
I'm not a bad person

77
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,580
I want to see you in my heart

78
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,580
I'll be with you from now on

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,580
I'll be with you from now on

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,580
I'll be with you from now on

81
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,580
I'll be with you from now on

82
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Anyway, it's you today

83
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,580
Thank you

84
00:04:43,580 --> 00:05:11,580
I think their performance can really feel their cuteness

85
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,580
I believe they are all very young

86
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
More than 24 years old

87
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,580
26 years old

88
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
26 years old

89
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Because I think they are mature

90
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:33,580
But I think they can really see the very youthful and passionate characteristics of Thai music from their songs

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,580
How much effort and effort they put into this song

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,580
I think they can follow their lyrics to the top of the stage

93
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,580
And the first word after their break

94
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
How much effort and effort they put into this song

95
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
It's like they are out of control

96
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,580
But they are not in a state of control

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
They are very active

98
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
So I really like this performance

99
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
Thank you

100
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:16,580
You just came out and you are like a beautiful mermaid

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Although this dress is really disturbing

102
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,580
But I think your performance is very transparent

103
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Your voice is also very good

104
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,580
But I think there are more different sides to the melody

105
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Thank you

106
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,580
I don't know how old you are

107
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
I want to know how old you are

108
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,580
I'm 24 years old

109
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,580
Your understanding of the song and the song you are singing is quite mature

110
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,580
But there is no extra part

111
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,580
The skill and skill points are all there

112
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
But they are not too much

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
They are very suitable

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Because Chinese songs are afraid of the sound and the sound

115
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,580
But the things you just added

116
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
I think they are all very suitable

117
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,580
Thank you

118
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,580
Sir, I'm just curious how old are you

119
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm 24 years old

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
She is also very young

121
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
So young

122
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,580
Just 24 years old

123
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
After she was born

124
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
She has a lot of skills and skills

125
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,580
I think every stage

126
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Is to take out these weapons

127
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
And practice on the stage

128
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Of course, how many of them are there

129
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
With your stage experience

130
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
Then you will slowly choose

131
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,580
When to take them out

132
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
When to take them back

133
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
This is the charm of the stage

134
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,580
The stage to share with everyone

135
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
An experience

136
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Then I want to say that I am 24 years old

137
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
And collect so many weapons

138
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
It's very difficult

139
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,580
So I still appreciate your performance

140
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,580
Thank you

141
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Actually, what I sing in the middle

142
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
Is the Chinese traditional culture

143
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,580
It's from the poem

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
From the song

145
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,580
The reason I chose this song

146
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Is because this song is special to me

147
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Because I have actually been involved

148
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
In the drama

149
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,580
But at that time I was still young

150
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,580
I don't understand the specific business in it

151
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,580
But I slowly grew up with it

152
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,580
I gradually found myself

153
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
I can understand

154
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,580
I also found the beauty in it

155
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
And chose this song

156
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Because I think this song

157
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Is integrated with the flow of music

158
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
With the elements of our traditional culture

159
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
This drama

160
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Let me want to

161
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Can sing on this stage

162
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
I think it will be more meaningful and more annoying

163
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
You are only 20 years old now

164
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Already

165
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
I think the song just now

166
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
There are many

167
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Some relative

168
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Some compared to the language

169
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
I have already sung very well

170
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
But you may have more

171
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Some more performance experience

172
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
The distance you made

173
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,580
The power of singing with you

174
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Can put that

175
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
A little bit

176
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Because when you sing

177
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
When you sing very lightly

178
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,580
We may have a little bit

179
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
I don't know

180
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Plus from

181
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Your big strength to the small strength

182
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
This range is very wide

183
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
So when you suddenly get it

184
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Maybe the teacher of the music

185
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Can't wait to follow you

186
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,580
To increase your volume

187
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
From this song

188
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
Can hear Yang Roon's voice

189
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,580
In fact, it is very

190
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,580
The range is also very

191
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
There is a explosive

192
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
It's a song like this

193
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,580
But I will be more confused

194
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Or I will hope to hear

195
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,580
If you continue to stay in this competition

196
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,580
What kind of music will you choose

197
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
Or say

198
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,580
You keep going until the end

199
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,580
When you want to choose

200
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Other types of music

201
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,580
There are more details

202
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
You need to go

203
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
More accurately to control and control

204
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
This part is some of my suggestions for you

205
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Thank you, teacher

206
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Thank you

207
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
In fact, this song

208
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
It's a high pitch

209
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
It sounds like

210
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
When it's too high

211
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
There will be a little bit of a burden

212
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
In fact, this kind of song

213
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Is an advice

214
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,580
You can set the key low

215
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Then you can even

216
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Can even design a higher place

217
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Give everyone one

218
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Or two

219
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
Where surprise

220
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Then other places

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Let it stay more

222
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
More space

223
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Give you

224
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
The emotions of lyrics

225
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Some small strength

226
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
This push

227
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I think it may be

228
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
For this song

229
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
It's an advice for me

230
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Thank you

231
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Today

232
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Just know the knife is small

233
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
In fact, if you have a chance

234
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
To hear other works of Pan Hong

235
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
I believe he can have more

236
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Let everyone

237
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
More explosive performance

238
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
I'm very looking forward to this

239
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Because it's not the first time

240
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
To hear him sing on the stage

241
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
Every time he gives me a feeling

242
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
It's just

243
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
He should be on the stage

244
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Thank you, teacher Liang Ying

245
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Welcome to your first seat

246
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm a man

247
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Man

248
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Wish you a good life

249
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Wish you a good life

250
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Wish you a good life

251
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Thank you so much

252
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,580
Okay

253
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
Thank you so much

254
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Now, let's play a game

255
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Now, you guys

256
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Find someone

257
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
You guys want to meet

258
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Only one

259
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
And then say why

260
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Then go to the director

261
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
I want to drink with you

262
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Director, thank you

263
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Then, brother Seol

264
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Who do you want to start first?

265
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
See whose eyes are hiding

266
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Whose eyes are locked

267
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Then

268
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
See who you want to start with

269
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
I can't see

270
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,580
I see someone hiding

271
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Who?

272
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Why are you hiding?

273
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Okay

274
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Welcome, KeLong

275
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
I want to drink with you

276
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
Actually, there are two friends

277
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
No, one

278
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
One

279
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm very tacit understanding

280
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Then I can only endure pain and love

281
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,580
I actually want to drink with

282
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Da Hai and Sasha

283
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Then

284
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Please make your choice

285
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Then I'll

286
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Then I'll go to you

287
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Okay

288
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Cheers

289
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
Because I'm a more introverted person

290
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
I'm not a good friend

291
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
But I think

292
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
The person who comes to me

293
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
Will

294
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,580
Will

295
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,580
Be with me

296
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
I feel very appreciate him

297
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
Yes

298
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
There is a lot of drinking

299
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
Welcome, Mei

300
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Everyone

301
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Amazing

302
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
So

303
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Pick one

304
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
Yes

305
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
He

306
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
A-Hoo

307
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
His voice is very surprised

308
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Thank you so much

309
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Thank you

310
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Thank you

311
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Next one

312
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Let's sing a song today

313
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,580
I really adore her

314
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
So perfect

315
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
I want to cheers

316
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
But

317
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,580
My religion is

318
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
We know that

319
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Thank you so much

320
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
You're my

321
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Inspire

322
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Good

323
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Very good

324
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
You're so good

325
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
You're good

326
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
You're good

327
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
You're good

328
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
You're good

329
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
That's like they're gonna fight

330
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
It seems like we don't need to translate

331
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
We're just talking

332
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
She's different from the stage

333
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Enjoy

334
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Enjoy, but you're too problem

335
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Danily

336
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,580
I would like to cheers you

337
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
Thank you

338
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
You guys are very easy

339
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Thank you

340
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Thank you

341
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Cheers

342
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Cheers

343
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Cheers

344
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Cheers

345
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
What's that?

346
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Look

347
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Look at his expression

348
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Brother Zhe

349
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
I have a part in this

350
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,580
You're so accurate

351
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,580
I'll give a toast to this man

352
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Thank you

353
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
All the pressure is here

354
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
Thank you

355
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Keep fighting

356
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Let's continue

357
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
It's your turn

358
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
It's your turn

359
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
Pick one

360
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Brother Fei

361
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
What?

362
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
We're the first to go on stage today

363
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,580
Oh, you're not the first?

364
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Yes

365
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
Open the door

366
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,580
Thank you

367
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Thank you for choosing me

368
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Next

369
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
Flower

370
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
We choose together

371
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
I'd like to say why

372
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Give us some reason

373
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Because she's so cute

374
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
She's so unique

375
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
And I like her clothes

376
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I feel like she's more cute

377
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
And yes

378
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
I want to be your friend

379
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Yes, I'm your friend

380
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Cheers

381
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,580
This is the beauty of music

382
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm your friend

383
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
We're already friends

384
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Hello, everyone

385
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,580
We're at the last game

386
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
Okay

387
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
We'll choose a theme

388
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Under this theme

389
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,580
You have to sing a song

390
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
It's okay to be related to the theme

391
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
No words

392
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,580
What about my boy?

393
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
Three people

394
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
You can take a picture of him

395
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
Okay

396
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,580
Okay, so what theme should we choose?

397
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580
The theme I'm most worried about today

398
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Is the wind

399
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
Wind

400
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Wind

401
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Wind

402
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
Wind

403
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
Wind

404
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Wind

405
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
It's so cold

406
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
It's really cold

407
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
My head hurts when it's windy

408
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
Is it a song called

409
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Wind?

410
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
No, it's a movie

411
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
It's a movie

412
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
It's a movie

413
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Let's start

414
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
Okay

415
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
The wind blows

416
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Under the sand

417
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,580
In the eyes of sadness

418
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,580
Who?

419
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Is it too fast?

420
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Too little

421
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
I want to be free like the wind

422
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Like the sky

423
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Actually, this song is free like a dream

424
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Okay

425
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Do you know what is sky?

426
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
He said sky

427
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Sky

428
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
He said sky has wind, right?

429
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Yes

430
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
How is it?

431
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Sky is okay

432
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
Because sky has wind

433
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
Yeah, sky

434
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
So expensive

435
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Bani Liyah

436
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
I don't know anything about wind

437
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
But I know something about sky

438
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
He told me that sky is okay

439
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
There you go

440
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Bye bye

441
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,580
So nice

442
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,580
You and I

443
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,580
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

444
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Wow

445
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
And you play without the colors of the wind

446
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
I thought the song was wind

447
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,580
And you play without the colors

448
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Soft the wind

449
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Yeah

450
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Little boy

451
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Long

452
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Long is wind

453
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Can you pass me by?

454
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Thank you

455
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
Thank you

456
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Thank you

457
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Pan Hong

458
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Three

459
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Two

460
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
One

461
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
I'm a man

462
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
I know the world

463
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,580
I know the world

464
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I don't have wind

465
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
I thought it was wind

466
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
It's wind

467
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
It's wind

468
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
It's wind

469
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
Fan in Japanese

470
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Kaze

471
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Kaze

472
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
Next

473
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Malin

474
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
Kaze

475
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Kaze

476
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
Kaze

477
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Kaze

478
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Kaze

479
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm a samurai

480
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
This time

481
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,580
doro

482
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,580
kaze

483
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
kaze

484
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:22,580
I'm falling into the water

485
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,580
I'm falling into the water

486
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,580
It means like riding a horse against the wind

487
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,580
I want to ride a horse with him

488
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Love is like a wind

489
00:20:49,580 --> 00:21:00,580
After he passes by, no one can stop him

490
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Cold wind

491
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Zhege

492
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
I'm blowing cold wind for you

493
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,580
I'm crying when loneliness comes

494
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,580
No one asks who I am

495
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,580
But who cares about who

496
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Who cares about who

497
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
It's over

498
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Sister Liang

499
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,580
I think of a very old song

500
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,580
I want to fall into the water

501
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,580
I'm falling into the water

502
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,580
I'm busy with the crowd

503
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
I always feel like I'm in the water

504
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
The main song is

505
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
We We Fall

506
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
We're together

507
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
We're waiting for the day

508
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Sorry, I've been too noisy

509
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,580
But this song is in the song

510
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,580
I think Chinese songs have a very good wind

511
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Finally, let's cheers

512
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,580
