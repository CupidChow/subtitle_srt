I believe in light

98
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
Did you think of anything to say to her?

99
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
I want to tell the sea

Tomorrow there will be a new world

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
I will win

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
This great man is a man

107
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260

108
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,260

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Come on

110
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,260
Come on

111
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
The first battle is Japan

112
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,260
We will win the youngest singer in Japan

113
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
But at the same time, the competition is cruel

114
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,260
We have to win at least one victory

115
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
in the two competitions

116
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
in the two competitions

117
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
You have to win at least one victory

118
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
to be safe

119
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,260
You didn't get in the two competitions

120
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
You have to get in the elimination zone

121
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Because we are a pair of losers

122
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
We will face elimination

123
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Actually, this pressure is quite big

124
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,260
I think it will make me more impulsive

125
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
I don't need to feel so much

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Just show yourself

127
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm still very nervous

128
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Because I lost the first round

129
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
I think I have to be fully prepared

130
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
I can't stay in the comfort zone

131
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Next, I will show myself

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
I will show myself

133
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,260
I will try my best

134
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
I will try my best

135
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
I will try my best

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
I will try my best

137
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
We can do it

138
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
We will try our best

139
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
This battle is for myself

140
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
or for the team

141
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
I have to win

142
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
I can't lose

143
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
We will fight even if we不知道

144
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
I will give it always

145
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,260
Is this a lottery or isn't that a victory?

146
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Before the discussion about this

147
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,300
There will be a sign

148
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,260

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Next, let's welcome the five singers from the Japanese war.

230
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
They are

231
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
Mr. Zhang Xun,

只年 North Korea

238
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,960
compare with Japan

239
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
They are on parades as fun as TV shows

240
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
in war.

241
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,760
I think the program team

242
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,400
is going to be the strongest for me.

243
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,480
The time is the original single.

244
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,720
Social media has started to grow 6 million times.

245
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,920
The genius singer-songwriter

246
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
who lives in the Internet era.

247
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,200
Iko.

248
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,960
Social media single broadcast

249
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,400
is over 60 million.

250
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,360
So pitiful.

251
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,480
What kind of pitiful?

252
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,640
Pitiful is

253
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
such a strong one.

254
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,280
The first five dreams

255
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,720
have started to grow 1 billion.

256
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
The super popular YouTuber

257
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
is the mysterious singer-songwriter

258
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
Ohana Lam.

259
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,360
The whole network is not changing the screen.

260
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm 5.9 billion.

261
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,520
Mi Yuna.

262
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,400
The famous anime

263
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,360
is the first hit of the Black Clover.

264
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Mi Yuna.

265
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,560
Mi Yuna.

266
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,240
She is the original song

267
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
of this anime.

268
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,280
I think this is very impressive.

269
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
I think her song

270
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
may not only represent

271
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
this anime,

272
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
but also represents

273
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,360
Japan.

274
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,920
Good bus.

275
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,440
Before we start,

276
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,120
let's welcome the two contestants.

277
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,560
Let's show them

278
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,200
our respect.

279
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
The first step to win

280
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
is to believe in yourself.

281
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,920
So,

282
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
Japanese friends,

283
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
please come over here.

284
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,800
Where are the tickets?

285
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,400
A boat we boarded

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
doesn't just do this.

287
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,240
Chinese people

288
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,200
also have a wonderful message.

289
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,600
We should keep moving forward.

290
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,040
Let's host

291
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,920

Hello.

295
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I think Japanese teams will definitely win.

296
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I will definitely be the king.

297
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I think it's not going to be a champion

298
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
since I came here.

299
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Before the game,

300
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
let me introduce the game.

301
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
The five Japanese players

302
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
will be the first to play.

303
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
The new singer will be the first to play.

304
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
The new singer will be the first to challenge.

305
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
The winner of this round

306
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
will be the first to play.

307
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
They will direct the battle

308
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
with the new singer,

309
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Musa.

310
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
The new king of the Japanese battle.

311
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Let's welcome the first to challenge the singer.

312
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Wow, here he comes.

313
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm actually quite excited.

314
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I want to be the first to challenge him.

315
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
You want to challenge him.

316
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I will challenge him.

317
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I will challenge him.

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Please give me more instructions.

319
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Hello, everyone.

320
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
I will be the first to challenge him.

321
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,040
The lyrics and the song are all in the game.

322
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Let's go with a bright feeling.

323
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
The first song is called

324
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Blinding.

325
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
You may have heard it before.

326
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Blinding is the first single.

327
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I really did my best

328
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
to make music

329
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,040
with my experience.

330
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,040
I really put my taste in music.

331
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,040
I really do my best to make music.

332
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
I will be the first to challenge him.

338
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,820

348
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,120
The happy end

349
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,360
We are this girl, we are this girl

350
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh, I forgot

351
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,960
The feelings that have been revealed

352
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,800
The more I think about it, the more I think about it

353
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,520
The tears overflow

354
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,680
All these feelings are so stupid

355
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,760
I so bloody bloody

356
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,960
I can't say anything anymore

357
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm fighting from you

358
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,760
I'm not your type anymore

359
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,160
I still remember that time

360
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,360
When I look at you, your smile is all night

361
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,200
Even if I'm separated, your words are still in my heart

362
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,560
Right, you sing?

363
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,480
I sing

364
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,360
Then let's see your hand movements

365
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm running through my thoughts

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,160
Now I'm alone

367
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,000
I knew that day would come

368
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,680
When I notice it, I'm leaving

369
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,840
The promise is

370
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
We are this girl, we are this girl

371
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, I forgot

372
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
The feelings that have been revealed

373
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh, I so bloody bloody

374
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,640
I'm not your type anymore

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,000
I still remember that time

379
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,120
When I look at you, your smile is all night

380
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
Even if I'm separated, your words are still in my heart

381
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,920
Right, you sing?

382
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,880
I remember that time

383
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,240
I still remember you

384
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I want to smile more next to you

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
I so bloody bloody

386
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm sorry for being like this

387
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
I'm fighting from you

388
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
I can't be your type anymore

389
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I still remember that time

390
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,040
When I look at you, your smile is all night

391
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Even if I'm separated, your words are still in my heart

392
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
I so bloody bloody

393
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
I can't say anything anymore

394
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm fighting from you

395
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm not your type anymore

396
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I still remember that time

397
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,040
When I look at you, your smile is all night

398
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Even if I'm separated, your words are still in my heart

399
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I still remember you

400
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Thank you

401
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,040
It's a great opening for this song

402
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,040
It's youthful and youthful

403
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,040
It makes you smile without feeling

404
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
You know, your mouth is not controlled

405
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Right, that's how it feels

406
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm going now

407
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,040
The song of Yiguang is the Japanese guest in my mind

408
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
It's a very lively and full of energy

409
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
I also want to challenge it

410
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Not yet

411
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
He's ready

412
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Thank you for your performance

413
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
I'll introduce myself to you

414
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm a Japanese artist

415
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Nice to meet you

416
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Thank you for your wonderful song

417
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Thank you for your wonderful song

418
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Is this song your own song?

419
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Yes, I sang my first single

420
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,040
How long have you been singing this song?

421
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
This song is about two years

422
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Yes, it's a very unique and unique song

423
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I think it's already done

424
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I think it's a little different from getting used to it

425
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I think it would be great if you could always sing this song

426
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,040
in a fresh and fresh way

427
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Thank you for your performance

428
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Thank you

429
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Yiguang is a very cute boy

430
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
He's very lively and full of energy

431
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
after he came on stage

432
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
He makes people like him

433
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
I want to say

434
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
the way he performed on stage

435
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
I don't know how to read the information

436
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I don't think he's only 20 years old

437
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
He's like a kid

438
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
but his performance is very mature

439
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
The way he sings

440
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
the way he sings

441
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
the way he sings

442
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
the way he sings

443
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
the way he sings

444
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
and I can hear his song

445
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Fighting

446
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Thank you so much

447
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
I want to ask Yiguang

448
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Do you remember the inspiration

449
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
of writing this song?

450
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I made this song

451
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Two years ago

452
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,040
I performed the original song

453
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
at the high school festival

454
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
I performed this song

455
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I was just in a relationship

456
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,040
and that relationship was the reason

457
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I wanted to be with her

458
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I wanted to make this song

459
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
and make her feel better

460
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
No one wrote this song with me

461
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Next, in the new battle

462
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
there will be a singer

463
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
who will challenge you to make a strong sell

464
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Before the start of the challenge

465
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
do you have anything to say to them?

466
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
I will be the winner

467
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
I will be the winner

468
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Yiguang is here

469
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
The start of the strong sell

470
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Someone has successfully made a strong sell

471
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
The singers in the new battle field

472
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
have already

473
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
suppressed their desire

474
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
What should we do?

475
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
I feel a little annoyed

476
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
What should we do next?

477
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
What should we do next?

478
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
We will lose the battle

479
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
I am very anxious

480
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Because I lost the first battle

481
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
and I lost a lot

482
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040

486
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
It's not cool

487
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
It's annoying

488
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
I think you don't care so much

489
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
You should compete

490
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
If you lose again

491
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I will show you

492
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I will fight for my life

493
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Let's shout one more time

494
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
This is a song

495
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
that represents Chinese young singers

496
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
So this time

497
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
you must win

498
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
I am very anxious

499
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
I am very anxious

500
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
I am very anxious

501
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I am very anxious

502
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
I am very anxious

503
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
I am very anxious

504
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I am very anxious

505
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I am very anxious

506
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I am very anxious

507
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I am very anxious

508
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
I am very anxious

509
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
I am very anxious

510
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I am very anxious

511
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I am very anxious

512
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:05,040
It's a gentle revenge

513
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Don't say it

514
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
It's a little bit of a waste

515
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,040
It's a little bit of a waste

516
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
I am very anxious

517
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Very anxious

518
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
I am very anxious

519
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I am very anxious

520
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I am very anxious

521
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I am very anxious

522
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I am very anxious

523
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I am very anxious

524
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I am very anxious

525
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I am very anxious

526
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I am very anxious

527
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I am very anxious

528
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
I am very anxious

529
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
I am very anxious

530
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
I am very anxious

531
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
I am very anxious

532
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
I am very anxious

533
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Every moment of forgiveness is falling

534
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:02,040
If you start to be a miracle

535
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Three times ten times

536
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Let me sing it to you

537
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
You are like a dream

538
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
You are like a sea of ​​heart

539
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Everything is in this bag

540
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
The stars fall down

541
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,040
The shadow is so cute

542
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:30,040
It's a gentle revenge

543
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Don't say it

544
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
The face is white

545
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,040
It's worth the night

546
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm looking forward to it

547
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
The one who is hidden

548
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
The cold child

549
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm looking forward to it

550
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
I want to know

551
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Thank you

552
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
I think the performance of Mr. Wang

553
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,040
is a performance that I can't do

554
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
He sings beautifully

555
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,040
He is like a river

556
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I feel that kind of emotion

557
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
So amazing

558
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
How do you feel

559
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
The second round

560
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I feel that my condition is better than the first round

561
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Because the first round is really too nervous

562
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
And then today this

563
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Maybe I laughed more

564
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I didn't think you would steal the first one

565
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,640
Because before Iluang

566
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,040
We also have it at the backstage

567
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I think he is very, very good

568
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,760
I wanted to steal his microphone.

569
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,080
Yes.

570
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,480
I thought he was the first one to come out.

571
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,560
Yiguang said,

572
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,880
I knew it.

573
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,760
I don't know you.

574
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
I think

575
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
Wang Hao's voice,

576
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,040
his voice,

577
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,840
his song,

578
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,200
are very different.

579
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,240
It's very stable today.

580
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,640
There's a sudden change in the background.

581
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,200
I think that's a very

582
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,240
surprising part.

583
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,200
It's good to take back

584
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,720
all the details at once.

585
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,400
But I want to see more of you

586
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,520
in this song.

587
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
When you describe a person

588
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,160
like Moonlight,

589
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,000
the happiness on your face

590
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
comes out a little bit.

591
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,160
A little bit of happiness.

592
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm very happy.

593
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,960
It's very difficult.

594
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,400
Wow.

595
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
The voice is

596
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,920
very wide and wide.

597
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I think that's a very

598
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,720
beautiful voice that I saw

599
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
a lot earlier

600
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,840
in the voice of the sea.

601
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,920
And there are many

602
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,840
different ways to sing.

603
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,040
So I think that's a very

604
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,840
possible person.

605
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,160
Thank you, Mr. Gong.

606
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
Let's welcome Yiguang

622
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,200
Thank you, Liangying.

623
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,080
OK.

624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Once.

625
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,760
Thank you, Ms. Wang Honghao.

626
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,840
Wang Honghao.

627
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,360
This is a tough battle.

628
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,200
I like your voice and performance.

629
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,560
I want to ask you something else.

630
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,400
I want to ask you more about your voice.

631
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm curious about your potential.

632
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,280
Thank you.

633
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,280
I gave Wang Honghao my vote.

634
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,680
But I want to say

635
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,120
I hope you can see

636
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,400
the performance on the stage

637
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,880
and the lyrics of the song

638
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
in the performance.

639
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,600
Thank you, Wang Honghao.

640
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,640
I really enjoy your performance.

641
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,320
Thank you.

642
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,160
Let's pay attention to the final result

643
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,440
of the 21-member online competition.

644
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,800
It's a very difficult challenge.

645
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,840
But in the end, I'm a young man

646
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,120
who is very optimistic

647
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,320
and I'm passionate about the performance.

648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,480
I want to represent Japan.

649
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,720
I want to be on the streaming

650
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,120
and play it again.

651
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,680
I want to be a J-Bop fan.

652
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,240
I've been friends with Honghao for a long time.

653
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,360
I want to let him know

654
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,520
his characteristics

655
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,920
and his true and false sounds.

656
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,440
And the most important thing is his input.

657
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm very touched.

658
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Wang Honghao is a very good actor.

659
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
I want to give him a big hand

660
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,760
to make him the winner.

661
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,480
The final result of the online competition is...

662
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,320
A beautiful green light,

663
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,340
Got Love

664
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:10,040
A light, 9-

665
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,320
I thought it was really nice.

666
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,720
I want you to

667
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,160
make me feel better and work harder.

668
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,360
Thank you.

669
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,800
Thank you.

670
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,240
It's not bad.

671
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,600
The first one is happy.

672
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,080
I think the first decision

673
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,640
I made was right.

674
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,760
I have to believe in myself

675
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,880
to get a good result.

676
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,640
The new singer team wins the round.

677
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,240
1 to 0 is temporarily leading.

678
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,440
The next one is

679
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,880
the next one.

680
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,240
The challenge singer.

681
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,920
OK.

682
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
OK.

683
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm happy.

684
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm waiting for you.

685
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm waiting for you.

686
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm waiting for you.

687
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,280
I'm in front of the rehearsal today.

688
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,680
I'm the Japanese singer who plays the guitar.

689
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm very proud of you.

690
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,760
Very proud of you.

691
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,720
No matter what kind of opponent I am,

692
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,920
I have to win.

693
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,280
I knew I could win.

694
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,760
She's listening.

695
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,240
Hello, everyone.

696
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,520
I'm Miuna.

697
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm from Japan.

698
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm from Japan.

699
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,000
Mi Yo-Nai, 22 years old.

700
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,160
She's a young Japanese singer.

701
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,120
When she was 16,

702
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,280
she released her first original song,

703
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
QQ.

704
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,920
Her work has been released.

705
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,920
She's the highest-ranked music blogger in China.

706
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,720
When she was 17,

707
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,000
she was on the stage of the 19th year of the Yagun Music Festival.

708
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,760
She was the first to perform in the world

709
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,920
with many musical instruments such as

710
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,080
Black Tiger and the Black Tiger.

711
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm'll go next.

712
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay, go.

713
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,360
Okay.

714
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000

715
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000

716
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000

Yeah

739
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I feel the energy

740
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Like a child

741
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Like a child

742
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You and I are really strong

743
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I think it's a very strong

744
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
level

745
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
When you perform

746
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
you can see that

747
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
there is music in her music

748
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
She is a very talented person

749
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
She is very natural

750
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Here we go

751
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Hello, everyone

752
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm Miura

753
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm Chindou

754
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hello, everyone

755
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Thank you for your performance

756
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Thank you

757
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The balance between the part

758
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that breaks the beat

759
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and the part that makes you feel strong

760
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
is very good

761
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
There are people who say

762
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
you can't sing too much

763
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
but it's very good

764
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Thank you

765
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I was so nervous

766
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I was very happy

767
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Thank you

768
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Miura

769
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You and your guitar

770
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
have a good relationship

771
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Thank you

772
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Because I can hear the tacit understanding between you

773
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
From the first part

774
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I was touching your voice

775
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and your stability

776
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
and your true and false voices

777
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Every change

778
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I think it's a surprise

779
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm looking forward to the next part

780
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and not only the structure

781
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
of the music

782
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
including her singing

783
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
every part is a surprise

784
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
of course her unique voice

785
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I want to know

786
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Did you write this song yourself?

787
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
When I was 15

788
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I sang the song

789
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
that I made for the first time in my life

790
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
this time

791
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You have a new song

792
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Originally I only made one chorus

793
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I wanted to make the old one

794
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
in my own world

795
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I made it on a different day

796
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
so I wanted to write

797
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the third verse

798
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I want to ask

799
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Did you fall in love with her?

800
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Because I was wondering

801
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
if she started to fall in love with her

802
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I felt like she started to sing

803
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and started to have a snow flower

804
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It's so amazing

805
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
She sang so gently

806
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and she sang so gently

807
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
She made me

808
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
feel so much love

809
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Thank you for your wonderful performance

810
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Thank you

811
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I want to ask

812
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Did you feel anything

813
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
on the stage of

814
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
the new Asian singer Jia Duo Bao?

815
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I started to sing

816
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
this song

817
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
for about 7 or 8 years

818
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
after I started to sing

819
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
this song

820
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I sang this song

821
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
in my own room

822
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
at the beginning

823
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I was so happy

824
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
to be

825
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
able to

826
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
be in this world

827
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
from Japan

828
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I really want to

829
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
make a song for everyone

830
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
from now on

831
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I want to ask

832
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
what kind of good words you have

833
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I was so embarrassed

834
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that I didn't have

835
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
confidence

836
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I was told

837
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
this voice to many people

838
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I was so embarrassed

839
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
that I was told

840
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
that I was a good girl

841
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I want to

842
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
be a good girl

843
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
if I can

844
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
There is a person who said

845
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
your voice

846
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
he didn't listen to the song

847
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
His voice is so good

848
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I think it's very special

849
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I want to tell you that your voice is very good

850
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I like your voice

851
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Thank you

852
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I also have

853
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
a special skill

854
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I also have a lot of practice

855
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and practice

856
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
until the stage that I am singing

857
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I am very amazed

858
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I want to say

859
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you are not allowed

860
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
to sing

861
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
in the new backup

862
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What do you want to say

863
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I have put out my full power

864
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
so let me

865
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
let the other person's full power

866
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Then please

867
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
prepare to sing

868
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Now

869
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
start

870
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What do you say

871
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Do you want to

872
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I want to

873
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I feel

874
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
let Rene

875
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
give Rene two more chances

876
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
because this is too strong

877
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Because

878
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Rene has already lost

879
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I think Rene can avoid

880
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It seems more hesitating

881
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
6 seconds

882
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
5 seconds

883
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It seems that

884
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Rene was the singer of the rap

885
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
for the longest time

886
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So I think

887
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I am here

888
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
3

889
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
2

890
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
1

891
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The singer of the rap

892
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
seems that you have hesitated for a long time

893
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Please be ready

894
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Come on

895
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
3

896
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
2

897
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I can feel

898
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
only the wind and my backup

899
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I know I am ready

900
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I am not afraid of anything

901
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
5 seconds

902
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Fighting

903
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm so happy

904
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm so happy

905
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm so happy

906
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm so happy

907
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm so happy

908
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm so happy

909
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm so happy

910
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'm so happy

911
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm so happy

912
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm so happy

913
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm so happy

914
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm so happy

915
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm so happy

916
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm so happy

917
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm so happy

918
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm so happy

919
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm so happy

920
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I'm so happy

921
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm so happy

922
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm so happy

923
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm so happy

924
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm so happy

925
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm so happy

926
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm so happy

927
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm so happy

928
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm so happy

929
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm so happy

930
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm so happy

931
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm so happy

932
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm so happy

933
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm so happy

934
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm so happy

935
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm so happy

936
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Kylin

937
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm so happy

938
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm so happy

939
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Kylin

940
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm so happy

941
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Thank you

942
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I have to say this

943
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm so happy

944
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm so happy

945
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm so happy

946
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm so happy

947
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm so happy

948
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm so happy

949
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Not one

950
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think

951
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm sorry.

952
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm sorry.

953
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm sorry.

954
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm sorry.

955
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm sorry.

956
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm sorry.

957
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm sorry.

958
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm sorry.

959
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm sorry.

960
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm sorry.

961
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm sorry.

962
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm sorry.

963
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm sorry.

964
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm sorry.

965
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm sorry.

966
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I'm sorry.

967
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm sorry.

968
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm sorry.

969
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm sorry.

970
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm sorry.

971
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm sorry.

972
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm sorry.

973
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm sorry.

974
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm sorry.

975
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm sorry.

976
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm sorry.

977
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm sorry.

978
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm sorry.

979
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm sorry.

980
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm sorry.

981
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm sorry.

982
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm sorry.

983
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm sorry.

984
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm sorry.

985
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm sorry.

986
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm sorry.

987
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm sorry.

988
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm sorry.

989
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm sorry.

990
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Thank you, Yang Huichun.

991
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Thank you.

992
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Thank you, Yang Huichun.

993
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I sang like I was whispering to the people.

994
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I was quite loud.

995
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I was singing like I was singing.

996
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I didn't think it was for me.

997
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
How do you feel?

998
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's great.

999
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I was originally a new singer

1000
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
who was challenging for the stage.

1001
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But when he was talking,

1002
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I was a little...

1003
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The boy was...

1004
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's the same as I felt.

1005
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
When I heard the voice,

1006
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I felt...

1007
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes, it's...

1008
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yes.

1009
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's really...

1010
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Your voice really surprised me today.

1011
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You put your energy into your voice

1012
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and your emotions.

1013
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I totally heard the emotion

1014
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
you wanted in this song.

1015
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And your voice is really good today.

1016
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Thank you, Yang Huichun.

1017
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But you really met a strong opponent today.

1018
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I really want to say...

1019
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I like to challenge the strongman.

1020
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Thank you for your wonderful song.

1021
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I have to decide which one to choose.

1022
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I feel bad about it.

1023
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Wait a minute.

1024
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm young,

1025
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but I'm really...

1026
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I'm a person who is kind and strong

1027
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
like a feather.

1028
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I've been singing the chorus several times.

1029
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I've been singing the chorus several times.

1030
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I can sing it in any song.

1031
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I think I can sing it

1032
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
even if I have a color or a habit.

1033
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I think that's all.

1034
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Thank you.

1035
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Welcome, Milk.

1036
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Back to the stage.

1037
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I feel so uncomfortable.

1038
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's really difficult.

1039
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I know it's hard.

1040
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I just do it.

1041
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
The teacher of the class is starting to dance.

1042
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yang Sang.

1043
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then, please choose

1044
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the one that you chose.

1045
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
The one that Yang Ying chose is

1046
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Miuna.

1047
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Miuna.

1048
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I think that today's mission

1049
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
is really good.

1050
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
When you sing

1051
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and don't bring your guitar,

1052
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I hope you have more

1053
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
music on the song.

1054
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think your body

1055
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
can be more comfortable.

1056
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's a song

1057
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
that you can sing

1058
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
without any problems.

1059
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You can add more

1060
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
music on the performance.

1061
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Thank you, teacher.

1062
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
My god.

1063
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Teacher Gong Teng is so stubborn.

1064
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Teacher Gong Teng,

1065
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
your choice is...

1066
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Miuna.

1067
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Miuna.

1068
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Congratulations, Miuna.

1069
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You got two votes.

1070
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
The stage today

1071
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
is completed.

1072
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Miuna is really

1073
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
amazing.

1074
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Miuna is really amazing.

1075
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I want to listen to

1076
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
her songs more.

1077
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Thank you.

1078
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Let me pay attention to

1079
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
the 21 judges.

1080
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I really like Miuna.

1081
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I think she

1082
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
is very difficult

1083
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
to create

1084
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
because she has

1085
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
different ways of

1086
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
learning and

1087
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
different ways of moving.

1088
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
She has many

1089
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
musical skills.

1090
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
She has many skills.

1091
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
She has a lot of skills

1092
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and she is a little bit

1093
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
good at singing.

1094
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Miuna's songs

1095
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
are very good.

1096
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
She has a technique

1097
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and soul,

1098
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and she has the potential

1099
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
to control it.

1100
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
She has the potential to control it.

1101
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
She has the potential to control the stage

1102
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
more than just a judge.

1103
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Where have you been?

1104
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You have a song

1105
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
that's like a roller coaster.

1106
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You don't know

1107
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
what you will meet in front of you.

1108
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
She has

1109
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
light,

1110
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
heavy,

1111
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
fake music,

1112
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and a magical voice.

1113
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
She can

1114
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
fully perform

1115
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
in this song.

1116
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
If you know

1117
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
your song,

1118
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
it's also very good.

1119
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But it's too...

1120
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
too thin.

1121
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Miuna's performance

1122
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
is very good.

1123
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
She has a very emotional

1124
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and storytelling

1125
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
to express her feelings to Miuna.

1126
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Let's welcome

1127
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the 21 judges

1128
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
to the final vote.

1129
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Miuna won 20 votes.

1130
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yang Yunze won 1 vote.

1131
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yang Yunze won 1 vote.

1132
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What?

1133
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
1 vote.

1134
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It's too long.

1135
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
1 vote.

1136
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The score now

1137
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
is 22 votes.

1138
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
The score now

1139
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
is 22 votes.

1140
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
The score now

1141
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
is 22 votes.

1142
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
The score now

1143
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
is 22 votes.

1144
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Actually, in my heart,

1145
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
there is a answer.

1146
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I think she will win.

1147
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
But I didn't expect

1148
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I would lose so badly.

1149
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Congratulations to Miuna.

1150
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Congratulations to you

1151
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
for having a chance

1152
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
to go to the King of Songs.

1153
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think I'm very satisfied

1154
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
with today's performance.

1155
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I think it's good.

1156
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The only pity is

1157
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Miuna didn't get the guitar today.

1158
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Because I don't know

1159
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Japanese players have a love story.

1160
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yes.

1161
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We were just talking on the backstage.

1162
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I said,

1163
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
are you a man?

1164
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Are you a man?

1165
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's right.

1166
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
We were talking about

1167
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
the number of votes.

1168
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's too...

1169
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Because she is very good.

1170
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
She is very good.

1171
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The challenge singer team won the round.

1172
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
1 to 1, the score is equal.

1173
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's unusual for Snow in Okinawa.

1174
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yes, it's unusual.

1175
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Perfect timing

1176
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
when the song just started.

1177
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Amazing.

1178
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Next, please welcome the challenge singer.

1179
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
What is the K.O.K. competition?

1180
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
20 years old.

1181
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
20 years old.

1182
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
12 years old.

1183
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
The one who sings the wolf's song.

1184
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You can't do it wrong.

1185
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
If you do it wrong, you lose.

1186
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It means that their voice accuracy is very accurate.

1187
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The K.O.K. competition

1188
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
held by the Japanese TV station

1189
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
is the most accurate

1190
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
voice accuracy competition in Japan.

1191
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
From the show,

1192
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
a treasure girl is hidden.

1193
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
13 years old,

1194
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
the K.O.K. competition.

1195
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The winner of the second round

1196
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
is the one who has the most votes.

1197
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
The record of the first round

1198
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
is now broken by no one.

1199
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Thank you.

1200
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Thank you.

1201
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I was looking forward to

1202
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
singing in the Asia-Pacific stage.

1203
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I will do my best

1204
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
to be the representative singer of Japan.

1205
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The K.O.K. competition.

1206
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
The first round of the second round

1207
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
is now broken by no one.

1208
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The famous K.O.K. competition.

1209
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
The one who sings the wolf's song.

1210
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
The one who sings the cherry blossom song.

1211
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I was standing alone

1212
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:49,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1213
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I was standing alone

1214
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1215
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I was standing alone

1216
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1217
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I was standing alone

1218
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1219
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I was standing alone

1220
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1221
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I was standing alone

1222
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
in my heart that I couldn't hold back.

1223
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He has such a unique voice.

1224
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He is in his 40s.

1225
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The one who sings the cherry blossom song.

1226
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,000
The one who sings the cherry blossom song.

1227
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000

The one who sings the cherry blossom song.

01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The one who sings the cherry blossom song.

1235
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000

1242
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:35,000
呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜

1245

僧台と舞を舞うコロイヤですが、 cutieèteと舞を舞うコローとか cutie Jerseyと舞うコローとか cutie

1246
01:06:39,300 --> 01:07:01,340
私は一人。 anata no omoi o kamishimeta the journey ofsteeline inakabura.

1247
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,780
Mom

1248
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,580
Thank you

1249
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,220
I'm so impressed

1250
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,260
This song is really good

1251
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,180
I think Kuyo

1252
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,660
He is not the same age as this

1253
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,020
Especially his age

1254
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,060
It doesn't seem to be big

1255
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,980
But his singing

1256
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,540
There is no sense of balance

1257
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,740
His voice

1258
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,780
He expresses his overall emotions

1259
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,660
Let me

1260
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,460
Passing back to that era

1261
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,460
I'm Kuyo

1262
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,020
24 years old

1263
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,980
I'm from Ashikagashi, Japan

1264
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,180
Nice to meet you

1265
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,460
How does this stage feel?

1266
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,220
It's amazing

1267
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,820
It's amazing

1268
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,860
He sang on a stage with a sense of freedom

1269
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,780
It's really the first time

1270
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,420
I've ever experienced such a big stage

1271
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,340
I've never been on a stage this big

1272
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,260
It's really a great honor

1273
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,420
Thank you

1274
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,740
Thank you for your wonderful song

1275
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,780
Thank you

1276
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,020
Were you nervous?

1277
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,860
I was nervous

1278
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,620
But I didn't feel that at all

1279
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,460
The balance of his voice

1280
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,660
The pitch was perfect

1281
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,860
And I thought

1282
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,820
This is my own song

1283
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,380
I'm familiar with it

1284
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,940
I thought it was a wonderful song

1285
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,260
I thought it was a great song

1286
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,540
I'm so happy

1287
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,100
The voice

1288
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,420
It's not a folk song

1289
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,980
But it has a lot of different kind of essence

1290
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,180
It has a lot of different kind of essence

1291
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,940
Are you aware of this?

1292
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,460
When I first started singing

1293
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,100
I was singing a song

1294
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,060
That's why

1295
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,180
That's amazing

1296
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,780
Thank you for your great performance

1297
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,340
I also did a fake performance

1298
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,620
I did a fake performance

1299
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,700
But after I did a fake performance

1300
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,060
I didn't feel like I was breathing

1301
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,980
I sang quietly again

1302
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,940
But I couldn't do that

1303
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,940
Thank you

1304
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,020
It's wonderful

1305
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,580
I'm really happy

1306
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,980
Thank you

1307
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,460
First of all, this song

1308
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,860
I really like

1309
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,140
Because I sang this song before

1310
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,340
Chinese version

1311
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:32,020
The world that I'm so curious about

1312
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,060
And today, I heard this version

1313
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,980
I think I not only heard the cherry blossom

1314
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,620
I also heard the cherry blossom in a huge area

1315
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,460
When he came to the last part

1316
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:46,900
I felt very strong

1317
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,260
When I decided to sing this song

1318
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,620
I heard it was very famous in China

1319
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,780
I searched for how famous it is

1320
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,260
I also found out the video that I was singing

1321
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,220
It's really wonderful

1322
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,020
I'm really nervous

1323
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,660
Thank you

1324
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,740
I would like to ask you

1325
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,660
If you go home with your cherry blossom

1326
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,380
I will sing a song

1327
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,380
Is there anyone who can help me

1328
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,380
If you go home with your cherry blossom

1329
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,380
I will listen to your song

1330
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,860
I will sing now

1331
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,860
I can't say that

1332
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,380
No

1333
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,380
No

1334
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
Thank you

1335
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,380
And in the new battle hall

1336
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,380
My singer will give you a strong challenge

1337
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,380
What do you want to say to them

1338
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,380
Please be gentle

1339
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,380
I'm so happy

1340
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,380
The show starts now

1341
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,380
Someone is singing

1342
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,380
Please sing your song

1343
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,380
5, 2, 1

1344
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,380
Go

1345
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,380
I have to adjust my mentality

1346
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,380
I have to sing confidently

1347
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:33,380
And continue to take the score for our Chinese team

1348
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,060
The battle hall

1349
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,500
There is a Gregorio C bag

1350
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:52,740
I talk to myself for hours

1351
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:57,180
Say things you don't understand

1352
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:01,740
And I can take myself dancing

1353
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:05,020
And I can hold my own hand

1354
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:11,740
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

1355
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:16,300
Mmm, hey

1356
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,780
Paint my nails cherry red

1357
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:27,260
Match the roses that you sent

1358
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:31,700
No remorse, no regret

1359
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:36,100
I forgive every word you said

1360
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,940
Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you

1361
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,060
I didn't wanna lie

1362
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,140
Started to cry

1363
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,500
Then remembered I

1364
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,900
I can buy myself flowers

1365
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,060
Buy my name and a scent

1366
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,700
Talk to myself for hours

1367
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,420
Oh, say things you don't understand

1368
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:08,420
Oh, and I can take myself dancing

1369
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:11,700
And I can hold my own hand

1370
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:16,220
Yeah, I can love me better than

1371
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:18,980
You can't love me better

1372
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,780
I can love me better, baby

1373
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,460
Can't love me better

1374
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,140
I can love me better, baby

1375
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,860
Can't love me better

1376
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:34,620
Oh, hey

1377
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,980
I didn't wanna leave you

1378
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,100
I didn't wanna lie

1379
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,940
Started to cry

1380
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,180
Then remembered I

1381
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:48,700
I can buy myself flowers

1382
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,820
Buy my name and a scent

1383
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:57,220
Talk to myself for hours

1384
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:00,700
Oh, say things you don't understand

1385
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:06,220
Oh, and I can take myself dancing

1386
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,500
And I can hold my own hand

1387
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,940
Yeah, I can love me better than

1388
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:20,060
Yeah, I can love me better than

1389
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:27,860
You can't love me better than

1390
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,220
You can't love me better than

1391
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:34,820
Oh, hey

1392
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:38,820
Better than you can

1393
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,100
Wow

1394
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,380
It's really great.

1395
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,180
It's really great.

1396
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,020
The performance is really great.

1397
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,540
The way you feel is really great.

1398
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,420
The language is different.

1399
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,060
The song is different from my type.

1400
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,220
But it's really cool.

1401
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,980
It's really a great song.

1402
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,700
It's like this.

1403
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,340
Every time you say you're shy,

1404
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,300
you're very shy.

1405
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:10,980
Yeah.

1406
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,900
The first half.

1407
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,740
The first half.

1408
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,060
Wen Tao means

1409
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:30,140
Great

1410
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,740
I keep having such a long list.

1411
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:38,100
That's what's really good.

1412
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,600
Like a long list.

1413
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,100
Then everybody wonder how they Those difficult

1414
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,100
I'm not afraid

1415
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,100
What should I do?

1416
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,100
Start

1417
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,100
The boss

1418
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,100
Let's put it on the plate first

1419
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,100
Put it on the plate first

1420
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Thank you, teacher

1421
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Don't catch a cold

1422
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Thank you so much

1423
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,100
Do you know that when you came up

1424
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,100
Did you bring a big wind?

1425
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,100
Really?

1426
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,100
The moment you came up

1427
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,100
The wind suddenly came up

1428
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,100
Really?

1429
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,100
Your temperament

1430
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,100
Even the nature is compatible with you

1431
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,100
I really like it

1432
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,100
No matter you sing slow and fast

1433
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,100
The feeling of freedom and freedom in you

1434
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,100
The feeling of freedom and freedom in you

1435
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,100
Because your first part

1436
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,100
Is very precise and precise

1437
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,100
Control of the taste

1438
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,100
And then it was just the right time to blow the wind

1439
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,100
I saw the snow falling on you

1440
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,100
I'm really worried about you

1441
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,100
But you really held every shadow

1442
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,100
The whole appearance of the shadow

1443
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,100
I think the level of feeling is very good

1444
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,100
So I just completely

1445
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,100
Entered you into this song

1446
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,100
Very good

1447
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,100
Thank you, teacher

1448
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,100
When you were singing

1449
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,100
When you were singing

1450
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,100
The wind was very strong

1451
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,100
But on the other hand, in the drama

1452
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,100
Like a flower that stands firmly

1453
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,100
Even in any wind

1454
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,100
It was very beautiful

1455
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,100
Thank you

1456
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,100
Actually, the original version

1457
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
Is a relatively

1458
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,100
A relatively medium-speed

1459
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,100
Everyone, sing quickly

1460
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,100
Then I turned it into a ballad version

1461
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,100
Actually, I think it's

1462
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,100
I take my own understanding of this song

1463
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
To sing it

1464
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:41,100
It was wonderful like Mei's voice

1465
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,100
Thank you

1466
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,100
Thank you

1467
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,100
Okay, welcome

1468
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,100
Kuyui, back to the stage

1469
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,100
I love your singing

1470
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,100
Thank you

1471
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,100
So now

1472
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,100
For the two singers

1473
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,100
Make a vote for the second choice

1474
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,100
Oh my god, it's difficult

1475
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
It is

1476
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,100
I mean, it's not similar

1477
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,100
But nice quality

1478
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,100
Yeah, her way is more traditional

1479
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,100
And she's like more modern now

1480
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,100
Teacher Gong Teng, you're singing again

1481
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Her head

1482
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,100
I don't know

1483
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,100
I'm in a world of singing

1484
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,100
It's really hard

1485
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
They're so different

1486
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,100
But the same stability

1487
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,100
The same characteristic

1488
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,100
And I like singing

1489
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,100
So your choice is

1490
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,100
I choose my favorite

1491
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,100
Aisin Juelome

1492
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,100
Congratulations, Aisin Juelome

1493
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,100
Thank you

1494
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,100
Thank you

1495
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,100
Not yet

1496
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,100
Not yet

1497
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,100
I'm really worried about it

1498
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
Mei

1499
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,100
Congratulations, Aisin Juelome

1500
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,100
You got two votes

1501
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,100
Let's get to it

1502
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,100
The final vote of the 21 judges

1503
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,100
Kuyui is singing

1504
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
Like in the story

1505
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,100
It's like watching a movie

1506
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
It's so beautiful

1507
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,100
It's so limited

1508
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,100
I voted for Yu Yi

1509
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,100
Yu Yi has over a hundred thousand votes

1510
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,100
She's so good

1511
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,100
She can see the beautiful sky of Sakura in Japan

1512
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,100
She can see the scenery

1513
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,100
Just by listening to the song

1514
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,100
I want her to travel to Japan

1515
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,100
And go to the world

1516
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,100
I'm so happy

1517
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,100
Congratulations

1518
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,100
Aisin Juelome is singing a English song

1519
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,100
Especially when she's turning

1520
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,100
She's turning so beautifully

1521
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,100
And you can't help but think

1522
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,100
She's so amazing

1523
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,100
I choose Mei

1524
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,100
I'm so touched

1525
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,100
She sings

1526
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,100
My Little Father

1527
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,100
I think she's so good

1528
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,100
She's very original

1529
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,100
The whole public sense

1530
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,100
And the whole chicken court

1531
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,100
I'm so proud of her

1532
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,100
Thank you, teacher

1533
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,100
Yu Yi sings very well

1534
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,100
She sings like a foreigner

1535
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,100
The two of them are so good

1536
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,100
I think she's so pitiful

1537
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,100
Thank you

1538
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,100
The final vote of the judges is

1539
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,100
Mei

1540
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,100
Now the judges will give out

1541
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,100
You guys

1542
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,100
Okay

1543
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,100
Okay

1544
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,100
I'm so happy

1545
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,100
Okay

1546
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,100
So cute

1547
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,100
She's so cute

1548
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,100
She looks like you

1549
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,100
Actually I want to add one more thing

1550
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,100
Because when I heard you sing

1551
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,100
I think you really sing very well

1552
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,100
And I'm a little scared

1553
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,100
And I'm telling myself

1554
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,100
No matter what the result is today

1555
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,100
I'm very honored to share a stage with you

1556
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,100
With you

1557
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,100
On a stage like this

1558
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,100
I want to hear your song

1559
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,100
And sing with you

1560
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,100
I'm so happy

1561
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Please become my friends

1562
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,100
I'm a PC fan

1563
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,100
My friends

1564
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,100
Yeah

1565
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,100
Yeah

1566
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,100
Congratulations to Ai Xin and Jueloumei

1567
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,100
They have the chance to start over

1568
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,100
Thank you

1569
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,100
I think it's a little bit

1570
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,100
I'm so happy

1571
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,100
I'm so happy

1572
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,100
I can speak English

1573
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,100
So I can communicate with my friends

1574
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,100
I can exchange my Instagram

1575
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,100
And if I come to Japan

1576
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,100
I can tell them that I'm not

1577
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,100
I'm so happy to have friends

1578
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,100
who have the same eyes as me

1579
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,100
The new singer team wins

1580
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,100
2 to 1

1581
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:24,100
Please welcome the next

1582
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,100
singer

1583
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,100
I feel like I'm watching the king of masked

1584
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,100
The king of masked

1585
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,100
Is he coming?

1586
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,100
Yeah, because I'm looking forward to it

1587
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,100
I think he's quite mysterious

1588
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,100
Thank you

1589
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,100
Thank you

1590
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,100
Thank you

1591
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:53,100
I don't like Hilma

1592
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,100
The sound is too loud

1593
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,100
You don't know who she is

1594
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,100
But you may have heard her voice

1595
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,100
She has never shown her face in the Internet

1596
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,100
She has never shown her face in the Internet

1597
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,100
She has never shown her face in the Internet
