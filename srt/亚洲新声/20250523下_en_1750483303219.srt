Put on fire and drink Jia Duo Bao.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,600
The hard-core strength of the force to protect the new strength.

5

This program is sponsored by Shuang Ying He,

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,200
the strong-minded Huang Jia Meisu Jia Er.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,020
One day during the choreographer's meeting

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,220
Kill Cai Jinyuan

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,160
You worked hard.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Wages of work

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,000
All works

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Everything fits

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:10,720
Now, we will tell the story behind.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,920
Take a look at us.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:25,580
Look, I love you so, every amount of every Clue

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,580
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,580
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

18
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,580
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm not afraid of Cold, I've got cold

20
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,360
One heart doesn't go back

21
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:14,360
The concrete will never後

22
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,420
Hope you can see it from me from my childhood

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,580
How it was

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm happy

25
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,260
Now I can't move my legs

26
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,020
The more time passes, sometimes i'm sitting down

27
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,220
Or in front of others

28
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I'm so happy

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,580
I'm so happy

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I'm so happy

31
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,580
I'm so happy

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm so happy

33
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,580
I'm so happy

34
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm so happy

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm so happy

36
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:35,580
I'm so happy

37
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Mom I am going to brush you,

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
professor An.

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,640
Chen Yuanに完成

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,100
Let's listen to the performance

41
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Alright, zombie

42
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,740
Let's make some noise

43
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,660
I don't want to let them kill me

44
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,260
We can feel that so much. It's so beautiful.

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,860
Like the tradition and just the energy that you carry is really, really present.

46
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,340
And it's so lovely.

47
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,380
There was pockets of that performance that I wanted us to replay in my head.

48
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,780
I wanted to hear over and over and over again.

49
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,740
But the only thing I would say is that there were moments that were so beautiful

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,780
and so powerful and so filled with big notes, soft notes

51
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,900
that I wished that you had that capture from the beginning.

52
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,660
So just a little more belief in yourself on the jump from that first note.

53
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,540
I think it was, but I think it was really special.

54
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,300
Thank you so much.

55
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,060
This is a very beautiful song.

56
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,540
I believe everyone is deeply touched.

57
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,380
I want to know what he's singing.

58
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Yeah, this song is one of the most famous songs about father.

59
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,780
Yeah, and everyone goes and loves this song.

60
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,980
It was my dream to see Ocean.

61
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,260
Because in Mongolia, we don't have much of water there.

62
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,820
Yeah.

63
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,940
Well, look at this.

64
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,740
Yeah, I want Ocean.

65
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,180
Every single time I can't believe that I'm on the ocean.

66
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,100
And why I chose this song?

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,580
Because like many years ago, when I was in another country,

68
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,340
my father, he's passed away.

69
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,420
I really want to sing this song on the ocean

70
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,820
to show my father he's looking at me right now.

71
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,620
I can feel that your son is doing just fine.

72
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,940
I think your father can feel that.

73
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm very lucky to be on this show.

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,500
And then I can hear so many different music on this boat.

75
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
This song is also very different today.

76
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Because I can't accept this language at all.

77
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,180
But from his singing,

78
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,540
I can feel his love for father.

79
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,020
And I think his father's name is Ocean.

80
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,180
I think I hope he can sing on the ocean one day.

81
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Yeah, he has the same desire.

82
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,020
So I believe what he just said,

83
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,700
his father is looking at his performance.

84
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,940
Thank you so much.

85
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,540
Yeah, I really want to sing this song for my father.

86
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,940
As a gift, he was always there.

87
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,900
And I believe he received it from heaven.

88
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,940
Now, let's welcome He Lou to our stage.

89
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
OK.

90
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,180
OK, so please welcome the 21 judges

91
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,620
who have just performed for the two singers.

92
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
The vote for the second choice.

93
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,140
He Lou, her appearance and her vocal

94
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,260
the way she sang, it's perfectly max.

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,300
I think he Lou, I really appreciate him.

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,060
He is so good at singing.

97
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,300
He is so bright on the stage.

98
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,700
Please, the three teachers,

99
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,300
please tell us your choice.

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,380
Mr. Ze,

101
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,620
the choice is Ocean.

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,820
Ocean got one vote.

103
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,260
Ms. Liang, the choice is Ocean.

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,220
Ocean got two votes.

105
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
Mr. Jaycee,

106
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,780
your choice is

107
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,300
Hello.

108
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,580
I've got a young lady.

109
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,700
Hello.

110
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Hello, yeah.

111
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,900
C.L.O.U.

112
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,860
Thank you.

113
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,380
I really want...

114
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,700
I wish that she gave me a vote.

115
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,340
Hello.

116
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,140
Hello, yeah.

117
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,180
C.L.O.U.

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,340
I was planning to ask her that

119
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,180
can I take the vote that you wrote my name...

120
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,620
I will keep it forever.

121
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,500
I want that.

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,940
But I don't want to be on your side.

123
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
OK.

124
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,180
So, Mr. Jaycee,

125
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,420
I hope that you can give me a vote.

126
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,100
I wanted it, but she wrote color.

127
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
I'll say it.

128
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,740
Congratulations to Da Hai for leading the show.

129
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,660
Let's immediately pay attention to

130
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,420
the final voting result of the judges

131
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,820
who are from the online stage.

132
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,260
I chose Da Hai.

133
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,660
When I heard him sing,

134
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,060
I felt like I was watching a big person

135
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,020
chatting with him.

136
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,460
His voice is like a moon.

137
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,340
You can hear his low voice

138
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,660
and his nasal voice.

139
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,460
His fake voice is also beautiful.

140
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,300
I chose Ke Lo for this show.

141
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,100
He has a beautiful voice

142
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,060
and I feel very comfortable listening to him.

143
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,700
Ke Lo, when he sings,

144
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,220
he sings like a cow or a deer.

145
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,660
The final voting result of the online teacher is...

146
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,460
The total of Ke Lo won 6 votes.

147
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,620
Da Hai won 18 votes.

148
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,860
Congratulations to Da Hai for winning.

149
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,140
Congratulations.

150
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,660
Thank you so much.

151
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,740
Much appreciated.

152
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,140
Ke Lo, you're welcome.

153
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,740
It's a great song.

154
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm very happy for him.

155
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,500
Because I'm a little bit proud of him.

156
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,100
When he's happy,

157
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,060
I'm also very happy.

158
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,220
Because I'm more excited

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,700
to see him.

160
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
At one moment,

161
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,660
I'm the happiest person.

162
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,740
Yes, I did it.

163
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,620
Oh, G.S.E.J.

164
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,420
I did it.

165
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,260
Oh, G.S.E.J.

166
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,100
Let's start.

167
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:39,900
I'll sleep.

168
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,380
I'll sleep on the bed.

169
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,100
So smooth.

170
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's look forward to the next

171
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,980
new singer.

172
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,740
Come on.

173
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,060
Come on, Yang Renze.

174
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Come on.

175
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,500
Yang Renze's hometown is Shenzhen, Guangdong.

176
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,740
It's a window of China's reform and opening.

177
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,820
And music is the biggest feature of multi-channel packaging.

178
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
It's one of the most popular music in China.

179
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,860
Hello, friends of Asia.

180
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,140
Hello, I'm Yang Renze,

181
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,660
a Chinese singer.

182
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,660
The most glorious moment is

183
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,740
I've been practicing a lot,

184
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,620
performing a lot of music.

185
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,780
They all like to call me Zhai Ge.

186
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,180
I've been to a very far place in China.

187
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,100
But I sold it.

188
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,260
The band has experienced many stages with me.

189
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,700
But it's over.

190
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,780
It's much more exciting when they come here.

191
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm leaving now.

192
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
But do you wish to meet me?

193
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,780
For you, I won't come anymore,

194
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,620
because you will not meet me.

195
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,660
But I have my guitar.

196
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,620
Wanyun Shoulder &ól & R pumped

197
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,420
music to eliminate the frequency of noise.

198
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,940
This lady is my stage.

199
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,460
Wave Option?

200
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,580
Wave Option?

201
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,500
Which one?

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I love you

203
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,900
Are you happy?

204
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Are you looking forward to it?

205
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,700
Do you still remember the romantic moments?

206
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,500
The people hiding in the smoke

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,700
Are you scared?

208
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,100
Do you still remember the little horse?

209
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Do you still remember me?

210
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Do you still remember the silly moments?

211
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Where will you go?

212
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
I won't go anywhere

213
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Where will you go?

214
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I won't go anywhere

215
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,300
I remember the wine I had been through

216
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,500
I remember the wine I had been selling over there

217
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,900
But I don't dare to drink alone

218
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,700
I have been through the mountains

219
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,900
I want to drive my lazy motorbike

220
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
To turn around

221
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,500
But I, but I, but I'm afraid of being buried

222
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,300
My faith, my faith

223
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:48,700
I will give you everything

224
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,100
The good news

225
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
As for your confession

226
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

227
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,100
There is a place where I am

228
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,900
Someone opens the door for me

229
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
He's cool

230
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Yeah, I agree

231
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
The guitar really adds to it

232
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah

233
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,700
My faith, my faith

234
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I will give you everything

235
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,500
The good news

236
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,700
As for your confession

237
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,500
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

238
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,500
There is a place where I am

239
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Someone opens the door for me

240
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,500
As for your confession

241
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Don't be afraid

242
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,300
Someone opens the door for me

243
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:09,300
Someone opens the door for me

244
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Always open, always open

245
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,300
The good news

246
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,700
What's the song?

247
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,300
When he performed, he was so good

248
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
The more he played the guitar, the more he was so cool

249
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
I want to sing his voice

250
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Hi

251
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Hi

252
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
How are you? Good?

253
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Yeah, I'm fine

254
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Yeah, I feel good

255
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I feel good

256
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I feel good

257
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I feel good

258
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,900
I think you are really brave

259
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,700
coming up here with your guitar

260
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,500
and doing something different

261
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
So I think that's something that

262
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,500
I used to be in a girl band

263
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,700
and then when I went solo

264
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,300
you have to really transition into

265
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,500
being the only person on stage

266
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,900
having everybody's focus

267
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,100
I think it would be wonderful

268
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,700
if you move forward in this competition

269
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,100
if you did something acoustic

270
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,700
I think it would really enable you to explore

271
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
who you are with the guitar alone without your band

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
But I think it was fun

273
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,900
and I love your suit

274
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Thank you

275
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm really happy

276
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,700
It's like a recognition for my clothes

277
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,300
Yang Run's whole body is very youthful

278
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
and young

279
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,300
and clean

280
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,700
Actually, from this song

281
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,300
you can hear Yang Run's voice

282
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,700
It's very variable

283
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
and explosive

284
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
So do you usually play the band?

285
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
Yeah, I started playing the band

286
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
since I was in college

287
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,300
and I've been the main vocal of the band

288
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,900
and today I'm

289
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,500
the vocal of my own

290
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,300
and the stage

291
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
Why do you want to choose this song?

292
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,300
Because I usually like

293
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,900
listening to rock music

294
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
and this song is also

295
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,900
one of my favorite songs

296
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Because when I listen to you sing

297
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,100
Actually, the song I like

298
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
has different directions

299
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,700
One is singing the character

300
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,900
and the other is singing the original me

301
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,300
I will draw you to the one

302
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,500
that sings the original me

303
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,700
It's to remove all the technicalities

304
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,500
and remove the emotions

305
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,700
that are completely in your heart

306
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,900
So when I saw you

307
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,300
getting the instrument

308
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,700
the energy level of your inner heart

309
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
and the mental level

310
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm looking forward to seeing more

311
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
So what do you want to say

312
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
to the singer who will challenge you?

313
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,300
I'm very pizza

314
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,500
so I want to come here

315
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,900
OK

316
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,100
Give the time and stage to the next

317
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
challenger

318
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Ten, nine

319
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,700

Who will they be?

332
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,660
At first, I thought, have I started?

333
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
10, 9

334
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Have I started 10?

335
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
But I've actually started

336
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
I thought I didn't start again

337
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
So, within that, I got the talent

338
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660

I think you'll get the talent

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm okay

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Change the many things

380
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,660
You are not dead

381
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I want to be brave

382
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,660
I want to find

383
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,660
The truth

384
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,660
The truth

385
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Wow

386
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Wow

387
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
I want to run

388
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,660
To the heart

389
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Wow

390
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Wow

391
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Wow

392
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Wow

393
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Wow

394
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Wow

395
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Wow

396
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
He was amazing

397
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
I think he surprised all of us

398
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Wonderful

399
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Wonderful

400
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
So cute

401
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Introduce yourself

402
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Hello, I'm Amushali

403
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
My name is Muhammad Amishafiq

404
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
I'm Muhammad Satri

405
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,660
I'm from Malaysia

406
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,660
I just heard his song

407
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,660
It reminds me of a Chinese singer named Zhou Shen

408
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,660
I think when he first came out

409
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,660
I was a little nervous

410
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Do you know him?

411
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Yes, I know about Zhou Shen

412
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
Chinese in Malaysia

413
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,660
See me like Zhou Shen

414
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,660
But his voice is really better than me

415
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
But your voice is great

416
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Thank you

417
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,660
It's limited to a male singer like Zhou Shen

418
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,660
I think he must be proud and cherish this song

419
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Another one is

420
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
He chose this song today

421
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,660
A very lively and lively song

422
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
For the growth of this love song

423
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,660
I think he must be clear about the level

424
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,660
He must be a good listener

425
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
I think he is a good listener

426
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,660
I think he is a good listener

427
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Thank you

428
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Hello

429
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Hello

430
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
I think it was amazing

431
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Thank you so much

432
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
I wanted you to move

433
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
Because you are so still

434
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
And then you started doing this

435
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,660
And I was like he's gonna go

436
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
He's gonna go

437
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
But you did it

438
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
You stayed still

439
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
Use the stage

440
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Use your power

441
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,660
You have this Freddie Mercury angel

442
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Powerful thing

443
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
I love Malaysia

444
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Fantastic

445
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
I really do think you need to celebrate

446
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Thank you

447
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
Now

448
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Let's welcome Yang Renzhe

449
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
back to our stage

450
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Please come to the stage

451
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
to vote for the 2nd place

452
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
I think my performance is good

453
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
The wind blew me away

454
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
I was in the stage

455
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,660
I feel so scared and scared

456
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I'm sure I've lost the chance

457
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,660
to make one more important addition

458
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
I'm here to celebrate

459
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Please choose the 3rd place

460
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Jaycee

461
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Thank you

462
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Yang Renzhe, your choice is

463
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Thank you

464
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Renzhe got a vote

465
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
Brother A'Zhe, your choice is

466
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
Thank you

467
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
Renzhe may not have a word on the performance

468
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,660
But his music

469
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,660
is relatively

470
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
touching

471
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Let's watch the performance

472
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
The 21 judges

473
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,660
voted for the 2nd place

474
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Amusa is a very emotional

475
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,660
and powerful producer

476
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
I'm sure many people

477
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
want to work with her

478
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
She will have a new song

479
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Yang Renzhe is not ideal

480
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
The word ending

481
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,660
is very pitiful

482
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
He is very emotional

483
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
He is very emotional

484
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
The word ending

485
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660
is very pitiful

486
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660
He didn't sing well

487
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
He didn't

488
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
give her a full score

489
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
in this performance

490
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
The final vote is

491
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,660
Yang Renzhe got 2 votes

492
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,660
Amusa got 19 votes

493
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Congratulations

494
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Amusa got a chance

495
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
to sing the song

496
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Congratulations

497
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Thank you so much

498
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
I really appreciate it

499
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
Oh my god

500
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
So cute

501
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,660
Wow

502
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
So cute

503
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,660
So cute

504
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Looks like Amusa

505
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
is still quite emotional

506
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
It's good to cry

507
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Let it out

508
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Yeah

509
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,660
It's good

510
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
I love a good girl

511
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
I'll cry

512
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Yeah

513
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Make it louder

514
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,660
So fine

515
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,660
That's fine

516
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,660
When I saw the vote

517
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
from the judges

518
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,660
online judges

519
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
I was excited

520
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
I felt so happy

521
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
I felt so grateful

522
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
when the judges

523
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,660
from online

524
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,660
judged Amusa

525
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
The challenge singers

526
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,660
win 2-3

527
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,660
Let's welcome

528
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
the last new singer

529
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
to the stage

530
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Come on

531
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Go for it

532
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Yang Renzhe

533
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Come on

534
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
Thank you

535
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Come on

536
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
Come on

537
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
It's not for

538
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
me

539
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
I feel so proud

540
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
when I'm not famous

541
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Pan Hong's hometown

542
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
is Ganzhou, Jiangxi

543
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
Ganzhou is one of

544
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
the source of

545
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
the music of the guest house

546
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Hi, I'm Pan Hong

547
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
I haven't been

548
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
a singer for a long time

549
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
I suddenly got a

550
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
notification from

551
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
the Yajou Star's interview

552
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
That day

553
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
became the happiest day

554
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
in my two years

555
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm going to get on the boat

556
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
with the new captain

557
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,660
I was so excited

558
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
I was watching the sea

559
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
and I could feel

560
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
the moment of the sea

561
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,660
Everything was not real

562
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I was really

563
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
riding on the boat

564
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
I

565
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Today is a sunny day

566
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,660
I met a group of

567
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
friends

568
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
The bitter Renzhe

569
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
The hot girl

570
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
The sweet shell

571
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
And your old friend

572
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
The fat girl and Honghao

573
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
They are all different

574
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
I like them

575
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
I was on the stage

576
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
on the stage

577
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
I felt so beautiful

578
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
when I was singing

579
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
The wind was strong

580
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
When I was talking

581
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
I felt like

582
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
I was flying with the sound of the stream

583
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Today is the festival

584
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,660
I wore the high heels of the wine

585
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
This dream

586
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
is about to begin

587
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,140
And the expressions

588
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,660
are really good

589
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,660
So pretty

590
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
beautiful

591
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,140
She is more publicized

592
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,060
and should be known well

593
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,820
She can come too

594
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,580
洗 herself

595
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,580
Duan fabulous

596
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,980
I want to give him something

597
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,780
I'm bored

598
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,980
Suddenly I think of you

599
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,780
I'm bored

600
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,780
comforting myself

601
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,180
Beautiful

602
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:26,180
The silence is a sweet encounter

603
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:34,180
At least he won't make people too proud

604
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:42,180
Maybe I need a proof

605
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Without you, I really can

606
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,180
I'm alone, breathing

607
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Looking up

608
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:06,180
All the traces of the loss

609
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,180
If there is a chance

610
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,180
Please continue

611
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:22,180
I want to give you a warm welcome

612
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:30,180
I still love you

613
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:37,180
I don't want to hear you say it

614
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:45,180
But sometimes it feels

615
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Let me see you again

616
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:03,180
The loneliness is a sweet encounter

617
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:11,180
At least he won't make people too proud

618
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Maybe I need a proof

619
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Without you, I really can

620
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,180
I'm alone, breathing

621
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Looking up

622
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,180
All the traces of the loss

623
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,180
If there is a chance

624
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Please continue

625
00:36:52,180 --> 00:37:00,180
I want to give you a warm welcome

626
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:07,180
I still love you

627
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:15,180
I don't want to hear you say it

628
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:24,180
But sometimes it feels

629
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
So beautiful

630
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:35,180
Let me see you again

631
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:45,180
Let me see myself again

632
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
You sang so well

633
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,180
I didn't draw my hands

634
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,180
The painting is too strong

635
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,180
I love the song

636
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
I sit here and cover the blanket

637
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,180
And the seat has a heating function

638
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
You know the song she sang

639
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
I said I'm going to start dreaming

640
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Every detail won't disturb my dream

641
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,180
It makes me feel more comfortable

642
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,180
I forgot to blow the wind

643
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,180
And she has a very clear character

644
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,180
And she slowly tells her story

645
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
All these details

646
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,180
She's singing with the sea wind, waves, and waves

647
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,180
She even has a good design

648
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
She's like what she should be

649
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
The wind is too strong

650
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,180
My head is blown away

651
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
I can't push it

652
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
I don't know about others

653
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,180
But I'm really hard to hold the wind

654
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,180
The wind is so strong

655
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
It's a great performance

656
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,180
I think her voice is a great weapon

657
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,180
to make you calm down

658
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Yes

659
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,180
She uses a simple and flat thing

660
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
to stand on this stage

661
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,180
So I think no matter if she can

662
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,180
stand on this position

663
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Pan Hong's voice and her music

664
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
are all in the past

665
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
I think it's irreplaceable

666
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Pan Hong, great

667
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Hi

668
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Hi, Jason

669
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,180
Hi, love, you look beautiful

670
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
I think you have a very individual tone

671
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
I think that's you guys

672
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
The feeling that you create is very cinematic

673
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
It feels very grand

674
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,180
It feels like your voice is in a film or a movie

675
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
And I think that's something

676
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
that's really amazing to tap into

677
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Yeah, I think to sing like that

678
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
in this freezing cold wind

679
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,180
is really impressive to have that control

680
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,180
and your pitch to stay completely on

681
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
I think it was really lovely

682
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,180
But don't play it too safe

683
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
That would be my only thing to say

684
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Okay, thank you, Jason

685
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Thank you

686
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,180
So, for the new backup team

687
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,180
Do you have anything to say

688
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,180
to the singer who wants to give you a challenge?

689
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Welcome to my stage

690
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Please come with me

691
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Welcome to the stage of challenge

692
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Ladies and gentlemen

693
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
music and variety

694
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,940
我覺得

695
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,180
in hazardous cultural memories

696
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
At the same time

697
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
hspla приним�

698
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,180
house song

699
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,180
works really specialty

700
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:11,660
The world has its own

701
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
He's the main

702
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Du Noir

703
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,900
Hello, everyone.

704
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,060
I'm Main, Zhong Ling.

705
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,340
I made my debut in 2005.

706
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,340
I'm going to debut for 20 years this year.

707
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,500
Since he was 13,

708
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,340
he has been into the new selection contest of the new HURRY PRO.

709
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,740
He has become a popular songwriter.

710
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,220
Main has been able to sing with his unique voice

711
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,060
and has conquered many of his songs.

712
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,500
He has been to the Japanese dance hall.

713
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,980
He has been to Asia, Europe and America.

714
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,180
His music is on the global stage.

715
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,700
He is very active.

716
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,860
I believe that music will be the only thing

717
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,460
in the world that will make him a singer.

718
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,300
I will do my best to get him to sing like that.

719
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,020
Let's go.

720
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,740
He is a great singer.

721
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,980
I think he can win with his power.

722
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,980
That's why I challenged him.

723
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,380
He is so cool.

724
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
He is like across the sea from Japan.

725
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,100
He is a very nice man.

726
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,260
Don't cry.

727
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,260
Very beautiful.

728
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,060
I come to you.

729
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,860
ды

730
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,580
Are they coming or not?

731
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,380
The vocal is brilliant.

732
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,820
Yes, they are

733
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,500
suggestions for new songs.

734
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,100
For darling nothing that we can do

735
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,500
The two of us are the only one

736
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,900
No matter how just because

737
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,300
Don't be afraid to lose

738
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,300
So touch I got it

739
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,100
Never give up I won't let you go

740
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,700
Even if it's just a game

741
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,300
Even if you don't have to touch it

742
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,900
Don't panic, don't worry never die

743
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,900
I'll keep drawing with my heart

744
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,300
I'm ready to go

745
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:01,300
I'm no reason to be away

746
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,500
The world that has turned black

747
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
We can't go back anymore

748
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,900
The season that has never been so good

749
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,900
Is forever

750
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,500
Just go come as come

751
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,300
The world is full of sins

752
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Is on seven seven on your eye

753
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,100
Let's imagine again

754
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Just I'm on the borderline

755
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,700
I can't go beyond the hope

756
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,300
Never give up I won't let you go

757
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,900
Even if it's just a game

758
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,500
Even if it's just a place where I drew my feelings

759
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Believe your way and go away

760
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,700
My heart is like a flower

761
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,900
The dream of the same as my imagination

762
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,300
Right now in my hand

763
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,500
The world that has turned black

764
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:19,900
I'm gonna pray for you

765
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:42,940
OK

766
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,220
It's really a hot song

767
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,820
When I watched some Japanese animation

768
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,740
I was curious

769
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,620
how their theme song is

770
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,620
I think

771
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,780
it's just like

772
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Mr.Yi's performance

773
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,780
It's really worth learning

774
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,220
Before he sang

775
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,260
he was very polite

776
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
Thank you

777
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,260
He looks very gentle

778
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,020
Thank you

779
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,620
But as soon as he took the mic

780
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,460
and stood in the middle of the stage

781
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,580
he immediately became

782
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,060
his own song

783
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,340
He became very fierce

784
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,540
very violent

785
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,900
Thank you, Zhong Lingya Yi

786
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,500
for bringing us this song

787
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Thank you

788
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,540
Please introduce yourself

789
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,100
I'm Mei Ying Zhong Lingya Yi

790
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm from Japan

791
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,340
I'm so happy today

792
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,380
Thank you

793
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,940
Thank you

794
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,260
So sincere

795
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,180
I really like

796
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,860
the energy on the stage

797
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,140
I think you can

798
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,740
fill up your energy

799
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,500
I can easily follow his performance

800
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,700
and enter the music

801
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,260
I really like this

802
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,660
Thank you

803
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,100
It's so hard to...

804
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,620
You're so different

805
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,260
You know

806
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,980
The belief that you had in yourself

807
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,620
from the second you stepped on the stage

808
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,420
the passion that you had was undeniable

809
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,980
I think vocally

810
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,780
a little pitchy and a little bit

811
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,380
it wasn't as strong

812
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,620
as I think you probably can deliver

813
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,420
But your performance and your belief

814
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,980
and your just emotion was so compelling

815
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,020
that

816
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,420
I kind of didn't focus so much on that

817
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,540
So I just want to congratulate you

818
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,620
Thank you

819
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,780
I want to ask you a question

820
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,940
Ya Yi is also a

821
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,900
a very famous singer in Japan

822
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,380
With her background and height in the band

823
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,420
she is a young player

824
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,260
and also a P.E.K.

825
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,820
What is her attitude?

826
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,420
I debuted in Japan

827
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,100
and I've been in Japan for 20 years

828
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
20 years

829
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,700
Three times

830
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,500
I've been able to perform in China

831
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,380
and other countries

832
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,300
But I want to make more dreams come true

833
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,020
I believe that career and age

834
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,180
will not end

835
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,020
So I want to show you

836
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
more and more hard work

837
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,100
I want to show you

838
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,420
more and more hard work

839
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,580
to the fans who are supporting me

840
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,540
I came here to sing

841
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,340
to tell you that I don't have any dreams

842
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,540
You are the star of the show

843
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,180
Yes

844
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,220
Now let's welcome Pan Hong to the stage

845
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,100
Please come to the stage

846
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,340
to vote for the two singers

847
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,660
for the two singers

848
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,900
I can't predict the ratio between us

849
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,460
I think we are two different types

850
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,140
Honestly, I didn't know

851
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,980
the damage

852
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,580
but of course it was great

853
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,340
Have the two singers decided?

854
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,500
All right

855
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,820
Brother A'zheng is your choice

856
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,580
Pan Hong

857
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,780
Congratulations to Pan Hong

858
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,580
for winning one week

859
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,460
All those dishes here

860
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,900
This is why

861
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,940
I chose her

862
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,700
as a very important bicycle

863
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Your choice is...

864
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,700
So I will win with Emain.

865
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,700
Thank you.

866
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Congratulations to Emain for getting one vote.

867
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,700
Emain.

868
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,700
The energy that you brought is definitely lacking

869
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,700
in the other performances.

870
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,700
And I think you bring something to this competition

871
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,700
that is really important.

872
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,700
So I wanted to really show my support

873
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,700
and love for you too.

874
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,700
Thank you.

875
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,700
Yang Ying, your choice is...

876
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Pan Hong, congratulations to Pan Hong for getting one more vote.

877
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,700
So great.

878
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Let's immediately pay attention to the final result of the online judges.

879
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,700
I chose Pan Hong.

880
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,700
The music is turning into a soft line and a deep line.

881
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,700
Pan Hong performed better this time.

882
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,700
He sings well with his voice.

883
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
He has been into the music world.

884
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,700
He sings very touchingly.

885
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Yang Ying's stage performance is very impressive.

886
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,700
But his singing and the skills he uses

887
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,700
and the style of the song are not very good.

888
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,700
I can also hear his strength.

889
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,700
Pan Hong's voice is very harsh.

890
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,700
His voice and the sense of rhythm are great.

891
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,700
That's why I was the most attracted to him.

892
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,700
The music itself requires a lot of power.

893
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,700
The speed is important.

894
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,700
You have to keep going up to the top.

895
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
I think it was very difficult.

896
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,700
But I felt that the top of the face

897
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,700
didn't go up too much.

898
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,700
I felt that it was a waste of time.

899
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,700
The result of the online judges' vote is...

900
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,700
So great.

901
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
Pan Hong's 22 votes.

902
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,700
Mei's 2 votes.

903
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,700
Congratulations to Pan Hong for winning this round.

904
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,700
22 votes.

905
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,700
I got 22 votes.

906
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,700
That's so great.

907
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm so happy.

908
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,700
When I first saw the fire,

909
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,700
I was very happy.

910
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
I was very happy.

911
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,700
I was very happy.

912
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
When I first saw him,

913
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,700
he was very cute and beautiful.

914
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,700
His voice was so beautiful.

915
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,700
It was great.

916
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,700
He is very separated from me.

917
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,700
I want to face a friend I just met.

918
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,700
I appreciate his stage.

919
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,700
I want to compete with him.

920
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
The final result is still the same.

921
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,700
I will be happy because of the score.

922
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,700
But I will feel that

923
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,700
he is so cruel.

924
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
I will feel that

925
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,700
he is not the type of person who is kind.

926
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,700
One vote.

927
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,700
I didn't think that he would be so different.

928
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,700
I didn't think that he would be like,

929
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
oh my god.

930
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,700
I think that

931
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
he is very different.

932
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,700
I think that he is very different.

933
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,700
I don't know what to say.

934
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,700
When I sing good music

935
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,700
and I have a good time,

936
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
I think that

937
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,700
I can sing good songs.

938
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,700
I think that I can enjoy the audience.

939
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
The song is

940
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,700
about my faith.

941
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,700
I think that I can sing

942
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
good songs

943
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
and my music

944
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,700
when I sing with all my strength.

945
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,700
I think that it is fun.

946
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,700
That's why

947
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,700
I think that

948
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,700
I have the best stage.

949
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,700
The new singer team wins this round.

950
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,700
The score is 3-3.

951
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Please welcome the six candidates

952
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,700
to come back to the stage.

953
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,700
You will be the three teachers

954
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,700
and the 21 professional musicians

955
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,700
of all countries in Asia.

956
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,700

by the first round of the competition.

959
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,700
Hello, judges.

960
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,700
After the first six rounds of

00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,700
the competition,

962
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,700
six new singers

963
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,700
have won the chance to sing.

Choose your favorite two

966
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,700
and please vote.

967
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
OK.

968
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,700
Thank you for voting.

969
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,700
The voting result

970
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
is recorded in the third part

971
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,700
of my hand.

972
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,700
At this moment,

973
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,700
please count the votes

974
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,700

to the voting card.

976
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,700
Aisin Juelome and Danilia.

977
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,700
Aze is the one who voted for them.

978
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Aisin Juelome and Dahai.

979
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,700
Aze,

980
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,700
who is your favorite two?

981
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,700
So I have chosen

00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,700
Main and Amsa.

983
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,700
Main and Amsa.

984
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
Now I will announce

985
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,700
the voting result of the judges.

986
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,700

Amsa gets 15 votes.

00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,700
Amsa gets 12 votes.

993
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,700
I vote for Pan Hong.

994
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,700
She is a very good singer.

995
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,700
She has the understanding

996
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,700
of singing and singing.

997
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,700
She has a lot of details

998
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,700
of singing.

999
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,700
She has a clear mind.

1000
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,700
She has a lot of flow

1001
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
in the story.

1002
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,700
She invites us

1003
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,700
to go to the emotional stage.

1004
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,700
We can feel the emotional stage.

1005
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,700
Pan Hong is a good singer.

1006
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Amsa has a good singing and singing.

1007
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,700
Her personality is so special.

1008
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
Her voice is very clear.

1009
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,700
She is very full of energy.

1010
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,700
She is very gentle.

1011
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,700
She is very strong.

1012
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,700
She has the eyes of the audience.

1013
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,700
I voted for Amsa

1014
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,700
until the last vote.

1015
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,700
But the female judges

1016
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,700
had a very strong vocal power.

1017
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,700
So I voted for Amsa.

1018
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,700
The Asian New Year's show

1019
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
has been born.

1020
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,700
Congratulations to Amsa and Pan Hong

1021
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,700
for entering the next round of the competition.

1022
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,700
We choose Huang Jia and Meisou Jiaer.

1023
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,700
They are 50% natural and are so protective.

1024
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,700
They can reach 30 times the gold and silver.

1025
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,700
Why can't you grow up?

1026
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Huang Jia and Meisou Jiaer.

1027
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,700
Welcome the audience to sing

1028
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,700
the song that Pan Hong brought us.

1029
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,700
PS, I love you.

1030
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,700
Here you are.

1031
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,700
I love you.

1032
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,700
I love you.

1033
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
I love you.

1034
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,700
I love you.

1035
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
I love you.

1036
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,700
I love you.

1037
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,700
I love you.

1038
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,700
I can't forget

1039
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:19,700
the first time you asked me

1040
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,700
Thank you, Pan Hong.

1041
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,700
Let's welcome the audience to sing

1042
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,700
the song that Amsa brought us.

1043
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,700
Koo Masara, my youth.

1044
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,700
His voice is really...

1045
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
I love you.

1046
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,700
I love you.

1047
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,700
I love you.

1048
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,700
I love you.

1049
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,700
I love you.

1050
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,700
I love you.

1051
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Thank you.

1052
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,700
Thank you.

1053
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
Thank you.

1054
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,700
I'm so happy.

1055
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,700
Thank you.

1056
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,700
You are the best.

1057
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
I'm so happy.

1058
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Thank you.

1059
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,700
Thank you.

1060
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,700
Thank you.

1061
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,100
I think the performance of this song

1062
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,700
is totally different from what

1063
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,980
Jackson said to him before

1064
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,660
enjoying a bigger stage

1065
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,100
He really enjoyed a bigger stage

1066
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,180
It's a performance that's completely better for us

1067
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,540
Pan Hong, I want to say this song

1068
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,940
You finally let me hear you in the second half

1069
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,860
Especially the side with the aura

1070
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,300
It's very touching

1071
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,980
So Liang Yingjie

1072
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,220
Your choice is

1073
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,780
My choice is Pan Hong

1074
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:05,020
OK

1075
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,220
Congratulations to Pan Hong for getting one vote

1076
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,740
JC

1077
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,500
I think it has to be mentioned again

1078
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,420
that it's freezing

1079
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,740
and it's midnight

1080
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,140
and this isn't a normal situation

1081
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,300
to be doing this intense moment

1082
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,020
at this time of night

1083
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:26,940
in this weather

1084
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,340
So great job on just even showing up

1085
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,620
and doing it, you know

1086
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,740
This isn't easy

1087
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,540
However, I feel your performance

1088
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,420
is still so much of an artist

1089
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,140
I can see how you move as an artist

1090
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,100
and I really love that

1091
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,940
and I appreciate that

1092
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,100
alongside the vocals

1093
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,060
And I think that's something

1094
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,900
I need to see more from Pam

1095
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,980
JC, your vote is

1096
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,900
So for me, I have one vote for Amsa

1097
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,100
OK

1098
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,380
Congratulations to Amusa for getting one vote

1099
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,740
JC, your choice is

1100
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,860
Pan Hong

1101
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,860
Congratulations to Pan Hong for getting one vote

1102
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,220
and getting one vote

1103
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,100
Let's pay attention to

1104
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,860
the voting results of the judges

1105
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,420
Newlyweds, Jia Doubao

1106
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,460
and you, please stand by

1107
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,820
I choose Amusa

1108
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,100
Her tone is very delicate

1109
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,020
and she's very stable

1110
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,900
and she controls the movements very well

1111
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,060
Amusa is very difficult to sing

1112
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,820
What's good is that she can control the movements

1113
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,300
very well

1114
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,380
Pan Hong's full voice

1115
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,020
I think she sings every song

1116
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,460
as her own song

1117
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,140
The thing that she sings

1118
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,180
is that she doesn't know the lyrics

1119
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,420
But I think she's watching the music

1120
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,500
The scores of the judges have come out

1121
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,700
Let's welcome

1122
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,780
Newlyweds, Mr Zhang Lianying

1123
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,820
to announce

1124
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,780
the final singer of the Asian Newlyweds

1125
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,740
of Jia Doubao

1126
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,660
Newlyweds, Pan Hong VS

1127
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,660
Newlyweds, Amusa

1128
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,620
7 votes is 14 votes

1129
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,260
Plus the three of us

1130
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,580
Jia Doubao, Newlyweds, Amusa

1131
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,820
and the king of singing

1132
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,420
She is

1133
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,420
Who is it?

1134
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,980
Amusa

1135
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,020
Congratulations

1136
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,380
Pan Hong is coming

1137
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,580
She's coming

1138
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,580
She's coming

1139
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,140
She's coming

1140
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,900
She's coming

1141
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,620
She's coming

1142
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,020
Congratulations

1143
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,500
Thank you

1144
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,340
Thank you

1145
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,620
Thank you so much

1146
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,620
Thank you

1147
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,740
Actually, I'm very proud of my friend

1148
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,540
because she's more powerful than me

1149
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,900
Basically, I agree with the judges

1150
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,420
Actually

1151
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,780
Thank you so much

1152
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,780
Thank you

1153
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:26,620
I'm not really a national contestant

1154
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,620
but I really like the way she speaks

1155
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,620
Even if the language and the culture

1156
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,620
are different from what people usually talk about

1157
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,620
the culture that people have lived in

1158
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,620
or the things that people want to say

1159
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,620
After people are nervous

1160
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,620
they often go on fire

1161
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,620
and they want to come to Jia Doubao

1162
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,620
At the same time, you have to witness

1163
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,620
your important moment with Newlyweds

1164
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,620
Come on, Hong Ge Guan

1165
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,620
Cheers

1166
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,620
Thank you so much

1167
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,620
I'm afraid of fire and Jia Doubao

1168
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,620
Our Newlyweds

1169
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,620
will perform all the Asian Newlyweds

1170
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,620
and continue to conquer the battle

1171
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,620
right and left

1172
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,620
All the best

1173
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,620
to announce the next

1174
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,620
journey of music and exploration

1175
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,620
Thank you

1176
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,620
We finally got the first day

1177
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,620
It's great

1178
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,620
We just...

1179
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,620
Of course I won't let you do it

1180
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,620
I'm a contract worker

1181
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,620
I just told Mr. Zhou that he's a temporary worker

1182
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,620
He's not a temporary worker

1183
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,620
You're laughing

1184
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,620
You two are talking very happily

1185
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,620
Brother

1186
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,620
Brother, sit down

1187
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,620
Please sit

1188
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,620
Thank you

1189
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,620
I'm a temporary worker

1190
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,620
I'm so tired

1191
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,620
I'm so tired

1192
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,620
I'm so tired

1193
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,620
I'm so tired

1194
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,620
I'm so tired

1195
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,620
We're just temporary workers

1196
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,620
So I think it's not easy for the players

1197
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,620
They actually get up early

1198
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,620
and the whole day of the journey

1199
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,620
is actually a big problem

1200
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,620
They're still young

1201
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,620
It's not easy

1202
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,620
I think you're not easy

1203
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,620
It's okay

1204
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:05,620
There are so many new things to remember

1205
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,620
Yes

1206
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,620
Welcome the newlyweds

1207
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,620
and the people who are looking for you

1208
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,620
The current priority is

1209
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,620
You feel only be cool?

1210
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,620
You're so cool

1211
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,620
Can you give a jacket to Danily?

1212
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,620
Why are you crying?

1213
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,620
It's okay

1214
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,620
Don't cry

1215
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,620
I'm so nervous

1216
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,620
Five, four, three, two, one

1217
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,620
No

1218
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,620
Welcome the next challenger

1219
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,620
to the stage

1220
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,620
My state is

1221
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,620
You don't have to queue me

1222
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,620
You have to queue me

1223
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,620
You have to be queueed

1224
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,620
You have to queue yourself

1225
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,620
Yes

1226
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
You're so cute

1227
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,620
You're the one who has to queue yourself

1228
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,620
You're so cute

1229
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,620
So the two of you

1230
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,620
You are currently

1231
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,620
the most impressive for all the players today

1232
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,620
Let's talk about it

1233
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,620
The impressive

1234
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,620
I think the impressive is

1235
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,620
I think I'm the most impressive

1236
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,620
I think I'm the most impressive

1237
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,620
She's very special

1238
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,620
I like her rhythm

1239
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,620
She has a good laid back

1240
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,620
She's in a

1241
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,620
emotional point of the lyrics

1242
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,620
She's in a emotional point of the lyrics

1243
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,620
She's in a emotional point of the lyrics

1244
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,620
But for this song

1245
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,620
She's in a good state

1246
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,620
And the state on the stage

1247
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,620
is very stable

1248
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,620
and has young people's excitement

1249
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,620
and details

1250
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,620
and control

1251
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,620
But her emotions

1252
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,620
are completely released

1253
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,620
I think that boy

1254
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,620
We said

1255
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,620
that voice is controlled very well

1256
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,620
Wang Honghao

1257
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,620
How many boys sing

1258
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,620
Yes

1259
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,620
Her voice is quite special

1260
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,620
And it's suitable

1261
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,620
The feeling she gives on the stage

1262
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,620
without much feeling

1263
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,620
Yes

1264
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,620
It's the state of the whole person

1265
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,620
I think she sings for herself

1266
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,620
She's in her own world

1267
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,620
Yes, this is also a way of performing

1268
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,620
Yes

1269
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,620
And then there's a part

1270
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,620
that we need to help

1271
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,620
the new singers to sit down

1272
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,620
and then sit down

1273
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,620
Just help them

1274
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,620
There's a sign behind us

1275
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,620
We can stand up and look at it

1276
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,620
I want to be the lowest and

1277
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,620
the highest voice in the whole scene

1278
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,620
This is not good

1279
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,620
Then I choose

1280
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,620
I feel that they are

1281
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,620
a little bit heart-to-heart

1282
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,620
Who?

1283
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,620
Flower Father

1284
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,620
The beauty of love

1285
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,620
She's beautiful

1286
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,620
It's true

1287
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,620
Because she really sings

1288
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,620
very, very, very well

1289
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,620
I don't know

1290
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,620
But I want to say thank you

1291
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,620
I think they can be good friends

1292
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,620
I think that

1293
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,620
Pan Hong and the little boys

1294
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,620
are together

1295
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,620
Pan Hong and the little boys

1296
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,620
are together

1297
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,620
together

1298
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,620
Pan Hong and the little boys

1299
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,620
are together

1300
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,620
It's very nice to be with

1301
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,620
Nili and Wang Honghao

1302
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,620
This is Jun and the beauty

1303
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,620
It's very eye-catching

1304
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,620
Yes, it's eye-catching

1305
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,620
This is eye-catching

1306
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,620
They are both singing

1307
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,620
OK

1308
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,620
Come on

1309
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,620
It's the effect of using it

1310
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,620
You are a young woman

1311
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,620
We are a marriage

1312
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,620
We are really a marriage

1313
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,620
Then we can

1314
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,620
invite them to the stage soon

1315
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Welcome you to the stage

1316
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,620
According to your name

1317
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,620
Hello

1318
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,620
Hello

1319
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,620
What's your MBTI?

1320
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,620
Do you know what?

1321
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,620
E

1322
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,620

01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,620

01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:01,620
Yes

1325
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,620
No

1326
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,620
You are E

1327
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,620
I

1328
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,620
Yes

1329
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,620
The green are

1330
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,620
You check later

1331
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,620
I will check later

1332
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,620
Hi

1333
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,620
Thank you

1334
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,620
Welcome

1335
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,620
Welcome

1336
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,620
Da Hai

1337
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,620
Welcome

1338
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,620
Please come in

1339
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,620
Hello, everyone

1340
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,620
Your performance is

1341
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,620
so great

1342
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,620
Amazing

1343
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,620
It's great

1344
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,620
I forgot my name

1345
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,620
The third one

1346
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,620
The third one

1347
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,620
The third one

1348
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,620
You are great

1349
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Thank you

1350
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,620
I am done

1351
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,620
How should I tell you?

1352
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,620
I am done

1353
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,620
I am done

1354
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,620
It's here

1355
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,620
Thank you

1356
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,620
You really say that

1357
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,620
my name is

1358
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,620
good for nose

1359
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,620
OK

1360
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,620
Good

1361
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,620
So

1362
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,620
Who called me?

1363
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,620
My friend

1364
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,620
I heard you are fever

1365
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,620
You have fever

1366
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,620
You feel better right now?

1367
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,620
Yes, much better

1368
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Because I don't have to say no

1369
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,620
The pressure is gone

1370
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,620
So now I have

1371
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,620
I know

1372
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,620
Happy again

1373
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,620
Are you satisfied

1374
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,620
with our arrangement?

1375
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,620
Why?

1376
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,620
OK

1377
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,620
Wait for the next one

1378
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,620
Yes

1379
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,620
What is that?

1380
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,620
You know what?

1381
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,620
I don't know

1382
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,620
Thai dance

1383
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,620
Are they from South Thailand?

1384
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,620
I think so

1385
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,620
It's different

1386
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,620
It's different

1387
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,620
So beautiful

1388
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,620
Thank you

1389
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,620
So beautiful

1390
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,620
Beautiful

1391
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,620
Beautiful

1392
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,620
Beautiful

1393
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,620
Thank you

1394
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,620
So beautiful

1395
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,620
Really?

1396
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,620
So beautiful

1397
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,620
So beautiful

1398
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,620
This line is so beautiful

1399
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:05,620
It's the whole song

1400
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,620
Thank you

1401
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,620
This is Ramonora

1402
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,620
It's a traditional Thai dance

1403
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,620
It's a long dance

1404
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Many years ago

1405
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,620
It's a person who

1406
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
loved and became

1407
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,620
a young man

1408
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,620
called Ramonora

1409
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,620
Thank you

1410
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,620
Thank you

1411
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,620
OK

1412
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,620
We have prepared

1413
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,620
a lot of Chinese food

1414
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,620
and a lot of Chinese food

1415
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:32,620
We have prepared

1416
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
a lot of Chinese food

1417
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,620
Let's see if you like it

1418
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,620
I love it

1419
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,620
I love it

1420
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,620
Spicy

1421
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,620
Honghao

1422
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,620
Can you eat spicy food?

1423
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,620
The dish with chili and fried pork

1424
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,620
is delicious

1425
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,620
The spicy food is also spicy

1426
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,620
I have to open a lot of Chinese food

1427
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,620
That's right

1428
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,620
You can order

1429
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,620
a lot of Chinese food

1430
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,620
You can order it

1431
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,620
If you want to give

1432
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,620
Chinese food

1433
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,620
a bowl of rice,

1434
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,620
you have to have cold tea

1435
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,620
You have to know that cold tea

1436
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,620
is not a normal drink

1437
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,620
It's one of the most

1438
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,620
non-title cultural products in China

1439
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,620
Now we have

1440
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,620
Chinese cold tea in town

1441
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,620
This can of cold tea

1442
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,620
is the spirit of

1443
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,620
the traditional Chinese food culture

1444
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,620
with the new classic

1445
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,620
Now we have

1446
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,620
a can of cold tea

1447
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,620
Come on

1448
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,620
Cheers

1449
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,620
Thank you

1450
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,620
Is there anyone

1451
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,620
who wants to be a little friend?

1452
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,620
I want to be a little boy

1453
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,620
because I think

1454
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,620
they three

1455
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,620
have brought a special performance

1456
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,620
Come on

1457
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,620
Come on

1458
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,620
Cheers

1459
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,620
Thank you

1460
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,620
Did he beg you?

1461
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,620
But you will know it

1462
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,620
I will know it

1463
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,620
I used to live in Thailand

1464
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,620
I used to live in Thailand

1465
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,620
I really adore

1466
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,620
with her

1467
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,620
So I'm open back

1468
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,620
Thank you so much

1469
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:35,620
You are my inspiration

1470
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:38,620
Good, very good

1471
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,620
You are so good

1472
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,620
You are good

1473
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,620
You are good

1474
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,620
They are going to find

1475
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,620
It seems that we don't need to translate

1476
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,620
She is different from the stage

1477
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:55,620
Enjoy

1478
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,620
Enjoy

1479
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,620
Enjoy, bad tip

1480
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,620
This is my first time to see Pan Hong

1481
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,620
I think

1482
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,620
she is like this

1483
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,620
in the moment you just started talking

1484
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:08,620
So you are like this

1485
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,620
Hello, everyone

1486
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,620
Now we are in the game section

1487
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,620
OK

1488
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,620
Now we choose a theme

1489
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,620
Under this theme

1490
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:18,620
everyone should

1491
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,620
sing a song in the scene

1492
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,620
This theme

1493
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,620
is in this theme

1494
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,620
Pass

1495
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,620
OK

1496
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:28,620
We don't have to

1497
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:29,620
mention it in the song

1498
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,620
But we just need to

1499
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,620
enter the scene

1500
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,620
and the picture will be OK

1501
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,620
What is the boat?

1502
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,620
How did Xiaofai sing the boat?

1503
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,620
What is it?

1504
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:48,620
What is it?

1505
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:55,620
I don't have a song

1506
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,620
Help me

1507
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,620
I think I need to search this phone

1508
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,620
The boat

1509
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,620
Are you ready?

1510
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,620
We are not ready yet

1511
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,620
Did you think about it?

1512
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,620
I'm totally blank

1513
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,620
What should I do?

1514
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,620
Difficult

1515
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,620
Easy

1516
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,620
Who will start first?

1517
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,620
I will choose

1518
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,620
a song that doesn't have a boat

1519
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,620
But the name

1520
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,620
can't be stopped

1521
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,620
It's actually similar

1522
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,620
OK

1523
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,620
Fei

1524
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,620
I can change the song

1525
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,620
OK

1526
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,620
Change the song

1527
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,620
OK

1528
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,620
You sing it

1529
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,620
I'm OK

1530
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,620
OK

1531
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,620
We have never sung it before

1532
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,620
3 2 1

1533
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,620
You are the best

1534
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,620
I'll change the song

1535
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,620
OK

1536
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:58,620
You can finish it

1537
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,620
You can finish it

1538
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,620
Don't take the other songs away

1539
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,620
Just that one

1540
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,620
OK

1541
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,620
There is a precious tree on the boat

1542
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,620
The white rabbit is playing

1543
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,620
OK

1544
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,620
Hello

1545
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,620
The shadow is floating in the spring

1546
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,620
You are the little one

1547
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,620
In the soft sky

1548
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,620
Why do they all think of these songs?

1549
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,620
In the cold cold

1550
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:28,620
I am sad

1551
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,620
OK

1552
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,620
This one is hard for me

1553
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:35,620
We don't have ocean

1554
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,620
We don't have sea

1555
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,620
You see

1556
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,620
Come on

1557
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,620
See, also can

1558
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,620
Your name

1559
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,620
Yes

1560
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,620
The eyes are almost out

1561
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,620
OK

1562
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:58,620
3 2 1

1563
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,620
Every time I feel sad

1564
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,620
I just look at the sea

1565
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,620
Is that OK?

1566
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,620
Yes

1567
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:06,620
Sea

1568
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,620
I'm sorry

1569
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,620
Amusa

1570
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,620
OK

1571
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,620
In English, boat

1572
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,620
In Malay, it's kapa

1573
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,620
Kapal

1574
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,620
Kapal

1575
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,620
Yes

1576
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,620
I'm so tired

1577
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,620
I'm so tired

1578
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,620
Yes

1579
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,620
Thank you

1580
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:47,620
OK

1581
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,620
In English, it's a boat

1582
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,620
A boat

1583
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:56,620
Beautiful boat

1584
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:02,620
Let's throw away the things we don't know

1585
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,620
Throw away the things we can't throw away

1586
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:08,620
And questions

1587
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,620
I really can't remember

1588
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,620
So I wrote a song

1589
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,620
Go to the stage

1590
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:36,620
And that's when we'll start to sing

1591
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:40,620
So come join us on this musical journey

1592
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:45,620
Me?

1593
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,620
I'm so tired

1594
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:58,620
Wind is blowing on my boat

1595
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,620
Heart is beating

1596
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,620
Heart is beating

1597
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,620
I'm getting older

1598
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,620
Wow

1599
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,620
Please

1600
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,460
Looking in my memory

1601
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,620
Looking at my phone

1602
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:38,380
Being here for you

1603
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,620
No boat

1604
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,620
Yes

1605
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,620
Her music video was sitting on the boat

1606
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,620
Just don't put on Srg

1607
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:56,620
No boat

1608
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:57,620
OK

1609
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,420
This song

1610
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,460
Luckily no one thought of this song

1611
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,900
Bili

1612
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,100
This ending is perfect

1613
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:34,900
Yes

1614
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:39,300
Okay, today, the three of us have prepared a small gift

1615
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,620
It's for everyone

1616
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,340
Let's draw the name

1617
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,540
Denilia

1618
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,940
I've drawn Aisin Xuelou Meng

1619
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,260
Wang Honghao

1620
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,300
This is a year cake

1621
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,140
My mum made it for her sister

1622
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:00,620
Usually, we make different year cakes for each family

1623
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:03,260
We give each other a gift

1624
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,100
So I hope you can receive this gift

1625
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:10,100
You can start your journey in music

1626
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,460
Thank you

1627
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,580
I hope you can succeed

1628
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,700
Thank you

1629
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,860
This is a candle

1630
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,260
This is also a box

1631
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,140
When you light it up,

1632
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,860
you'll know what it tastes like

1633
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:24,140
It's a special surprise for you

1634
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,580
It's a candle

1635
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,220
Thank you

1636
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,380
It's a great gift

1637
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,500
Sometimes music tastes like a smell

1638
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,020
Yes

1639
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,220
When we hear the familiar melody,

1640
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,380
we'll remember the song

1641
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,060
Yes

1642
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,820
I brought the Taiwanese pineapple tree

1643
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:46,180
The pineapple tree has a special meaning in Thai

1644
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,660
It means to forget and be lucky

1645
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,140
It means to bring luck to you

1646
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:52,820
Thank you

1647
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,140
I'll share it with you

1648
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,140
Thank you

1649
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,940
Lastly, let's cheers

1650
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:24,260
We hope that

1651
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:27,260
Please use the song, Jia Duo Bao, to sing a song in the first half of the competition.

1652
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,260
Happy New Year, accept the challenge.

1653
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:32,260
I'm afraid of fire and Jia Duo Bao.

1654
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,260
I'm afraid of fire and Jia Duo Bao.

1655
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,260
I'm afraid of fire and Jia Duo Bao.

1656
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,260
Sing a Song, Jia Duo Bao, sing a song to the new generation of singers.

1657
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,260
This show is exclusively sponsored by Jia Duo Bao.

1658
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,260
I'm afraid of fire and Jia Duo Bao.

1659
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,260
The new generation of singers, Zhao Yuqiang.

1660
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:51,260
They are the most famous singers in Japan.

1661
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,260
Most of them have a good feeling about music.

1662
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,260
So I don't think it's over here.

1663
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,260
The Japanese singer, Tiencai.

1664
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:02,260
The Tokyo TV Taikuzhang Contest.

1665
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,260
The 12th time in a row.

1666
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,260
The most mysterious singer, Dong Yenmi.

1667
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,260
The highest-ranked singer.

1668
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,260
The most famous singer, Yazhou.

1669
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,260
The first battle in the Tokyo TV Taikuzhang Contest.

1670
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
The first battle in Japan.

1671
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,260
I will be the king.

1672
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,260
I will definitely win.

1673
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,260
I will win.

1674
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,260
In the two competitions,

1675
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:23,260
you must get at least one victory.

1676
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,260
That's the safety.

1677
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,260
The competition is exciting.

1678
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,260
Life and death are all in the game.

1679
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,260
And I will be the king.

1680
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,260
What?

1681
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,260
The Japanese friends.

1682
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:33,260
Please come over.

1683
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,260
The strong will meet each other.

1684
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,260
There is a battle in the king's stage.

1685
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,260
Is it a battle for glory?

1686
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,260
Or for brothers?

1687
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,260
I will always remember

1688
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,260
the feeling of listening to you sing this song

1689
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,260
on this stage.

1690
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,260
Three, two, one.

1691
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,260
The best of the best.

1692
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,260
The strongest opponent.

1693
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,260
The first dream.

1694
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,260
The cruelest reality.

1695
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,260
If I go out again, I will be eliminated.

1696
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,260
I will try my best.

1697
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,260
I want to stay on this stage.

1698
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,260
I don't want to lose.

1699
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,260
We can't lose.

1700
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:04,260
We have to beat him.

1701
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,260
I will beat him.

1702
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,260
I will beat whoever comes.

1703
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,260
The battle begins.
