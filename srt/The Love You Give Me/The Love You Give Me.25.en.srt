=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 25=

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,340
(Reading Mi)

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,600
What are you looking at?

27
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,119
What a coincidence.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,559
Let me explain.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,080
It's not like I don't trust you.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
And I'm not here to ruin your day.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,160
It's true.

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,800
I...

33
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,839
I'm here to buy a toy for our son.

34
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,480
Don't be mad.

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,839
Please. Don't be mad.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,719
Mr. Cai.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
If Cao Mu is right about

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,439
you joining the MBO

39
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,399
because I was your blind date,

40
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,399
I think I'll have to explain to you.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,399
I have a boyfriend now.

42
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,599
Let me officially introduce him to you.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040
This is my boyfriend.

44
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,599
Nice to meet you.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,879
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,159
What are you doing?

47
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,599
Are you that happy?

48
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,679
Of course I am.

49
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,080
Min Hui, let me tell you.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,559
You don't know how cool you were

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,320
just now.

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,439
Let me introduce him to you.

53
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,279
This is my boyfriend.

54
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,559
My boyfriend.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,080
Amazing.

56
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,200
You better rein it in.

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,599
If Mr. Cai sees it,

58
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,719
he'll regret it because
his fellow investor

59
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,080
is so childish.

60
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,960
He will be jealous
instead of regretting it.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Mr. Xin.

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,839
Don't you feel embarrassed

63
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,920
to tail after someone?

64
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,200
That's better than
losing my girlfriend.

65
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,800
Why do you sound so righteous?

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,999
Don't be mad.

67
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,439
It's not that I don't trust you.

68
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,399
I just want to see

69
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,399
what kind of a person Mr. Cai is.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,119
And also how better
I am compared to him.

71
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,399
Why are you better?

72
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,159
He's not worse than you.

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,640
How can you be so confident?

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,360
At first, we were not that different.

75
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,320
But when I saw

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,800
how you looked at him,

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I felt so much better.

78
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,480
Why?

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,559
Because you only have eyes for me.

80
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,159
Just like me who only has eyes for you.

81
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,439
You are such a sweet talker.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,439
But since Cai Wenbin knows
about our relationship now,

83
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,480
I think

84
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,800
He Haixiang will find out about it soon.

85
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,399
Then, everyone in Be Agile...

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,080
Everyone in Be Agile
will find out about it, right?

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,520
Let them know.

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,479
Sooner or later,
we'll have to tell them.

89
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,960
Finally, I'm where I want to be.

90
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:29,960
Xin Qi.

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
You are so annoying.

92
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,560
Come.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
Cheers.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,599
Hello. Where are you now?

95
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,719
Are you kidding me?

96
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm already here.
And you are going to stand me up.

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,839
Forget it.

98
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,440
You chose your boyfriend
over your friend.

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
I'll hang up now.

100
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,039
Let me talk to my friend for a while.

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,880
What's so good about
being in a relationship?

102
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,919
Yao Zizhu.

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,640
You are too mean.

104
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,719
You didn't reply to any
of my messages on WeChat.

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,960
Sheng.

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,440
What a coincidence. You are here too.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,599
I...

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,560
I have a date with my friend.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,799
I have to leave now.

110
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,560
Stop lying to me.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,839
I heard you on the phone just now.

112
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
Your friend has stood you up, right?

113
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,599
Come. Let's have a glass of drink.

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,719
Just a glass.

115
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,440
No. I can't drink it.

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,919
It's just a glass.

117
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,719
I'll drink it for her.

118
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,719
Who are you?

119
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
I am her...

120
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:29,880
friend.

121
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,239
Are you trying to be the hero?

122
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,760
Fine. Drink it.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,799
But if it's you,
it won't be just a glass.

124
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,520
Go on.

125
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,880
I can drink it myself.
This has nothing to do with you.

126
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:50,799
Zizhu.

127
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,839
I have something to tell you today.

128
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,719
You've never been my second choice.

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,919
And you are not a substitute.

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
I had liked Min Hui for four years.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
Sometimes, I didn't even know

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,039
if I cared for her

133
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,799
because I liked her

134
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,039
or because I was doing it out of habit.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,039
But you are different.

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,159
I don't know when it started.

137
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,960
But you've become the one
I want to see the most,

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
the one I miss the most,

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,279
the one I often dream about

140
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,200
and the first person

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,640
I want to hug after I come out

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
from the operating room.

143
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,919
I was foolish.

144
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,279
I didn't realize
my feelings for you sooner.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When I saw you leave
by yourself that day,

146
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,320
I felt so bad about it.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
At that time, I was thinking

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,520
that I would be willing to do anything

149
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,960
to make you happy.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,839
No. Have you gone mad, Zhou Ruji?

151
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,919
Yao Zizhu.

152
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,080
Yao Zizhu!

153
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,560
Give me another chance.

154
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,200
I just need you to give me
another chance.

155
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,399
I will...

156
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,520
Zhou Ruji.

157
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,680
Zhou Ruji, what's wrong?

158
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,919
Are you a fool?

159
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,680
Why did you drink so much?

160
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,239
Zizhu.

161
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,960
I won't let you do something

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,039
that you don't want to do.

163
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,159
Okay.

164
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:10,719
Be careful.

165
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,839
Don't sit on the floor. It's cold.

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,919
Get up first.

167
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,520
Wait.

168
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,799
I won't let you do it.

169
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,880
Zhou Ruji.

170
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,440
I want to ask you.

171
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,760
What were you trying to say just now?

172
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,719
I like you.

173
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,440
I really like you.

174
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
I like you.

175
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,359
My love for you won't be
less than your love for me.

176
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,920
How can I make you believe me?

177
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:06,080
How can I make you believe me?

178
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,479
Zhou Ruji.

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,960
Zhou Ruji.

180
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,359
Let's make a bet, okay?

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,239
If you still remember what you said

182
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,960
when you wake up
in the morning tomorrow,

183
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,759
come and find me
with a bouquet of roses.

184
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,280
If you don't remember,

185
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,160
it means that we are not fated
to be together.

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,719
Do you hear me?

187
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,080
It looks like you.

188
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,960
The more I see it,
the more it looks like you.

189
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,599
It's totally you.

190
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,879
It looks exactly like you.

191
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,400
Look.

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,080
Ms. Min Hui.

193
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,639
Meimei?

194
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,479
I have something urgent to tell you.

195
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,800
So, I asked Ms. Cao for your address.

196
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:22,960
And she told me
that you are staying here.

197
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,519
She's staying here because
I'm her husband.

198
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,839
Let's talk inside.

199
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,680
Come on in.

200
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,639
Ding Yifeng told me

201
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,920
that as long as
I can put this listening device

202
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
on you,

203
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,560
he'll promote me when he becomes

204
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
the R&D director of Be Agile.

205
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,719
No wonder Guanchao
has been so passive lately.

206
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,040
Cheng Qirang is so calm about it,

207
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,320
because he has already
planted a spy among us.

208
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,759
So, did you agree to do his bidding?

209
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,040
I didn't, Ms. Min Hui.

210
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,639
I just...

211
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,040
You had agreed to do his bidding.

212
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,680
Then, you came here
to report it to me at once.

213
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,960
Well done.

214
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,119
It was a smart
and courageous thing to do.

215
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,440
Looks like you've grown up a lot.

216
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,479
What should I do next?

217
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,999
Let's beat them at their own game.

218
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,680
That's right.

219
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Since he wants to know
the amount of our takeover bid,

220
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,800
we'll just tell him about it.

221
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,599
What's wrong?

222
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,160
Is it broken again?

223
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,359
Chen Jiajun!

224
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,400
Chen Jiajun, help!

225
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,879
Chen Jiajun!

226
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,239
What would I do without you?

227
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,280
This is my fault too.

228
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,719
I already found that the faucet
was faulty a few days ago.

229
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,040
But I haven't gotten
the chance to change it

230
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,200
because I have so many classes lately.

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I realize that after
you move in with me,

232
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,200
everything in our house
starts to break down one by one.

233
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,680
They keep bullying me.

234
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,599
It means that I'm so charming

235
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,040
that they have been conquered by me.

236
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,599
So,

237
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,639
have I conquered you too?

238
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,200
Not quite.

239
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,519
What about now?

240
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,879
What do you think?

241
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,119
Have you decided on what surprise
you want to give to Cheng Qirang?

242
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,920
I've already talked to Cao Mu about it.

243
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,080
Currently, the available funds
that we can use for the bidding

244
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,519
are 1.33 billion.

245
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,920
But I'm sure that Cheng Qirang

246
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,119
already knows the estimated
market price of Be Agile.

247
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,680
He won't believe it if the amount
we mention is too low.

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,879
Our plan may even backfire on us
if we give a much lower price.

249
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,680
That's right.

250
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,800
So, we need to mention the amount

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,160
that seems reasonable to him

252
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,440
and about the same amount
as what he has in mind.

253
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
That way, it'll seem more believable.

254
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,639
How do we know
the amount that he has in mind?

255
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,479
Estimating a company's
market price and current asset

256
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,040
is my field of expertise.

257
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
Based on my estimation,

258
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,320
the maximum available funds
that Guanchao has right now

259
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,280
will not be over 1.3 billion.

260
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,519
Twelve.

261
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,599
What about 1.29 billion?

262
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,200
It'll make him desperate

263
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,239
when he finds out about this amount.

264
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,320
And he'll be more likely to believe it.

265
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,719
Cao Mu said
that the luckiest thing for us

266
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,839
is to have you as our shareholder.

267
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,239
I believe her now.

268
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:49,839
What do you mean?

269
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,839
Did you doubt me before this?

270
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,440
Of course not.

271
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
I already knew
that you were capable before this.

272
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,239
But I never thought
that you would be so incredible.

273
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
Really?

274
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,759
Looks like from now on...

275
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,920
Why are you switching off my phone?

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,519
I have to prove myself better.

277
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,479
We were interrupted this afternoon.

278
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,080
Why are you ringing now?

279
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,999
Do you feel unwell?

280
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,479
Whenever I'm with you,

281
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,800
it gets more excited than me.

282
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,839
No, Xin Qi.

283
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,759
Stop getting distracted.

284
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,200
Ignore it.

285
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,879
Have you been feeling unwell lately?

286
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,519
I'm feeling great.

287
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,599
Why do you keep looking
at your heart rate then?

288
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,920
Are you unwell?

289
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,359
There's something wrong with it.

290
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,560
Well.

291
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,440
Send this back to the factory
to get it fixed.

292
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,359
It's not accurate.

293
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,839
The readings have been
unreasonably high lately.

294
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,440
Is it not accurate or is your heart...

295
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,599
As I said, I'm feeling great.

296
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,400
When will the readings go up usually?

297
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,080
Well.

298
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,839
As I said, it's inaccurate.

299
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,119
Something is wrong with it.

300
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,879
Go and get it fixed.

301
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,040
Are you really okay?

302
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,519
I'll get it fixed now.

303
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,239
It's decided then.

304
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,999
You can leave now.

305
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,840
(Mr. Ding, I've set up
the listening device.)

306
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,440
Women.

307
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,320
(Do you think we can win Guanchao)

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,280
(with our current funds?)

309
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,800
(We can't be sure.)

310
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,639
(Guanchao and us are evenly matched.)

311
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,200
(To be honest, after working
in Be Agile for so many years,)

312
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,479
if we fail to execute this MBO,

313
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,839
I'll feel upset that I have to leave.

314
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,400
Even if we fail, it doesn't mean
that you have to leave.

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,680
Everyone knows how much

316
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
you've contributed to Be Agile, right?

317
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,879
Unlike Ding Yifeng.

318
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,080
(I've never seen someone)

319
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,719
(as despicable as him.)

320
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,639
(He looks like a rat.)

321
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,200
But he thinks he's so handsome.

322
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,719
And his taste in clothes.

323
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,640
Does he think that wearing
branded clothes equals good fashion?

324
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,239
Let me tell you.

325
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,120
(If I'm the PR of a branded line,)

326
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,440
(I'll pay him not to wear
our line of clothes.)

327
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,160
(He's a fashion disaster.)

328
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,239
That's right.

329
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,960
Someone like him

330
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,880
doesn't even deserve to be human.

331
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,719
(He's the worst of the worst.)

332
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,440
(He doesn't have any morality to him.)

333
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,039
He's useless and unworthy.

334
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,440
Let me tell you.

335
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,999
He better not fall into my hands.

336
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:26,840
Otherwise, I'll let him know

337
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,039
the consequences of bullying a woman.

338
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,840
Just you wait.

339
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
When I become
the deputy director of the R&D,

340
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll teach all of you a lesson.

341
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
I feel disgusted at the mention of him.

342
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,559
Let's go back to our previous topic.

343
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,239
Okay.

344
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,039
Ms. Cao, do you think

345
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
we have enough money?

346
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,279
(I'm still worried about it.)

347
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,960
(Is there a way for us to get more money?)

348
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,039
(Ms. Min.)

349
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,640
Pooling the funds is the same as R&D.

350
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,239
I've done my best.

351
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,680
Getting 1.29 billion
is already my limit.

352
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,999
They have 1.29...

353
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,640
They have 1.29 billion.

354
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,840
I know that you've done your best.

356
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,039
I can't do anything to help you.

357
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,519
And yet, I ask
for the impossible from you.

358
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,799
I am wrong.

359
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,880
I know.

360
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,719
You want to stay away from...

361
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,360
I know.

362
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,120
You want to stay away from Guanchao.

363
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,759
Don't worry.
I've already done my research.

364
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,279
They are a big company.

365
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,239
But

366
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,840
they have a lot of ongoing projects.

367
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,319
They have limited funds.

368
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,759
So, I'm sure we have
the advantage with our offer.

369
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,519
Hopefully.

370
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,559
I'm sure we can win the bid.

371
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,519
Let's see how long
you can remain smug about it.

372
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,440
(Ms. Min.)

373
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,079
(Pooling the funds is the same as R&D.)

374
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,600
(I've done my best.)

375
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
(Getting 1.29 billion
is already my limit.)

376
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,039
They will offer 1.29 billion.

377
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,799
I've done some inquiries of my own.

378
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,039
Cao Mu has three venture capitalists
working with her.

379
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,440
But other than Xin Qi from Blue Jay,

380
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
the other two are on a smaller scale.

381
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,160
As for the executives,

382
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
although they want to execute MBO,

383
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
most of them can only offer

384
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,120
their management experience and
knowledge in exchange for the shares.

385
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
So, they can't offer much money.

386
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,999
If we add everything up,

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,520
getting 1.29 billion is already
the best they can do.

388
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,641
With the estimated market price
of Be Agile right now,

389
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,719
that is already a good price.

390
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,120
At first, I just planned
to offer 1.25 billion.

391
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,799
Looks like

392
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,759
I have to put all 1.3 billion into this.

393
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
You said that Guanchao
has only 1.3 billion

394
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,880
at its disposal, right?

395
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,479
Will Zheng Bangguo agree

396
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,279
to let you use all 1.3 billion
of the funds?

397
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,440
That old man is bedridden in the ward.

398
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,200
He has already lost his power.

399
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,640
I will

400
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,680
take over Be Agile.

401
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,999
Zhuzhu, aren't you leaving yet?

402
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,319
I want to practice for a while longer.
You can leave first.

403
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,470
- Okay. We'll go and eat now.
- Bye.

404
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,719
This is my first time
watching you dance.

405
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,200
You look beautiful.

406
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,759
You...

407
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
Why are you here?

408
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,039
You told me to come to you

409
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,680
if I remember what I said

410
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,600
after I woke up.

411
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,880
Zizhu.

412
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,200
I know that I've disappointed you
before this.

413
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,999
But I hope that you can
give me another chance.

414
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,360
I want to make you

415
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,319
the happiest princess in the world.

416
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,479
Who says that you don't know
how to sweet talk?

417
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,559
You are doing it just fine.

418
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,799
This is not sweet talk.

419
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,840
I meant what I said.

420
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm a slow-witted person.

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,319
Sometimes,

422
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
even when my body is full of love,

423
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,719
my heart is still encased in ice.

424
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,279
But after knowing you,

425
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,759
I've finally realized my true feelings.

426
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,239
I realize that you have already

427
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,519
taken over my heart.

428
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,920
Zizhu.

429
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,799

that the winner

450
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
of Be Agile's

451
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,360
takeover bid

452
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,719
is Guanchao.

453
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
Congratulations, Mr. Cheng.

454
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
Congratulations, Mr. Cheng.

455
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,239
Okay.

456
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,440
I got it.

457
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,799
Thank you.

458
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,960
Do you have the answer, Mr. He?

459
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,960
Guanchao offered 1.332 billion.

460
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,920
That's 200 million more than ours.

461
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,079
That's impossible.

462
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,160
It doesn't feel right to me too.

463
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,719
He offered only 200 million more.

464
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,479
How could he be so accurate?

465
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,960
(VICE GM OFFICE)
The whole incident is so fishy.

466
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,400
It is fishy instead.

467
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,640
Ms. Min.

468
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm sure you don't know how you lost.

469
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,960
To be honest,

470
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,039
I'm the biggest contributor
behind the success

471
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,039
of Guanchao taking over Be Agile.

472
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
By the way,

473
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,680
I've forgotten to say
the most important thing.

474
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,039
Soon,

475
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,960
I'll become the new deputy director
of the R&D of Be Agile.

476
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,279
If you can be obedient to me after this,

477
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,799
I can consider letting you

478
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,999
keep your position.

479
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,920
Looks like you haven't learnt

480
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,039
your lesson from last time.

481
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,519
What are you going to do?

482
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,160
Let me tell you.

483
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,479
We are at Be Agile, not Blue Jay.

484
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,920
Don't you dare touch me.

485
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,999
Forget it.

486
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,120
It's not worth it to go
to the police station

487
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,039
for hitting someone like him.

488
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,640
But what he had said
alerted me to something.

489
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,880
He still believes

490
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,519
that he found out the price from us.

491
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,160
So, what went wrong?

492
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,360
(Tian'an Yungu)

493
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,680
Father, Yiting.

494
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
I've managed to acquire Be Agile

495
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,960
because of your support.

496
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,160
Now, I can say this.

497
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,920
Guanchao is now

498
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,880
the flagship

499
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,719
of the medical technology industry
in Bincheng.

500
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,999
I've told you before

501
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:17,479
not to put all of our company's funds
into one basket, right?

502
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,400
But what did you do?

503
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,440
Not only have you invested
all of our money into it,

504
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
but you also got a 32 million loan

505
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,400
from the bank.

506
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,039
Father, let me explain.

507
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,160
I did everything
that you taught me to do.

508
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,999
You told me
that I shouldn't fight a losing war.

509
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,039
And if I'm going to do it,

510
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
I have to do everything
in my power to win.

511
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,920
So, I've come up with some ways

512
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,960
to find out about
Be Agile's bidding offer.

513
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,079
Cheng Qirang.

514
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,120
That's illegal.

515
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Are you trying to destroy Guanchao?

516
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
Father.

517
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,039
Father, I know
that this will be your reaction.

518
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,880
But you have to let me explain.

519
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
The one who gave me the information

520
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,400
is even more afraid of getting exposed.

521
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,880
So, we'll be safe.

522
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,079
You better hope
that it'll stay that way.

523
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,680
Otherwise,

524
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,999
I'll cut you off

525
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,440
at a moment's notice

526
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,400
even if you are the chairman.

527
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,120
Father, don't worry about it.

528
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,999
I won't do something...

529
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:22,039
Father has discussed it
with the board of directors.

530
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,799
HR will give out a notice tomorrow.

531
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,279
Father will be retiring
from his position

532
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,079
and you'll be the acting president
of Guanchao.

533
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,559
Father.

534
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,880
Qirang.

535
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,759
Your future

536
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,479
relies on the well-being of the company.

537
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
Father, I know.

538
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,960
I'll always be by your side.

539
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,960
I will take care of the company well.

540
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,719
Father is tired. Let him rest.

541
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,719
Be careful. Let me help you up.

542
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,479
Come.

543
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,559
You can go back to your work.
I'll take care of him.

544
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,400
Be careful on the road then.

545
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,920
I never thought that Ding Yifeng
would lie to us.

546
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,319
Maybe he didn't lie to us.

547
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,840
He was just dumb.

548
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,239
Luckily, you were smarter

549
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,600
and bribed the executives
of Yuanlai in the end.

550
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,640
Because I said

551
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,759
that I would do anything

552
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,279
to take over Be Agile.

553
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,160
Was I useless?

554
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,239
You...

555
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,759
You did your best.

556
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,920
If you have nothing else to do,

557
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,039
you can go back first.

558
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
I have a business dinner tonight.

559
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,440
Okay.

560
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,600
Then...

561
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,319
When you go down,

562
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,920
don't let that woman see you.

563
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,360
Okay.

564
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,999
I knew that you would be here.

565
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,999
I'm just feeling upset.

566
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,360
And I came here without realizing it.

567
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,840
What are you going to do next?

568
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,279
I can't work with him.

569
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,079
Since he's here now,

570
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,880
I'll just quit.

571
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,120
How about...

572
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,479
I won't go to Blue Jay.

573
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,920
You have underestimated me.

574
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,279
I'm so capable.

575
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,680
A lot of companies are pining for me.

576
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,200
I still need to choose carefully
about where I want to go next.

577
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200
Yes.

578
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,960
If I'm out of job one day,

579
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,680
I'll have to rely on you
to take care of me.

580
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,440
Dream on.

581
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,279
You can ask Quanquan
to take care of you.

582
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:42,079
One. Two. One.

583
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,120
Halt.

584
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,519
Turn right.

585
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,960
All the best, darling.
I'll always support you.

586
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,279
All the best, mummy.
I'll always support you too.

587
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,479
And I'll love you forever.

588
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,360
We didn't have this line just now.

589
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,039
I love you more.

590
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,160
Mummy, let me carry your bag for you.

591
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,079
Driver, send me to school.

592
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,039
Roger that.

593
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,279
Let's go.

594
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,079
Don't be afraid, darling.

595
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,680
No matter what, you'll always have me.

596
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
With you here,

597
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,039
I'm not afraid of anything.

598
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,279
He should be the one who's afraid.

599
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,559
I'll get going now.

Ms. Min Hui.

614
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,640
Good morning.

615
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,559
What's wrong?

616
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,079
Do I look especially good today?

617
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,719
We've received an e-mail
from the company this morning.

618
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:44,880
According to it,
Guanchao's HR Department

619
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,039
will take over the company soon

620
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,880
and there'll be
a major employee staffing adjustment.

621
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,880
That's it?

622
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,400
Why are you so shocked about it?

623
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,640
Even if it does happen,

624
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,279
it's not up to us
to do anything about it.

625
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,799
All of you are Be Agile's
capable employees.

626
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,840
Just do your job well.

627
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
It'll be their loss to fire you.

628
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
- Okay.
- Fine.

629
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,160
Let's do as she said.
Let's get back to work.

630
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,519
Let's get back to work.

631
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:08,840
Go on.

632
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,799
Let's get back to work.

633
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Cheng Qirang is here.

634
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
He wants to hold a meeting
with all the executives.

635
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,640
Okay.

636
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,600
This is unavoidable.

637
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,479
Why are you so calm?

638
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
I feel a little bit scared.

639
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,920
I plan to quit.

640
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,479
I've already written
my resignation letter.

641
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,120
I'll give it to him later.

642
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,360
I should quit too.

643
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,840
What are you talking about?

644
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,640
There are reasons

645
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,680
that I can't work with Cheng Qirang.

646
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,319
But you are different.

647
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,440
Be Agile is your painstaking effort.

648
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,680
Besides, you have to stay here

649
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,640
to take care of the people on my team

650
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,600
on behalf of me.

651
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,800
Stop it.

652
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm just as helpless as them.

653
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,240
I can't even save myself.

654
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,599
Cao Mu.

655
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,479
I'm sure you can do it.

656
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,079
Don't worry.

657
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,199
As long as I'm here,

658
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,519
I'll take care of them.

659
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,039
I'll leave them to you then.

660
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,039
Leave it to me.

661
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
This is the information of Lin Xiyue.

662
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,559
Why are you investigating her
all of a sudden?

663
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,800
Back then, she betrayed Min Hui
to get close to Cheng Qirang.

664
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,079
And for the past few years, she has done

665
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,119
a lot of illegal things
to help Cheng Qirang.

666
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,840
The best way to take down Cheng Qirang

667
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,199
is to go through her.

668
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,440
Are you trying to take down Cheng Qirang

669
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
or to avenge Ms. Min Hui?

670
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,079
Can't I do both?

671
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,800
Yes. Of course you can.

672
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,400
I wonder how it is with Ms. Min Hui now.

673
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:07,599
Will he make it difficult for her?

674
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Why don't you ask her
to work for Blue Jay?

675
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,240
She's so capable anyway.

676
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,440
And you can take care of her too.

677
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
Isn't that great?

678
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,840
She rejected my offer.

679
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,039
That's indeed her personality.

680
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,639
Let me tell you.

681
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Min Hui is not just a pretty vase

682
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,039
who hides behind a man

683
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,840
and seeks protection from him.

684
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,920
She is capable and has
her own mindset and solutions.

685
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,440
I believe that she can handle it.

686
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,159
You've finally gotten it right.

687
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,120
(Resignation Letter)

688
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,479
It has been proven

689
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
that the one with more experience
will always win.

690
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,159
Look at He Haixiang.

691
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,559
It's a win-win for him.

692
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,400
He's now the deputy director of Yuanlai.

693
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,800
Do you like this office?

694
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,999
What do you mean?

695
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,760
Take back your resignation letter.

696
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,519
This office will be yours.

697
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,960
I'm not interested in it.

698
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,880
You are the one who developed

699
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,479
the AI heart modeling technology.

700
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,999
Are you really going
to let it get destroyed?

701
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,639
It must be upsetting.

702
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,079
It is.

703
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,039
But more importantly, I hate you.

704
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,559
Fine.

705
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,999
Even if you don't want to do it,
for the sake of the project,

706
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,159
you should

707
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,599
do it for the people on your team.

708
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,760
What is her name again?

709
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,479
Zhong Meimei.

710
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,880
Cai Wenji.

711
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,440
Tang Xinning.

712
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,519
Jiang Heng.

713
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,999
Am I right?

714
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,639
What do you want?

715
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,720
If you leave,

716
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,920
I'll do my best to torture them.

717
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,920
I'll fire Cai Wenji

718
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,999
who needs the money most.

719
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,440
Wang Qingyuan too.

720
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,599
His wife is pregnant, right?

721
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,999
I heard that his wife is older than him.

722
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,440
And she's not that fit.

723
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,320
And it's a geriatric pregnancy.

724
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,039
If I push

725
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,320
all the work onto him right now,

726
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,479
will he have anxiety?

727
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,639
Of course.

728
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,679
We have Zhong Meimei
and Tang Xinning too.

729
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,360
I have ways to deal with

730
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
beautiful ladies like them.

731
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,400
Enough.

732
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,079
You are so shameless.

733
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,400
