=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,680
=Episode 12=

25
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,415
It's a hectic day for this little boy.

26
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,935
He had such a strong desire to drag you

27
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,096
and tell everyone
that you're his father.

28
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,695
He must be tired.

29
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,456
You've been busy today. Are you hungry?

30
00:01:59,376 --> 00:01:59,935
I am.

31
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,415
Me either.

32
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,336
What are you looking at?

33
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,575
I didn't know you could
enjoy eating instant noodles

34
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:17,575
besides the Michelin-starred food.

35
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:20,455
You would be the same
if you haven't eaten for the day.

36
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,015
Why didn't you eat anything?

37
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:25,536
I had to catch the flight this morning.

38
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:26,936
I rushed to the kindergarten
once I touched down.

39
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:27,735
I didn't have time to eat.

40
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,575
So, you rushed hotfoot

41
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,135
to attend the parent-child event?

42
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,415
Is your business in Beijing done yet?

43
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,496
I burnt the midnight oil

44
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:39,895
to finish the work.

45
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,575
And I had some extra time
to find a dessert instructor

46
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,816
for an online lesson.

47
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,536
You didn't have to come

48
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:47,936
if you were tied up with work.

49
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,256
Quanquan would understand you.

50
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,695
Now that I'm back for him,

51
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,216
I will give him the best

52
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,615
in my power.

53
00:02:58,415 --> 00:02:59,175
Xin Qi.

54
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,015
Thank you.

55
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,056
No.

56
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,015
Quanquan's my son too.

57
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:07,855
I thank you

58
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:11,295
because you prove my decision
to let you know about Quanquan.

59
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,216
Ms. Cao.

60
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:25,336
Here's your coffee.

61
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,536
And an adorable little duck too.

62
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:30,695
Thank you.

63
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:31,575
I'm off.

64
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,096
Can I

65
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,936
kiss you?

66
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,936
I should've snapped

67
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,295
your drooling face.

68
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,376
What has happened to you?

69
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,135
Did you dream

70
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,135
about having dinner with a handsome guy?

71
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,536
Kind of.

72
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,015
Are you in love again

73
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,135
and you keep it from me?

74
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,415
I'm not sure about it.

75
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,135
What's it in your hand?

76
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,656
Quanquan and I made this cake

77
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:14,735
on a parent-child event.

78
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,336
He wanted to give his cake

79
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,615
to Godmother.

80
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,016
Quanquan's such a sweet boy.

81
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,336
He really appreciates me.

82
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:22,935
It looks good.

83
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,375
It mustn't be done by you.

84
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,495
Who made this?

85
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,295
Not me, anyway.

86
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,415
You know me very well.

87
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,495
Cooking isn't my thing.

88
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,016
What a beautiful cake.

89
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,776
What are you doing?

90
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,495
You know what,

91
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,216
the expression you just made

92
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,656
isn't any better than my drooling face.

93
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:39,576
Did I?

94
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,495
Out with it.

95
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,016
Are you in love?

96
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:46,615
It's not Zhou Ruji.

97
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:47,615
Who else could it be?

98
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,935
The baker?

99
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,216
No way.

100
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,576
Tell me who's it?

101
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,016
Are you my bestie? Come on.

102
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,656
Do you still remember
that I talked about

103
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:02,855
Quanquan's father?

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,415
Yes.

105
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:05,055
Why?

106
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,495
Does he come back to you?

107
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,495
Listen, Min Hui.

108
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,495
If he comes back...

109
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,295
He's back?

110
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,295
Not only that,

111
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,055
he has met with Quanquan too.

112
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:20,096
What?

113
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:22,615
Stay calm, please.

114
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,415
Calm down.

115
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,855
He's Xin Qi.

116
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:29,935
The unicorn?

117
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,735
I'm sorry, Cao Mu.

118
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,415
I didn't tell you

119
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,016
because I didn't want there
to be any complications.

120
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,696
I didn't even plan on telling him

121
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:45,976
about Quanquan.

122
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:47,656
But things

123
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,576
just got out of control

124
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,255
and this is it now.

125
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,935
No wonder I always sense

126
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,855
some chemistry between you.

127
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,175
I even doubted my guts before.

128
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,415
Quit fantasizing.

129
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,055
We're just parents to Quanquan

130
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:05,536
and nothing else.

131
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,456
Yes, but who knows
what's going to happen next?

132
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:08,136
Two months ago,

133
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,615
you had never thought

134
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:10,976
of staying under the same roof
with him, right?

135
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,016
Besides,

136
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,776
there are billions of people
in the world.

137
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,055
What are the chances of meeting again

138
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,735
after you parted ways?

139
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,896
About...

140
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,576
Are you calculating now?

141
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:20,896
Both of you

142
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,415
are just meant for each other.

143
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:27,615
Isn't this only happening in romance?

144
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:28,776
And if anything,

145
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,456
it's worth

146
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,576
going for Xin Qi's dashing look.

147
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:34,735
Are you sure?

148
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,336
Min Hui.

149
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,055
The past shouldn't cast

150
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:41,336
its long shadow over your present.

151
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,615
If you still have feelings for him,

152
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:43,735
don't let anything restrain you.

153
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,456
Got it.

154
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,136
If I can be certain

155
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,096
of my own heart,

156
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,776
I won't avoid it.

157
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,375
Remember what you said.

158
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,136
I'm going to pursue my happiness too.

159
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:09,336
Who's the guy?

160
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:10,576
I'm not telling you.

161
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,536
What about the duck toy?

162
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:13,935
You can have it.

163
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,216
Luckily, I'm ready.

164
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:24,536
I got to be perfect when he confesses.

165
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,656
This venue is too common though.

166
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,615
Why didn't he choose some special places
for the confession?

167
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,536
How romantic.

168
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:44,815
It is.

169
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,776
Why are you here?

170
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,016
Shouldn't you be with them?

171
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,495
I...

172
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,375
What's wrong with me?

173
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,055
Jingjing, will you marry me?

174
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,016
Why did you ask me out?

175
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,415
Do you want to go to a movie?

176
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,576
Can I say no?

177
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,375
Yes.

178
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,055
I thought...

179
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,696
Have you bought the tickets?

180
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,175
Yeah.

181
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,935
It's fine. I said that in jest just now.

182
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:28,456
Let's go.

183
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:30,576
I hate missing the beginning of a movie.

184
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:33,615
Wait for me.

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
(Jiaren Hospital)

186
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:41,655
Min Hui, are you looking for me?

187
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,296
Mr. Yao told me that.

188
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:47,895
I didn't know Mr. Xin is here too.

189
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,296
Come on and sit.

190
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,056
What's the matter?

191
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,015
Here's the thing.

192
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,816
RG Group, the major shareholder
of Blue Jay Investment

193
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:57,336
isn't very optimistic about

194
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,495
my AI cardiac modeling software.

195
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,135
Xin Qi flew to Beijing

196
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,216
to meet with the president of RG Group
a few days ago.

197
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:03,416
He has tried so hard

198
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,816
and persuaded her at last.

199
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:07,176
But only if we can come out

200
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:09,056
with a simple prototype soon.

201
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,096
Then, she will help us to convince
other shareholders.

202
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,216
What can I do for you?

203
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,775
I will handle the technical part.

204
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,615
But I need

205
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:20,416
a unique case
for the demonstration subject.

206
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,535
A unique case?

207
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:23,816
What's the requirement?

208
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,855
The condition must be complex enough

209
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,096
with high treatment difficulty.

210
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,176
It'd be best if it's congenital.

211
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,216
I hope to demonstrate

212
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:33,375
how AI modeling software is applied
for heart disease treatment,

213
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,535
especially in the surgery field.

214
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,255
I will get you the case
as soon as possible.

215
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,936
But I have to remind you

216
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,655
that such medical cases

217
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,615
involve patient privacy.

218
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,976
If the patient doesn't agree,

219
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,135
you can't use it.

220
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:48,375
We know that.

221
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,336
Sorry to trouble you

222
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,015
to find us some suitable cases

223
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:52,895
per the requirements.

224
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,456
I will handle the rest.

225
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:55,535
It's not trouble.

226
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,535
Min Hui and I have
been friends for years.

227
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,176
I'm glad to help her.

228
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,375
Thank you.

229
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,056
Do you want to have lunch together?

230
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:03,375
We can look for the cases after that.

231
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,416
She isn't free for lunch.

232
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,456
We're running out of time
for the heavy task.

233
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,015
I need to head back to the office

234
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,456
for the model presentation.

235
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:10,735
It's fine.

236
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,135
Let's have dinner tonight.

237
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:14,696
By the way, tonight...

238
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,416
I'll have Hardy pick up Quanquan.

239
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,096
So, you can focus on your work.

240
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,576
Sounds good.

241
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:49,615
Excuse me, everyone.

242
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,176
Please allow me to take a moment
of your time.

243
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,296
We're here to witness

244
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,375
a happy and blissful moment.

245
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,416
Today,

246
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,775
my friend

247
00:10:58,775 --> 00:10:59,895
wants to confess his love

248
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,895
to a girl he's been holding dearly

249
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,535
in front of you all.

250
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:06,056
I hope

251
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,176
that you can give him a round
of applause to amp him up.

252
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,895
- Sure.
- Sure.

253
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,495
All right, let's welcome

254
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:14,655
the lady of the day.

255
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,855
(Chen Jiajun, you don't disappoint me.)

256
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:36,976
Miss Chen Kaiyang.

257
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,176
Where's my handphone?

258
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:50,535
I put it here just now.

259
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,615
Marry me.

260
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:10,336
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

261
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,895
She better not say yes.

262
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,696
Why didn't the guy book a VIP hall
to propose?

263
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:16,816
What's the point of cheering for him?

264
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,135
They hug.

265
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,056
How's the data sifting?

266
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,296
Only one-third is done.

267
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:29,176
Still working on it.

268
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,375
Keep it up.

269
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,015
How's your progress over here?

270
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:34,976
It's not a good one.

271
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,056
It's not suitable. Keep looking.

272
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,375
Yes, Ms. Min.

273
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,096
Tang Xinning.

274
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,816
How about you?

275
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:42,135
Two-thirds are done.

276
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,696
I'll make sure to examine all the data
before tomorrow's working hours.

277
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,936
How's your framework coming along, Cai?

278
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,976
Cai.

279
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:52,976
It's almost there.

280
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,015
Let's take a break.

281
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:01,976
We'll call it a day.

282
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,735
Finish the rest tomorrow.

283
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,336
Ms. Min, I...

284
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,375
I know we're on a tight schedule.

285
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:09,655
But you don't have

286
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,056
to sacrifice your rest
and health for it.

287
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,735
Besides, it's not efficient

288
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:14,895
to work overtime.

289
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:15,936
Listen to me.

290
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,775
Leave your work here.

291
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,336
Go back and get rest.

292
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:21,775
- Thank you, Ms. Min.
- Thank you, Ms. Min.

293
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,576
Go home now.

294
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,096
Leave now. I don't want to see you here.

295
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:26,855
Hurry up and go home now.

296
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:29,696
Cai, go home. Stop working.

297
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,375
Come on.

298
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,255
You haven't eaten yet, right?

299
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:33,255
Go eat first.

300
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:37,816
Stop drinking coffee. It's late.

301
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,775
Drink some water instead.

302
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,775
You didn't have time
to take dinner just now.

303
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:45,696
Have some congee.

304
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:50,735
Thank you.

305
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:53,735
They've all left.

306
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,056
Yes.

307
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:56,816
This kind of data work

308
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,535
can't be rushed.

309
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,615
They worked pretty hard today.

310
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,336
The subordinates went home
while the superior is working.

311
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:03,735
Who's the one working really hard?

312
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,176
My salary

313
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,696
is more than four times theirs.

314
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,296
I should do the work.

315
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,456
You should go home later.

316
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:16,696
These are the technical issues.

317
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:17,775
You can't help with it.

318
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,375
It's better to go back
and accompany Quanquan.

319
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,936
Am I a househusband to you?

320
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,375
I've contacted the database of RG,

321
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,255
but they couldn't find
any suitable case so far.

322
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,456
If they do,

323
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,296
the protocol of a large organization
can be complicated.

324
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,015
It won't be possible

325
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,416
to use it as fast as I want.

326
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,015
Zhou Ruji has sent me some good cases.

327
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,775
Still, I didn't find them suitable.

328
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:50,015
We shall continue to search.

329
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:52,296
Later,

330
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,615
I'm going to print out

331
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:54,336
the cases they picked.

332
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,416
We'll read them at home later.

333
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:57,336
Okay.

334
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:06,336
I've photocopied some...

335
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:20,895
A sudden blackout?

336
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,416
Oh, there are still people here.

337
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:52,775
I'm sorry to interrupt.

338
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:53,456
Keep going.

339
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,375
I'm going to check the circuit.

340
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:54,895
No.

341
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,696
No, it's not what you think.

342
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,135
We're working here.

343
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,895
I think we should go home now.

344
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,056
Okay.

345
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:14,096
Let me take my bag.

346
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,375
Go home?

347
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:28,775
What's so special about today?

348
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,296
We managed to see

349
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,816
so many confessions and proposals today.

350
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:33,855
(Jeez, Chen Jiajun.)

351
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:36,056
(Is he playing dumb
or is he real dumb?)

352
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,735
We're already at my place.

353
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,655
Thank you for walking me home.

354
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:45,495
So fast?

355
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,255
Let me walk you

356
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:49,336
to the staircases.

357
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,135
(Don't tell me
there's a surprise there.)

358
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:56,816
(Chen Jiajun, this is your last chance.)

359
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:01,976
My classes are packed

360
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:02,936
tomorrow and the day after.

361
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,656
So, I'll come to see you
the day after that.

362
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,335
I'm going then.

363
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,456
Get rest early.

364
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:13,976
Bye-bye.

365
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,176
Chen Jiajun.

366
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:20,495
Yes?

367
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:23,456
Are you leaving like this?

368
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,176
If you want me to come up,

369
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:30,896
sure, I will.

370
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,095
In your dream.

371
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,815
Let me ask you.

372
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,015
Did you forget something important?

373
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:41,735
No.

374
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:43,335
No?

375
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,255
Chen Jiajun, what am I to you?

376
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:46,976
My girlfriend.

377
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:47,735
Who said I'm your...

378
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,376
What did you just say?

379
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,936
I said you're my girlfriend.

380
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,696
- Scissors, paper, stone.
- Scissors, paper, stone.

381
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,416
I won again.

382
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,936
Turn your face.

383
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,176
There's not much space though.

384
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,495
Quanquan.

385
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,015
How about you take the medicine first?

386
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,535
I will wash my face
while you take the medicine.

387
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:15,815
You can continue
to draw after that, okay?

388
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,335
You promised that if you win,

389
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,495
I have to take the medicine.

390
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,136
If I win, I can draw on your face.

391
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,216
But you've never won
a single time so far.

392
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,656
Why should I take the medicine?

393
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,616
You indeed take that after Mr. Xin.

394
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,095
Perfect logic.

395
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,775
How come...

396
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:32,495
Found a space here.

397
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:34,295
I'm going to draw you a horn.

398
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,815
So, you become

399
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,735
a unicorn that brings happiness
to everyone.

400
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:41,095
Quanquan,
let's take the medicine, okay?

401
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,815
In Chinese mythology,

402
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,416
it's called "Huanshu".

403
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:48,976
Come here.

404
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,376
Finally, you're home.

405
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:54,255
Hardy would've cried
if you didn't come back.

406
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:56,255
Not at all. I'm very happy.

407
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:57,735
I'm sorry, Hardy.

408
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:58,936
It must be hard for you.

409
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,416
Not at all.

410
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,696
It's my job to take care of Quanquan.

411
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,735
Well, you can go home now.

412
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,136
I'll pay you for the extra hours.

413
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,295
Thank you.

414
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,376
I'm leaving now.

415
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:09,575
See you, Quanquan.

416
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,055
See you, Hardy.

417
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:12,815
Go and wash your face.

418
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,535
Don't scare others at night.

419
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:15,015
Okay.

420
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,015
Over there.

421
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,815
Did you not take your medicine again?

422
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:21,376
I'm already cured.

423
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,176
Why do I need to take medicine?

424
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,015
Your mommy said

425
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:26,976
you're Iron Man.

426
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,535
Even a car needs petrol,

427
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,696
so how can Iron Man
not replenish his energy?

428
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:31,896
That's right.

429
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:32,896
Look.

430
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,535
This small pill

431
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,896
is your energy booster.

432
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:37,936
Eat it

433
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,735
and your heart is filled with energy.

434
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:44,696
Well, I'll take it

435
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,255
since you're acting so seriously.

436
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:50,335
Good boy.

437
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,696
Okay, energy replenished.

438
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:54,976
Let's go and fight monsters.

439
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,055
Sure.

440
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,136
Hardy, we're going to fight monsters.

441
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,015
But I can't fight monsters.

442
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,856
Hello, Ms. Cao.

443
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:09,735
What's the matter?

444
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:11,216
(Listen to this.)

445
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:12,575
(I've never seen such a ridiculous guy)

446
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:13,896
(in my life ever.)

447
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:14,775
He actually thinks

448
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:15,856
that we have become a couple

449
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:17,376
after kissing.

450
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,055
Dear Ms. Cao.

451
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,495
People with the right mind would think

452
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:23,055
that kissing
is something that only couples do.

453
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,456
Yes, I know.

454
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,495
But what bothers me is that
the conversion of our relationship

455
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,656
should be specially celebrated. Okay?

456
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,815
Asking someone out is a serious matter.

457
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,255
Yet he thinks it's all done
after kissing.

458
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,216
A serious matter?

459
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:35,616
Are you the one who just said that?

460
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:36,335
I don't care.

461
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,896
I'm really frustrated
and pissed off now.

462
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:40,176
In that case,

463
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:42,095
you should stop seeing him.

464
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:45,295
No, that won't do.

465
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,295
He's a kind guy,

466
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:50,095
but sometimes he's so dense.

467
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,656
Dense but cute.

468
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:53,735
Ms. Cao.

469
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:55,735
Congrats, you're in love again.

470
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,095
Bring him to me afterward.

471
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,176
(All right, I'm hanging up.)

472
00:20:58,335 --> 00:20:59,095
Hello.

473
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,015
I'm in love?

474
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:06,656
It depends on how he behaves first.

475
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,095
Read this.

476
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,616
It can pick you up better than coffee.

477
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,055
You got this?

478
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,456
It perfectly fits the requirements.

479
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:29,095
Where's the patient?

480
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,376
Perhaps I should go

481
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,735
and approach the patient,

482
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:33,095
and get his authorization
tomorrow morning.

483
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,616
Just use it.

484
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:35,976
No authorization is needed.

485
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,136
What?

486
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:40,575
Yes, it's mine.

487
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:43,856
Remember, just between us.

488
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:45,775
If anyone knows that the CEO
of Blue Jay Investment

489
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:47,696
once had a serious heart disease,

490
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,775
it will affect the stock market.

491
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,176
I will keep it safe.

492
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,416
Thank you.

493
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,456
What for?

494
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,416
Well, you've got the case now.

495
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,416
Read it tomorrow.

496
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:00,696
I suppose you've done your part today.

497
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,575
Don't just ask others to take a rest.

498
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,735
You're not a robot, right?

499
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:09,656
Well.

500
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:10,696
Goodnight.

501
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,055
Xin Qi.

502
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:17,295
What's up?

503
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,055
Thank you.

504
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:23,335
You're welcome.

505
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:33,015
Go to bed now.

506
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,920
(Jiaren Hospital)

507
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,976
Isn't it just

508
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,095
to take a CT cardiac angiogram

509
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:41,176
to complement the medical records?

510
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,176
Why do I have to stay
in the hospital for a day?

511
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:44,575
The Chairwoman said

512
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,136
that since you're already
at the hospital,

513
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:48,335
you might as well get
a full-body check-up.

514
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,416
It's been almost half a year

515
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,896
since the last check-up.

516
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:53,255
Seriously?

517
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:55,616
She seems to care a lot about you.

518
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:57,976
You know what,

519
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,295
the Chairwoman

520
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,136
is most concerned about his health.

521
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:02,456
The second most important thing

522
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,015
is his relationship.

523
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:06,696
Do you know what's mine?

524
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,015
I'm thinking
to replace you with someone else.

525
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:10,656
Replace me...

526
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,095
I think Hardy is right.

527
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:12,976
Why don't you get a check-up

528
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,376
while you're here?

529
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,376
This place is more comfortable
than my place.

530
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,176
So, you're on board with this.

531
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,416
You have so much work to be done
with the model demonstration.

532
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:22,616
I can't leave it to you.

533
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,616
Why don't you move in here too?

534
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,575
You want me to stay here with you?

535
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,735
What about Quanquan?

536
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,055
I will take care of him.

537
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:33,176
I've completely mastered

538
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,775
all of Quanquan's interests.

539
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:35,976
It won't be a problem.

540
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:38,495
It seems

541
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,535
that I should trouble you again.

542
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:40,815
It's not trouble at all.

543
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:42,456
Mr. Xin.

544
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:44,696
Can we arrange for the check-up now?

545
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:45,775
Off you go.

546
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:47,575
Take this.

547
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:48,775
Let's go together.

548
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,295
Okay.

549
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:58,575
The check-up time...

550
00:23:58,656 --> 00:23:59,295
Goodness.

551
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,535
What's wrong?

552
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,416
You've seen it before though.

553
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,095
I know.

554
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,456
Because I don't have interest in it.

555
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,896
You should start working out.

556
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,416
Really?

557
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,656
Does Zhou Ruji have eight-pack abs?

558
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:17,656
You can check it out yourself
if you're curious.

559
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:25,656
And if anything,

560
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,136
it's worth

561
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,055
going for Xin Qi's dashing look.

562
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:30,495
I didn't get a clear look.

563
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:37,856
What does it feel like
lying inside this thing?

564
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,015
Fear.

565
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:45,735
It's strange.

566
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,616
It's just a machine,

567
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,936
but I can feel boundless darkness

568
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:54,416
lying in it.

569
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:58,055
When you get off this thing,

570
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,815
you're clueless about the result,

571
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,335
whether it is the hope to live

572
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,815
or an announcement of death.

573
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,976
So Quanquan will have this feeling

574
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,176
when he goes through this?

575
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:15,295
I'm sorry.

576
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,176
No need to apologize.

577
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,936
Mr. Xin, please lie down.

578
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,856
Don't overthink.

579
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,335
Every time Quanquan
comes for a check-up,

580
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:43,295
he would hold my hand
to feel my energy.

581
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,616
I will give you some.

582
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:58,976
I'll wait for you outside.

583
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:02,735
Min Hui.

584
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:04,976
Min Hui.

585
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,136
Zhou Ruji.

586
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,976
Why are you here?

587
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:09,616
Quanquan told me
that you came to the hospital.

588
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:10,335
What has happened to you?

589
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,856
Not me. It's him.

590
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:14,815
He's here for the full-body check-up.
I'm accompanying him.

591
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,295
Excuse me.

592
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,295
Let's come in and talk.

593
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:28,055
The case I gave you

594
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:29,055
isn't suitable.

595
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,656
So, I have found another two.

596
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,216
No need.

597
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:33,416
I've found one.

598
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:35,936
Do you need me to contact the patient?

599
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:38,535
No.

600
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:39,856
It's not from Jiaren Hospital.

601
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,575
We've already arranged it.

602
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:43,456
Well.

603
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,335
I'm about to get off work.

604
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,335
Do you want to leave together?

605
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:47,896
I'm staying here tonight

606
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:49,295
to discuss something about the work

607
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:50,216
with him.

608
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,696
So, I'm sleeping in here.

609
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:54,095
I can give you the key
to my on-call room.

610
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,456
You can sleep over there.

611
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:58,456
I don't think

612
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:00,335
outsiders can't just go in there.

613
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:02,095
Don't break the rules.

614
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:05,216
The sofa here is big and
comfortable enough for her.

615
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:06,535
It's fine, Zhou Ruji.

616
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:08,295
I'm expecting to stay late tonight

617
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,696
and probably won't get much sleep.

618
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,495
I will just make do with it here.

619
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,095
Min Hui.

620
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:14,815
I have a headache after the check-up.

621
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:16,696
You have a headache?

622
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,255
Do you need me to call the doctor?

623
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:20,456
No.

624
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,055
Well,

625
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:23,936
I want a quiet place to rest.

626
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,896
I'll leave.

627
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,535
Here's the thing.

628
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,896
I will swap the night shift
with Yang Yangyang.

629
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:32,416
Come to me

630
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:34,055
if anything happens tonight.

631
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,575
I will go with you.

632
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:39,936
Where are you going?

633
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,575
Your head hurts, don't you?

634
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:42,936
I'm giving you some quiet time.

635
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,255
I don't want to disturb you.

636
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,015
Let's go.

637
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:54,136
Quiet time, my foot.

638
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:55,295
Bite my tongue.

639
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:01,216
Let's go grab something. My treat.

640
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:04,416
I don't think so.

641
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,055
I'm going to buy Xin Qi some chocolate.

642
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:07,376
Bye.

643
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,456
Zhou Ruji.

644
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:19,376
You weren't scared by that?

645
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:20,896
What are you doing here?

646
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:22,815
I'm here to see Madam. Jiang.

647
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:24,015
She was hospitalized last week.

648
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:24,696
Don't you forget

649
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,775
that I'm a dedicated volunteer.

650
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:27,815
Not bad.

651
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:32,216
I want to talk to you.

652
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,936
They are just friends

653
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,136
and having some random chat.

654
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,095
Don't overthink.

655
00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:05,775
Didn't she say she'd
accompany me to work?

656
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:07,696
They talked for so long.

657
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,616
Zhou Ruji.

658
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,416
I can't hold it in anymore.

659
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:14,976
I...

660
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:16,456
I have a question for you.

661
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:17,936
What's it?

662
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,376
That shoes.

663
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:21,936
What shoes?

664
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,176
You bought a pair of heels

665
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,495
when you went shopping the other day.

666
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,815
I know.

667
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:29,015
Are they for me?

668
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,775
If they are, just say it.

669
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:34,255
Though I don't usually wear heels,

670
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,575
I will surely like them

671
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:36,815
if they're from you.

672
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,775
That's not for you.

673
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,255
But that's my size.

674
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:45,255
I don't know what your size is.

675
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,015
That's for my friend.

676
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:48,735
Girlfriend?

677
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,775
No.

678
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:55,095
Someone you like?

679
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:04,376
Yes.

680
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:07,416
Wait.

681
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,616
When did you have someone in your heart?

682
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,295
How could you like someone else?

683
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:13,896
What about me?

684
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:21,976
Don't you know

685
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:23,696
that I like you?

686
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:30,735
Yao Zizhu.

687
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:37,936
Xin Qi?

688
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,376
Xin Qi.

689
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:48,896
Xin Qi.

690
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:10,376
Does Min Hui know

691
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:12,176
that you like to eavesdrop on others?

692
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:16,535
This is a public area.

693
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,535
If you don't want others to hear you,

694
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,216
you shouldn't have talked here.

695
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:22,055
You seem to loathe me.

696
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:23,856
Aren't you the same?

697
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:27,176
I loathe you because I like Min Hui.

698
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,376
And I don't wish to see a man

699
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,095
hanging around her,

700
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,216
especially when this man
is the father of Quanquan.

701
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:32,176
What about you?

702
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:35,456
You admit this fast

703
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:37,055
even before I ask.

704
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,376
You've heard that, anyway.

705
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:41,015
I have nothing to hide.

706
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:42,856
I like Min Hui.

707
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,575
When I first saw her four years ago,

708
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:45,696
I fell for her.

709
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,775
Why didn't you tell her then?

710
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,575
Because you know

711
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,575
that she doesn't like you.

712
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,095
As long as I stay by her side,

713
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:02,015
she will realize something good
about me one day.

714
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,015
That girl earlier is pretty good too.

715
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,936
But will you like her because of this?

716
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:14,575
Zhou Ruji.

717
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,055
I'm grateful to you

718
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,335
for taking care of Min Hui and Quanquan

719
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:20,335
over the four years.

720
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:22,416
I mean what I said.

721
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:24,136
I can see

722
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:26,216
that Min Hui regards you highly too.

723
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:28,696
But from what I know about her,

724
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:30,856
she has never liked you
throughout the years

725
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,216
and she won't in the future.

726
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:34,376
Take it or leave it.

727
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:35,295
What about you?

728
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:41,255
Do you think Min Hui
will fall for you once again?

729
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,136
Yes, she will.

730

Quanquan is right.

741
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,695
You're not good at faking sleep.

742
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:03,015
Your eyelids were twitching.

743
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,936
The chocolate is nice.

744
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:08,896
Thank you.

745
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:11,175
I find this blood relationship

746
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,015
something miraculous.

747
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,135
Back then, when Quanquan
refused to go to the hospital,

748
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:16,896
I used to convince him with chocolate.

749
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,416
To be honest,

750
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:27,015
I've been studying your case recently.

751
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,615
Although I knew

752
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:31,655
that you were very sick five years ago,

753
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:35,256
I didn't realize it was so serious.

754
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:38,336
Five years ago,

755
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,416
you actually risked your life

756
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,416
to keep the promise.

757
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,456
Before I left the orphanage,

758
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,336
I've made a promise to Su Tian

759
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:53,615
that I'd come back fifteen years later.

760
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:56,976
I was very sick back then.

761
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,095
All of the kids in the orphanage
didn't like me.

762
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,936
Only she treated me as a friend.

763
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:05,655
So, deep inside,

764
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,535
I saw her as my blood sister.

765
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:11,535
I even thought

766
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:15,336
that she was the only kin I had
in this world.

767
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,695
Though I didn't know her for long,

768
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:23,856
everything she said

769
00:36:23,856 --> 00:36:25,215
was about you.

770
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,896
She had been looking forward

771
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:29,655
to meeting with you again.

772
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:32,095
I went to the temple to pray
for his goodness every year.

773
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:34,095
He will surely recover.

774
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,376
I believe in him.

775
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:38,336
Xin Qi will definitely
keep good his promise.

776
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:40,816
She said all she wished

777
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,495
was that you could
stand before her healthily.

778
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,055
And she would be satisfied.

779
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:51,936
Thank you, Min Hui.

780
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:56,695
Thank you for accompanying Su Tian
and telling me all this.

781
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,816
I never thought

782
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:01,535
that we could talk

783
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:03,495
about Su Tian calmly one day.

784
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:04,776
True.

785
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,015
Neither did I.

786
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,340
(Five years ago)

787
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:30,936
This is the place.

788
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:46,535
Hello.

789
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,495
You like this bracelet, don't you?

790
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:51,776
My husband made this himself,

791
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,175
named "Moon at Night".

792
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,816
What does it mean?

793
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:56,856
Though you're late for years,

794
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:59,976
I'm still happy upon your arrival.

795
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,055
I like this.

796
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:04,256
Please wrap it up for us.

797
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:05,416
Well.

798
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:08,456
You have to draw it
from these lucky sachets.

799
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:13,615
Love depends on fate, after all.

800
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:15,695
We have to draw to get that?

801
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,776
You will do it.

802
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:19,175
You do it.

803
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:19,816
You.

804
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:20,816
Me?

805
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,256
This one?

806
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:25,135
We'll take this.

807
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:29,296
It's number one?

808
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,055
What's the number?

809
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,095
Three.

810
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:40,256
Number three
is this pair of beautiful earrings.

811
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,015
They look pretty good.

812
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:44,215
We'll take this.

813
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,816
I will wrap this up for you.

814
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,816
Wait a moment.

815
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:47,816
Thank you.

816
00:38:59,055 --> 00:38:59,615
Ma'am.

817
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:02,015
I would like to take
all of the lucky sachets.

818
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:04,175
For someone I like,

819
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,416
I don't want to rely on fate.

820
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,296
I want to take control of myself.

821
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:08,336
Well, then.

822
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:09,055
Give me some time.

823
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,736
I'll wrap them up for you.
