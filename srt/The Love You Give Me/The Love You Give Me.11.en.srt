=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,160
=Episode 11=

25
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,553
Wait, I really don't get it.

26
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:48,512
Why should women wear these?

27
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:49,633
Well...

28
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:53,312
They won't be running fast
if they encounter a robber.

29
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:55,792
Not exactly.

30
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,792
I've seen women who ran faster than me

31
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,113
with high heels on.

32
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:01,033
Because you're weak.

33
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:03,553
Mr. Xin.

34
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,193
You've been stalling here for long.

35
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,273
Is there any pair
that catches your attention?

36
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,712
They all look the same, don't they?

37
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:13,393
Certainly not.

38
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:15,872
These are the classical 5cm heels,

39
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:18,073
suitable for high-heel beginners.

40
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,953
You can tell from
the streamlined design on the side

41
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,712
that it must be a masterpiece.

42
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:24,953
This is different.

43
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:26,752
The legendary skyscraper heels.

44
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,312
Women will exude a statuesque aura
after wearing them

45
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:29,712
even if they're short.

46
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,632
Oh, this is more amazing.

47
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,393
The latest fashion this year,

48
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,592
kitten heels.

49
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,513
This design is adopted by big brands.

50
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:39,472
Wait.

51
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,553
When did you learn all these?

52
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,513
It's always good to have
more strings to your bow.

53
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,712
But I kindly recommend you
buy this pair.

54
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,073
Trust my taste.

55
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,073
I can show you.

56
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,872
No, it's too small to fit me.

57
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:54,752
I can't.

58
00:02:54,993 --> 00:02:56,233
Pervert.

59
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,712
Excuse me.

60
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,472
Can you get me

61
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,953
the bestselling pair this season?

62
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,032
No problem.

63
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:05,113
Thank you.

64
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,720
(Jiaren Hospital)

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,793
You haven't left yet.

66
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:16,032
You're back, Dr. Zhou.

67
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,073
Why are you so late?

68
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,712
I just finished performing surgery.

69
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:23,833
Does anything go wrong?

70
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:24,912
It's fine.

71
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,192
It's done, anyway.

72
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,752
It's the last one today, right?

73
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,073
You work so late.

74
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,152
It must be tiring.

75
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:32,993
I'm off work. Got to go now.

76
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:34,273
Sure, see you tomorrow.

77
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,513
Wish you good luck.

78
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:03,273
A surprise for you.

79
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,273
It's me.

80
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,592
They said you'd be back soon.

81
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:08,472
But I waited for two hours.

82
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,353
What brings you here?

83
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,073
Please don't always say the same thing

84
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:15,152
whenever you see me.

85
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,872
Must I really come here with a purpose?

86
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,872
You must be tired
after doing surgery all day.

87
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,312
Are you hungry?

88
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,913
Let's grab something.

89
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:25,033
Well...I'm really fried.

90
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,553
I'll order food delivery for you.

91
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,272
I know there's one with good food.

92
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:28,793
Wait.

93
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:31,432
Why do you come here?

94
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:32,913
I...

95
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,192
I happened to pass by.

96
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:36,512
So I stopped in

97
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,192
and asked if you need any help.

98
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:40,512
Well.

99
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:41,632
I'm worn out today.

100
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,553
If there's nothing else,

101
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:44,952
you may go back first.

102
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:47,832
Sure.

103
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,632
Take a good rest.

104
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,713
Are you sure everything is all right?

105
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:58,473
Yes.

106
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:05,872
Actually, I know...

107
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:06,632
Everything is just fine.

108
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,952
Get rest.

109
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:14,832
Close the door.

110
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:26,033
He did buy the heels.

111
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,233
Isn't that for me?

112
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:29,952
It can't be.

113
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:31,553
That's my size.

114
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:35,233
Is he too shy

115
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,713
to give me that?

116
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:39,793
No way.

117
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,673
I keep hinting at him though.

118
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,000
(Ma Love QQ)

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,272
Quanquan.

120
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,192
Ask Xin Qi to send you
to the kindergarten,

121
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:50,752
all right?

122
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,913
I'm late for the meeting.

123
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:52,793
All right.

124
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,752
I have Xin Qi.

125
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:55,272
Good boy.

126
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:56,072
Hold on.

127
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,192
Take this with you.

128
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:01,233
Thank you.

129
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:17,312
I got this from a friend of mine.

130
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:19,192
I can't wear them though.

131
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:20,353
Lucky you.

132
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:22,632
Do you have friends in Bincheng?

133
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,432
There're lots of people in Bincheng
who want to butter me up.

134
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:27,952
Why did they give you women's shoes

135
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,072
to butter you up?

136
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,192
Stop gibbering.

137
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,512
Just take it.

138
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,553
I'm sure it's better
than someone's taste.

139
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,233
Thank you, but I don't need them.

140
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,713
I don't like wearing heels.

141
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,113
My friend wanted
to give me a pair of heels.

142
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,392
However,

143
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,632
I have noticed

144
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,913
that you walk a lot
and often work extra hours.

145
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,512
High heels look pretty.

146
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:50,473
However,

147
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,673
it's not good for your body
wearing them for long.

148
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:55,832
Wearing the flats...

149
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,593
I can do it myself.

150
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:57,952
You can go wherever you want.

151
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:02,153
Do they look good on you?

152
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:30,072
Well, I got to go now.

153
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:31,473
Thank you.

154
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:32,832
I...

155
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,233
I'm off for work.

156
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:35,553
Bye.

157
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,272
Take care.

158
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,272
You're shy.

159
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:54,952
I'm not.

160
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,512
The temperature is high.

161
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,353
Are you jealous of Daddy Zhou?

162
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,233
Not at all.

163
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:05,632
Don't worry.

164
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,353
Min Hui has no interest in Daddy Zhou.

165
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,713
I said I'm not jealous.

166
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:12,553
Have you eaten breakfast?

167
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:13,512
Hurry up and go get changed
after eating.

168
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:14,312
We're setting off.

169
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,153
Adults are always like that.

170
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:20,113
They never speak their mind.

171
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,792
What's wrong with him?

172
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:36,113
Why did he give me a pair of shoes
out of a sudden?

173
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,752
It's comfy to wear.

174
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,593
He chose a good pair.

175
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,632
It's strange.

176
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,433
Very strange.

177
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,073
The Chairwoman has tried her best

178
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,672
to persuade the shareholders of RG.

179
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:54,433
But the development

180
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:55,713
of AI cardiac modeling technology

181
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:56,752
can be a slow process,

182
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,512
and needs huge funding.

183
00:08:58,752 --> 00:08:59,953
Most importantly,

184
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,233
this technology has
been under development

185
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,833
by some teams overseas three years ago.

186
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,752
But no substantial progress was made.

187
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,593
Just because they couldn't develop it,

188
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:08,113
it doesn't mean that
it can't be done here.

189
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,272
They should have a broader sight.

190
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:11,993
Yes, you're right.

191
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,073
The Chairwoman agreed

192
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:16,073
to shift your focus
of Blue Jay back here

193
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:18,233
because she predicted
the potential domestic prospect.

194
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:19,872
But most of RG's shareholders

195
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:21,313
are reserved.

196
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:22,872
If they don't nod their heads on this,

197
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,473
I'm afraid this large scale of funding

198
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,632
can't proceed smoothly.

199
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,353
Book a flight to Beijing tomorrow.

200
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,473
Cao Mu.

201
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,512
You've bought so many swimming suits

202
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,872
in different designs,

203
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:43,872
but do you really mean
to learn to swim?

204
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:45,672
Mind your own business.

205
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:46,752
Speaking of which,

206
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,193
I've been looking at your shoes.

207
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,193
Looks nice

208
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,392
and comfy.

209
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,073
Where did you buy them?

210
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,313
I want to get a pair as well.

211
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,353
Someone gave me this.
Are you satisfied with this answer?

212
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,872
I knew it.

213
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,353
Who's it? Is it a man or a woman?

214
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,313
Mind your own business.

215
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:03,593
Judging by that tone,

216
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,473
it must be a man.

217
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,193
Zhou Ruji? Impossible.

218
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,113
You would've told me if it was him.

219
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:10,713
Xin Qi.

220
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,593
Goodness.

221
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,512
You are fast.

222
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,152
Are you already at the point

223
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,792
of giving intimate gifts?

224
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,113
No.

225
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,272
It's true this is from him.

226
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,713
Because someone gave him this.

227
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,032
He gave me the shoes
because he couldn't wear them.

228
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,392
That's it.

229
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,512
Is he courting you?

230
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,953
That's impossible. Nonsense.

231
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,713
Why not?

232
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:39,993
There are many problems between us.

233
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,833
Solve the problems then.

234
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,032
Nothing can stop a lovely pair

235
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:45,512
from being together.

236
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:48,272
Did you read some cheesy romance again?

237
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:49,872
Let me ask you.

238
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:51,552
Do you like him?

239
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,152
It's hard to describe my feeling

240
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,313
by simply liking him or not.

241
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,953
What do you mean?

242
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:04,912
Maybe

243
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,953
the best relationship between us

244
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:08,993
is to have no relationship

245
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,713
for now.

246
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,193
I don't understand.

247
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,552
Me neither.

248
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,380
(Bincheng Nanshan
Taohuayuan Kindergarten)

249
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,833
Quanquan. See, I'm not late.

250
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,512
Why is it you?

251
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:32,272
Why not?

252
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,752
Xin Qi said he would come.

253
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,073
Min Quanquan.

254
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:37,233
How can you be like this?

255
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:38,353
This is not fair.

256
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,632
I will get jealous.

257
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,433
Why do adults

258
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,593
always get jealous?

259
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,353
Who else?

260
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:48,353
Xin Qi. He's jealous of Daddy Zhou.

261
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,233
Oh, gosh.

262
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,120
Don't talk nonsense.

263
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,080
- I'm doing very well today.
- Little kid, don't be naughty.

264
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,390
- Let's go home.
- Why do you know so much?

265
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,392
Min Quanquan's mom.

266
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:00,233
Zijun's mom.

267
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,433
Here's the thing.

268
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,272
This weekend,

269
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,672
we'll have a parent-child event.

270
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,552
I wonder if you can join us?

271
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:08,552
Well.

272
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,272
Because I'm usually
quite busy with work.

273
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,552
I'm not sure if I have time for that.

274
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:13,993
I see.

275
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,872
Mommy, let's join in.

276
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,193
I want to see what it's like.

277
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:19,392
Please.

278
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:20,272
All right.

279
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:21,313
Got it.

280
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,272
I'll try to make time for it.

281
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,272
That's great.

282
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,193
Let's divide the work then.

283
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,233
Everyone will bring different food

284
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,032
to make it more diverse.

285
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,792
What are you good at making?

286
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,473
Cookies, cake,

287
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:36,272
or pizza? Anything is fine.

288
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:37,953
I...

289
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:39,233
I don't know either of them.

290
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:42,632
Mommy, you're so embarrassing.

291
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,392
It's fine.

292
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,872
I will help you to prepare it.

293
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,193
It's fine.

294
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,912
Since it's a parent-child event,

295
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,672
more interaction is expected

296
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:51,632
between parents and children.

297
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:52,672
Though I don't know how to make it,

298
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,113
I can learn.

299
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,073
How about

300
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,313
I prepare some cupcakes?

301
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:57,713
It's the simplest. Is that okay?

302
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:58,752
Sure, see you then.

303
00:12:58,752 --> 00:12:59,953
See you then.

304
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:00,752
Bye-bye.

305
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:01,233
Bye-bye.

306
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,280
- How could you say that I'm embarrassed
- Let's go.

307
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,392
in front of the others just now?

308
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:10,752
Corn oil, milk, and cake flour.

309
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,833
They are easy ingredients.

310
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,912
Min Hui.

311
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:16,552
Can you ask Xin Qi

312
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,272
to come to the event too?

313
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,552
My friends have both parents attending.

314
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,353
I'll have to ask him if he has time.

315
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,672
Sure, ask him as soon as possible.

316
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:28,392
All right.

317
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,593
I will ask him when he comes back, okay?

318
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:32,433
Good boy.

319
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,473
You should go to bed now.

320
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:37,792
Sure.

321
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,500
(When are you coming back?)

322
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:57,953
Still up?

323
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,353
You're back.

324
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,032
What's up?

325
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:03,792
Nothing.

326
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,593
Quanquan said he wanted
to listen to the bedtime story from you.

327
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,152
He's already asleep.

328
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:12,752
By the way,

329
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:12,953
Xin...

330
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,353
I'm going on a business trip
to Beijing tomorrow.

331
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,233
Hardy will stay here with you.

332
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,632
Call him if you need anything.

333
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:20,672
You're leaving tomorrow?

334
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:22,672
How long?

335
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:26,032
It'll take one day or two
if things pan out.

336
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,433
If not,

337
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,032
I will stay for a longer time.

338
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,152
What's it you wanted to tell me?

339
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:36,233
Well...

340
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,433
I forgot.

341
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,193
It's fine.

342
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,353
I will go to bed now.

343
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,193
Go ahead.

344
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,672
(I'm sorry, Quanquan.)

345
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,672
(I've asked him already.)

346
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,433
(He's not free that day.)

347
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:10,593
Watch your tempo.

348
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:12,193
Keep your legs straight.

349
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,073
Remember to do kickings.

350
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:14,912
Right.

351
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,272
I have something to attend to.

352
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,433
Please cover for me.

353
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,792
This is the last time.

354
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:20,473
Sure.

355
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:20,953
Thank you.

356
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:21,433
It's cool.

357
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:22,272
(Chen Jiajun.)

358
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,272
(If I can't get you down to the pool,)

359
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,433
(I'm going to eat my hat.)

360
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:33,313
Cramp!

361
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:38,193
Help!

362
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,073
Don't be afraid.

363
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,593
Are you fine?

364
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:02,752
I'm thirsty.

365
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,672
Please get me a bottle of water.

366
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:06,152
Sure.

367
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,313
I will go now.

368
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:11,113
Are you sure you're all right?

369
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:12,353
Yes.

370
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,780
(Lift the whisk
after stirring the mixture fine.)

371
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,152
Draw a figure "8".

372
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,152
I can't see the texture

373
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,752
after stirring it.

374
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:37,193
Add in some more.

375
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,152
More, I think.

376
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,713
Min Hui, you put too much flour in it.

377
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:44,713
Really?

378
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,073
It's hard to stir

379
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,512
and it's very dry.

380
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,912
I will add some milk.

381
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,632
How much should I add?

382
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,233
Maybe this much.

383
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:01,073
Too much milk.

384
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,993
Who knows if it works?

385
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:05,393
Give it a try.

386
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,673
Let's bake it, right?

387
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,433
What if it works?

388
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,792
Why are there so many bubbles?

389
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,980
(Min Hui)

390
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:36,953
(Mommy is making the cake seriously.)

391
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,552
(I don't think it will work out.)

392
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:41,873
That's not right.

393
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,072
Quanquan.

394
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,993
Is the cake supposed
to have lots of bubbles?

395
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,060
(Min Hui)

396
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:06,552
Be careful.

397
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,032
Quanquan.

398
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:11,953
Let me see.

399
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:12,953
It's fine.

400
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,552
Look.

401
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,673
Min Hui, I don't think

402
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,433
it looks like a cake.

403
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,832
It's like a cookie.

404
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,112
How come it turned out like this?

405
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,032
There were a lot of bubbles just now.

406
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,953
How could it be so flat now?

407
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:30,393
Perhaps we should just give up.

408
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,713
We can buy cakes from the bakery

409
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,193
to take to the kindergarten.

410
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:37,272
They won't know it's not done by you.

411
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:38,832
No.

412
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:41,032
We shouldn't lie.

413
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,272
Besides, this is your first

414
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,433
parent-child event.

415
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,272
I must make it myself.

416
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,953
But...

417
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,473
It's fine, Quanquan.

418
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:52,112
We should be brave and try, right?

419
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:53,633
The cake failed

420
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
maybe because I baked it at 150 degrees

421
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,592
for twenty minutes.

422
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,312
Where's he?

423
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:02,552
I shouldn't have said I was thirsty.

424
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,552
Help!

425
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:05,473
Help!

426
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,792
Help!

427
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,272
Help!

428
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:32,393
Give me a hand.

429
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,393
Are you all right? Did you choke?

430
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:36,072
Are you fine?

431
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:37,752
Keep an eye on her.

432
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,393
It's dangerous
to leave her in the pool alone.

433
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,473
Thank you so much.

434
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:41,153
It's fine.

435
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,592
Are you all right?

436
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:45,233
Did you get choked?

437
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:07,272
Min Hui.

438
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,913
Min Hui.

439
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,552
What's wrong? Is the house on fire?

440
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:12,913
No.

441
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:13,473
I will call the police.

442
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,193
It's fine.

443
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,112
No need to call the police.

444
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,352
Let the air circulate.

445
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:17,112
What has happened?

446
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:18,272
I was baking a cake.

447
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,393
Come in and have a seat.

448
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:23,592
Maybe...

449
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,832
Maybe later.

450
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,953
Don't look at me like that.

451
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:40,873
I didn't expect

452
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,552
this could be so difficult.

453
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:46,592
Had I known about this,

454
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,913
I would rather get back to coding.

455
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:52,552
It's good that Quanquan
has gone out with Hardy.

456
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,633
Otherwise, he would
make me eat all of them.

457
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,673
People always said

458
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,352
that when you're given some talents,

459
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,272
you will lose some talents too.

460
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:03,233
I suppose this is what you've lost.

461
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,713
I seem to have lost it so thoroughly.

462
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:08,233
I followed the online tutorial

463
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,752
step by step, meticulously.

464
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,072
Yet it turned out like this.

465
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:15,752
I'm thinking to hire a cooking tutor.

466
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,233
It's not necessary.

467
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,832
I'm your godsend.

468
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:24,512
Don't tell me you can make cakes.

469
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:25,993
I can't right now,

470
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,193
but I think I can get the hang of it
sooner than you.

471
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:30,633
Show me the tutorial.

472
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,433
This is it.

473
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,780
(Hardy)

474
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:39,873
Hello.

475
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:41,832
(Xin Qi, I miss you.)

476
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:43,352
(When are you coming back?)

477
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,072
Two days later.

478
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:46,512
What are you doing?

479
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,673
Hardy and I are buying snacks

480
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,153
for the kindergarten
lunch party tomorrow.

481
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,072
Look, we bought so many.

482
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,153
Mr. Xin.

483
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:56,873
Per your order,

484
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:58,592
I'm taking great care of Quan.

485
00:21:58,592 --> 00:21:59,873
Rest assured.

486
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:02,032
All right, I'll give you a raise.

487
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:03,512
Quanquan.

488
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:05,832
What's the kindergarten
lunch party about?

489
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:08,233
All of the students are going
to prepare delicious food

490
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,352
with daddies and mommies

491
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,393
and share it with everyone.

492
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:13,993
There'll be game activities too.

493
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,112
So, Min Hui is learning
how to make cupcakes

494
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:18,072
because of this?

495
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,473
Yes, she's serious about that.

496
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:23,552
I wanted to ask you to come.

497
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,193
But Min Hui said you're busy.

498
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,352
Says who.

499
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,032
Yes, I'm quite tied up these days.

500
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,072
I'm going back two days later, okay?

501
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,592
I've forgiven you.

502
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:34,592
Bye-bye.

503
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:35,993
Bye-bye.

504
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:48,953
Zhou Ruji.

505
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:52,592
How many hidden talents
do you keep from me?

506
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:54,312
I just tried it.

507
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,953
This is awesome.

508
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:57,552
You made it so easily.

509
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,072
So, I will follow your step
to do it tomorrow.

510
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:01,832
I guess everything is within control.

511
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:02,633
It seems so.

512
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:04,032
I will write a note for you,

513
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,673
and mark the parts
that are easy to make mistakes.

514
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:06,953
Thank you.

515
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,752
I'm so grateful to you.

516
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:09,393
You have no idea

517
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:10,752
how fearful I am

518
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,193
of seeing Quanquan disappointed.

519
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,072
I will do it.

520
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,913
Why doesn't Xin Qi

521
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:17,993
attend the parent-child event tomorrow?

522
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,393
Is he busy or...

523
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,272
No, he went on a business trip.

524
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:21,953
You know what,

525
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:24,072
Quanquan really wanted him to go.

526
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:26,032
What about you?

527
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:27,993
Do you want him to go?

528
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,953
Be honest?

529
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:32,713
I hope that he can go too.

530
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:35,552
You know,

531
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,873
I just came to realize

532
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:40,473
that Quanquan needs
a father desperately.

533
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,233
What has happened?
Did Xin Qi say anything to you?

534
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,233
He didn't.

535
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,792
I figured this out myself.

536
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:49,233
Quanquan was so overjoyed

537
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,112
when Xin Qi took him
to the amusement park earlier.

538
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,112
It's been a long while

539
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:53,393
since I saw that happy face on him.

540
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:55,433
Perhaps there are many things

541
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:56,953
that I can't do

542
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,913
to fill up the gap in a father figure.

543
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,592
Could it be that

544
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,512
Xin Qi has spent
so much time with Quanquan lately,

545
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,592
and he has become reliant on him?

546
00:24:04,953 --> 00:24:06,433
But Xin Qi can't stay here forever.

547
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:07,512
Perhaps Quanquan will be fine

548
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,193
after he leaves.

549
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:12,473
Quanquan always wants a father.

550
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:15,233
But I always refuse to face this.

551
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:16,873
These past few days,

552
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,473
I've been asking myself

553
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:19,433
if I really have the heart

554
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,752
to let Quanquan grow up
with this regret.

555
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:26,193
Are you trying to get back together
with Xin Qi?

556
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:27,552
Of course, not.

557
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,752
I haven't thought of it at all.

558
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:34,312
But perhaps we can both try our best

559
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:36,433
to be good parents to Quanquan.

560
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:44,873
You've lied to me once

561
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:47,352
and I've tricked you once.

562
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,193
Let's drink this

563
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:50,752
and let bygones be bygones.

564
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:02,792
You were quite professional

565
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:04,433
when you saved the girl just now.

566
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:06,233
Not really.

567
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,592
I was on a swim team before.

568
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:09,193
The school coach taught us.

569
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,713
You were on a swim team?

570
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:12,993
Can't you tell?

571
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:15,153
I got these perfect body curves

572
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,512
from swimming.

573
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,352
But I lost interest in that
when I was in college

574
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,433
and never swam again.

575
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:22,713
How many years did you learn?

576
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,193
About seven or eight years.

577
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:26,433
Seven or eight years?

578
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:28,512
And you just gave it up?

579
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,153
That's nothing to feel weird about.

580
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:33,112
I can't even like someone for long.

581
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:34,633
What so matters about mere sports?

582
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:36,512
Why can't you?

583
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:38,032
The happiest thing in life

584
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,072
is to find someone

585
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,112
who you like

586
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:41,233
and stick with her for life?

587
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:46,193
Isn't that true?

588
00:25:57,713 --> 00:25:58,552
Cao Mu.

589
00:25:58,673 --> 00:25:59,873
Are you thinking about seeing me

590
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:01,512
like how I secretly came
to see you before?

591
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,512
You're calling my name now?

592
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:07,953
How bold of you.

593
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:09,153
Chen Jiajun.

594
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:11,752
Yes, I'm bold.

595
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:18,713
Answer me.

596
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,193
What if I don't tell you?

597
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:21,993
Take a guess.

598
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,832
You're so drunk.

599
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:56,713
It's better to ask the designated driver
to take you to my place.

600
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:03,752
You're Cao Mu.

601
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:05,473
And you're Chen Jiajun.

602
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:10,233
Get ready for the competition.

603
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:12,752
Oh, you can make a sound.

604
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,713
Do you need a brief introduction
of each other before the competition?

605
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:18,673
No.

606
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:19,552
Okay.

607
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,752
You have the backbone, huh?

608
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,153
Real man.

609
00:27:24,552 --> 00:27:25,312
Start.

610
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:26,832
Hold yourself properly.

611
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:30,552
Stand upright.

612
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:32,673
Hold yourself properly.

613
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,792
Ready.

614
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:38,312
Go.

615
00:27:47,473 --> 00:27:49,673
Chen Jiajun. Chase after her.

616
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:50,792
Come on.

617
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:53,913
Go.

618
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:00,953
What are you doing here?

619
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:13,233
Cao Mu.

620
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:15,792
Can I

621
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:18,913
kiss you?

622
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:27,072
So, you're being polite now?

623
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,473
It's different when you were in the pub.

624
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,193
May I?

625
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:38,153
No.

626
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,512
But I can kiss you.

627
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,233
You're awake.

628
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:24,352
Your clothes are washed.

629
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,272
I put them over there.

630
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:26,352
I've ordered breakfast for you.

631
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,792
Eat it before you leave.

632
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:30,713
Yesterday...

633
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:33,393
We did

634
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,193
nothing, right?

635
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:37,233
You're a good kisser.

636
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,633
Where did you learn from?

637
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,193
You're

638
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,713
my first kiss

639
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,393
and my first...

640
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,552
What are you talking about?

641
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:46,993
You were too drunk

642
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,352
to do anything.

643
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,673
I'm off for work.

644
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,100
(Parent-Child Self Service Lunch Party,
Team Up To Share The Happiness)

645
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,900
(A Gathering of Naive Hearts)

646
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
(Dear and Happy Family)

647
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:09,072
Min Hui, are the cupcakes okay?

648
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:09,953
No worries, Quanquan.

649
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:10,792
It'll be fine.

650
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,473
I learned it from Daddy Zhou.

651
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,193
Besides, I've prepared snacks.

652
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:16,193
No kid can resist snacks,

653
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:16,673
right?

654
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:18,032
I won't embarrass you.

655
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,260
You're great, baby.

656
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,153
Hello, parents.

657
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:27,713
Thank you for taking the time

658
00:30:27,713 --> 00:30:28,953
to join the parent-child lunch party

659
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,473
of our class.

660
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,272
What have we got today?

661
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,272
Kids,

662
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:36,112
choose a table and stand before it

663
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:37,592
to let me know your favorite,
all right?

664
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,112
- Yes.
- Yes.

665
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:38,993
Be quick.

666
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:40,072
Go and look around.

667
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Have a look at this.

668
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,713
The cookies look beautiful.

669
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:46,953
Huanhuan.

670
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,072
The kid likes this.

671
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:49,913
Do you want a cupcake?

672
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,312
I don't want it.

673
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:58,272
Mommy, look. They've done so well.

674
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,673
There are small desserts
and cartoon cakes.

675
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:03,112
Quanquan, I've done my best.

676
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,673
But they can't appreciate it.

677
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:06,352
The cakes are yummy.

678
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,512
Ms. Liu.

679
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,433
Ms. Min.

680
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:16,153
This is your first time?

681
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,393
Yes.

682
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:19,953
I haven't done this before.

683
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:21,873
It's fine. It's the thought that counts.

684
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:23,153
Maybe they don't look quite pleasant,

685
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,473
but I've tasted it.

686
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,633
It's good.

687
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:26,993
Kids.

688
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:28,552
Do you want to eat a cupcake?

689
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,312
I have yummy cupcakes here.

690
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,352
Do you want to have a taste?

691
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:32,032
Yes?

692
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:33,352
- No.
- No.

693
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:34,072
Do you want to try this?

694
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:35,433
- No.
- No.

695
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,260
No.

696
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:38,673
It's really yummy.

697
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:41,673
Look, the bunny.

698
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,552
Quanquan, I...

699
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,112
Quanquan's cakes are over here.

700
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,193
Mr. Xin.

701
00:31:48,193 --> 00:31:49,072
Dad.

702
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:49,953
Why are you here?

703
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:50,792
Ms. Liu.

704
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:53,993
She's quite busy with work,

705
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:56,552
but she values this activity

706
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:58,112
very much.

707
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:01,072
She had tried her best
to make the cakes.

708
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,272
The cakes might not look good,

709
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,312
but her love for our son

710
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,873
isn't any less than other moms.

711
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,193
I understand.

712
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:11,792
Since it's a parent-child event,

713
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,112
as Quanquan's dad,

714
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:14,633
I also want to contribute.

715
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,312
So, I will customize a cake

716
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,272
for each child here.

717
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,272
Right, Quanquan?

718
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:21,153
Yes.

719
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:22,393
Kids.

720
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:24,352
What kind of cake do you like?

721
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:26,352
Quanquan, me

722
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:27,633
and his mother

723
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,592
will make one for you all,

724
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:30,233
all right?

725
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,953
- Yes.
- Yes.

726
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:32,832
Thank you so much.

727
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:33,433
It's fine.

728
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:34,433
Thank you, Mr. Xin.

729
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:35,552
Thank you, Ms. Min.

730
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,473
- Thank you, Mr. Xin.
- Thank you, Mr. Xin.

731
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:40,193
Who's going to make that? I can't.

732
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,112
Give it to me.

733
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:43,153
Can you do this?

734
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:46,153
Huanhuan, what kind of cake do you want?

735
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:48,032
My dad can do it for you.

736
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,673
I want a cake with Elsa.

737
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:51,592
Sure, no problem.

738
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,072
Let's make it now.

739
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,713
What kind of cake do you want?

740
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:56,112
Come with me.

741
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:56,953
I want a little bunny.

742
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:57,312
Go ahead.

743
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:57,832
No worries.

744
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:00,633
I want a little princess.

745
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:01,832
Sure.

746
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:02,312
I want one too.

747
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:03,393
I want a rocket.

748
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:03,832
Of course.

749
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:04,953
I want mousse.

750
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,433
Miss Cao likes this?

751
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,832
I didn't expect that of you.

752
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,633
It's cute.

753
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,340
(Cao Mu)

754
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:46,112
(Hold yourself properly.)

755
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:47,233
(Go.)

756
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:50,993
What?

757
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,020
(Bincheng Nanshan
Taohuayuan Kindergarten)

758
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:03,153
That's amazing.

759
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:12,353
Kids.

760
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,072
Do you like this?

761
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

762
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,780
Very good.

763
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:17,032
Come on.

764
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
You're amazing.

765
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:20,393
Give me a hand, Hardy.

766
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,873
Let's cut this first, okay?

767
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:22,913
Sure. Let's do it.

768
00:34:22,913 --> 00:34:23,712
Take the plate.

769
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,112
Everyone will have one.

770
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:25,913
Son, come here.

771
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:27,512
Three, two, one.

772
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,152
It's yours.

773
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:29,712
Thank you.

774
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:30,753
This is for you.

775
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,152
Let's go.

776
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:34,032
Mommy.

777
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:36,873
Quanquan.

778
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:38,993
I don't want this ugly cupcake.

779
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,712
Let's eat

780
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,592
the beautiful cake over there.

781
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:44,232
It looks kind of dull,

782
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:45,993
but the taste...

783
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:50,632
It's not bad.

784
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:52,112
Son.

785
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:55,032
Your mommy made this.

786
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:56,112
Don't waste it.

787
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:00,913
Yummy.

788
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:02,913
Are you sure?

789
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:10,873
It tastes yummy.

790
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:11,473
Yes.

791
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:16,993
Quanquan.

792
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,512
What about the three of us

793
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:22,993
making a cake for ourselves?

794
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:23,953
All right?

795
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:24,793
Sure.

796
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,592
Count me out.

797
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:26,353
I'm clumsy though.

798
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,833
I will ruin it.

799
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:31,433
I will handle the equipment.

(Five years ago)

812
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:05,672
Hey.

813
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:07,232
The cake over here tastes really good.

814
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,980
Hello, this is your cake.

815
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,600
- Please enjoy it.
- That one.

816
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,712
It looks good.

817
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:11,592
Yes, that one.

818
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:13,152
Pretty good.

819
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:15,433
You eat first.

820
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:18,753
Xin Qi.

821
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:20,672
Look at that couple.

822
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:22,793
Do you think there are still people

823
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:23,833
who use such an outdated way to propose,

824
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,793
like hiding the ring in a cake?

825
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,152
Outdated?

826
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:28,433
Yes.

827
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,032
What an old hat.

828
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,833
I find it quite romantic though.

829
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:36,433
Seriously?

830
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,512
Look.

831
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,152
I told you.

832
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:45,152
Baby.

833
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:46,913
Marry me, please.

834
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,632
Gosh, I think it depends.

835
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:52,753
If I were there,

836
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:53,793
I will cringe to death.

837
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:54,753
I can't accept this.

838
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:56,313
Look. There are so many people
around them.

839
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:58,353
Many of them are taking photos.

840
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,592
No.

841
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,353
This is the red velvet cake you ordered.

842
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:08,953
Please enjoy it.

843
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,833
Thank you.

844
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,552
It looks great.

845
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:14,273
I'll have a try first.

846
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:14,953
Hold on.

847
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:15,873
What?

848
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:16,632
Well...

849
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:17,512
This...

850
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,512
This isn't the cake I ordered.

851
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:20,273
I'll go get you another one.

852
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:21,273
Isn't it the same?

853
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:22,512
Xin Qi.

854
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,072
Please order your drink.

855
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:47,833
Hello, Xin Qi.

856
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:48,953
What took you so long?

857
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:49,552
Where are you?

858
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:50,552
(I can't find you.)

859
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:51,793
On my way back.

860
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:53,473
I have a surprise for you.

861
00:38:53,473 --> 00:38:54,993
I'm not in the cafe now.

862
00:38:54,993 --> 00:38:55,953
Where are you now? Tell me.

863
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:56,793
I'll meet you there.

864
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,552
I'm now at...

865
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:03,793
What's wrong, Xin Qi?

866
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:05,313
Hello.

867
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,353
Xin Qi.

868
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,112
Coming through.

869
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:19,993
Is it painful when I press here?

870
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,433
Ouch.

871
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:23,993
Careful.

872
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:30,712
Let's go to the hospital.

873
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:31,873
Xin Qi.

874
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:33,793
Are you all right? What has happened?

875
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:34,953
I'm good.

876
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,433
I just felt some discomfort in my heart.

877
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,993
I send you to the hospital, all right?

878
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,032
No.

879
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:42,072
I'm much better now after some rest.

880
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:43,753
Glad to know that.

881
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:44,993
Just now...

882
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:46,953
I thought...

883
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:48,712
Don't be afraid.

884
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,552
You're here with me.

885
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:51,873
I'm not ready to die so soon.

886
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:53,993
Don't say that word.

887
00:40:01,393 --> 00:40:02,632
