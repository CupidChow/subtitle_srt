=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 21=

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,179
(Gaga Garden)
You've asked a lot about me.

26
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,298
Maybe you should tell me

27
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:42,819
a little more about yourself too.

28
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,498
I'm a simple man.

29
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,459
I hold a master's degree.

30
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,259
As for my height, weight, and looks,

31
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,259
you've seen them.

32
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,539
Humbly speaking,

33
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,658
I'm definitely above average.

34
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,018
You are quite humble.

35
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,938
I've always preferred to stay low.

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,418
This is what I think

37
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:00,699
about the two of us.

38
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:03,018
You're almost 30.

39
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:04,979
You take good care of yourself,

40
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,419
but that's quite high of an age
for a woman.

41
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,538
I have years to go before I turn 30.

42
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,818
Well, you're almost there anyway.

43
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:12,859
Listen.

44
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:15,218
Men are different from women.

45
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:16,258
Look at me.

46
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:17,698
I may be 32,

47
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:20,778
but I'm at the age
when men are most attractive.

48
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,899
Now, women, on the other hand,

49
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,419
start to lose their value

50
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,978
once they turn 30.

51
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,139
But there's one thing good about you.

52
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,258
You're pretty.

53
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,339
Our children will look beautiful.

54
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:35,658
Speaking of children,

55
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:36,978
we'll get engaged first.

56
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,938
Then, we'll register our marriage
and hold the wedding

57
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,538
after you give birth to a son.

58
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,818
Let me stop you right there.

59
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,778
I don't think we've gotten far enough
to warrant that discussion.

60
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,299
What do you mean?

61
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,619
I don't mind settling for you.

62
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,179
Do you actually have complaints
about me instead?

63
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,378
What gives you the right
to complain about me?

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,619
Academically,

65
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,818
you graduated from a university

66
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,059
that's at least 200 ranks below mine.

67
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:56,778
Income-wise,

68
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,859
I make thrice the money than you do.

69
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,378
As for children?

70
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,019
I can't believe I'm still hearing

71
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,818
about marrying after giving birth
to a son in this day and age.

72
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,739
Men are most attractive at 32?

73
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,299
Let me tell you something.

74
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,218
Women are attractive
regardless of their age.

75
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,978
Of course, someone like you
wouldn't be able to see that.

76
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,098
You see things at a lower height
than everyone else, after all.

77
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:14,778
What does that mean?

78
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,098
Are you calling me a dog?

79
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,778
I guess you're not that stupid.

80
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,218
You should stay low.

81
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,538
After all, you're only this tall.

82
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,179
You...

83
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:23,739
A blind date?

84
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:28,098
Let me go.

85
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:30,538
Are you so lonely

86
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:31,498
after breaking up with Xin Qi

87
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,258
that you would settle for a blind date
with a man like that?

88
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,619
If you need the company that much,

89
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:36,899
you can come to me.

90
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,859
You can be my mistress.

91
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:39,658
How about it?

92
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,258
I said, let go!

93
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,778
You haven't answered my question.

94
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:53,019
She told you to let go of her.

95
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,378
Just do it and shut up.

96
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:58,840
Stay away from her.

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,978
(Gaga Garden)
Min Hui!

98
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,538
I'm glad I didn't go further with her.

99
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,579
Wait, Min Hui!

100
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,258
Hear me out!

101
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,739
Who told you I was there?

102
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:11,658
Cao Mu?

103
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:12,619
It had to be her.

104
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,019
It's Chen Jiajun.

105
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,859
They're the same.

106
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:16,859
No.

107
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,219
Everyone can tell
that I still have feelings for you.

108
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,138
And everyone thinks

109
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,739
that it would be a pity
if we parted ways just like that.

110
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,219
It doesn't matter
what everyone else thinks.

111
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,458
What matters is what I think.

112
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,099
Min Hui,

113
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,498
did you rush into the blind dates

114
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,859
because you're afraid
of falling for me again?

115
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,539
Of course not.

116
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,138
Don't think so highly of yourself.

117
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:45,059
You're ridiculous.

118
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:45,619
Just...

119
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,378
Don't touch me.

120
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,458
What's wrong?

121
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,698
Are you faking it again?

122
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,898
What do you mean "again"?

123
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,179
First of all,
I was actually sick last time.

124
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,219
Secondly, this...

125
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:00,419
I twisted my wrist
when I hit Cheng Qirang.

126
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:01,419
Let me see it.

127
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:02,659
Here.

128
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,338
You shouldn't have bothered
with such trivial matters.

129
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:09,779
I could've hit him myself.

130
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:12,219
Nothing about you is trivial!

131
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,578
Everything that concerns you is serious!

132
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,059
I'll tell you

133
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,859
something serious right now.

134
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,179
Stop interfering with my life.

135
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,578
That's the best for both of us.

136
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:25,859
You're leaving just like that?

137
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,018
You're going to leave
an injured patient here?

138
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,378
What do you want me to do, then?

139
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,059
I hurt my hand. I can't drive.

140
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,138
Send me home.

141
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,498
I'll have Hardy come and pick you up.

142
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,138
I sent him to Shanghai
on a business trip.

143
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,619
I'll call you a cab, then.

144
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,179
No, the drivers are awful.

145
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,619
I might get another heart attack.

146
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,498
You really want me to drive you back?

147
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:53,779
Yes.

148
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:56,979
Please.

149
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:58,898
Please.

150
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,338
We made a deal.

151
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,698
I'll leave right after I pick up

152
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,818
the toy for Quanquan.

153
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:13,979
Okay.

154
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,979
Quanquan will love what I got him.

155
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:20,698
I forgot about him.

156
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:21,659
Mr. Xin.

157
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,539
Hardy.

158
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:23,859
Ms. Min Hui.

159
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,338
Wasn't he supposed to be in Shanghai?

160
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:28,458
Yes.

161
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,898
I just got back.

162
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,979
I came here to pick up some documents.

163
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,539
I'll leave right after I get them.

164
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,138
Xin Qi.

165
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:36,578
I'll get the stuff for Quanquan.

166
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,258
Have a seat, Ms. Min Hui.

167
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,299
When he first moved into this place,

168
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,779
he said he wanted to plant a big tree.

169
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,059
Since then,

170
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,619
he often stared into space when
he came home, looking at this tree.

171
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,498
I didn't understand why at first.

172
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,018
But I found out about it later on.

173
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:13,698
He hasn't forgotten about you at all

174
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,179
for the past five years.

175
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:17,378
Ms. Min Hui,

176
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,539
you're the only one he has ever loved.

177
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,539
This is the building block set
Quanquan has always wanted.

178
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,138
I'm sure he'll love it.

179
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,099
Okay.
I thank you on his behalf. I'm off.

180
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,498
Um...

181
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:37,099
My hand is swollen.
I need someone to put medicine on it.

182
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,619
Did you hear that, Hardy?

183
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,219
Your boss's hand is swollen.

184
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:42,818
I'm running late.

185
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,018
I need to hurry back to the company.

186
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,258
I'm off.

187
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:55,739
Min Hui.

188
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:57,179
What?

189
00:07:58,219 --> 00:07:59,859
Nothing. Just wanted to say your name.

190
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,898
You're annoying.

191
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:04,059
Min Hui.

192
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,138
What?

193
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,018
Can you not go on
those blind dates anymore?

194
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,498
Someone as genuine as you are

195
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,419
deserves a genuine romance.

196
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,059
You shouldn't be talking about marriage

197
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,498
and feelings with men like that.

198
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,219
Sure.

199
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:21,938
If you keep your distance
from me from now on,

200
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,099
I won't have to.

201
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,059
Are you going on those blind dates
to get rid of me?

202
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,018
In a sense,

203
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,299
yes.

204
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:32,578
Then,

205
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,818
let's make a deal.

206
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,338
I won't pester you anymore,

207
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:37,539
so don't go on those dates anymore.

208
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:38,379
How about it?

209
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,059
Great.

210
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,858
You've finally decided to give up on me.

211
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,499
I didn't say that.

212
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,338
I just meant

213
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,019
that I wouldn't use

214
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,299
what they taught me
to pursue you anymore.

215
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:53,259
I'm going to use my own ways
to get you back.

216
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:00,259
I suggest you better give up on this.

217
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,499
I'm not easy to get.

218
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:03,259
I'm leaving.

219
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,338
What's wrong?

220
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,218
This isn't another

221
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,659
of Chen Jiajun's tricks, is it?

222
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,259
Xin Qi, are you all right?

223
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,738
Xin Qi?

224
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,458
I'm not.

225
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,098
Can you stay with me?

226
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,779
No.

227
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,059
That looked real.

228
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,338
I'm leaving.
I'll deliver your gift to Quanquan.

229
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,419
Take this.

230
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,539
No. This is too sexy.

231
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,899
You're going on a business trip alone.

232
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,338
You'll attract perverts
if you dress so sexily.

233
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,419
I've always dressed like that,

234
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,818
and I've been fine.

235
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:05,539
Also,

236
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,618
even if I do come across one,

237
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,338
that has nothing to do with what I wear.

238
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,059
That's misogynistic.

239
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:11,419
My point is

240
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,499
you should be careful

241
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,259
going on a business trip alone.

242
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,698
All right. Got it. Don't worry.

243
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,499
First of all,
I go on business trips very often.

244
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,019
I can handle these things.

245
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,499
Secondly, even if I have to be careful,

246
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:23,338
I don't need to watch what I wear.

247
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:27,978
Well, I can't help it.

248
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,179
We just made up,

249
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,458
and you're leaving.

250
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,379
I'm worried about you.
I can't bear to be away from you.

251
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:33,899
How about this?

252
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:34,858
Take me with you.

253
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,379
I'll be your personal bodyguard.

254
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,858
You adorable thing.

255
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,578
Personal bodyguard?

256
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,179
You can't protect me for my entire life.

257
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,019
Besides,

258
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,338
you can't let yourself
get distracted at work

259
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:47,218
because of me anymore, okay?

260
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,299
I can take leave.

261
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,458
You didn't know me before this,

262
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,259
so it can't be helped.

263
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:51,978
Now,

264
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,179
I'm your boyfriend.

265
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,539
I'll protect you

266
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:55,698
for as long as I can.

267
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,019
Fine. I'll do as you say.

268
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,858
Then, pack all these

269
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:03,938
thick and well-covered clothes.

270
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,938
Are you trying to suffocate me to death?

271
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,578
I think these are good.

272
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:14,419
Min Hui,
did you go on another blind date?

273
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,539
Yes.

274
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,419
Do you not like that man?

275
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:20,098
I don't.

276
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:21,978
Quanquan,

277
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,299
I know you don't want
to call another man daddy.

278
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:27,458
I promise you

279
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:28,899
that

280
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,499
even if I get together
with another man in the future,

281
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,938
I won't ask you to call him daddy.

282
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,779
You only have one father,

283
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,059
and it's Xin Qi.

284
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:40,539
But Xin Qi really loves you.

285
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,578
I don't think
anyone else loves you more.

286
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,659
Do you know what love is?

287
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,618
I do.

288
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,938
Love is

289
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:50,738
even though I love chocolate

290
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,338
and I only have one,

291
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,098
I'm willing to give it to you

292
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,419
because I love you.

293
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,698
Think about it.

294
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,499
Who else besides me and Xin Qi

295
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,618
would give that chocolate to you?

296
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:08,659
Someone as genuine as you are

297
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,659
deserves a genuine romance.

298
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,059
You shouldn't be talking about marriage

299
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,539
and feelings with men like that.

300
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:17,618
All right.

301
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,818
I promise

302
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,738
I won't go on those blind dates anymore.

303
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,818
But you have to promise me

304
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,059
you won't interfere with what's going on
between me and Xin Qi anymore.

305
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,818
I just want you

306
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,259
to be a carefree boy.

307
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,458
Okay, I promise.

308
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,059
Good boy.

309
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,660
(Jiaren Hospital)

310
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,299
Hello, Dr. Zhou.

311
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,578
(I'm on the night shift tonight.)

312
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,218
(I'll pick you up
for breakfast tomorrow).

313
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,450
(Hello, the subscriber
you have dialed is currently busy.)

314
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,120
(Please try again later.)

315
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,059
Dr. Zhou,

316
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,019
there's a patient downstairs
requesting you.

317
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:20,218
Okay.

318
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,059
Here. Have another bite.

319
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:31,698
Have another bite.

320
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,978
Last one.

321
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,139
All right.

322
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,698
Good dog.

323
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:45,098
Dear,

324
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,338
I passed by the pet shop today

325
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,338
and got Sensen a set of clothes.

326
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:50,098
No need.

327
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,738
If you've got something to say, say it.

328
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,938
No need to use Sensen to buy favors.

329
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,738
You and I are husband and wife.

330
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:58,738
That means we should support and care

331
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,299
for each other.

332
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,338
Are you full, Sensen?

333
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,098
Let's go out and play.

334
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,218
Come on, my baby.

335
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,698
Sensen is the best.

336
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:08,499
My baby.

337
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,580
(You have received a WeChat message.)

338
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:13,419
You smell great.

339
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,420
(Zheng Yiting)

340
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,299
Dear!

341
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,578
Dear,

342
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,259
I have nothing to do with this.

343
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,019
Believe me.

344
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,379
It's that woman!

345
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,139
She... She did this on purpose!

346
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:36,978
Cheng Qirang.

347
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,458
I really don't care what's going on

348
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,419
with you and that Lin Xiyue.

349
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:43,698
You called her here today

350
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:46,379
to put up a show with you,

351
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,818
to let my father know

352
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,259
how much this company needs you

353
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,858
to keep it in order.

354
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:51,659
That's not it, dear.

355
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,978
That's not true. That's not true at all.

356
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,578
You want me to put in
a good word for you

357
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:55,978
in front of my father,

358
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,738
so he makes you
the chairman of Guanchao.

359
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,659
Listen up.

360
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,938
I don't care
how many women you have out there.

361
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,379
But you need to make sure

362
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,259
no one gets a hold of anything on you.

363
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,779
I don't want to see that woman
at the office ever again.

364
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,139
Dear! Dear!

365
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,100
(Jiaren Hospital)

366
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,338
You're back.

367
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:40,578
My goodness.

368
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:42,659
Yao Zizhu is incredible.

369
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:44,738
My girlfriend has wanted to try
this internet-famous ice cream shop

370
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:45,899
since forever.

371
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,618
I queued several times
but could never manage to get one.

372
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:48,659
Look at her.

373
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,858
She got two at once.

374
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,578
You're in luck.

375
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,738
(Yao Zizhu)
She'll definitely bring you one.

376
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,659
You don't like ice cream anyway.

377
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,098
Why don't you give it to me?

378
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,338
What did you do to her

379
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,179
that she blocked you?

380
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,180
(Why won't you let me see your Moments?)

381
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,020
(The message is successfully sent
but rejected by the receiver.)

382
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,139
She blocked you!

383
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:12,818
This is serious.

384
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:16,818
Give me the address
of that ice cream place.

385
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,818
Good luck.

386
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:31,539
No.

387
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,419
Min Hui,

388
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:34,978
I'm bored.

389
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,179
Can you play with me?

390
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,899
Not yet, Quanquan.

391
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,019
I need to finish up my work.

392
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,139
Be good.

393
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,578
Adults.

394
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,299
You're busy all the time.

395
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,899
You're working overtime
at the office on weekends.

396
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:49,738
Daddy Zhou

397
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,938
is busy dating Zizhu.

398
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,259
My dad

399
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,458
was supposed to pick me up today,

400
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,899
but then he said
he had to go on a business trip.

401
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,179
You're complaining a lot

402
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:03,978
as a kid.

403
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,059
You'll turn into an old man.

404
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,779
If you're bored,

405
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,059
give him a call.

406
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:11,699
Okay.

407
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,979
Missing me, Quanquan?

408
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,739
Yes. Are you busy, Xin Qi?

409
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,858
How can I be busy when it comes to you?

410
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:23,979
I'll always have time for you.

411
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,259
When are you coming back?

412
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,739
In a few days.

413
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,459
(Where are you?)

414
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,459
(You're not home?)

415
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,418
Min Hui is working overtime
at the office.

416
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,459
I'm keeping her company.

417
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:38,259
Point the camera at your mom.

418
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,418
I want to see if she's actually working.

419
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,059
Why are you putting me on camera?

420
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:50,979
Xin Qi wants to know
if you're working hard.

421
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,699
What a capitalist.

422
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,858
I'm already working on weekends,

423
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,138
and he wants to know
if I'm working hard?

424
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:58,858
Oh, right. Give me the phone.

425
00:17:58,858 --> 00:17:59,898
I have to talk to him about something.

426
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,779
Xin Qi.

427
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,618
Perfect timing.
I want to confirm the choices

428
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,299
for the AI heart
modeling clinical hospital.

429
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,259
What are your thoughts on that?

430
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:09,219
Let's talk about that next time
when I'm not busy.

431
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,779
Didn't you say you're free?

432
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,499
Where are you?

433
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:16,219
Shanghai?

434
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:17,739
That background

435
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,939
looks

436
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,219
weird.

437
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:22,138
Um, I have to get back to work.

438
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:23,818
Ha... Hardy is calling me.

439
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:27,739
He hung up.

440
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,019
Quanquan, do you think

441
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,578
something's off about him?

442
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:36,818
Come here.

443
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,259
I told you to get me a hotel backdrop.

444
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,219
What's this?

445
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:43,818
Why did you get me
a picture of Shanghai?

446
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,699
(Aurora Plaza)
These two words don't move at all!

447
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,178
It's clearly fake!

448
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:47,658
Calm down.

449
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:48,818
She'll definitely find out!

450
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:49,739
Calm down.

451
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:50,739
Mind your health.

452
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:53,858
I wanted to make it look more realistic.

453
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:55,699
This is Lujiazui.

454
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,459
An iconic landmark in Shanghai.

455
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,019
As if I need you to tell me that!

456
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:00,418
Listen up.

457
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:00,939
If she finds out I'm lying,

458
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,299
you can forget
about your bonus for this month.

459
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:03,898
No, don't!

460
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,699
No.

461
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,739
Shouldn't you tell her
that you're unwell and at the hospital?

462
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,939
That will get her
to worry and fret about you.

463
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:11,979
I don't get it.

464
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:13,138
Why hide this from her?

465
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,219
Mr. Xin, it's time for your checkup.

466
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,418
Ms. Min Hui is calling.

467
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:29,979
Hang up!

468
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,259
Idiot.

469
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:43,779
She has noticed

470
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,299
something's wrong.

471
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,378
What if she keeps calling?

472
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,178
Keep it from her for as long as you can.

473
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,739
(I'm going back after this checkup.)

474
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:54,059
(That won't do.)

475
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,539
(The doctor said)

476
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,019
(your heart rate hasn't been normal.)

477
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,739
(Then you need to be hospitalized
for a proper checkup)

478
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,818
(and rest.)

479
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,699
I know my own body.

480
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,858
If they want to do tests,
have them hurry up.

481
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:06,378
I can't stay here for long.

482
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,818
I'll be busted if I do.

483
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,259
Going against
a doctor's orders at a hospital?

484
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,299
(Do you want Min Quanquan
to lose his father at such a young age?)

485
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,019
Ms. Min Hui.

486
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:28,059
(Where are you guys?)

487
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,338
We...

488
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,858
Ward 863 at Jiaren Hospital.

489
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:38,939
She hung up for real this time.

490
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:42,739
Get out.

491
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:44,699
Get out!

492
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:46,858
Calm down.

493
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:47,699
Mind your heart.

494
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,299
I finally found you.

495
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:24,939
How did you know I am here?

496
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,779
Why did you block me?

497
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,338
Did you just realize?

498
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,618
I've been swamped
at the hospital lately.

499
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:34,979
I have several surgeries back-to-back,

500
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,459
rounds to make, reports to write...

501
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,259
Dr. Zhou,

502
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,219
if you like someone

503
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,378
and that person has clearly
stated their lack of interest in you,

504
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:43,779
then you should exit that person's life

505
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,338
once and for all.

506
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,618
That's the basic etiquette
in modern-day dating.

507
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,459
That's not what you said before.

508
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:50,898
A girl has the right to change her mind

509
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,898
at any time.

510
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:55,418
These are my three rules
when it comes to dating.

511
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:57,059
Rule number one, never be a home wrecker.

512
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,098
Rule number two, never be a simp.

513
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,578
Rule number three, never be a backup.

514
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,658
Don't look for me again.

515
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,459
Yao Zizhu, that's not what I meant.

516
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:09,539
What's wrong?

517
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:11,259
(Come to Jiaren Hospital at once.)

518
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,059
(Hurry.)

519
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,418
No... Right now?

520
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:35,939
I knew you weren't serious.

521
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,380
(Jiaren Hospital)

522
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,418
Are you all right, Xin Qi?

523
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,739
Xin Qi, wake up.

524
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:55,979
How is he?

525
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:57,578
Is it that bad?

526
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,539
It's not as bad as it looks,

527
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,658
but it's not something
to brush off, either.

528
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:02,908
His heart problems acted up yesterday
and he was hospitalized.

529
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,178
Preliminary examination showed

530
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,939
a slight problem
with his heart rate and blood pressure.

531
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:06,939
But we can only know the exact details

532
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,059
after all the tests are completed

533
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,818
and when the results are out.

534
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,098
My recommendation is
to stay in the hospital for observation.

535
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,378
Weren't you supposed to help me?

536
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,378
Help you with what?

537
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,578
If you don't want Min Hui to worry,

538
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:25,979
you should tell her the truth.

539
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,898
She isn't as fragile as you think.

540
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,299
Don't worry too much.

541
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,818
It might just be stress from work.

542
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:33,979
Maybe it'll turn out to be nothing

543
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,979
after we get the results.

544
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:36,618
Rest up.

545
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:37,699
Call me if anything comes up.

546
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,979
Quanquan,

547
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,618
I'll take you to play.

548
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:50,338
Okay.

549
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:50,779
Come on.

550
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:59,178
I have been a little unwell,

551
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,138
but it's really not that serious.

552
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:02,378
If you don't believe me,

553
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,378
have Hardy show you the reports.

554
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,418
Even so,

555
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,539
you should listen to the doctor

556
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,779
and get treated properly.
Why try to play the hero?

557
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,858
I don't get you.

558
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:15,499
You pretended to be sick
when you weren't.

559
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,059
Now you're sick,
you pretend you're not.

560
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,459
I pretended to be sick
because I wanted you to worry about me

561
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,418
and care about me.

562
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:26,178
Now, I'm pretending not to be sick
because I don't want to make you worry.

563
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:29,858
I've had this problem for so long.

564
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:32,378
I know my body.

565
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,979
It really isn't a big deal.

566
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,299
I've been fine on my own all this while.

567
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:41,858
Well, you don't have
to do it on your own anymore.

568
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,459
What do you mean?

569
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,098
I meant what I said.

570
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:54,979
Get some rest.

(Residence G)

572
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:07,459
Take a look.

573
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,739
I've had my eye on this for a long time.

574
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:19,219
This is expensive.

575
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:20,059
What's the occasion?

576
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,138
Why give me such an expensive gift
all of a sudden?

577
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,059
Because you like it.

578
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,219
Now, take a look at this.

(Guanchao, Resignation Letter)

580
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:36,979
What is the meaning of this?

(Resignation Letter)

582
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:49,898
You're firing me?

583
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,378
No.

584
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,578
You

585
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:58,219
are resigning.

586
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:00,658
Zheng Yiting

587
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,299
knows about us.

588
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:04,618
I'll need you to endure this

589
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:06,138
so that I can get my hands
on Guanchao sooner.

590
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:08,658
So just because she found out about us,

591
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,739
you're kicking me to the curb?

592
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:14,459
You're so quick to sacrifice me?

593
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,539
I put my heart and soul
into Guanchao too.

594
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:20,059
I know

595
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,019
this is unfair to you.

596
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:25,499
But this is for us. It's for our future.

597
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,499
Do you want to be my mistress

598
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,178
and live in the shadows

599
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,338
forever?

600
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,699
Even if you do,

601
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,019
I don't.

602
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,138
I can't bear to see you go on like this.

603
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,259
You're the only one

604
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,858
in my heart

605
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,138
worthy of the title "Mrs. Cheng".

606
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,499
You mean...

607
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:52,618
You would marry me?

608
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:53,338
Of course.

609
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,499
Xiyue,

610
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,618
give me a little more time.

611
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:02,178
Trust me.

612
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,979
All your sacrifices will pay off.

613
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:09,499
Our separation

614
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:11,779
is temporary.

615
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:33,578
You're awake.

616
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:36,739
You guys stayed.

617
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,019
I told you, didn't I?

618
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:40,699
You're not alone anymore.

619
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:45,779
Daddy, look.

620
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,658
I drew you a heart.

621
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:49,939
Now, you have two hearts.

622
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,459
If one doesn't work,

623
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,739
you have the other.

624
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,098
Thank you, Quanquan.

625
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,459
I'm not done yet.

626
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:58,378
Let me continue.

627
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,618
Thanks, Quanquan's mom.

628
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,338
Want some fruit?

629
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:07,898
It's time for his medicine.

630
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:09,939
Xin Qi's family?

631
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:10,979
Yes, that's me.

632
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,138
This is tonight's medicine.

633
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:14,979
He can have the white one now.

634
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:16,299
He has to take the yellow one an hour

635
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,818
after he takes the white one.

636
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:18,499
Got that?

637
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,059
Yes. Thank you.

638
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:20,739
You're welcome.

639
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,098
Thank you.

640
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:25,818
Take your medicine.

641
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,779
If only this illness
will keep me here longer.

642
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:34,858
How wonderful it is to have a family.

643
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,699
If you don't get better in a week,

644
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:39,138
we're not staying here.

645
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,418
Jason! Jason!

646
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:48,059
Jason!

647
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:50,418
Poor Jason, are you all right?

648
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:53,059
Why are you here?

649
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:54,418
To see you.

650
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:57,658
Mommy,

651
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,939
didn't you say we were going
to stay at the hospital

652
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,539
with Xin Qi?

653
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,578
I know you're worried about him.

654
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:07,818
But there are doctors at the hospital,

655
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,138
and your aunt is there too.

656
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,378
So no need to worry about him.

657
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,618
Everything is in order.

658
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,779
Quanquan is the best.

659
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,098
How about this?

660
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,338
You go to bed early tonight,

661
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,299
and I'll take you
to see him tomorrow morning.

662
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,459
Can you help me

663
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,019
make heart sandwiches for him, then?

664
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:24,098
Why?

665
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,418
He gave me an energy heart

666
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:29,338
when I was sick.

667
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:31,418
Now, he's sick.

668
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:34,418
I want to give him heart sandwiches.

669
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,499
I see.

670
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,098
You should make it yourself, then.

671
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,299
But I'm a kid.

672
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,059
It's dangerous for me.

673
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:43,979
Got it.

674
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,499
I'll help you make it, then.

675
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,378
Remember to make them into hearts.

676
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,178
They're not heart sandwiches, otherwise.

677
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,219
Understood.

678
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,658
Go to bed now.

679
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:53,818
Off you go.

680
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,340
(Jiaren Hospital)

681
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,138
Why are you here?

682
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,418
See? The minute Min Hui knew you were here,

683
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,219
she left

684
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,338
with my son.

685
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:13,219
You're heartless.

686
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,459
I flew back

687
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,898
the second Hardy
told me what had happened.

688
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,378
Not only did you not appreciate me,

689
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:19,499
but you're even saying that to me.

690
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,858
You're ungrateful.

691
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,739
You used both idioms correctly.

692
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,658
You've improved.

693
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,818
Of course.

694
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,138
I've been studying.

695
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:30,499
I don't want

696
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,539
to be made fun of by Quanquan again.

697
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:35,178
Don't change the subject.

698
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:36,499
I heard from Hardy

699
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:37,979
that you tried to leave the hospital

700
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,059
without even waiting for your results.

701
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:43,019
You blabbermouth.

702
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:45,739
Don't blame him.

703
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:48,219
You're not the only reason I'm back.

704
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:49,779
I have a business to negotiate.

705
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:51,019
Tell me about it.

706
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:54,178
You know? I got an intel

707
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,739
that Be Agile's biggest shareholder,
Yuanlai Group,

708
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,578
is going to sell Be Agile.

709
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:01,779
Is that true?

710
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:03,259
Of course.

711
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,380
(Jiaren Hospital)

712
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,019
All right. Got it. Thanks.

713
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:17,939
They're selling Be Agile.

714
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:19,178
See?

715
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,219
I told you.

716
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:21,459
Get a move on.

717
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,779
Have the team calculate
Be Agile's market value.

718
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:24,979
All right. Right away.

719
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:29,858
You want to purchase Be Agile?

720
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:33,299
It hasn't been a year
since you got back.

721
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,939
You're not familiar
with the domestic market yet.

722
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,138
And you've spent most of your funds

723
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:38,259
on

724
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,979
the AI heart modeling technology.

725
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,178
It's too risky for you

726
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:41,979
to buy up Be Agile now.

727
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,338
I have to try, even if that's the case.

728
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,818
If some other company buys up Be Agile,

729
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,858
Min Hui's AI modeling project

730
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:50,219
will be affected.

731
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:51,658
Besides,

732
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:55,418
this technology
has been a dream of mine too.

733
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,658
I won't allow
anything to go wrong with it.

734
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,499
Cindy,

735
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:04,739
help me get out of the hospital.

736
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,539
Your condition...

737
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,259
My condition is perfect.

738
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:10,779
You can feel

739
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,539
how well my mental state is, can't you?

740
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,259
Please.

741
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:16,019
Please.

742
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:19,658
Okay. I got it.

743
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,459
Got it.

744
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,539
Have a mandarin orange.

745
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:26,898
Another?

746
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:28,418
Okay. Eat it yourself.

747
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:34,019
Seriously, Mr. Xin.

748
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,939
The doctor told you to stay
in the hospital for a few more days.

749
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,939
But you just had to leave.

750
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:38,699
At least

751
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,338
there are professional
nurses and caregivers

752
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,378
who can take care of you
at all times.

753
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,578
That's enough.

754
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,858
There's no place like home.

755
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:46,699
He'll get better

756
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,499
once he feels better. Isn't that right?

757
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,098
That's true.

758
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:51,699
Don't worry, Mr. Xin.

759
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,219
I'll take good care of you.

760
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,539
Better than I take care of my mother.

761
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,739
Would you like some water?

762
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:59,178
I have things to do in Bincheng.

763
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:00,658
I'm taking him with me.

764
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:02,658
I need him more than you do.

765
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,378
Thank you, Chairwoman.

766
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,739
Min Hui,
I have important matters to attend to.

767
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,019
But Xin Qi

768
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,138
doesn't have friends around here.

769
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:12,219
The doctor said

770
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:13,979
someone has to be with him at all times,

771
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:15,499
or something might go wrong.

772
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:16,779
Please

773
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,939
take good care of him for me.

774
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:21,019
No problem, Aunt Cindy.

775
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,898
Mommy and I will take good care of Daddy

776
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,779
because we're a family.

777
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,299
That's right.

778
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:28,739
Cindy,

779
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,578
I have a lot of work to do.

780
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:32,098
I don't think I have time to do this.

781
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,299
Please.

782
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,338
You're the only one I can count on.

783
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:37,818
Please.

784
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:40,658
Mommy, Daddy is so pitiful.

785
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:42,459
He's so sick,

786
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,098
and he has no one to take care of him.

787
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,019
It's okay, Min Hui.

788
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:49,779
I know you're busy with work.

789
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,898
You can focus on your job.

790
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:52,578
I'll be fine on my own.

791
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:55,499
At worst, I'll have to order delivery

792
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:57,898
and maybe not have anyone get me water.

793
00:33:58,378 --> 00:33:59,618
I'll be fine. I mean it.

794
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:02,219
I've managed to survive
all these years on my own.

795
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,818
That won't do.

796
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,138
Don't worry, Mr. Xin. I...

797
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:06,178
Jason!

798
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:09,218
You poor thing.

799
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:13,298
Poor Jason.

800
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:15,098
All right.

801
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,298
I'll take care of him.

802
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,499
Quanquan and I will stay here

803
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:21,698
and look after him

804
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:22,459
until

805
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:23,899
the doctor says he is fine.

806
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,419
That's great!

807
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:27,979
Hardy, back to the company.

808
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:28,778
Yes.

809
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,298
I'll leave him to you, Min Hui.

810
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:32,339
Don't worry.

811
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:37,738
Sleep with me tonight.

812
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,379
No.

813
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,459
Chairwoman,

814
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:49,459
I can't let Min Hui

815
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:50,899
take care of Mr. Xin alone.

816
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:51,859
I have to go back.

817
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:52,939
Get back here!

818
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:54,539
Hardy.

819
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:55,979
Tell me.

820
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,298
What qualities must

821
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:58,738
an excellent assistant possess?

822
00:34:59,218 --> 00:35:01,258
Think what the boss wants,
and do what the boss wants.

823
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,258
Always try to figure out
the boss's true intentions and desires.

824
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,939
Put the boss's wishes first.

825
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:05,859
Clear all the obstacles

826
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,738
(All the obstacles)
in the way of the boss's goals.

827
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:08,419
Very good.

828
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:09,539
Now, tell me

829
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,899
what Xin Qi's greatest desire is
at the moment.

830
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:18,578
I understand.

831
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:21,379
Now, can you leave with me?

832
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:21,899
Yes.

833
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:24,859
From this moment on, I'm your boss.

834
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:25,698
You can start thinking

835
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:28,218
about what I want
and solving my problems.

836
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:30,819
Chairwoman,

837
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:33,539
I've been waiting to hear that.

838
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:35,499
Ever since you assigned me to Mr. Xin,

839
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:37,059
there's not a moment
I haven't wanted to return to you.

840
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:40,819
Do you know
why I assigned you to Xin Qi?

841
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:43,899
Because you talk too much.

842
00:35:45,098 --> 00:35:45,819
Let's go.

843
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:52,859
I might be here to take care of you,

844
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,019
but I can't ignore

845
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,218
my work.

846
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,459
So besides making sure you have
water, food, and medicine,

847
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,098
do not call me

848
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,138
for anything else.

849
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,298
What about
when I need to use the toilet or shower?

850
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:05,258
Of course not!

851
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,618
Poor Jason.

852
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:12,258
Honestly, I'm just happy

853
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:13,778
you're here.

854
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,379
Min Hui.

855
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:18,019
This too.

856
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:20,059
Right. This.

857
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:21,899
For you.

858
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:26,379
You made these?

859
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:27,859
For me?

860
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,138
Yes,

861
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:31,539
but your son requested them.

862
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,298
I just made them for him.

863
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,499
That's my son.

864
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,379
Oh, they're hearts!

865
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:47,738
What's the matter?

866
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:49,499
Did I oversalt them again?

867
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:52,859
No.

868
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:53,899
It's a little sweet.

869
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:55,419
You...

870
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:57,379
Don't look.

871
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,218
