=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,970
=Episode 23=

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,660
(Jiaren Hospital)

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,279
How is he?

27
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,559
He has woken up.

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
But he didn't dare
to contact his family.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,399
I've been standing guard by the door.

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,199
What about his injuries?

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
Nothing serious.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,040
Just a dislocated arm.

33
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,399
Nothing fatal.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,399
Ms. Min Hui didn't hurt him too badly.

35
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,999
I already said that there's
no need to inform my family.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,839
Looks like you also know

37
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,279
that you can't let Zheng Yiting
find out about this.

38
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,759
One of your people sent me here.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,679
I'm sure I don't need

40
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,959
to explain to you why I am here.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,479
Not only do I know the reason,

42
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,479
I also regret not being able to land
a few punches on you.

43
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm going to sue Min Hui
for intentional injury.

44
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,280
How long do you think
she'll be sentenced

45
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,120
for putting me into this condition?

46
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,639
Are you interested in being my witness?

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,239
You must be joking, Mr. Cheng.

48
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,160
Min Hui

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,880
was just defending herself.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
We don't even know

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,359
who the police will arrest.

52
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,359
Everything has changed
now that she has a backer.

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,000
Xin Qi, I've been wanting
to ask you this.

54
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,759
How did you make Min Hui yours?

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
With money

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,479
or with projects?

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,479
I have a question.

58
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,280
How long will it usually take

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,639
to recover from a dislocated arm?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
It'll take around a month.

61
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,799
Please excuse me.
I have to take this call.

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,440
Ms. Min Hui.

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,840
Aunt.

65
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,040
Is something weighing down
on my mom lately?

66
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,479
Why did you ask that?

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,840
She has been frowning a lot lately.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
She doesn't even smile when I try
to make her feel better.

69
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,840
Another thing.

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,199
Daddy insists on
letting me stay with you today.

71
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,239
I'm sure there's something going on

72
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,720
that they don't want me to know.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,199
Such a smart child.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Quanquan. Adults have their own worries.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,320
You don't have to worry about them.

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,679
Moreover,

77
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,519
you need to believe in Min Hui.

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,959
You always say

79
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,519
that your mother is a superwoman, right?

80
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,840
But I still want to cheer her up.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,079
How are you going to do that?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,320
I think that's a great idea.

83
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,639
But I don't have money.

84
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,199
I do.

85
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,400
But I don't want to use the money
from another person.

86
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,479
You are so cute.

87
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,559
You are exactly like Xin Qi
when he was young.

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,400
How about this?

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,720
Do you want to know how to earn money?

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,919
You know how to earn money?

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,439
Of course.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,280
When it comes to earning money,

93
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
I'm way better at it than your dad.

94
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,799
Really?

95
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,040
How about this?

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Kiss me and I'll teach you.

97
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,679
Finish your food

98
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,479
and I'll teach you how
to become a millionaire.

99
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,100
(Inpatient Department)

100
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,720
Hardy.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,559
Ms. Min Hui.

102
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,160
Ms. Xin is already inside.

103
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:52,919
Okay.

104
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,840
But I want

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,679
to resolve this issue myself.

106
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay.

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,319
I don't care how Min Hui
managed to seduce you.

108
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,200
I just want to ask you this.

109
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,400
Have you never suspected her

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
of approaching you for your money?

111
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:10,799
I had.

112
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,160
I even hurt her because of that.

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,640
And it was the most regretful thing
that I had ever done.

114
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,479
Cheng Qirang.

115
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,080
You say that you like her.

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
But your feelings for her are not love.

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,879
You just want to own her.

118
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
Same with me.

119
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,520
I say that I love her.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,200
But I'm the one who hurt her the most.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,919
We've loved and hated each other deeply

122
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,640
in the past.

123
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,799
So, in the future,

124
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,879
as long as I still live,

125
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,439
I won't allow anyone to hurt her,

126
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,319
including me.

127
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,080
So, don't challenge me.

128
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm willing

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,679
to do anything for her at this moment.

130
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,640
Since you are here to beg me today,

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,040
shouldn't you

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,960
show how sincere you are?

133
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,720
Who says I'm here to beg you?

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,280
You want to file a police report?

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,359
Go ahead.

136
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,080
I'll hire the best lawyer
in Bincheng for her.

137
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,439
We can also reinvestigate
your sexual harassment case

138
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,960
from five years ago.

139
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,840
As soon as I have the evidence,

140
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,280
I'll sue you at once.

141
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,160
It doesn't matter even if
I can't find the evidence.

142
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,600
I can just put this on the internet

143
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,479
and let the netizen be the judge of it.

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
By the way,

145
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,840
Zheng Bangguo has the intention
of making you his successor, right?

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Do you think he'll change his mind

147
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,640
when he hears about
this kind of scandal?

148
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,720
Are you threatening me?

149
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,799
No.

150
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,359
Why would I threaten you?

151
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
What you are going through now

152
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,840
is nothing compared to how Min Hui

153
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,160
had suffered five years ago.

154
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,119
I'll get going now.

155
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,960
Have a safe journey.

156
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,640
Mr. Xin, you've finally succeeded.

157
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,520
It's late now.

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,999
You should get some rest.

159
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,879
My first job is with Be Agile

160
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,239
right after I graduated.

161
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,160
I never thought that I would continue
to work there until now.

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,160
I've given my youth
and everything to Be Agile.

163
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,799
I've spent half of my life

164
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,600
at Be Agile.

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
Everything that I have now

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,559
is because of Be Agile.

167
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,280
You are wrong.

168
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
You didn't become great
because of Be Agile.

169
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Instead, Be Agile
has become great because of you.

170
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,119
Even if Be Agile is acquired
by another company,

171
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,439
it doesn't mean that you have to leave.

172
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,239
Even if it happens

173
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,840
and you lose your job...

174
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,580
Hey!

175
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,280
I'll take care of you.

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,799
What are you doing?
Are you imitating Zhou Xingchi?

177
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,880
You should take care of yourself first.

178
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm not joking with you.

179
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll take care of you.

180
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,480
Although I don't earn
as much as you do right now,

181
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll continue to work hard.

182
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,919
It's okay. I know.

183
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,079
You are not my husband.

184
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,480
I know you just want to help.

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,839
I'll come up with a solution.

186
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,360
That's right.

187
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,919
Why should I wait for another company

188
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,760
to acquire Be Agile?

189
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,719
Husband?

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,839
Was she

191
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,880
hinting at me?

192
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,839
Why are you still awake?

193
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,439
I can't sleep.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
Where were you just now?

195
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,079
I...

196
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,599
You looked cool when you acted like

197
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,040
the domineering CEO.

198
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,520
You were at the hospital?

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,520
I heard what you said.

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Thank you.

201
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,839
Do you trust me now?

202
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,079
I'll keep my promise

203
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,319
to you.

204
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,559
Do you know?

205
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
Lately,

206
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,959
I've been thinking about the first time

207
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,079
we met five years ago.

208
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,120
I wonder when this tree

209
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
can grow up to that size.

210
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
Actually, if we think about it carefully,

211
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,280
I was the one who mistook you
for Su Tian.

212
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,120
But I blamed you

213
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
for everything.

214
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,799
Min Hui.

215
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,799
I owe you an apology.

216
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,880
I remember someone once told me

217
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,799
that with enough time,

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,240
everything will become

219
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,839
good memories in the end.

220
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,319
Looks like it's true.

221
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,199
Maybe it has nothing

222
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,280
to do with time.

223
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,919
Good or bad,

224
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,679
it depends on the state of our mind.

225
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,480
Min Hui,

226
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,400
compared to what happened
five years ago,

227
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
I would rather focus on our future.

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,919
I won't let myself live in the past.

229
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,360
You shouldn't do that too.

230
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,839
You are right.

231
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,839
We shouldn't live in our memories.

232
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Just like what happened
with Cheng Qirang.

233
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,319
It's in the past now.

234
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,880
That day,

235
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,199
I found this on your bed

236
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,480
when I cleaned your room.

237
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,280
Xin Qi.

238
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,679
Are you willing to put it on me again?

251
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Time to wake up.

252
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,959
Just a little while longer.

253
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,280
No. We have to get up.

254
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,240
Let's sleep a little bit longer.

255
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,480
Let me hug you for a while longer.

256
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,439
Xin Qi.

257
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,120
Xin Qi, you really need to get up.

258
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,760
Get up. You have to get up.

259
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,799
Hurry up.

260
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,240
What is it?

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
How could you?

262
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,959
Quanquan, let us explain.

263
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:45,919
Explain it to him.

264
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,640
Quanquan.

265
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,719
About this,

266
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,839
you have to let me...

267
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,120
Why didn't you sleep together with me?

268
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,520
You even sent me to Aunt Cindy.

269
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,760
Let's sleep together
for a while longer then.

270
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,120
Okay.

271
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,910
- Come.
- No.

272
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Min Quanquan,
you are going to be late for school.

273
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,000
It's okay. I'll send you there
in my car later.

274
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
You won't be late.

275
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,599
You can't spoil your son like this.

276
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,439
Why can't I?

277
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,799
You want to spoil him?

278
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,079
I won't let any of you sleep.

279
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,439
Wake up now.

280
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,319
No.

281
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,160
We need to go to work and
you need to go to school.

282
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,590
- Quanquan.
- Quanquan.

283
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,719
Daddy!

284
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,760
Quanquan.

285
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,839
Time to go to school.

286
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,199
Daddy.

287
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,719
I'll sleep for a while longer.

288
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,160
Naughty boy. Let's go.

289
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,160
Wear your shoes.

290
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,839
It smells so nice.

291
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,880
Hurry up and eat your breakfast.
Otherwise, Quanquan will be late.

292
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,880
What are you wearing?

293
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,599
Quanquan chose this.

294
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
It's indeed different when someone
is nourished with love.

295
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,839
You are glowing.

296
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,760
Thank you then.

297
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,679
Here. Take a seat.

298
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,919
I want to discuss
something important with you.

299
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,640
What is it?

300
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,760
Let me go back with you today
to pack your things.

301
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,240
Why should I pack my things?

302
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,199
We should pack up
your and Quanquan's things.

303
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Don't tell me that you want
to live separately from me.

304
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,719
I think

305
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,760
that even if we are a couple now,

306
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,000
we need to have our personal space.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,880
I don't plan to move in with you.

308
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
Are you being serious?

309
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,760
Yes.

310
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,319
Besides, you are quite healthy, right?

311
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:37,679
It doesn't look like
there's any problem with you.

312
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
Actually, my heart
hasn't been feeling well

313
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,760
for the past two days.

314
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
I don't know what's wrong with it.

315
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:46,959
Really?

316
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,959
Xin Qi, drop your act.

317
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,880
Hurry up and feed me.

318
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,160
I have to go to the kindergarten.

319
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,280
- He has to go to the kindergarten.
- Son, eat over there.

320
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
I'm talking about something serious
with your mom.

321
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
Go now.

322
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,400
No.

323
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,079
Go now.

324
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,679
No.

325
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,079
Please?

326
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
Quanquan, who do you want to feed you?

327
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,199
Daddy.

328
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,839
Feed him, daddy.

329
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,719
Not that one.

330
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,439
Well.

331
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,480
Move in.

332
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,959
Come on. Eat it yourself.

333
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,919
Okay?

334
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,799
No.

335
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,480
Please.

336
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,760
Please.

337
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,520
No.

338
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,520
Hurry up.

339
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
We are going to be late.

340
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,320
(Be Agile Medical Technology)

341
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,120
Good morning, Ms. Cao.

342
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,559
Good morning.

343
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,640
Good morning, Ms. Cao.

344
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,460
- Ms. Cao.
- Good morning.

345
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,360
- Good morning, Ms. Cao.
- Good morning, Ms. Cao.

346
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,040
Good morning.

347
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,280
Good morning, Ms. Cao.

348
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,719
Ms. Cao, you look beautiful today.

349
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,599
Good morning.

350
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,079
(You didn't become great
because of Be Agile.)

351
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,159
(Instead, Be Agile
has become great because of you.)

352
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,820
(Come to me when you are at the company.
I have something important to discuss.)

353
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,319
Ms. Cao.

354
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,520
What is it that is so important?

355
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Do we have to wait for Min Hui?

356
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,480
I have two meetings later.

357
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,879
Please wait for a while longer, Mr. He.

358
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,839
I promise you

359
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,359
that what I'm about to say

360
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,480
will be more important
than your meetings.

361
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,480
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:40,440
Please have a seat.

363
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,280
I only saw your message
when I was on my way here.

364
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
What is it?

365
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,119
Okay. Everyone is here now.

366
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,839
What I'm about to say next

367
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,599
is confidential.

368
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:50,799
So, I hope

369
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,760
that I won't hear anything about it
outside of this office.

370
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,079
Are you here to talk about
the acquisition issue?

371
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,520
Guanchao is behind it.

372
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,480
Guanchao has entered
the acquisition war too?

373
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,399
It's okay.

374
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,119
He can acquire his company
while we acquire ours.

375
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,960
We?

376
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,879
Yes.

377
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,720
No matter who owns Be Agile in the end,

378
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,440
it won't be better
than how it is right now.

379
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,839
Rather than letting others acquire
our company, we can be our own master.

380
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,399
MBO?

381
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,159
Yes. That's the one.

382
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,599
Management buyout.

383
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,879
If all the executives of Be Agile
pool our money together to bid

384
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:24,960
for the acquisition in the name
of the management team,

385
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,799
with the help of some venture
capitalists and private equity firms,

386
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,920
we might win the bid.

387
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
Are you being serious?

388
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,159
Of course.

389
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,480
If it's a success,

390
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,680
we'll have more freedom
in managing our company

391
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,799
and we can better

392
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,040
protect our teams,

393
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,040
our projects

394
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,359
and our research data.

395
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,000
I've thought about it too.

396
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,159
But where can we get the money?

397
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,799
Even if we reach out to
venture capitalists,

398
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,000
each of us will have to put
at least a few million into it.

399
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,760
You have overestimated me.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,359
You are our core researcher.

401
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,480
You can offer us your skills

402
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
and some funds.

403
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,839
Yuanlai doesn't want us anymore.

404
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,240
Why don't we fight back
and save ourselves?

405
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,639
Are you in

406
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,760
or are you out?

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,520
Blue Jay has only 300 million funds
at its disposal.

408
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,000
It won't be enough to acquire Be Agile.

409
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,680
I've asked Hardy to contact the bank

410
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,879
to apply for a loan.

411
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,359
President.

412
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,399
Mr. Xin.

413
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,599
I've received a reply from the bank.

414
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
They can only loan us
200 million at most.

415
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,920
But

416
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,200
we need to use Blue Jay's
shares as collateral.

417
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,720
No way.

418
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,159
The board won't agree to it.

419
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,040
What if I say

420
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,520
that I'll bear the consequences

421
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,319
of acquiring Be Agile by myself?

422
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,480
Jason.

423
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,200
Cindy.

424
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,119
I'm not being reckless.

425
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,000
Helping Min Hui
is just one of the reasons.

426
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
I can really see the potential
of Be Agile.

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,920
It's like a bamboo shoot in spring.

428
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,520
Only the top can be seen right now.

429
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,119
But when the spring rain comes,

430
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,879
it'll shoot up into the sky

431
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,720
and show everyone its worth.

432
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,680
I want to be that spring rain.

433
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,079
Isn't that our purpose

434
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,440
of being a venture capitalist?

435
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
Hardy.

436
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,760
Book a morning flight for me tomorrow.

437
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:29,879
Put together all the information

438
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,119
in the form of a PPT for me

439
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,399
before I board the plane.

440
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,599
I'll get it done.

441
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,920
Count me in.

442
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Let me ask you this.

443
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,960
Why are you asking me to join you?

444
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,799
I don't think we are close enough

445
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,319
to cooperate on something of this scale.

446
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,000
You are the general manager of Be Agile.

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,639
If we are to proceed with the MBO,

448
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,920
we'll have to go through you.

449
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,079
So,

450
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,280
it's better to have an extra comrade
instead of an extra enemy.

451
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,879
What about the money?

452
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,319
Whether it's the private equity firms
or venture capitalists,

453
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,240
you can't get

454
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
that much money so easily.

455
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,440
I know some investment company owners.

456
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,680
I can also

457
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,040
contact the bank to get more money.

458
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,280
Actually, I've already contacted
some venture capitalists.

459
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,319
At least three of them

460
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,960
are very interested in our proposal.

461
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,159
How about this?

462
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,920
If you can find any willing investors

463
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
within two weeks,

464
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,079
I'll join you.

465
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,359
No problem.

466
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,159
13,549.

467
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,599
7,586.

468
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,399
8,000.

469
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:01,720
Wait.

470
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,240
Wait. I'm in the middle
of a calculation.

471
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,119
What are you calculating?

472
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,359
My balance.

473
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
Are you out of money?

474
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,920
What happened?

475
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,960
Cao Mu plans

476
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,399
to push for the MBO

477
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,599
with the executives of our company.

478
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,720
MBO?

479
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,879
That's daring of you.

480
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
Cao Mu has done the calculation.

481
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,079
Be Agile's current market valuation

482
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,040
is around 1 to 1.3 billion.

483
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,520
If we want to push for the MBO,

484
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,720
the executives

485
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,760
need to pay at least 3.5% of the total.

486
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:40,079
It means that you just need
to collect 1 billion.

487
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
If you can raise your funds
to 1.3 billion,

488
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,240
you'll have a high chance
of winning the bid.

489
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,119
That's right.

490
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,920
It's about the same as my evaluation.

491
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,240
Cao Mu has done her research.

492
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,200
Yes.

493
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
She has been staying up late
for the past few days

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,879
to work on the MBO.

495
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,480
I really want to help her.

496
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,839
But I haven't even settled
my own issue yet.

497
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,760
I can't help her even if I want to.

498
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,839
That's not true.

499
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,879
How could I forget

500
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,440
that I have the God of Fortune
by my side?

501
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,599
God of Fortune.

502
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,960
Are you interested in joining us?

503
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,760
Well.

504
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,520
It depends on how well
you can convince me.

505
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,399
Let me show you what I can do then.

506
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,159
Is this enough?

507
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:29,839
No.

508
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,799
No?

509
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,680
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

510
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,620
(Spectrum Theatre)

511
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,599
Excuse me.

512
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,599
Is this where the ballet dancers
come out?

513
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,480
Yes. This is the place.

514
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,119
Thank you.

515
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,639
Zizhu.

516
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,680
Zizhu, this is for you.

517
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,040
Do I have to accept it?

518
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,280
Besides, who says that I like roses?

519
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,000
I hate roses the most.

520
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,639
Zizhu.

521
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,960
With Blue Jay's current situation,

522
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,639
we don't have a lot of available funds.

523
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,839
But

524
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,480
I can get 500 million for you.

525
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,799
Then...

526
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,200
No. That's too much.

527
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't feel pressured about it.

528
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,639
I'm not just doing it

529
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,319
for you.

530
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,280
I'm doing it for Be Agile
and Blue Jay too.

531
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,920
Ask Cao Mu to come
to my company tomorrow.

532
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,399
I'll talk about the details with her.

533
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,639
For the MBO, how much funds do you need?

534
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,399
Cao Mu, He Haixiang and the others

535
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,839
will take out 6 million each.

536
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,760
I'll be offering my skills too.

537
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,159
So, I just need to take out 3 million.

538
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,159
That's quite reasonable.

539
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,839
Tomorrow afternoon, I'll...

540
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,879
I want to settle this myself.

541
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,159
If I can't do it,

542
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,040
it means that I'm not capable enough.

543
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,520
If that's the case,
I'll withdraw from the MBO.

544
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,399
Do you have to draw
such a clear line between us?

545
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,839
There are things that I want
to take care of myself.

546
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,879
Have faith in me.

547
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,359
I can do it.

548
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,119
Okay.

549
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,639
I respect your decision.

550
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,960
By the way,

551
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,319
if Blue Jay

552
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,399
is going to join our acquisition plan,

553
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
our relationship

554
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,799
will become a sensitive topic.

555
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,319
You understand, right?

556
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't want to ruffle He Haixiang
and the others.

557
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,240
So...

558
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,559
So, we have to keep our relationship

559
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,639
a secret.

560
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,520
That's right.

561
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,359
You are so smart.

562
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,920
You are indeed my son's father.

563
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,280
You make it sound nice.

564
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
But you just don't want to
give me the title.

565
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,799
What title?

566
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,559
Mr. Xin, you've watched too many dramas.

567
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,960
I know this is unfair to you.

568
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,200
How about

569
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,879
I do as you say when we are outside

570
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,760
as well as when we are at home?

571
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,200
Really?

572
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,240
Let me collect
some of the interests then.

573
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,839
You are the one
who gave up on the interests.

574
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,240
That doesn't count.

575
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,440
Why is he here?

576
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,480
I don't know.

577
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,200
Get up.

578
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,079
I don't know.

579
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,119
Let's carry him back to his room.

580
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,040
You are here.

581
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,480
Let's sleep together.

582
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,520
Quanquan, be good.

583
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,879
I'll carry you back to your room.

584
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,480
No.

585
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,559
I want to sleep with you today.

586
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,040
Quanquan, you are a big boy now.

587
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,440
You've been sleeping by yourself
before this, right?

588
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes. This bed is too small.

589
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,920
It can't fit all of us.

590
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,359
But it could fit us before this.

591
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,639
You even told me bedtime stories on it.

592
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,480
I shouldn't have helped you
pursue Min Hui.

593
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,159
Now that you have Min Hui,
you don't want your son anymore.

594
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,319
I'm regretting having him

595
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,599
as our son now.

596
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,799
Maybe we should
take a rain check for today.

597
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,879
No. Let me take you back to your room.

598
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,040
Mummy, save me.

599
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,480
Don't go yet.

600
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,799
Take this with you.

601
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,120
Quanquan, the crocodile
will keep you company.

602
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,960
- Let's go.
- Mummy!

603
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,040
Quanquan!

604
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm such a bad mummy.

605
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,200
Let me down.

606
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,319
Our neighbors are sleeping already.

607
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,359
Quanquan.

608
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,319
You have to be understanding.

609
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,799
What does it mean?

610
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:36,960
Being understanding

611
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,079
means that you are an adult from now on.

612
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,559
You have to learn
how to sleep by yourself.

613
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,720
But I'm still a kid.

614
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,760
You are not.

615
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,200
You are Iron Man. You are an adult.

616
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
This will keep you company today.

617
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,599
Anyway,

618
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,920
don't go to me and Min Hui's room.

619
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,040
Sleep now.

620
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,680
Goodnight.

621
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,920
Adults now are so unreliable.

622
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,319
Are you asleep?

623
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:19,280
Looks like you are really exhausted.

624
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,680
Goodnight.

625
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,559
Xin Qi.

626
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Are you asleep?

627
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,200
Xin Qi.

628
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,960
Do not sleep.

629
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,359
Do not sleep.

630
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,040
How can I sleep with you here?

631
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,440
(Be Agile Medical Technology)

632
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,639
Xin Qi said yes?

633
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,799
But Blue Jay can only offer
500 million at most.

634
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,319
As for the rest...

635
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,879
I've talked to two private equity firms.

636
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,920
One of them

637
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,119
is very interested

638
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,440
in the AI heart modeling technology

639
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
that Min Hui is working on.

640
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm sure they'll invest in us.

641
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,440
The other firm is still considering it.

642
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
But I think it's very likely
that they'll say yes too.

643
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I think it's just an issue
with the profit distribution.

644
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,799
Min Hui.

645
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,480
You should come with me tomorrow
to meet the investor.

646
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,879
You can convince him
with your professionalism.

647
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,680
No problem.

648
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,119
That's great.

649
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,319
As I said,

650
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,920
everyone knows the value of Be Agile.

651
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:39,119
Yuanlai will regret selling us off.

652
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,599
If we didn't work on

653
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,879
the AI heart modeling technology
back then,

654
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:45,200
we wouldn't have been
so popular right now.

655
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,359
It's pointless to bring that up now.

656
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,639
We are in the same boat now.

657
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,359
We should focus on the future.

658
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,680
If the acquisition is a success,

659
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,559
I'll be in charge of the management.

660
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,280
As for the R&D projects
and technologies,

661
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,639
Min Hui can be in charge of them.

662
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,559
If the acquisition is a success,

663
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,559
we will be the shareholders.

664
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,920
Of course she'll be in charge of them.

665
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,319
But Mr. He,

666
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:08,079
what are you going to do

667
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,440
with Ding Yifeng?

668
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,839
What do you mean?

669
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,079
If this company becomes ours,

670
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,079
I won't hire an idler.

671
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,079
The most important thing now

672
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,839
is to work on the acquisition.

673
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,359
As for the rest,

674
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,680
we can discuss it later.

675
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,359
Let's go.

676
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,040
So, about that...

677
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,280
Ms. Cao.

678
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,240
We'll talk later. Let's go.

679
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,280
Why are they acting so cocky?

680
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,720
Are they hiding something from me?

681
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,159
Mr. He.

682
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,760
What are they planning again?

683
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:48,920
Nothing.

684
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,680
They came here to talk about work.

685
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,159
Mr. He.

686
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,720
Are we going to be acquired by Guanchao?

687
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,119
How would I know?

688
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,960
I can't find out anything
from the new chairman.

689
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,799
Moreover,

690
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,440
it doesn't matter

691
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,599
who's at the helm.
We are just the employees.

692
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,480
We just need to do our job.

693
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:06,799
That's right.

694
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,359
I'll just stick to you.

695
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
I'll let you get back to work then.
I'll take my leave now.

696
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,799
Close your eyes first.

697
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,480
Okay. I'll close my eyes.

698
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,799
Okay. You can open your eyes now.

699
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,760
I made this myself. It's for you.

700
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,639
Quanquan.

701
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,079
Did you ask us out

702
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,960
just to give me this?

703
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,520
You looked so unhappy a few days ago.

704
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,280
Although Aunt Cindy told me

705
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,839
that adults can settle

706
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,079
their own issues,

707
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,559
I still want to cheer you up.

708
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,520
Do you like it?

709
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,399
Why aren't you saying anything?

710
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,879
I like it.

711
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,680
I like it so much.

712
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,159
The necklace is so well-made.

713
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,359
Thank you, Quanquan.

714
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,680
Enough.

715
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,559
Quanquan.

716
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,639
What about my gift?

717
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,599
Close your eyes first.

718
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay. I'll close them.

719
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,520
You can open your eyes now.

720
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
This is a gift for you.

721
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,200
What is this?

722
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,280
It's the same as mine.

723
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,559
They are exactly the same.

724
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,599
It looks like you.

725
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,520
This is for me.

726
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,639
Quanquan.

727
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,719
Quanquan.

728
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
My gift is way better.

729
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,400
Zizhu.

730
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,440
I asked the florist for advice.

731
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,020
(Spectrum Theatre)
The florist told me

732
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,119
(Spectrum Theatre)
that tulips are the best in this season.

733
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,840
(Spectrum Theatre)
I bought them just for you.

734
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,800
(Spectrum Theatre)
Do you like them?

735
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Do you know what tulips symbolize?

736
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't know.

737
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:37,559
Love for all.

738
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,279
They suit you quite well.

739
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,279
I didn't know.

740
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,159
How about you tell me

741
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,840
what flowers you like?

742
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,599
I'll buy them for you.

743
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,599
I like all kinds of flowers.

744
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,040
But I don't like those from you.

745
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,440
Stop following me.

746
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,400
I really...

747
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,119
Don't move.

748
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,079
Are you for real?

749
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,719
Can't you help me
when I'm already like this?

750
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,360
No.

751
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,320
You asked me not to move.

752
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,960
Did you twist your ankle?

753
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,440
Is it painful?

754
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,119
Come. Let me take a look at it.

755
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:12,800
Forget it.

756
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,719
This can become a serious issue.

757
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,920
Let me carry you.

758
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,759
Climb on.

759
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,239
Who are you to me?

760
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,079
Don't think that I'm easy.

761
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,480
How can you go home like this then?

762
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,759
Zizhu.

763
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,279
Are you tired?

764
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,360
Do you want me to send you back?

765
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,279
I'm not done with my shopping yet.

766
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,119
Are you tired?

767
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,199
No. I promised to come shopping
with you today.

768
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,679
I'll follow you wherever you go.

769
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,119
You are the one who said it.

770
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,759
Don't regret it.

771
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,119
Let's go.

772
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
I'm sorry.

773
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,960
Is it that bad?

774
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,920
Can I stop wearing these?

775
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,159
I'm not forcing you to do this.

776
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,440
If you don't want to do it anymore,
just leave.

777
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:15,639
No. Wait for a moment.

778
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,840
Wait for a moment.

779
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,559
Why are you wearing socks like that?

780
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,800
Do you think you are a kid?

781
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,279
Well...

782
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:36,079
They are quite cute, right?

783
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,159
So childish.

784
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,599
Hurry up.

785
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,040
Wait for me.

786
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,840
Good morning, Mr. He.

787
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,320
Good morning.

788
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,480
By the way, where is Cao Mu?

789
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,719
She has gone up first.

790
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,239
Mr. He.

791
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,880
Mr. Xin, good morning.

792
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,199
Can you please make some space for him?

793
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,159
Thank you.

794
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,119
Please come in, Mr. Xin.

795
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,559
Good morning, Mr. Xin.

796
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,000
Thank you.

797
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Good morning.

798
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,980
(Didn't I ask you to come in
after ten minutes?)

799
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,300
(I waited for ten minutes.
The lift is too slow.)

800
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:07,759
Mr. Xin.

801
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm sorry. Please make way.

802
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,279
After you, Mr. Xin.

803
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,279
Lady first.

804
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:15,159
No. After you, Mr. Xin.

805
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
After you.

806
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,440
