=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
=Episode 18=

25
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,433
You asked me a question that day.

26
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,193
I can answer you now.

27
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:47,954
I like you.

28
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,114
I hope I can be with you

29
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,154
every day in my future.

30
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,594
And our Quanquan.

31
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:56,633
All right?

32
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:00,514
Xin Qi, did you forget about that?

33
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,993
Our story ended five years ago.

34
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:08,833
During this time we've spent together,

35
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:10,993
I often wonder

36
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,713
if we could start again.

37
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,234
That morning,

38
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:22,074
you said that to me.

39
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,273
I'm willing to spend my whole life

40
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:25,273
repaying you.

41
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,114
Can you give me one more chance?

42
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,753
Sunflower brings the meaning

43
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:31,394
of anticipating for the reunion of love.

44
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,354
As you walked slowly toward me

45
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,753
and put that bracelet on my wrist,

46
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,074
I felt really happy.

47
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:44,234
I know

48
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,273
you're mad at me,

49
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,394
because of Chen Jiajun.

50
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:50,794
I didn't stand by your side
at the first time

51
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,194
and didn't trust you.

52
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,313
But I've explained myself.

53
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,033
I know.

54
00:02:58,273 --> 00:02:59,993
So, I began to understand you

55
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,914
after calming down.

56
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,474
I accept your apology.

57
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,674
But why?

58
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,354
Because I'm afraid.

59
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,313
I'm afraid
that I'll endure the same pain

60
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,993
if we restart.

61
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,273
Also, I'm afraid

62
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,394
that the shadow of Su Tian
will continue to haunt us.

63
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:19,433
But there's no love

64
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,394
between us.

65
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,394
I know.

66
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,033
Can you assure me

67
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:26,514
this is the last time

68
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,394
you blame me for her death?

69
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,914
I don't want

70
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:32,873
that accident

71
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,074
to become a time bomb

72
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:35,514
that buries within us.

73
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,273
I don't want the wounds
from five years ago

74
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:40,474
to keep opening up over and over again.

75
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,833
That's beyond me.

76
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,273
Starting today,

77
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,234
we're just

78
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,074
Quanquan's parents.

79
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:00,833
And

80
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,313
nothing more.

81
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,513
Please.

82
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,914
Pass this to him.

83
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:49,674
Don't tell him about me.

84
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:54,034
I want him to be safe.

85
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,753
(Su Tian.)

86
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:00,873
(Hopefully, you can rest in peace.)

87
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,234
(In our next life,)

88
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,914
(I wish we could meet earlier.)

89
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,114
Min Hui.

90
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,873
Did you forget that I'm a boy?

91
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,154
Apparently, this backpack is for girls.

92
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:35,914
Quanquan.

93
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,474
Look, isn't that design great?

94
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,993
It was too rushed
to pick a present for you

95
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,633
when I left.

96
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:43,834
But, look.

97
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:44,553
You can give this backpack

98
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,354
to Huan or Nuan,

99
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:47,953
am I right?

100
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:50,393
But I don't like Huan anymore.

101
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:53,600
I like Zhuzhu now.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,800
You move on so fast.

103
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,154
Gosh, I didn't know

104
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:58,753
you're actually a playboy.

105
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:03,354
But Zhuzhu is going to marry Daddy Zhou.

106
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:04,753
What? Who?

107
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,274
Daddy Zhou.

108
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:08,834
That's a lot to take in.

109
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,114
That's nonsense.

110
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:11,993
Zhuzhu was joking.

111
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,073
Zhuzhu?

112
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,193
Who's it? Your girlfriend?

113
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,154
Eat the fruit.

114
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,354
Zhou Ruji, I smell something.

115
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,114
Finally, your frozen heart melts.

116
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:24,354
Is she pretty?

117
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:25,354
How old is she?

118
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:26,474
Does she like you too?

119
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:26,993
Do you like her?

120
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:27,834
Do you like each other?

121
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:28,633
You're prying

122
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,674
as if you're my mother.

123
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:31,034
I'm showing concern for you.

124
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,313
As your good friend,

125
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:33,513
I've never seen you date someone

126
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:34,674
since I knew you.

127
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,714
To be honest,
I used to think that you...

128
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:37,674
Aren't you the same too?

129
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:38,953
You've been alone all this time.

130
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,433
No, it's different.

131
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,114
She has Xin Qi.

132
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:48,433
Well, right.

133
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:51,393
Cao Mu told me

134
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,073
that you had an argument with Xin Qi
in Shanghai.

135
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:55,193
But she didn't say much about it.

136
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,034
What has happened?

137
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,073
Have you made up with him?

138
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,234
We made a clean breakup this time.

139
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:13,873
(Have you reached home?)

140
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:18,993
(It's been hectic these days.)

141
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:20,594
(Get a good sleep.)

142
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,700
(Min Hui)

143
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:39,474
It's for you.

144
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:40,794
Thank you.

145
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,234
So, Xin Qi and you

146
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:45,714
are over?

147
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:48,753
Yes, we're over.

148
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,513
I admit that I'm sad,

149
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,873
but I'll get through it.

150
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:57,633
After all, there are many people
and things

151
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,953
that are important in my life.

152
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:01,354
Love relationship isn't everything.

153
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:03,953
Well said.

154
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:06,753
The Min Hui I know
has finally come back.

155
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:09,714
When did I even leave?

156
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:12,474
Well, wrong expression.

157
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,794
You've never changed.

158
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:18,114
Last time, you told me

159
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:19,594
you suddenly realized

160
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,073
that Quanquan always wanted a father

161
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:23,034
after Xin Qi's appearance.

162
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:25,553
What do you do about this now?

163
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,193
You've been all alone these years.

164
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,873
Don't you want to find another man

165
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,674
besides Xin Qi?

166
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:34,673
Yes, I do.

167
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,873
But I can't find a suitable one.

168
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,434
What kind of man do you want?

169
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:40,753
Care to share?

170
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,753
Perhaps I...

171
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,114
I can give you some suggestions.

172
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,434
First of all,

173
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,033
we must share the same topic

174
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,074
and feel comfortable around each other

175
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:52,314
without awkwardness.

176
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,834
Next, no suspicion and mistrust

177
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,993
between us.

178
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,513
On top of all of that,
he should treat Quanquan well.

179
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,074
Are you referring to me?

180
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:05,913
You're not telling me
you have a crush on me, are you?

181
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,714
I will splash on your face.

182
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,393
But seriously,

183
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:14,993
many couples around me

184
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,114
were developed from friends.

185
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,753
It's like finding a companion in life,
after all.

186
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:20,714
It's pretty good.

187
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,273
That's not good.

188
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,633
We have lots of time ahead.

189
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:26,753
I'm not going to compromise now.

190
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:30,393
You too.

191
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:31,714
You still have

192
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,474
Zhuzhu waiting for you.

193
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,033
(Are you in bed now?)

194
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:51,954
(Is Quanquan asleep?)

195
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,420
(Have you reached home? It's been
hectic these days. Get a good sleep.)

196
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,860
(Are you in bed now?
Is Quanquan asleep?)

197
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

198
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:20,673
Hello, dear.

199
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:21,633
Ms. Min.

200
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,873
Mr. Xin has been waiting for you inside.

201
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:26,273
Morning, Mr. Xin.

202
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:29,234
You didn't reply to my message.

203
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,554
Normally, I won't reply

204
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:31,913
to work messages during rest days.

205
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,633
It's not about the work.

206
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,354
I'm so sorry, Mr. Xin.

207
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:37,114
We're just

208
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,954
business partners now.

209
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,474
So, I'm not obliged
to respond to anything

210
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,913
outside of work.

211
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:45,074
Is there anything else?

212
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,913
If not, I have to work now.

213
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,114
Mr. Liao of Daye Group

214
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,474
would like to have dinner with you

215
00:10:58,554 --> 00:10:59,834
for the collaboration matter.

216
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,594
Collaboration, my foot.

217
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:02,673
Every time I eat with him,

218
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:04,714
I have to drink and
listen to him bragging about himself.

219
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,033
Tell him I'm not free tonight.

220
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,060
(Chen Jiajun)

221
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:20,074
(I'm back. I'm at the entrance now.)

222
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,114
(Did you change your passcode?)

223
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:27,873
Zhang Beibei.

224
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:29,753
Make an appointment with Mr. Liao

225
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:30,873
and choose a fancy restaurant.

226
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:31,993
Yes.

227
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,234
(Where are you now? I'll come to you.)

228
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,474
You have the guts, huh?

229
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:47,600
(I have something to tell you
face-to-face.)

230
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,100
(The message is successfully sent
but rejected by the receiver.)

231
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,234
Mr. Xin.

232
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,753
We've come out with a detailed report

233
00:11:57,753 --> 00:11:59,434
on the progress of Mist.

234
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,633
Please have a look.

235
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,554
Firstly, tests in every phase.

236
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,714
Secondly, the final presentation
of the product.

237
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,793
It's classified into three sections.

238
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:10,793
Finally, the conclusion and discussion
of statistical analysis.

239
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,074
This is the result

240
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,234
concluded by the discussion team

241
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,354
led by Ms. Min and me.

242
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,114
So, that's all we got so far.

243
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,590
Please take a look.

244
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,513
Min Hui.

245
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:29,673
Min Hui.

246
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,040
There are functions like machine vision,

247
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,830
speech recognition, and deep learning.

248
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,273
As for the operating plan,

249
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,273
we develop these formations.

250
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:46,354
You're here, Mr. Xin.

251
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:47,194
Mr. Xin.

252
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,793
I have brought afternoon tea for you.

253
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,913
- Thank you, Mr. Xin.
- Thank you, Mr. Xin.

254
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,660
(Xin Qi: Let's have dinner together.)

255
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,300
(Sorry.)

256
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,300
(The number you're calling is busy.)

257
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,740
(Please try again later.)

258
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:42,194
How to deal with
my girlfriend who's sulking?

259
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,320
(How to deal with
my girlfriend who's sulking?)

260
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:46,393
Ex-wife?

261
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,830
(How to deal with
a girlfriend who's sulking?)

262
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,714
Mr. Xin.

263
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,234
Be careful of heatstroke.

264
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,234
It seems that Ms. Min

265
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,314
has already given up.

266
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:04,993
The way she looked at you

267
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,434
is like looking at a stranger.

268
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:10,594
Of course, that's different.

269
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:14,554
Have you been in love with someone?

270
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,114
Oh my.

271
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:17,633
Isn't that apparent?

272
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,114
You've been in love with someone?

273
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,554
Who are they?

274
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,153
How many girlfriends have you dated?

275
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,074
When?

276
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,594
Just one?

277
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,834
No.

278
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:35,114
I dated three girls

279
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:35,673
in three years each

280
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:36,194
during college.

281
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:37,033
After graduating,

282
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:38,594
I had one girlfriend per year.

283
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:39,673
But after I work for you,

284
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:40,474
I never date anyone.

285
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:41,314
No time for that.

286
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:44,554
Come on.

287
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:45,954
Please sit.

288
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:47,074
I...

289
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:51,673
Share with me.

290
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,913
Well,

291
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,273
that's hard though.

292
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:58,673
Hardy.

293
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,633
You haven't got a raise
for a year, right?

294
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,474
In that case,

295
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,954
that's a pretty simple thing.

296
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,793
I've read a book previously.

297
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:09,793
It said

298
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:11,513
that aggressive women
can't resist pestering suitors.

299
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:12,513
Meaning to say...

300
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:13,234
No. I can't.

301
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,554
I'm not the clingy type.

302
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,714
It doesn't suit my character.

303
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:20,114
Seriously?

304
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,834
Do you think maintaining your image

305
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,513
is more important
than winning back Ms. Min now?

306
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:24,913
Ms. Min

307
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:26,873
is the kind who won't stand down
in the face of dominant men.

308
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,033
The bossy type won't work for her.

309
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,194
Instead, pestering type

310
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:32,513
might be feasible.

311
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,273
Also,

312
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:37,913
you have Quanquan between you.

313
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:40,033
Hence, there's no way

314
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,273
she could make a clear breakup with you.

315
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:45,554
Sounds reasonable.

316
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:46,993
Of course.

317
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,314
What book did you read this from?

318
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,194
"The Pampered Husband
of The Female Boss."

319
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,793
Very informative.

320
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,714
No, Mr. Xin.

321
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,913
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,314
Fine.

323
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,273
I won't read such a useless book

324
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,194
anymore.

325
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,234
I'll throw them...

326
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,273
Get me this.

327
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,354
Buy them all.

328
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:08,673
The whole series.

329
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:09,554
I want them all.

330
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,873
Point taken.

331
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:17,714
I'll go right away.

332
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:25,153
"Pampered husband of the female boss."

333
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,513
Quanquan, go get the door.

334
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,234
Who's it? The postman?

335
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,834
No, it's Xin Qi.

336
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,554
Oh, I haven't eaten yet.

337
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:50,834
It seems

338
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,074
the food quality drops after I left.

339
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:54,633
Mr. Xin.

340
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,074
I...

341
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,673
Please don't call me that at home.

342
00:16:59,033 --> 00:16:59,714
Quanquan.

343
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:00,474
Do you miss me?

344
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:01,513
I do.

345
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,273
Hurry up.

346
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:04,754
The food is going to cool off.

347
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:16,473
It's a bit spicy.

348
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:20,354
Have more.

349
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:21,314
Make yourself at home.

350
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:22,794
Here, Quanquan.

351
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:31,554
Quanquan.

352
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,794
Let's go for a movie after dinner,

353
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:34,473
all right?

354
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:35,594
Hardy said

355
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:38,034
there's a great new animated movie.

356
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:41,953
Sure, it's been a long time
since I watched movies.

357
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,034
Min Hui.

358
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,594
Can we go to a movie after this?

359
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:47,314
Sure.

360
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,233
Quanquan, what are you doing?

361
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,554
Nothing.

362
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,153
Eat the dishes.

363
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,794
Home-cooked is always the best.

364
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,633
Quanquan.

365
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:18,834
Quanquan, get in.

366
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:20,114
Get in the car.

367
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:23,554
Get in the car.

368
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,994
According to our agreement,

369
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,713
you can see Quanquan
once a week.

370
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,754
So, tonight counts as your visit
for this week.

371
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:33,554
If he wants to stay
in your house tonight,

372
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:34,913
just text me.

373
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,754
You're not coming with us?

374
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:39,153
I allowed Quanquan to go to the movie
with you.

375
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:40,473
But I didn't say that I'm tagging along.

376
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:42,514
Xin Qi.

377
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,074
I think

378
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,794
you should understand what I told you

379
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,314
in Shi'an Town.

380
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,433
I understand what you meant,

381
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:54,193
but I don't agree with it.

382
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,314
That's why I want to prove

383
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,594
that you're the only woman I want.

384
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,114
In the past, present,

385
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:01,433
and future.

386
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,314
But I don't have feelings
for you anymore.

387
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:06,713
I will rekindle the sparkle between us.

388
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:09,354
Whatever.

389
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:10,994
You can waste your time

390
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,514
as much as you wish.

391
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:14,913
I ordered the service.

392
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,393
Where are you going?

393
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:19,114
Since someone is looking
after Quanquan, I'm going on a date.

394
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,473
Min Hui.

395
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,554
What do you know again this time?

396
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:28,794
I don't.

397
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,580
(Block 8)

398
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,433
You're back.

399
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:05,233
Why do you look for me?

400
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,594
I know you have misunderstandings
about me.

401
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,594
So I came here to explain myself.

402
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:21,514
I didn't eat anything today.

403
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:23,514
Can you let me go up?

404
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:29,433
I miss you so much.

405
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,393
Stay right there.

406
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,354
Keep a distance from me.

407
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:33,794
Fire away.

408
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,514
Why did you ignore my calls and texts?

409
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,193
I misunderstood that Min Hui caused
my sister's death.

410
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,473
I didn't know how to face you

411
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,754
when I thought about
how good you two are.

412
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:44,354
So, I...

413
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:45,153
So?

414
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,114
So you planned to break up with me

415
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,153
if the investigation led to no way?

416
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,074
No, I didn't.

417
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:52,314
I was afraid
you won't talk to me anymore.

418
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:53,794
How do you explain
that you approached me purposely

419
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:54,913
and moved into my house as my boyfriend

420
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,794
after I hit you with my car?

421
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,554
You even wanted me
to introduce Min Hui to you.

422
00:20:58,633 --> 00:20:59,754
Are you going to deny

423
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:01,514
that this wasn't
to investigate your sister's case?

424
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,713
It's an accident to know you.

425
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,913
There's no such coincidence.

426
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,034
I should've known

427
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,754
that you approached me with a purpose.

428
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,354
No, I didn't. Cao Mu.

429
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:13,633
Let go of me.

430
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:21,633
Chen Jiajun.

431
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,594
After this incident,

432
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,834
I realized that I know nothing
about you,

433
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,074
so do you.

434
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:31,794
I hate dishonesty.

435
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:36,834
I've packed your things.

436
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:39,393
I hope that you can leave

437
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,153
before I come back.

438
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:42,713
Wait.

439
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:45,994
Cao Mu.

440
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,873
Did you tick Min Hui off again?

441
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:18,354
How did you know?

442
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:19,633
Oh, please.

443
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,514
You've been typing to Min Hui
since just now.

444
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:23,953
Yet you didn't send it out.

445
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:25,834
You feel guilty.

446
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:30,594
Min Hui said

447
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,473
you're a kid and
you can't take cold drinks.

448
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:38,594
What do you think Min Hui's doing?

449
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:39,633
Who's she dating?

450
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,754
Is it Zhou Ruji?

451
00:22:40,754 --> 00:22:41,834
How would I know about that?

452
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:43,193
They didn't tell me anything.

453
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,153
Are you curious?

454
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:44,994
Do you know?

455
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:52,673
You want two?

456
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:54,274
Min Hui won't allow me to take you out

457
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:55,713
if she finds out.

458
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:59,554
Not the yogurt.

459
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:00,834
I want your phone.

460
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:02,153
What for?

461
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:09,153
Who are you calling?

462
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:14,473
Hello.

463
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,994
Where are you, Daddy Zhou?

464
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,554
(I'm on the night shift.)

465
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:20,193
(What's up? Whose number is this?)

466
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:22,074
This is my dad's number.

467
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,633
Nothing. It's just that I miss you.

468
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,233
Please do well with your work.

469
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:25,873
Love you.

470
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:29,114
As expected of my son.

471
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,994
Smart boy.

472
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:33,594
But you can't say you miss him

473
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:34,913
or love him anymore.

474
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,713
You can only say that to me

475
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:38,074
and Min Hui.

476
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:38,673
Do you hear me?

477
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:39,754
Got it.

478
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,794
Petty daddy.

479
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,514
But who is Min Hui seeing now?

480
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,994
I shouldn't have taken your call.

481
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:01,354
Be that as it may,

482
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,994
you will still be drinking alone here.

483
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:05,953
How pitiful.

484
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:07,594
Cao Mu, I told you

485
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,754
Chen Jiajun can't be
that kind of person.

486
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:11,473
Had he wanted to investigate me,

487
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,034
he should've hit on me directly.

488
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,794
Why did he have to take
such a big detour

489
00:24:14,794 --> 00:24:15,713
to approach you first?

490
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,354
He doesn't look like someone scheming.

491
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:18,834
Perhaps I'm more gorgeous than you.

492
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,393
Can I beat you up now?

493
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:28,913
You're well aware

494
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,713
that Chen Jiajun wouldn't do that.

495
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,354
So, what are you up to now?

496
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,834
I'm really pissed off.

497
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,473
He had so many chances

498
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:39,233
to explain this.

499
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,354
Why did he not tell me

500
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,274
and keep investigating?

501
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:42,153
What am I to him?

502
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,074
Regarding this,

503
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:45,074
Chen Jiajun has done wrong.

504
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,314
But it's not necessary
to break up with him.

505
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,274
To be honest,

506
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,354
I think I care too much about him.

507
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:58,673
Well, that's the thing.

508
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:00,314
But that shouldn't be the thing.

509
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:02,713
Do you know what the best
relationship is between the couple?

510
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:04,754
Close but independent.

511
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:06,794
What does it mean?

512
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,754
It means that two people
like each other,

513
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:11,074
but they aren't fully occupied
with each other.

514
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,673
When they're together, they're happy.

515
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,554
But when they're not,

516
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,554
they focus on their own lives.

517
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,673
That's the way it should be.

518
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:19,034
Are you suggesting that you can
only give half of your love?

519
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:20,873
What I mean is

520
00:25:20,873 --> 00:25:21,673
you should love yourself

521
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:23,673
more than you love the other person.

522
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,393
So that you won't lose the ground.

523
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,633
Are you talking about dating,

524
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:27,354
not war?

525
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:28,834
Why do we have to determine
a winner or loser?

526
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:30,913
Dating is sometimes like a battle.

527
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,034
I quite disapprove of your view,

528
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,193
but I support your decision.

529
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:36,713
Well.

530
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,713
Since everything is back
to square one now,

531
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,074
let's celebrate

532
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,673
our wonderful single life.

533
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:43,554
No.

534
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:45,393
I won't be single for too long.

535
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:46,554
Fine.

536
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,354
To my single life.

537
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:53,393
Give me something strong.

538
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:54,953
I want to find someone
even more handsome

539
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,274
and younger.

540
00:26:00,274 --> 00:26:01,594
I'm sorry, Xin Qi.

541
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:02,754
If it wasn't for me,

542
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:04,433
Min Hui and you wouldn't
have ended up like this.

543
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,314
So, I prepared these today

544
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,074
to apologize to you.

545
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:08,754
It's not related to you.

546
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,673
Without you,

547
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,314
Min Hui and I would
have rough patches too.

548
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,554
She's right.

549
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:18,314
Su Tian's a thorn between us.

550
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,314
If we don't remove this,

551
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:22,673
we can't be together.

552
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,834
Why are women so strange

553
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:25,873
and fickle?

554
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:27,673
Everything was fine a few days ago,

555
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,074
and now she wants to break up.

556
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,794
Don't ask me about this.

557
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:34,233
I'm like you.

558
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:34,994
I don't know much

559
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,473
about women in this regard.

560
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,153
Quanquan, why are you sighing?

561
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:44,074
Do you want to make them forgive you?

562
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:45,754
Ask me.

563
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,074
I grew up with them,

564
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,473
and I know their preferences

565
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:52,034
very well.

566
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:53,153
So, tell me.

567
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,274
What to do to make Mommy
change her mind?

568
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,953
Every time I get on her nerves,

569
00:26:57,994 --> 00:26:59,953
I just need to act cute and coax her.

570
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:03,314
I suddenly feel like what Quanquan said
makes sense.

571
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,393
Xin Qi, why don't we form an ally?

572
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:07,514
Consider this.

573
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:08,873
Now Min Hui ignores you,

574
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:10,034
but she talks to me.

575
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:11,794
Cao Mu refuses to see me,

576
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:13,633
but you can talk to her.

577
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,514
Let's form an ally and help each other.

578
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:16,393
It's an efficient collaboration.

579
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:20,873
Let's do it.

580
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,840
The Love Pursuers Ally is established.

581
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,180
(The Love Pursuers Ally)
Wait.

582
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,354
This name sounds old-fashioned.

583
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,233
Is it?

584
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,114
Cao Mu said,

585
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,834
there's no mistake

586
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,354
that a bouquet of flowers
can't put right.

587
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:36,633
If not, try two.

588
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,860
(Day 1)

589
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,140
(First move of pursuing love:
Flower bouquets)

590
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,633
The more flowers you give,

591
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,274
the more sincere you appear to be.

592
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:48,754
I assure you
that Min Hui will be overjoyed

593
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,554
when she sees the flowers.

594
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:00,754
Cai.

595
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:01,673
I...

596
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:02,834
Well...

597
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:04,873
What's going on in my office?

598
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,873
The person who delivered
the flowers this morning said

599
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:08,633
you knew the sender.

600
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,193
How would I know?

601
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:14,673
Jia.

602
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:16,594
Do you like this?

603
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,673
Apparently.

604
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:23,114
Don't tell me you like the flowers too.

605
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,473
Apparently.

606
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:27,794
Do you all like it too?

607
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,354
Great! You can have them.

608
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,940
(Day 2)
I want two.

609
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:35,873
Come on.

610
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,153
Take them away.

611
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:41,673
Thank you, Ms. Min.

612
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:45,554
I want it too.

613
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:46,393
Take it.

614
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:47,514
Thank you.

615
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:48,554
I want this.

616
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,554
Thank you.

617
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:51,834
Off you go.

618
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:53,754
Ms. Min, my flower...

619
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:01,913
You can have this.

620
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:03,794
Take it

621
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:04,514
and leave.

622
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,393
Get back to your work.

623
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:12,473
Besides, Cao Mu said,

624
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,034
no woman is immune

625
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,274
to a considerate guy with sweet words.

626
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:19,473
Ms. Min.

627
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,594
Here's your parcel.

628
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:21,233
Thank you.

629
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,060
(Day 3)

630
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,240
(Second move of pursuing love:
Sweet words)

631
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:28,473
(Use this when you drink water.)

632
00:29:28,514 --> 00:29:29,713
(The water will taste sweet.)

633
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,994
(Because it's full of my love.)

634
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,153
Speak boldly about your care for her

635
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:35,074
as much as you can.

636
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:37,193
She will be very touched for sure.

637
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:49,713
It's already nine.

638
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,433
She's never late to work.

639
00:29:53,754 --> 00:29:55,233
Hasn't she received flowers yet?

640
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,840
(Have you received the flowers?)

641
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:16,554
Meimei.

642
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:19,554
Ms. Min.

643
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:20,554
What's the matter?

644
00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:22,554
I...

645
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:29,074
You should speak up

646
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,554
for what you want.

647
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,074
Otherwise, no one can help you.

648
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,074
Can I transfer to R&D Team B?

649
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:37,633
Have you made up your mind?

650
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:39,713
Ms. Min.

651
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,153
I'm capable.

652
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,274
If you approve the transfer,

653
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,354
I will strive as much as I can at work.

654
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,034
I don't need you to strive too hard.

655
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:46,713
Just finish all your work

656
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:47,594
will do.

657
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:49,953
Do you approve of it?

658
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,473
But it's not valid with my approval.

659
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,594
Ding Yifeng should let you go.

660
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:00,074
Well.

661
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:01,873
You go write
the transfer application first.

662
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:03,473
I'll handle the rest.

663
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:04,794
Really?

664
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:06,354
Thank you so much, Ms. Min.

665
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:07,754
Off you go.

666
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,873
"The most interested party
in AI Summit."

667
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,393
"Be Agile, is a budding company
in the industry."

668
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:21,554
The reporters seemed

669
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,873
to have a good nose.

670
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,514
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:26,873
My handphone hasn't stopped ringing

672
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:29,114
after the summit ended.

673
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:31,034
Certainly.

674
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:33,034
Be Agile's achievements today

675
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,074
are all thanks to your wise leadership.

676
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:37,314
Min Hui.

677
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,633
Your AI heart modeling technology

678
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:41,074
has received high praise

679
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:43,433
from peers and experts at the summit.

680
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:46,594
I have an interview
with a medical journal tomorrow.

681
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:47,633
You should go with me.

682
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:48,554
Mr. He.

683
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,953
I believe you can handle
the interview very well

684
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:51,354
by yourself.

685
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,314
You represent Be Agile.

686
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:54,713
Other people aren't necessary
to show up.

687
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,713
If you need someone

688
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,473
to carry your bag or serve water,

689
00:31:58,473 --> 00:31:59,834
I can do it.

690
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:01,713
The interview

691
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,554
is about the details of
AI heart modeling technology.

692
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:06,193
Who do you think can explain this,
you or me?

693
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,314
Mr. Xin.

694
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,274
This way, please.

695
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,354
Mr. Xin. Ms. Min is having a meeting.

696
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,354
Show me the way.

697
00:32:23,354 --> 00:32:24,594
All right, this way.

698
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:32,953
I hold this meeting today

699
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,713
because I have something
to discuss with you.

700
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:35,473
Sure, go ahead.

701
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:37,673
Mr. Xin.

702
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,274
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. He.

703
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:41,873
I passed by here.

704
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:43,994
I heard that you're having a meeting

705
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:46,193
about the AI heart modeling technology.

706
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:47,393
So, I stopped by here.

707
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:48,114
Would you mind?

708
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:48,994
Of course, not.

709
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:49,754
Please take a seat.

710
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:50,913
Please sit.

711
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:52,433
Mr. Xin...

712
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:57,953
Sit, please.

713
00:32:58,153 --> 00:32:58,873
Go on.

714
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:00,193
Sure.

715
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:14,953
You ought to behave well

716
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:16,554
and listen to the teacher in the school.

717
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:18,794
I will come over
to play with you next time, okay?

718
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,594
You must remember what I told you.

719
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,114
If any pretty ladies approach Daddy Zhou,

720
00:33:25,114 --> 00:33:26,153
inform me right away.

721
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:28,594
Quanquan is the best.

722
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,473
I'm hanging up.

723
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,953
Why don't you give him your numbers?

724
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:36,994
He always calls me
when he wants to talk to you.

725
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:38,274
No, I won't.

726
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,153
This is our agreement.

727
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:42,153
Otherwise, I won't have any excuses
to come to see you.

728
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,314
What's wrong?

729
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,554
You seem down.

730
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:55,114
Nothing.

731
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,393
Please tell me.

732
00:33:57,393 --> 00:33:59,034
I want to satisfy my curiosity.

733
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:04,994
I just realized

734
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,034
why you said
that I'm the second male lead.

735
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,790
(Jiaren Hospital)
For the past few years,

736
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,353
I always thought

737
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,594
Min Hui stopped liking anyone

738
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:19,713
because of Quanquan.

739
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:22,233
So, I didn't tell her

740
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,514
my true feelings.

741
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:25,153
I was afraid of making things awkward

742
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,074
and losing her as a friend.

743
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:30,793
It proves me wrong

744
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:32,673
until Xin Qi showed up.

745
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:35,874
Xin...Xin Qi? Who's that?

746
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,833
Quanquan's biological father.

747
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:45,914
His appearance made me realize

748
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:48,994
that Min Hui didn't stop liking anyone.

749
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,514
She just didn't like me.

750
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:54,994
Even if she and Xin Qi broke up

751
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:55,954
completely,

752
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:59,074
she never considered being with me.

753
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,353
In her heart,

754
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:02,233
I'm only

755
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:03,753
her best friend

756
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:05,554
forever.

757
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:08,753
Like you said,

758
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:10,833
I'm the second male lead.

759
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,394
Get a grip, Zhou Ruji.

760
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:19,753
I didn't finish my sentence that day.

761
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:22,114
The current trend is that the second
male lead outperforms the rest.

762
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:22,954
Besides,

763
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,114
you've been by Min Hui

764
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:26,313
and Quanquan's side all the years.

765
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:27,874
How could you give up so easily?

766
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:30,193
You're the man I, Yao Zizhu, like.

767
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:31,673
You shouldn't be inferior.

768
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:35,074
Right now, Min Hui just hasn't
discovered how good you are.

769
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,673
Yes, that's the truth.

770
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:38,193
Dr. Zhou, you're a perfect guy.

771
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,153
You get to be brave

772
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:41,233
like me.

773
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:42,793
Confess your liking for her,

774
00:35:42,793 --> 00:35:44,034
otherwise, she won't know.

775
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:45,034
Am I right?

776
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:48,394
Do you want me

777
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:50,554
to confess?

778
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:53,153
Of course, you do.

779
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:54,753
Although

780
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,633
I don't want you two to be together,

781
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,793
because I'll be heartbroken.

782
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,713
However, I hate to see you

783
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:04,233
to have regrets

784
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:07,434
for not confessing

785
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:10,114
when you like her so much.

786
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:21,954
Well.

787
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,514
Remember what I said.

788
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:24,474
Think about it carefully.

789
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,500
(Jiaren Hospital)

790
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:37,193
My biggest gain from this summit

791
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:38,753
is that I have met several researchers
around the globe

792
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:41,034
who're also interested in this field.

793
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:43,313
I very approve of the ideas
and technical abilities

794
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,554
raised by some of them.

795
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:45,434
I'm thinking

796
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:46,753
if we should open a channel

797
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,074
to promote cooperation,

798
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,753
and invite them to join
as technical partners

799
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,633
for the following development.

800
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,673
I think this approach is efficient.

801
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,554
I don't think that's necessary.

802
00:36:58,753 --> 00:36:59,874
Our R&D team

803
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:01,114
is capable of this.

804
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,114
Besides, Min Hui,

805
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:03,273
you assured me of that before.

806
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:04,514
Mr. He, I think...

807
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,353
I believe this is necessary.

808
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:09,074
I've met those who Min Hui mentioned

809
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:09,914
at the summit.

810
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:12,914
They are professional.

811
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:13,633
Of course,

812
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,874
they might be lacking in many ways

813
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,753
compared to Min Hui.

814
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:19,074
But I believe it can speed up the launch

815
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:21,914
if they join us.

816
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,273
Min Hui.

817
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:25,353
The thing is, how should we divide

818
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:27,833
the patent rights?

819
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:28,673
That's right.

820
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:30,153
They don't belong to Be Agile.

821
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,833
If you're doing this,

822
00:37:32,353 --> 00:37:34,193
it's a waste of investor's money.

823
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:36,833
Having an increase in labor costs,

824
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,874
but the R&D duration
can be shortened substantially.

825
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:40,474
I can crunch the numbers well here.

826
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:41,994
I think what you're most concerned about

827
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,633
is the patent right for this technology.

828
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:49,153
Ms. Min.

829
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,514
Concerning your relationship
with Mr. Xin,

830
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:53,554
I must remind you

831
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:56,153
that you're the R&D director
of Be Agile.

832
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:58,474
Be Agile's interest is our top priority.

833
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,353
Otherwise, some might say

834
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:02,353
that women are emotional.

835
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:04,594
And then you'll claim us
for not respecting women.

836
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:08,034
Mr. Ding.

837
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,313
The reason I'm doing this

838
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:10,914
is out of my responsibility

839
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,753
to both our company and investors.

840
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:13,994
Science is borderless.

841
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:15,753
You can't let

842
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:17,153
your limited mind

843
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,394
impede the technology from developing.

844
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:21,273
Also, I don't think you can stop this.

845
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:23,114
Mr. He.

846
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,313
Mr. Ding

847
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:28,914
is on the same level as Min Hui,

848
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:30,434
but he's not on the R&D team

849
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:31,793
of this project.

850
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,394
Why is he sitting here?

851
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:35,034
Does it mean that your company

852
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,954
doesn't practice
confidentiality protocol

853
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:38,833
for the core technology?

854
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,074
Here's the thing, Mr. Xin.

855
00:38:40,353 --> 00:38:42,514
I ask Mr. Ding here

856
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:43,713
to help us.

857
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:46,753
For making it worse?

858
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:51,514
I fully agree
with Ms. Min's suggestion.

859
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:53,313
Well, Min Hui.

860
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:54,753
Since Mr. Xin has said so,

861
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:55,633
you can proceed.

862
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:57,114
Thank you, Mr. He.

863
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,753
And Mr. Xin too.

864
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:03,554
By the way,

865
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:06,034
my project team

866
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:07,793
has too much workload.

867
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,394
I need an assistant.

868
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:11,833
I wonder if Mr. Ding
can give me his team member.

869
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:14,514
Go find an assistant yourself
if you need one.

870
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:15,874
Don't take mine.

871
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,514
But Zhong Meimei has already sent me

872
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:18,753
a transfer application.

873
00:39:19,114 --> 00:39:19,793
Mr. He.

874
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,394
I don't know if this violates

875
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,353
the transfer policy of the company.

876
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:26,713
Of course not.

877
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:27,874
Good to know that.

878
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:30,434
Mr. He.

879
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,833
