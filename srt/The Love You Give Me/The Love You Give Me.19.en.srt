=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
=Episode 19=

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
This is...

26
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,080
Mr. Xin.

27
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,520
I snatched some flowers from them.

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
I can't let your effort go to waste.

29
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,080
Ms. Min Hui.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
I'll take my leave now.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,639
- You...
- You...

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,080
You first.

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,240
Why are you here?

34
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,440
To see you.

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,639
No.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
Why did you give my flowers

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,639
to others?

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,759
I don't like flowers.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,839
All women like flowers.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,279
I'm that exception.

41
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,759
And I hate flowers.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,679
What do you like then?

43
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,720
I'll give you other gifts next time.

44
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,440
If it's about something I like,

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,160
I like my peace and quietness

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,040
where no one disturbs me when I work.

47
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,519
So, can you not simply enter my office

48
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,239
without my permission?

49
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,639
Does it mean that I can go
to your house whenever I like?

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,679
That's even worse.

51
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,759
What if I want to pick up Quanquan?

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,759
You can tell me beforehand

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,639
and I'll take Quanquan to you.

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
You don't have to do that.

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,199
I do.

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
And I think

57
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,919
it's very necessary.

58
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,720
So you won't do something so impractical

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,959
and childish again.

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,440
Fine.

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,600
We'll do as you say.

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
It's noon now.
Let's have lunch together.

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,359
I'm working now.

64
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,479
I'll wait for you to finish up.

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
I don't like to deal with my clients

66
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,679
after work.

67
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,600
You understand, right?

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,880
Fine.

69
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,959
I'm sure you'll go out with me one day.

70
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:01,639
Wait.

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,919
Have you regretted it?

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,799
Take this out with you.

73
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,600
It's getting on my nerves.

74
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,600
He's so childish.

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,040
Look over there.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
There are two handsome men over there.

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,440
What do you think?

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,079
They are really handsome.

79
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,239
Should we add them on WeChat?

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:36,840
Go and add them then.

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,079
No. You go.

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,759
Hi, handsome men.

83
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,759
Do you want to play some games with us?

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,199
Sorry to bother you.

85
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,600
Those moves that you taught me
didn't work at all.

86
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,280
They didn't work on Min Hui.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,919
But I did my best to help you.

88
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,519
At least you get to see Min Hui.

89
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,919
After Cao Mu

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,079
blacklisted me,

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,840
I don't even have an excuse to see her.

92
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,400
Jiajun,

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,359
I really don't know
how to pursue a woman.

94
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,640
But I have brought
a strategy book for you.

95
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
(Domineering CEO Falls in Love with Me)

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,879
"The domineering CEO
falls in love with me."

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,960
What is this?

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Hardy has personally verified this book.

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
All the strategies inside
are useful against

100
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,679
a woman like Cao Mu.

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,999
Use those strategies.

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,999
I'm sure you'll get the result you want.

103
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,239
But I'm not domineering
and I'm not a CEO.

104
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,359
What should I do?

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,799
Do you want Cao Mu
to get back with you?

106
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,640
Of course I do.

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,679
Use the strategies in the book then.

108
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,999
Okay.

109
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,520
Xin Qi, let me teach you
some moves too.

110
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,799
Cao Mu told me

111
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,440
that no woman could withstand

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
(Eight-Pack Abs! WOW)
the seduction of abs.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,400
It's all about what Cao Mu said again!

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
It's not just about what she said.

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
I verified it too.

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,359
It worked.

117
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,879
I personally verified it.

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
You did it?

119
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,359
Anyway, the goal

120
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,919
is to show Ms. Min Hui

121
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
your charm as a mature man.

122
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,919
That's not a huge issue.

123
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,960
The issue is,

124
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,479
she doesn't even let me enter her house.

125
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,919
I don't have a chance to do that.

126
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,799
That's not true.

127
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,999
Quanquan.

128
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,080
Min Hui, you are so slow.

129
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,640
Uncle Chen has already started
teaching me how to swim.

130
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
You asked Uncle Chen
to teach you how to swim?

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,359
It's expensive to hire him
as your coach.

132
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,679
Did you pay him?

133
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,319
Where's my money?

134
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,679
I don't have money.

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Can I pay him with this?

136
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,119
Jiajun, thank you.

137
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Quanquan has been pestering me
about learning how to swim.

138
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
But I don't have much time
to bring him here.

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
It's okay. No worries.

140
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
You are so busy.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,559
If Quanquan wants
to come swimming again,

142
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,520
just tell me about it.

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,319
I'll take him here.

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Thank you.

145
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,799
You don't have to trouble Jiajun for it.

146
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,200
You have me.

147
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
Why are you here?

148
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,040
Xin Qi wanted
to have a meal with me.

149
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,160
And I told him

150
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,799
that I was giving Quanquan
a swimming lesson.

151
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,359
I never thought that he would come here.

152
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,799
You didn't expect this?

153
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,319
Yes.

154
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,520
I suddenly recall

155
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,479
that I have a class later.

156
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,319
Maybe you can let Xin Qi
teach Quanquan how to swim first.

157
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,319
He's quite a good swimmer.

158
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,840
It's okay. Just leave Quanquan to me.

159
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,999
Go and do your work.

160
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,119
You are indeed Mr. Xin.

161
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,960
You are so good at winning someone over.

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,840
Well.

163
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,400
I just happened to run into you today.

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,119
It doesn't count as our weekly visit.

165
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,600
Am I right, son?

166
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,999
Xin Qi, hurry up and
teach me how to swim.

167
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay. I'm coming.

168
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,520
What are you doing?

169
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,960
This is so embarrassing.

170
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,280
Are you going to swim or not?

171
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,359
Of course.

172
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:35,600
What do you think?

173
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,720
You are too funny.

174
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,760
This is your uncle's fault

175
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,080
for giving me such a bad idea.

176
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,520
Hello.

177
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,559
Hello, Ms. Cao.

178
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,559
Just now, a tenant called to tell us

179
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,960
that your car is unlocked.

180
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,359
Maybe you should go down and check.

181
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:04,720
Okay.

182
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,919
Thank you.

183
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,840
My car is locked.

184
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Are you the one who called
the management office?

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
Is there a problem with your neck?

186
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,240
Get up, Chen Jiajun.

187
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
Woman.

188
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,599
You won't be able

189
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,000
to escape me.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,839
Where did you learn this kind
of nonsense?

191
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,640
That's not important.

192
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,520
The important thing is,

193
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,240
we are together now.

194
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,839
Chen Jiajun.

195
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll give you three seconds.

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
Get up from me at once.

197
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,839
Three.

198
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,640
Two.

199
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,319
What if I refuse?

200
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:42,959
Miss.

201
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,360
Do you need help?

202
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:46,799
I'm not...

203
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,919
I'm not a bad guy.

204
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,559
I knew that this was not for me.

205
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,480
Thank you.

206
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:05,880
He's still as cute as ever.

207
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,799
Cao Mu.

208
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,880
Forget it.

209
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,760
Forget about him.

210
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,040
It was so embarrassing.

211
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,599
I rented this suit for nothing.

212
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,719
I shouldn't have listened to Xin Qi.

213
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,640
"The domineering CEO
falls in love with me."

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,400
This is such a bad idea.

215
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
I wonder how it is going for him.

216
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:43,880
Use your legs.

217
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,959
Kick.

218
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,040
Quanquan.

219
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,520
Go and ask Min Hui

220
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,160
to swim with us.

221
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,319
Go now.

222
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,240
Min Hui.

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,839
Come into the water to play with us.

224
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,439
You have Xin Qi, right?

225
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,839
It looks like both of you
are having fun.

226
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,839
Quanquan, look at that man
swimming over there.

227
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,280
He swims like a professional, right?

228
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,799
Xin Qi.

229
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,040
Min Hui keeps looking at that man.

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,040
Anyway, the goal

231
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
is to show Ms. Min Hui

232
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,799
your charm as a mature man.

233
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll show her that I can
swim better than him.

234
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,240
Do your best.

235
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,959
Don't worry. I will.

236
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,120
All the best, Xin Qi!

237
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,839
So childish.

238
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,319
Come on.

239
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,599
Hurry up.

240
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,280
All the best, Xin Qi!

241
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,160
Come on.

242
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:31,679
Xin Qi.

243
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,439
Xin Qi.

244
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
Are you okay?

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,280
Xin Qi.

246
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,319
Are you okay?

247
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,559
Does it hurt?

248
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm fine.

249
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm fine.

250
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
Don't worry about me.

251
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Xin Qi.

252
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,919
We are adults.

253
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,760
Before you do something,

254
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
can you think about
the consequences first?

255
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
Can you not be so childish?

256
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,199
What if something happens to you?

257
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,839
What about Quanquan?

258
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,799
I'm really fine.

259
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,959
Listen to it if you don't believe me.

260
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Why is it beating so loudly?

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,839
Are you sure you are feeling well?

262
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,120
It's not beating fast
because I swam too fast.

263
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,280
It's because of you.

264
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,719
Don't you know
that your heart beats fast

265
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,960
when you like someone?

266
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,160
♪Befall us like a heavy downpour♪

267
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,400
Listen to it if you don't believe me.

268
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,670
♪My heart is gone♪

269
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,520
It's beating even fast now, right?

270
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,599
Indeed.

271
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,199
But why is it beating so loudly?

272
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
It's indeed quite loud.

273
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,670
♪Bring us back together?♪

274
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,880
Beautiful ladies,
are you done watching them?

275
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,599
Please continue.

277
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,360
That heartbeat is my phone's ringtone.

278
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,120
Please continue.

279
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,640
What's the rush?
I still want to watch them.

280
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's go.

281
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,559
Look at how good she is at flirting.

282
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,319
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,480
You should learn from her.

284
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,919
Please continue.

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,919
It's not like that.

286
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,040
Why are you inside the house?

287
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
You've taken Quanquan home.

288
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,280
You should go back to your house now.

289
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,280
Maybe I swam too fast just now.

290
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,360
I feel a little bit dizzy.

291
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,240
Let me sleep for a while.

292
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,839
Just for a while.

293
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Thank you.

294
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,360
Why do you have to take the medicine?

295
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,799
Because I'm the same as you.

296
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,959
I have the heart of Iron Man too.

297
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
I need to replenish my energy.

298
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,559
Daddy Zhou told me

299
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,799
that my heart disease is genetic.

300
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,120
Did I get it from you?

301
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,199
I'm sorry, Quanquan.

302
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,079
You don't have to apologize to me.

303
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,480
Min Hui said

304
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
that only me

305
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,839
and my father will have this disease.

306
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,399
It's the most unique marking between us.

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,760
Quanquan.

308
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,920
Quanquan, come over here.

309
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,960
Slow down.

310
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,599
Pull it harder.

311
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,359
Can you do it?

312
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,000
It won't budge.

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll hold this part for you.

314
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,000
Try pulling it up first.
Then, pull it down again.

315
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,920
It won't budge.

316
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,720
I still can't pull it down.

317
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,359
How can it be?

318
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,280
Do you need my help?

319
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,240
No.

320
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Yes.

321
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
Quanquan.

322
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,399
I'll come in then.

323
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,399
Quick. Pull it up.

324
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,280
What's wrong?

325
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,760
Her zip is stuck.

326
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm fine.

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,440
Come. Let me try.

328
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,399
It's okay. I don't need your help.

329
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,040
Come on.

330
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,639
She needs your help.

331
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,839
It's stuck.

332
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,119
It's improper to look. Turn around.

333
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,079
You can get changed now.

334
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Let's go.

335
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,760
Daddy, my shoes!

336
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
For the joint R&D

337
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,079
that we talked about last time,

338
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,359
I've sent the proposal
to you and He Haixiang's inbox.

339
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,680
It looks fine to me.

340
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,720
But I have to send it to our legal team

341
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
to make some adjustments
before I can send it back to you.

342
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
After all, the interest
of the company comes first.

343
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,639
Understood.

344
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Look at this.

345
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
What is this?

346
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,960
My friend has created a dating website.

347
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
And all the premium members are there.

348
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,680
Are you going on a blind date?

349
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,920
Not me. Us.

350
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,440
Why are you shocked?

351
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
We don't have anything to do anyway.

352
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,639
Most importantly,

353
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,359
according to my friend,

354
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,920
the competition is tough
for this kind of website.

355
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,559
He wants to keep his users there.

356
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,480
So, we need to find someone
to go on a date with.

357
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,879
So, it's matchmaking.

358
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,119
It's not.

359
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,159
Are you single?

360
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:23,599
Yes.

361
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,680
Am I single?

362
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,639
It's on then.

363
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:26,280
If we find someone suitable,

364
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,639
we can even get
into a relationship, right?

365
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,240
It's not matchmaking.

366
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,760
I'll pass.

367
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
It's too late.
I've already signed us up.

368
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,000
Cao Mu.

369
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm sorry, my beloved friend.

370
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,799
Give them a chance

371
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,119
and give yourself a chance too.

372
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,879
I'm not asking you

373
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:44,559
to get married at once.

374
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,280
What are you afraid of?

375
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,000
Even if you can't find
a suitable man for you,

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,359
you won't lose anything.

377
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,520
Look at this one.

378
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,350
- 190cm!
- 190cm.

379
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,000
He's 190cm tall.
He's a little bit too tall.

380
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,319
Let's look at the next one.

381
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:59,280
I totally embarrassed myself
in front of Cao Mu.

382
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,119
Now, it's less likely
that she'll forgive me.

383
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,319
Your trick didn't work either.

384
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,720
Min Hui didn't even look at me

385
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,599
no matter how hard I swam.

386
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,480
If only she is as vain

387
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,839
as Cao Mu.

388
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,079
Cao Mu is not a vain person.

389
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,319
She just pays more attention
to physical attributes.

390
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,000
Unlike Min Hui.

391
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,599
She's like a tomboy,
rough around the edges.

392
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,319
Min Hui is not a tomboy.

393
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,040
You just haven't seen the side of her
which is gentle and cute.

394
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,359
You criticized Cao Mu
for being vain first.

395
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,000
It doesn't mean
that you can criticize Min Hui.

396
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,680
We are both suffering.

397
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,559
Xin Qi.

398
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,280
I have another trick for you.

399
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,960
Stop.

400
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,720
I don't want to hear anything

401
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
from Cao Mu again.

402
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
It is not what Cao Mu said.

403
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
It's a trick
that I've come up with myself.

404
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,440
This time,

405
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,119
to win her over, you have to get
into a favorable position first.

406
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,118
(Get into a Favorable Position)

407
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,359
Min Hui doesn't even allow me
to enter her house.

408
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,200
How can I stay there?

409
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,319
You have an inside agent, right?

410
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,720
Even if Ms. Min Hui
doesn't allow you to enter,

411
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,280
Quanquan can let you in.

412
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,359
Then, you just have to insist
on living with them.

413
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:20,920
Ms. Min Hui

414
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,480
can't really chase you out, right?

415
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,599
That way, you can see her every day.

416
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,040
And you'll have more chances
to win her over.

417
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,359
Unlike me and Cao Mu.

418
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:29,879
It's hopeless.

419
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,159
No.

420
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,920
I had lost too much pride
when I clung on to her

421
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,159
like a leech as per Hardy's advice.

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,599
Now, you want me to shamelessly
force my way into her house.

423
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,399
I'll trust you one last time.

424
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,159
No problem.

425
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm sure it'll work.

426
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,599
Cheers.

427
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Why are you so late?

428
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,480
Why are you there again?

429
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,879
Because from today onwards,

430
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,879
this will be my house too.

431
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,720
What are you saying?

432
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,359
I'm saying that I'm going to move in.

433
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,359
Say that again.

434
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,079
I'm going to move in.

435
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,920
You want to move in?

436
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,960
Calm down.

437
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,319
You...

438
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,559
Calm down!

439
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,839
Min Quanquan.

440
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,839
How many times have I told you?

441
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:56,319
When I'm not at home,

442
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,159
you can't open the door to anyone.

443
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,319
Don't you know that by doing so,

444
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,960
you'll let the wolf in?

445
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,960
Xin Qi is a person, not a wolf.

446
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,240
Did you wake me up

447
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,799
to ask me something so ridiculous?

448
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,159
The teacher

449
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,440
tells us

450
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,079
that if we don't sleep well,
we can't grow up.

451
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,399
If that happens, I won't be able

452
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,240
to carry you out to go under the sun
when you get old.

453
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,920
Be serious.

454
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,000
For Quanquan's sake,

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
I won't sue you today

456
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,839
for breaking into my house.

457
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:28,760
But if there's a next time,

458
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,920
I won't let you off the hook so easily.

459
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
The water pipe in my house has burst.

460
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,119
The floor is totally soaked.

461
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,399
I don't have a place to stay.

462
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,040
Really?

463
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
I'll verify it now.

464
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
I've prepared for that.

465
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,559
(Ms. Min Hui, how can I help you?)

466
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,639
Hardy.

467
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,639
Is it true that Xin Qi's house
is flooded?

468
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,040
Yes.

469
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,680
(The bathroom and kitchen
are full of water.)

470
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,000
(The water pipe has burst.)

471
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
(The house is inhabitable now.)

472
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,040
Really?

473
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,200
Let me video call you then.

474
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
(Video call?)

475
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,879
You don't dare to do that, right?

476
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,280
No.

477
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,119
I don't think

478
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,760
you need to video call him.

479
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,760
(Ms. Min Hui.)

480
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,119
(Look. I'm even wearing boots.)

481
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,200
(Look.)

482
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,600
(The place is completely flooded.)

483
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,680
(It's inhabitable.)

484
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,200
(Can you see it?)

485
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,119
(I just spoke
to the furnishing company.)

486
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,079
(They told me that it'll take)

487
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,440
(more than a month to fix the flooring.)

488
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,119
(More than a month won't be enough.)

489
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,240
(It'll take at least half a year.)

490
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Okay then.

491
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,319
Luckily, I'm well-prepared.

492
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,839
See? I didn't lie to you.

493
00:24:58,639 --> 00:24:59,639
But

494
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,280
it doesn't matter that your water pipe
has burst and your house is inhabitable.

495
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,839
We can't let you stay with us.

496
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,559
You should leave now.

497
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,680
It's time for Quanquan and I to sleep.

498
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
I want to live together with Daddy.

499
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,480
A child without a father
is like an unwanted toy.

500
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,079
Min Quanquan.

501
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,079
If you want to act pitiful next time,

502
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,399
it's better if you can
squeeze out some tears.

503
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,280
Otherwise,
it won't be convincing enough.

504
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,839
A child with divorced parents
is so pitiful.

505
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,559
A child without a father
is like an unwanted toy.

506
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,440
A father without a child
is like an unwanted toy too.

507
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,119
How can you separate us

508
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,760
from each other?

509
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,760
Xin Qi, you are an adult.

510
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,119
I'm sure you know

511
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,599
why it's like this between us, right?

512
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,480
What are you doing now?

513
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,000
I understand what you are trying to say.

514
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,040
But everyone makes mistakes.

515
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,639
And everyone deserves a chance
to fix their mistakes.

516
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,720
But when I made
a mistake five years ago,

517
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,000
you didn't give me a chance
to fix my mistake.

518
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,520
(Then, you just have to insist
on living with them.)

519
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,559
(Ms. Min Hui can't really
chase you out, right?)

520
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,760
(That way, you can see her every day.)

521
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,559
(And you'll have more chances
to win her over.)

522
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,159
I know. I was wrong. It was my fault.

523
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,079
So, I'm surrendering myself to you now.

524
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,680
You can torture me

525
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
however you want after this, okay?

526
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
You are not going to leave, right?

527
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes.

528
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,480
Are you sure?

529
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,480
Yes.

530
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:37,200
Quanquan, you can sleep with him today.

531
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
I'm leaving.

532
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,359
Where are you going?

533
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,040
Aren't you going to go after her?

534
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
No.

535
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,559
Why?

536
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
What if she's trying to lure me out?

537
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,359
What does it mean?

538
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,520
It means that she may be

539
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:57,920
trying to make me go out

540
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
to go after her.

541
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,359
Then, she'll suddenly come back
and close the door.

542
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:02,440
And I'll be locked outside.

543
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
You.

544
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,599
If I have to worry about you further,

545
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,359
I'm going to become old.

546
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,440
Let me ask this old man then.

547
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:13,720
Where do you think Min Hui will go?

548
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,399
She can either stay outside,

549
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
go to my godmother's house

550
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
or stay in Daddy Zhou's house.

551
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,639
Daddy Zhou's house?

552
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,359
How can she go to Daddy Zhou's house?

553
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,559
Daddy Zhou is her best friend.

554
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,839
It's normal to go to his house.

555
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,040
Come here.

556
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,639
Play by yourself for a while.

557
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,319
He's not at home.

558
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,720
Looks like Min Hui is not here.

559
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,839
Why are you here?

560
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,000
Is there anything you need?

561
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Yes.

562
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
What is it?

563
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,680
It's personal.

564
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,319
Let's talk inside.

565
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,639
I can't let you in now.

566
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,960
We can just talk outside.

567
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,799
There's no privacy out here.

568
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,440
Let's talk inside.

569
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,559
We can talk tomorrow then.

570
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,200
Don't you want to know
about Min Hui's secret?

571
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,760
No.

572
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,359
If it's Min Hui's secret,

573
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,440
I want to hear it from her personally.

574
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,680
I don't want to find out
about her secret

575
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
from another person.

576
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,319
Bye.

577
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,720
I'm not done yet.

578
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,440
Why are you wearing such sexy pajamas?

579
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
You are acting so strange.

580
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,960
I'm sure you are hiding something.

581
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,280
If Xin Qi sees this,

582
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
he's going to laugh at me.

583
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,780
(Dr. Zhou, do you like
my special gift for you?)

584
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,900
(Let me tell you. It's a limited
edition. It's customized for you.)

585
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,440
(Do your best every day.)

586
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,280
(Do your best every day.)

587
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,079
Let me ask you.

588
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,839
Are you sure that you don't want

589
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,280
to get back together with him?

590
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,040
I...

591
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,639
Be truthful. Don't lie.

592
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,879
Do you know?

593
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,760
Our relationship

594
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
is like a huge tree.

595
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,159
But there's a small worm

596
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,920
inside the tree.

597
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,200
You can ignore that worm.

598
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,760
But this worm

599
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,079
will eventually

600
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,559
hollow out the huge tree.

601
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,520
And one day,

602
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,639
that tree will suddenly snap and fall.

603
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,200
That's it?

604
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,240
That's it.

605
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,399
It's the same between
me and Chen Jiajun.

606
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,680
It's like fireworks between us.

607
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
Fireworks can warm the heart.

608
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,359
But fireworks can burn you too.

609
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,200
Most importantly,

610
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,079
he doesn't know how to make it up to me.

611
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,280
I'm furious.

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,639
Xin Qi doesn't know
how to make it up to me too.

613
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,079
If only love

614
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,159
is as easy as coding.

615
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,000
I just need to write a computer program

616
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
and everything will progress

617
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,720
according to it.

618
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,240
That's right.

619
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,760
I still have some work to do.

620
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,399
Are you for real?

621
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,559
You are such a party pooper.

622
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,200
How can you start working now?

623
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,839
The only way to get rid of my sorrow

624
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,559
is to put myself to work.

625
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,040
When I work,

626
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,960
I'll forget about everything.

627
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,280
I won't even know who he is.

628
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,480
Such cruelty towards me.

629
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,399
I finally have some time

630
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,119
to share my sorrow with you.

631
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,200
But you want to work right now?

632
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,040
Do you have a better solution?

633
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,599
Going on a blind date.

634
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,760
The best way to move on
from a relationship

635
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,399
is to start a new relationship.

636
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,480
Last time, I told you

637
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,879
about my friend's dating website.

638
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:09,680
No.

639
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,040
It'll be like using them.

640
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,079
That's not good.

641
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,040
So,

642
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,799
what do you want?

643
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,200
What do you want?

644
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,280
Are you just going to let that man

645
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,559
slowly break down the walls
around your heart

646
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,680
until you are so deeply in love with him

647
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,200
that you'll just give yourself to him?

648
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,159
I can't let that happen.

649
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,240
So, you have to listen to me.

650
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
Here, take this.

651
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
Go or not to go.

652
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,920
That's the question.

653
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,359
Bottom up.

654
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,620
(Be Agile Medi Tech)

655
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:50,680
Good morning, Ms. Min Hui.

656
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,839
Ms. Min Hui.

657
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,480
Quanquan kept looking
for you last night.

658
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,799
Where did you go?
You didn't even answer my calls.

659
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,280
I didn't go anywhere.

660
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,119
I can see that.

661
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,599
You didn't even change your clothes.

662
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,879
You were just in the neighborhood.

663
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:22,440
Why didn't you go back to get changed
before coming to work?

664
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,159
Because I was lazy.

665
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,240
Min Hui, you are a lady.

666
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,480
How could you stay
in another man's house?

667
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,879
How is that your business?

668
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:34,760
How is it not?

669
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,200
I am your child's father.

670
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,520
You are my child's father,
not my father.

671
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,680
Even if you are my father,
I'm all grown up now.

672
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,520
There's nothing that you can do.

673
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,319
So what if you are all grown up?

674
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,960
There are still things
that you can't do.

675
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,799
You are so annoying.

676
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,960
Leave now. I have to work.

677
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,559
Do you hear me? Next time...

678
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,079
Mr. Xin.

679
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,639
You are here so early.

680
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,480
Are you here to do an inspection?

681
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,040
You left your phone at my house.

682
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,440
No wonder.
I was looking all over for it.

683
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,680
She stayed with you last night?

684
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
Where else?

685
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,960
Her house was occupied by someone else.

686
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,119
So, I had to take her in.

687
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't worry about him.

688
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,839
I'll leave you to it then.

689
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,760
I have to go to work now.

690
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,240
I'm sorry.

691
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,200
I misunderstood you.

692
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,480
If you don't

693
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,879
move out today,

694
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,480
it won't be just a misunderstanding.

695
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't do that.

696
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,319
I've made myself clear.

697
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,119
I won't stay there
as long as you are there.

698
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,280
Make your own choice.

699
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,799
I have to work now.

700
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,480
Fine. I'll leave.

701
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,000
I heard that during the AI summit,

702
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Mr. Xin personally admitted

703
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
that he is the father
of Ms. Min's child.

704
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,359
And the two of them
have never gotten married before.

705
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,159
Now, they are together so frequently.

706
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,280
What kind of relationship are they in?

707
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,359
I think they were
in a relationship before.

708
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,000
But Mr. Xin refused to marry her.

709
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,119
So, Ms. Min wanted to force his hand
in marriage by getting pregnant.

710
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,679
But her plan failed.

711
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,880
So, she could only give birth
to the child by herself.

712
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,400
What kind of old-fashioned
mindset is that?

713
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,880
Maybe Ms. Min

714
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,119
broke up with Mr. Xin

715
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,639
after giving birth.

716
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,360
Let me tell you.

717
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,880
A lot of women now

718
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,880
just want the children, not the men.

719
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,160
I'm in the middle of courting Ms. Min.

720
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:29,920
Mr. Xin.

721
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,520
- Mr. Xin.
- Mr. Xin. We...

722
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,719
I'm trying to court Ms. Min now.

723
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,360
Please help me out after this.

724
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,440
- No problem.
- No problem.

725
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,150
- Just let us know if you need anything.
- No problem.

726
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,119
Respect.

727
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,960
Respect.

728
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,400
Ms. Min.

729
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,860
Get back to work.

730
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,079
Mr. Xin.

731
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,360
A gentleman shouldn't exploit others
for his personal gain.

732
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,559
It's better for you to stop
this pointless act at once.

733
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,199
We'll see if it's pointless or not.

734
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,679
We have ample time ahead.

735
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,800
Mr. Xin, I'm sorry.

736
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,360
I don't think you have much time.

737
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,840
I'm signing her up for blind dates.

738
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,400
I haven't said yes, right?

739
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,239
You want to solve
this issue swiftly, right?

740
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,599
That's right.

741
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,599
You can't deceive me
with this kind of lie.

742
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,880
I know you well.

743
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,719
I'm leaving.

744
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,520
He...

745
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,239
He's so arrogant.

746
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,320
Cao Mu.

747
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,719
I want to go on a blind date.

748
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,159
Really?

749
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:30,719
Yes.

750
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,360
Okay. I'll find someone for you.

751
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,800
What kind of a man do you want?

752
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,119
Someone younger than me by six years,
who's young and can swim.

753
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,599
Come in.

754
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,639
Ms. Cao.

755
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,920
Ms. Min.

756
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,679
This is my job transfer
application form.

757
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,920
I need you to sign it for me.

758
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,040
No problem.

759
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,800
Let's work hard together after this.

760
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,759
All the best.

761
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll do my best.

762
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,840
If you wanted to help her,

763
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,719
why didn't you transfer her
here earlier?

764
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,520
If I just transferred her here
before this,

765
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,679
I would be helping her
to fight against Ding Yifeng.

766
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,719
But now,

767
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,360
she's fighting against
Ding Yifeng herself.

768
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,559
It's different.

769
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,000
Ms. Min,

770
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,440
you are teaching her
how to protect herself.

771
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,360
Yes. No one can protect her forever,

772
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,200
except herself.

773
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,590
(Jiaren Hospital)

774
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,159
Ms. Yao, you are a regular
in our hospital now.

775
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,320
How is it with you and Dr. Zhou?

776
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
Do you need my help?

777
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,119
It's okay.

778
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:35,079
This is probably
my last time here today.

779
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,239
Are you going to give up?

780
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,040
Why?

781
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
Dr. Yang.

782
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
When you love someone,

783
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,119
you want the best for him, right?

784
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,559
So?

785
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,279
What has it got to do with you?

786
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,440
It's a secret.

787
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,880
(Jiaren Hospital)
Dr. Zhou.

788
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,239
Please lend me your phone.

789
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,480
My phone is out of battery.

790
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,679
I want to order a food delivery.

791
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,639
Here you go.

792
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,000
Thank you.

793
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,000
I need to talk to you.

794
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,119
The patient on bed 25.

795
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,440
He has been emotionally unstable lately.

796
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,040
(Are you free this Saturday at 6 p.m.?)
What's wrong?

797
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,060
(Are you free this Saturday at 6 p.m.?)

798
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,360
Zhou Ruji? What does he want?

799
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,880
Are you free this Saturday at 6pm?
Let's have dinner together.

800
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,360
Ms. Min, you are so busy.

801
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,159
I'll get back to work too.

802
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,759
Bye.

803
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,320
Bye.

804
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,220
(Are you free this Saturday at 6 p.m.?)

805
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,260
(Sure.)

806
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,020
(Delete)

807
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,960
This is still fine.

808
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,679
Just give him the usual medication
and keep an eye on him.

809
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,320
Here you go.

810
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,119
Let's have dinner together
this Saturday at 6pm.

811
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,599
This Saturday?

812
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,040
It's your rest day. You can't say no.

813
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I've already booked the place.

814
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,679
Okay.

815
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,159
I'll get going now.

816
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,599
That's it?

817
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,960
No.

818
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,159
Something is wrong.

819
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,920
What is it?

820
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,559
There's something wrong with Yao Zizhu.

821
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,159
You should

822
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,239
cut it out too.

823
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,679
Don't play hard to get.

824
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,199
She's a young lady.

825
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,360
It's tiring to court you.

826
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
If she gives up in the end,

827
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
you'll regret it.

828
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,520
I'm not playing hard to get.

829
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,400
Anyway,

830
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,320
don't overdo it.

831
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,679
Otherwise, it'll be such a pity

832
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,320
if you lose this lovely lady.

833
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,440
I'll get going now.

834
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Am I playing hard to get?

835
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,159
I'm not.

836
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,079
Xin Qi.

837
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,759
Do you have a plan?

838
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,000
Look.

839
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,719
You are so rich.

840
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,320
But Ms. Min Hui doesn't care at all.

841
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,159
I'm so handsome.

842
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,440
But Cao Mu doesn't care at all too.

843
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,079
So, the hardest women to court

844
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,279
are those who have no care for money
and physical attributes.

845
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,800
You said something wrong.

846
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,759
"You are so rich."

847
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,159
That's a wrong statement.

848
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,000
How is it wrong?

849
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,239
You are saying as if I'm just rich.

850
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,599
Not only I'm rich,
I'm handsome too.

851
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,679
Moreover, I'm talented and loving, okay?

852
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,239
Fine.

853
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,920
No wonder.

854
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,040
What do you mean?

855
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,719
No wonder Ms. Min Hui
doesn't want to be with you.

856
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,040
She likes to keep a low profile.

857
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,159
I don't think she'll like someone

858
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,199
who's as narcissistic as you.

859
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,840
Are you on her side or mine?

860
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,119
Min Hui.

861
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,800
(Xin Qi.)

862
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,320
(Xin Qi.)

863
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,119
Quanquan.

864
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,759
(Do you miss me?)

865
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,759
Yes.

866
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:18,520
But I have something
more important to tell you.

867
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:19,480
What is it?

868
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,000
Something is wrong with the two of them.

869
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,719
