=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 28=

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,140
(Jiaren Hospital)

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,649
The doctor is still examining him.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,929
But he has regained consciousness.

28
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,489
Rest assured, President.

29
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,369
I'll be sure to report back to you

30
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:47,730
as soon as I receive any updates.

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,009
How is he?

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,690
Go inside and see him.

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,050
Wait.

34
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,330
I must've given you a fright.

35
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,249
Does it hurt anywhere?

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,570
I probably overexerted myself.

37
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,130
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

38
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,369
What...

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,570
What did you mean to ask me?

40
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,649
Nothing.

41
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,890
Bad timing.

42
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,089
Go ahead.

43
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,809
You might just get the answer you want

44
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,369
as I'm in a good mood.

45
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,050
I don't remember the question.

46
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,410
You guys go ahead.

47
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,330
Mr. Xin.

48
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,649
You guys decided on everything?

49
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,770
Give me another day.

50
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,489
Okay.

51
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,700
(Jiaren Hospital)

52
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,009
Is it bad?

53
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,449
I've known him for so long.

54
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,210
There's no way I can't tell.

55
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:56,050
It might be complications

56
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,410
due to him overexerting himself lately.

57
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:58,929
Mr. Yao warned him

58
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,410
during his previous checkup.

59
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,489
But things weren't that bad
at that time.

60
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,329
So...

61
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,170
How bad is it now?

62
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,369
He needs to undergo the operation
as soon as possible.

63
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,610
Otherwise, what happened today

64
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,970
could happen again anytime.

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,050
It might even...

66
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,449
It might even endanger his life, right?

67
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,170
We would need time
to study his medical record

68
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,249
and formulate a surgery plan,

69
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,770
if he chooses to
undergo surgery domestically.

70
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,329
So my recommendation is
for him to go abroad

71
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,929
and get his previous chief surgeon

72
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,050
to perform the surgery.

73
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,650
That's the optimal solution.

74
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,249
Then...

75
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,809
What are his chances?

76
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,530
Every surgery has its risks.

77
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,650
Especially one that involves the heart.

78
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,650
Thanks.

79
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:39,009
Xin Qi...

80
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,770
You're up.

81
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,650
What's the meaning of this?

82
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,770
I'm fine.

83
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,090
Mr. Yao says I'm good to leave now.

84
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,249
You can ask Zhou Ruji
if you don't believe me.

85
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:57,689
I believe you.

86
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,129
Let's go home, then.

87
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,090
But Hardy called.

88
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,889
He said something happened
at the company.

89
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,249
I need to go back
to the HQ overseas tomorrow.

90
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:17,809
It's all right.

91
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,050
You do what you have to do.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,369
Quanquan and I will be here for you.

93
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,050
We still have a day to ourselves.

94
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,009
Okay.

95
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,449
When I was still a student,

96
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,770
I thought to myself,

97
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,090
that when I get a boyfriend,

98
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,090
I have to watch the sunrise and sunset

99
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,009
with him at least once in my lifetime.

100
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,970
I wonder if we'll get to see it today.

101
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,090
It doesn't matter, even if we don't.

102
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,850
We still have the future ahead of us.

103
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,650
Min Hui,

104
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,569
I promise you

105
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,569
that I will come back in perfect health

106
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,489
and watch every sunrise
and sunset with you.

107
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,050
I have another thing I want to do.

108
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,770
Do it with me.

109
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,209
What is it?

110
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,689
A secret.

111
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,130
Okay.

112
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,050
Here. Be careful.

113
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,530
No.

114
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,089
You said it's a two-person game.

115
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,170
This is complicated.

116
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,650
Be patient.

117
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,209
You'll find out in a bit.

118
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,170
Easy there.

119
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,089
Stand.

120
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:27,770
Stand here.

121
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:28,890
Wait here.

122
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,609
Count to five

123
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,329
and open your eyes.

124
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,050
Okay?

125
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,170
Okay.

126
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,490
Remember. Five.

127
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,010
Got it.

128
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,929
Five.

129
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:42,770
Four.

130
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,569
Three.

131
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:48,569
Two.

132
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,770
One.

133
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,569
I'm removing the blindfold.

134
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,209
(Xin Qi,)

135
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,650
(I know)

136
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,770
(something's wrong with your body.)

137
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,609
(You're not going overseas)

138
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:07,170
(because of work,)

139
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,089
(but for surgery, aren't you?)

140
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,290
(You didn't tell me)

141
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,170
(because you didn't want me to worry.)

142
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,849
(But aren't you silly?)

143
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,650
(Of course, I would worry.)

144
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,250
(But)

145
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:20,209
(I have faith in you.)

146
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,650
(You promised Quanquan and me)

147
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,209
(that you would always be with us.)

148
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,969
(You've always been a man of your word,)

149
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:27,650
(right?)

150
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,809
(You told me)

151
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,890
(it was bad timing.)

152
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,809
(I used to think so too.)

153
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,010
(But now,)

154
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,490
(I don't think timing)

155
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,010
(matters.)

156
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,370
(Because)

157
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,170
(whether it's five years ago)

158
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,209
(or now,)

159
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,490
(you're the only one I want to marry.)

(Xin Qi,)

161
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,050
(if you feel the same,)

162
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,050

if you won't

175
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,170
ask that question,

176
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,969
I will.

177
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,650

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,290
I know.

179
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,569
You're worried you won't come back

180

when you leave for surgery.

181
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,490
You don't want to drag me down.

182
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,170
But, Xin Qi,

183
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,449
shouldn't I decide

184
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,010
what I want in my life?

185
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,329
I don't know what the future holds.

186
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,929
But at least

187
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,849
at this very moment,

188
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,729
you're the one I want
to spend the rest of my life with.

189
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,329
We've already wasted so much time.

190
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,449

to my Daddy and Mommy's wedding.

415
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,730
Aunt Cindy couldn't come,

416
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,849
but she told me

417
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:19,849
that I'm the luckiest child,

418
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:21,889
because not every kid

419
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,409
gets to attend

420
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,930
their parents' wedding.

421
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:29,569
So I wish my parents

422
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,409
a happy and blessed marriage.

423
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,290
Get me a little sister soon.

424
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,409
Who told him that?

425
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,490
Xin Qi,

426
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:45,169
will you take Min Hui

427
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,290

I heard from the townsfolk

491
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,770
that every 7th of July,

492
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,290
they write their wishes down

493
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,930
and hang them on this tree,

494
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,250
waiting for their love
to come and grant their wishes.

495
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,010
Really?

496
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,250
Don't tell me you wrote one too.

497
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,730
Of course.

498
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,490
See if you can find mine.

499
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,129
Let's see.

500
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,010
I want my beloved one
to give me a kiss.

501
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,450
Xin?

502
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,809
I found it on my first try?

503
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,250
Did you write this?

504
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,050
You picked it yourself.

505
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,530
Right?

506
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,089
I'm amazing.

507
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,410

508
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:14,850
another one?

509
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,649
Another one?

510
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,480
I want my beloved one...

511
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,370
This is a bit too much.

512
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,569
Every one of them?

513
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,810
You've gone too far.

514
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,010
I have a lot of wishes.

515
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,810
No more kisses for you.

516
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,490
This is cheating.

517
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,050
Okay, okay. How about this?

518
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,289
I'll pick one, then.

519
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,169
Not from this side.

520
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,129
Okay, okay.

521
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:47,930
Let me see.

522
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:50,649
I'll pick one.

523
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,769
Randomly.

524
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:55,890
Eyes closed.

525
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,970
It's still yours?

526
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,729
No. Look.

527
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,410
I want my beloved one to give me a kiss.

528
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,089
Isn't that still...

529
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:07,050
Min.

530
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,169
When did I write one?

531
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:11,010
Doesn't matter.

532
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,569
Cheater.

533
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,450
Then.

534
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:20,769
Do you know

535
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,729
what my greatest wish is?

536
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,249
Three kisses.

537
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,810
No.

538
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,890
I want to see
all the sights in the world

539
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,569
with you.

540
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay.

541
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:46,209
I promise you we will.

542
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,700
(Two years later)

543
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,169
Quanquan,

544
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,330
this is where your mother and I met.

545
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,450
Isn't it beautiful?

546
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:19,930
It is.

547
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,850
But not as beautiful
as my little sister.

548
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,050
When I grow up,

549
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,890
I'll buy you the prettiest dresses

550
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:30,089
and lots of dolls.

551
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,169
I'll make you

552
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,129
the happiest princess in the world.

553
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:35,410
Quanquan,

554
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,530
how many times have I told you this?

555
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:38,850
This is your little brother,

556
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,169
not your little sister.

557
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:41,450
Don't get it mixed up.

558
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,530
But I still want a little sister.

559
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,050
Well, you don't have one.

560
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,209
I think our son has a point.

561
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:54,970
Nonsense. Don't be ridiculous.

562
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,850
Why don't we try for another?

563
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,810
Don't...

564
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,050
No.

565
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:02,530
Look at how sad he is.

566

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,490
When did I say that?

570
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,689
It's okay. I'll work harder.

in front of the kid!
