(Yitang Serviced Apartment)

26
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,480
Did I...

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,599
Did I do that to you?

28
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,840
Your laptop is quite expensive, right?

29
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,120
This is your laptop.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
My laptop is quite expensive.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
And I have so many
important documents inside.

32
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,319
What if you broke it?

33
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,439
How do you know the password
to my laptop?

34
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,200
It's Quanquan's birth date.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,599
It's an easy guess.

36
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,240
No.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
Still, you can't just look
at the content

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,919
on my laptop without my permission.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Isn't that for me to look at?

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes. It's for you.

41
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,560
No.

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
But you can't...

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Did you do the risk assessment?

44
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,560
Although you've made the adjustments

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
for the first phase of panel work,

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
based on your schedule,

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
there's no room for any delays.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
There is.

49
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,879
I put a week of time for any delays

50
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,560
after every phase.

51
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,639
A week.

52
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,520
Are you sure it's enough?

53
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,120
If there's a problem

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,439
that can't be solved within a week,

55
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm more than 80% sure

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,199
that there's
an underlying problem with it.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I won't allow myself

58
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,879
to make such a mistake.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,759
I'll ask Hardy

60
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,639
to send you the investment contract
tomorrow morning.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
I'll give you six more months

62
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,560
for the development life cycle.

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
The contract?

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,560
We have the proposal meeting
to go through first, right?

65
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,759
We can have that meeting if you want.

66
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,719
It's okay. We don't have to do that.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,560
We don't have to do that.

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,919
You are such a wise man.

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,039
The best of the best.

70
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,840
You know the ropes. You...

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Stop complimenting me
if you don't know how to do it.

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Okay.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
I thought you liked to be complimented.

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
By the way,

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,560
I don't need more time
for the development cycle.

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,479
I can do it.

77
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,879
I don't want anything to go wrong.

78
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,599
Not with the project.

79
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,199
And not with the developer.

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,240
Thank you.

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,599
I'll go and wash up now.

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
Another thing.

83
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,280
With your level of alcohol tolerance,

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,039
you better stay away
from alcohol after this.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,879
Excuse me, lady.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
You are not allowed to wear heels here.

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
Okay. I'll try it.

88
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,310
Go.

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Coach, I'm so scared.

90
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,199
It's okay.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
(Looks like you are having a good time.)

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,079
Ms. Cao!

93
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,530
Ms. Cao.

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Ms. Cao, don't worry.

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,959
I'm right outside.

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,639
Just tell me when you are done.

97
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,600
Okay.

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,319
I spent two hours doing my make-up

99
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,279
for nothing.

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,780
(Family Changing Room)

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Ms. Cao.

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,079
Why are you smiling?

103
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,600
Do I look funny like this?

104
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
You look good in anything.

105
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,560
Such a sweet talker.

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,879
No wonder you are so popular.

107
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,439
I'm popular because
I'm good at swimming.

108
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Ms. Cao, do you want to learn to swim?

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,399
It was so dangerous just now.

110
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,040
What if something happened to you
if I was not there?

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,839
Me learning how to swim?

112
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,399
I...

113
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,720
Why do I feel

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
like you are good at doing business?

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,439
That's not what I meant.

116
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,600
If you want to learn,
I can teach you for free.

117
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,800
For free?

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Why will you do that?

119
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,639
Think of it as a way for me
to apologize to you.

120
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,399
Are you afraid of me?

121
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,000
I know that I was wrong.

122
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,319
It's only right for you to be mad at me.

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Why did you follow me in secret then?

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,759
I...

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I was afraid that you couldn't
take good care of yourself.

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Besides...

127
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
Besides, I wanted to see you.

128
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,160
Since you said that,

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
let bygone be bygone.

130
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,519
So, are you not mad at me anymore?

131
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,319
Did you come here on purpose

132
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:02,920
to tell me

133
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,839
that you've forgiven me?

134
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,839
I didn't come here on purpose.

135
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,759
I was just passing by.

136
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,079
So, I came in to return
your things to you.

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,600
Wait here. I'll go and get it.

138
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,480
I don't think I left anything behind.

139
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,000
Isn't this yours?

140
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,839
It's mine.

141
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,360
But it's a disposable one.

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
I threw it into the bin after I used it.

143
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,639
I didn't know.

144
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,680
So, you don't want it?

145
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,720
Let me throw it away then.

146
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
I want it.

147
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,560
You came all the way here
to return it to me.

148
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,680
I have to frame it up.

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,319
Just now, you said that you wanted
to teach me swimming.

150
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,959
Did you mean it?

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,800
Of course.

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,959
I'm not good at this.

153
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
There's no one that I can't teach.

154
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm going to take a long time to learn.

155
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,879
You can learn from me
as long as you want.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,040
That's more like it.

157
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,600
Did our company's stocks
go up in price again?

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,279
Says who?

159
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
From your expression,

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,680
it seems like you've taken
a huge advantage of someone.

161
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't take advantage of anyone.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,480
She's the one who took advantage of me.

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
Who is she?

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
It doesn't matter.

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,079
Do you need me to sign that?

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,600
Who took advantage of you?

167
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,620
(Jiaren Hospital)

168
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,879
What is it?
Are you trying to slack off again?

169
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,720
Dr. Zhou Ruji.

170
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,759
Have I offended you in any way?

171
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,919
No.

172
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,200
I'll leave you two to talk then.

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,879
Dr. Yang, be the judge for me.

174
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,519
As a volunteer at Jiaren Hospital,

175
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,960
I want to ask Dr. Zhou for advice

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
on some work matters.

177
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,879
But not only did he not
reply to me on WeChat,

178
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,200
he even blocked me.

179
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,080
Dr. Zhou.

180
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,519
That was wrong of you.

181
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
How could you treat

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,720
our volunteer like that?

183
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,039
If you do this again,

184
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm going to tell Mr. Yao about it.

185
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,039
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,799
I was busy that day.

187
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,000
And I was not in a good mood.

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't know that it was about work.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
I thought that...

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
What did you think?

191
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
No. Do you think

192
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm someone who'll harass you
for no reason?

193
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,360
Moreover,

194
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,240
can't I message you
if it's not about work?

195
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,919
So, was it

196
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,600
about work or not?

197
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,440
I...

198
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,679
It doesn't matter.

199
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,600
Just tell me.

200
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
He was wrong for blocking me, right?

201
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Of course.

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
So, he needs to apologize to me, right?

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Yes.

204
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,399
I'm...

205
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,039
I forgive you.

206
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,559
But

207
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,399
I don't think an oral apology
seems sincere enough.

208
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,559
How about this?

209
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,639
I want to buy a present for my father.

210
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,480
And you spent the most time with him.

211
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
You should come shopping with me
and choose a present for him.

212
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,519
I'm not...

213
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,399
Don't say that you are not free.

214
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,559
I've already checked it.

215
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,000
You have an early shift today.

216
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
You are already off duty
since an hour ago.

217
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes. We are already done
with our rounds today.

218
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,399
Just go with her.

219
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:37,840
I...

220
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,879
Do it for Mr. Yao.

221
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,840
I am not...

222
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,639
Stop making excuses.

223
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,360
Just go.

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Go and get changed.

225
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,799
I'll wait for you.

226
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
What do you think?

227
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm your best wingman.

228
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,240
This is easy.

229
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,639
I'm grateful.

230
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,759
Treat me to a meal next time.

231
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,240
Deal.

232
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,879
I'll get going now.

233
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,799
The amount of investment,
ratio, progress

234
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,879
and gain sharing

235
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,720
are all set based on

236
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,360
the usual standard of the company.

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Blue Jay has even given us
six extra months

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,639
for the software development cycle.

239
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,080
Are you still not satisfied, Mr. He?

240
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,159
I have nothing to complain about.

241
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,279
But I want to ask this.

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Is Xin Qi investing in
Be Agile Medi Tech

243
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,960
or is he investing in you?

244
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,799
Is there a difference?

245
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,159
Of course.

246
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,120
If he's investing in Be Agile Medi Tech,

247
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
I'll gladly accept his offer.

248
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,480
But if he's investing in you...

249
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,480
Min Hui.

250
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,320
I know that you are
a very capable person.

251
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
And you are beautiful.

252
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,720
But I don't think
you know men that well.

253
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
For a man like him,

254
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,919
he doesn't lack women.

255
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,720
I'm afraid that you are just
his latest conquest.

256
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,840
When he loses his interest in you

257
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,960
and withdraws his investment,

258
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,639
you'll be in trouble.

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,559
What is the meaning of this, Mr. He?

260
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,639
Are you implying

261
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,720
that Min Hui got the investment
from Blue Jay

262
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
by seducing Xin Qi?

263
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,720
That's impossible.

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,130
- I am not...
- Mr. He.

265
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,639
What you said just now

266
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,960
was a fallacy of composition.

267
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,240
I can vouch on my honor

268
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,000
that Xin Qi is not someone like that.

269
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,279
At least, he's different from you.

270
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,559
Mr. He.

271
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,519
You are the general manager
of Be Agile Medi Tech.

272
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,320
There are so many eyes on you.

273
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
If you don't keep your words,

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,399
how can others trust you anymore, right?

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,000
Did I say that I wouldn't sign it?

276
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,039
I was just saying it for your own good.

277
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Thank you very much, Mr. He.

278
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,039
Finally, we are done with this contract.

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,919
Now that everything is set,

280
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,519
you can take a rest now.

281
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,559
How can I rest?

282
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,639
I still have a lot of work to do.

283
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,879
No matter how much work you have,

284
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,840
as long as it's not life-threatening,
you can take a rest first.

285
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,600
It has been so long since
you last took Quanquan out.

286
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,399
Yes.

287
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
Now that I think about it,
it has been a long time.

288
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,039
Lately, by the time I finished work,

289
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,240
he's already been asleep.

290
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes.

291
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
If it wasn't for Zhou Ruji,

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,720
you would have been in trouble.

293
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,759
Not him.

294
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
Who else if not him?

295
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,759
Exactly.

296
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,399
You

297
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,720
should give yourself a break today

298
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,279
and take Quanquan out to have fun.

299
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,519
Or else, I'll feel bad for him

300
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,840
as his godmother.

301
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,879
You are right.

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
I'll do as you say.

303
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,399
Do you want to come with us?

304
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,279
I'll pass.

305
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,320
I have a date to go to.

306
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,919
Your face is totally glowing.

307
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
Do you have a hottie again?

308
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Not really.

309
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,240
I have an appointment
with my swimming coach.

310
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,480
He's quite handsome.

311
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,399
So, you are learning how to swim.

312
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
But you...

313
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,840
This is for the best.

314
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,879
So close.

315
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,559
It was indeed unfortunate.

316
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,360
You were so close to defeating me.

317
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,519
But

318
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,320
you've missed your chance.

319
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,879
Good shot, Mr. Xin.

320
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,519
Mr. Xin.

321
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,159
Please excuse me
for this abrupt question.

322
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,559
What is lacking in Guanchao's

323
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,759
cancer screening technology

324
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,039
that causes you not to choose us?

325
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,360
Indeed.

326
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,840
In terms of technical advancement

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,960
and market prospect,

328
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
you have the highest

329
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,519
composite index.

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
But I've found a project

331
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
that fits the vision and future

332
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,879
of Blue Jay better.

333
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,240
Min Hui's
AI cardiac modeling technology

334
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,720
is still in the early stage
of development.

335
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,240
It'll take at least five years until
it can reach the production stage.

336
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
Let alone making money for Blue Jay.

337
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
Mr. Xin, I want to know

338
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,960
exactly your criteria
for choosing a project?

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,879
Or did you choose your project based on

340
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,919
the person behind the project

341
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,320
instead of the project itself?

342
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,759
Ms. Lin.

343
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,159
I'm sure Mr. Xin has his own reasons.

344
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
If you know what he thinks,

345
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,879
you'll be the CEO of Blue Jay instead.

346
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,919
Am I right, Mr. Xin?

347
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
Mr. Cheng.

348
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
If you are unsatisfied

349
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,759
with my decision,

350
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,399
you can just be frank with me.

351
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,279
You don't have to do that
through Ms. Lin.

352
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,879
I invited you here today because

353
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
first,

354
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
I want to inform you about

355
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,200
my decision.

356
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
And second, I want to apologize to you.

357
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,320
Looks like Blue Jay and Guanchao

358
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,120
won't be having the pleasure
of working together.

359
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,840
You are making it sound worse
than it does, Mr. Xin.

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,639
Am I right?

361
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,759
Look.

362
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,600
Even if you are not interested
in our cancer screening,

363
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,039
there are many other projects
in Guanchao

364
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,240
under development.

365
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,960
Actually, we can...

366
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,279
Just now, Ms. Lin asked me

367
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,799
about my criteria
for choosing a project.

368
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,039
I can answer you now.

369
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,679
Besides the project itself,

370
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,480
the most important thing
is the person behind the project.

371
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,360
The purpose of developing medical
technologies is to benefit people.

372
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,240
If the developer

373
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
is someone with bad intentions,

374
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,000
even if he has
the most advanced technology,

375
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,679
it doesn't mean
that people will benefit from it.

376
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,840
Since we don't have the same mindset,

377
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,559
there's no need to force ourselves
to collaborate.

378
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
The last shot was amazing.

379
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:28,919
Mr. Xin.

380
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,960
Guanchao is the leading company in

381
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,919
Binhai medical technology industry.

382
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,919
Even if we don't collaborate with them,

383
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,600
there's no need to offend them.

384
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,639
He is too cunning.

385
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,039
If it wasn't for...

386
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,799
I didn't want to offend him too.

387
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,440
You are right.

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,320
After all, he allowed Lin Xiyue

389
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,919
to pick on Ms. Min Hui maliciously.

390
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
We should teach him a lesson.

391
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,080
Ms. Min Hui?

392
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,919
Was I wrong?

393
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,879
It won't sound nice for me

394
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,399
to call her the boss lady, right?

395
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,200
(Son.)

396
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,359
(I almost got it.)

397
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,279
(Where are you?)

398
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,559
Mummy took me to the amusement park.

399
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
(Look. Mummy is so bad at this.)

400
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,279
(She can't even get one.)

401
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,160
(Min Quanquan, how could you say that?)

402
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
(You couldn't get one too.)

403
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,519
Let me tell you.

404
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,319
I was good at it when I was young.

405
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,559
I don't believe you.

406
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,880
Min Hui said that same thing just now.

407
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,039
Why

408
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,440
can't I get it?

409
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,880
Wait for me. I'll show you
how good I am later.

410
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,440
(Okay. Hurry up.)

411
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,960
(We'll wait for you here.)

412
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,559
Bye.

413
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,079
What do you think? Do I look nice?

414
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,839
Not bad.

415
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,319
(So, Lolita is not his cup of tea too.)

416
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,839
(Do I have)

417
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,039
(no choice but to go for sexy?)

418
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,160
(It's now or never.)

419
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,440
Zizhu.

420
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,519
You've already tried on six dresses.

421
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,680
Aren't we here to buy
a present for Mr. Yao?

422
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,119
Do you know what
my father likes the most?

423
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,079
Archery.

424
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,119
He says that it's good
to help you focus.

425
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,519
Wrong.

426
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,319
Remember this.

427
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,240
I am the one

428
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,359
whom my father likes the most.

429
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,680
So, if I'm happy,

430
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,319
he'll be glad too.

431
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,119
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,279
I lied to you.

433
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,599
I was afraid that you wouldn't
come with me

434
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,880
if I told you the truth.

435
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,240
Since you are here,

436
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,799
do some shopping with me.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,720
It's pitiful to shop alone.

438
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,160
The dress you are holding

439
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
is too sexy.

440
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
And it's the wrong size.

441
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
After you wear it,
you'll have poor blood circulation.

442
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,359
How do you know
that it's a size smaller?

443
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
Do you know what
the three occupations are

444
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,799
that understand the human body best?

445
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,440
Doctor and painter.

446
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,759
What's the other one?

447
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,160
Medical examiner.

448
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,799
What about this one?

449
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,640
I think this one is not bad.

450
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,200
The cutting is too long.
Your legs will look short in it.

451
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,359
We can't have that.

452
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
This is a no.

453
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
This one.

454
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,599
This one looks nice.

455
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,519
The hem of this dress is too tight.

456
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,359
Meanwhile, your stride is longer.

457
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,039
If you wear it, you'll either fall down

458
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,359
or you'll be tired wearing it.

459
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,480
You are good at this.

460
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,240
I was right to bring you along.

461
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Choose one for me.

462
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Do you like it?

463
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,279
Please wait for a while.

464
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,880
Excuse me.

465
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,319
Can you get me the heels in pink

466
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,480
in size 38?

467
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,559
Sure. Please wait.

468
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,319
Thank you.

469
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,759
Please pay over here, Sir.

470
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,400
Okay.

471
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,079
(Size 38.)

472
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,720
(It's for me.)

473
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
It's okay.

474
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,599
If you are busy,

475
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,680
we can come again next time.

476
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,160
Although I still want
to go on the carousel,

477
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,759
the bumper car,

478
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,319
the trampoline

479
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:53,839
and...

480
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,519
Are you acting pitiful again?

481
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,359
Who says I want to leave?

482
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,079
I'm reading

483
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,640
the strategy

484
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,599
on how to conquer the claw machine. See?

485
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,599
Min Hui, if you are so competitive,

486
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,519
men will be afraid of you.

487
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,680
Because they feel inferior to me.

488
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
But not Xin Qi.

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,839
Quanquan.

490
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,519
What did you say
you want to do just now?

491
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,680
The carousel, right?

492
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,000
We'll do that now.

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,799
Okay.

494
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,400
Let's go.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Let's see where it is.

496
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,279
The balloons have flown away.

497
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,079
Do you think you can reach them?

498
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,319
I don't think I can, Quanquan.

499
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,480
But you are a Superwoman, right?

500
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,440
I wanted to bring them back for Xin Qi.

501
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,839
Okay.

502
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,200
I'll give it a try.

503
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
Quanquan, stand back.

504
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,279
Xin Qi, you are amazing!

505
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,559
You sure like to act cool.

506
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,400
I can be even more amazing. Come.

507
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
Looks like

508
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,079
there's something
that the Superwoman can't do.

509
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,359
Do you think being tall is that great?

510
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,920
Let's go and play, okay?

511
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,440
Yes.

512
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,880
Let's go.

513
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Let's go and shoot something first.

514
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,920
You want to shoot something?

515
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,160
Let's see where we can shoot something.

516
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,000
Why did you do that?

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,039
Forget it.

518
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,279
You can't get it.

519
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,000
There's a technique to this.

520
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Don't move.

521
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,559

Are you happy today?

575
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,680
Yes.

576
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,240
You caught so many things for me today.

577
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,519
Here you go.

578
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,440
Thank you.

579
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,160
Here you go.

580
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,519
Thank you, Min Hui.

581
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,680
After today,

582
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,279
I think we'll be blacklisted

583
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,119
by this amusement park.

584
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,200
It's okay.

585
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,720
We can go to another one next time.

586
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,000
Right, son?

587
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,000
Xin Qi.

588
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,880
Can I give these soft toys

589
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,839
to my friends in kindergarten?

590
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,000
Then, I'll tell them

591
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,079
that my father caught these for me.

592
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,599
"My father caught these for me."

593
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,119
Sure.

594
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
Nice!

595
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,599
Min Hui.

596
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,519
I want to look at
the fish and shrimps over there.

597
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,839
Sure. Go ahead.

598
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:50,759
Okay.

599
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,480
Don't fall into the water, Quanquan.

600
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,119
Okay.

601
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
Do you want to eat cotton candy?

602
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,079
No.

603
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm just thinking

604
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,440
that when I was in the orphanage,

605
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,319
one time, the dean

606
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,480
brought us to the amusement park.

607
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,720
We didn't have enough money.

608
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,160
So, we could only buy
two cotton candies.

609
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,319
We had to share them with everyone.

610
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,440
And each of us only got
a small piece of cotton candy.

611
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,880
Back, I hoped

612
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,440
that the machine could keep turning

613
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,079
to make one gigantic cotton candy.

614
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,359
You've given Quanquan
so many gifts today.

615
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,359
How about I give you one in return?

616
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,960
(Ms. Cao, have you reached?)

617
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,980
(Officer Deng)

618
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,640
Hello, Officer Deng.

619
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,039
Any news about that person?

620
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,640
(Not yet.)

621
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,200
(I called to ask you)

622
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,799
if there has been any progress after

623
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,359
staying in Bincheng for so long.

624
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,759
Not yet.

625
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,039
Bincheng is too big.

626
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,640
I don't even know her name.

627
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,559
I don't know where to start looking.

628
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,279
(Contact me
when you've found something.)

629
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,200
Beautiful lady.

630
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,519
Beautiful lady.

631
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,519
Do you want to learn to swim?

632
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,480
You don't have to pay for a coach.

633
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,039
I'll teach you.

634
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I am this lady's swimming coach.

635
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,440
Any problem with that?

636
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,039
Ms. Cao.

637
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,519
Are you going to wear this today

638
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,720
to teach me how to swim?

639
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
This is what I usually wear
in my swimming class.

640
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,279
Do you dislike the color of this shirt?

641
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,960
No. What I mean is,

642
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,759
you...

643
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,319
You...

644
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,680
Are you going to enter
the pool like this?

645
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,119
It's our first class today.

646
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,240
So, it'll be all about breathing today.

647
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,599
I don't have to enter the pool.

648
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,559
Let's skip this lesson and
go straight to the next one.

649
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,759
We can't do that.

650
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,119
Breathing is the most important lesson
when it comes to swimming.

651
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,960
Ms. Cao.

652
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,680
Be patient.
We have to take it one step at a time.

653
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
I already knew how to do that.

654
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,039
I...

655
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,640
What I mean is,

656
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,119
I think I already knew.

657
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,039
It's just breathing, right?

658
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:32,440
Look.

659
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Right? It's simple.

660
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,319
That's different.

661
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,759
Ms. Cao, you are so cute.

662
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,599
Are you saying that I'm cute?

663
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,000
You are like a kid
who needs to be coaxed.

664
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,720
Let's start with breathing today,

665
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,279
okay?

666
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,160
Okay.

667
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,000
Let's go.

668
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,079
Okay. Turn.

669
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,279
Turn it. Turn fast.

670
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,720
Slowly lift it up.

671
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,119
I'll give the first one

672
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,039
to Quanquan.

673
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
Okay.

674
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
Please wait for a while.

675
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,960
I'll get you some sugar crystals
in other colors.

676
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,680
Okay.

677
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,319
- Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you.

678
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,519
Next, let's make a huge one.

679
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,720
Min Hui.

680
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,039
I think this is not fair.

681
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,400
I think it's quite fair.

682
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,319
A big one for the adult and
a small one for the kid.

683
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,799
Quanquan, do you know

684
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,000
who invented cotton candy?

685
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,920
No.

686
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,119
It was invented by a dentist.

687
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,440
I don't believe it.

688
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,319
Dentists always tell me that candies
are not good for the teeth.

689
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,599
It's true.

690
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,839
The cotton candy looks so beautiful

691
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,920
and it tastes great.

692
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,319
So, children love it.

693
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,680
And they'll have caries after eating it.

694
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
So, children shouldn't eat
too much of it.

695
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,799
This is for you.

696
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,319
Thank you.

697
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,279
But do you have
to say something like that

698
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,640
to spoil the ambience?

699
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,599
Am I spoiling the ambience?

700
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,079
I'm just stating a fact, right?

701
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,079
Quanquan.

702
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,880
Has she always been like this?

703
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,519
Quanquan.

704
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,839
You shouldn't eat this. Give it back.

705
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,640
Son, come here.

706
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,440
Give me back my cotton candies!

707
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,759
I want to eat the big one.

708
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,799
Daddy, have some chocolate.

709
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,400
Okay.

710
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,799
The chocolate fed by you
tastes the best.

711
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,839
You are such a sweet talker.

712
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,519
Is this how you coaxed Mommy

713
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,599
to date you back then?

714
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

715
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,519
Such nonsense.

716
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,039
Mommy, have some chocolate.

717
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't like to eat sweet food.

718
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,599
Just eat one.

719
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,799
Fine. I'll eat one.

720
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,599
Come closer.

721
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,720
Min Hui.

722
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:14,799
Zhou Ruji.

723
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Daddy Zhou.

724
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,559
Did you go out to play?

725
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,799
Xin Qi and Min Hui brought me
to the amusement park.

726
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,160
It was so much fun.

727
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,200
You can't just play all the time.

728
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,400
Later, come to my house.

729
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,599
Let me check your heart rate
and blood pressure.

730
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,759
If you play too much,

731
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,079
your heart can't take it.

732
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,680
My son has a professional family doctor.

733
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,119
You don't have to trouble yourself.

734
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,240
I've been Quanquan's attending physician

735
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,839
since he was born.

736
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,200
I believe that no one

737
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,720
knows Quanquan's condition
better than I do.

738
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,400
Daddy, I'm tired.

739
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
Let's go home.

740
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,839
Daddy Zhou, I'm fine.
My heart is fine too.

741
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Do you hear that?

742
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,480
Let's go home.

743
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:02,799
Bye.

744
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,680
Min Hui.

745
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,960
This is for you.

746
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,000
Why are you suddenly giving me a gift?

747
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,119
Think of it as a congratulatory gift
for getting the investment.

748
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,279
But I think

749
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,839
I haven't told you about it.

750
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,960
How did you know?

751
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,759
I took a guess.

752
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,920
I believe that as long as
you put your mind to it,

753
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,079
you'll achieve what you want.

754
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,440
Son, call your Mommy.

755
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Why are you suddenly complimenting me?

756
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,039
But I like it.

757
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,720
Thank you.

758
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,279
Mommy, hurry up.

759
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,400
Okay.

760
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,240
I'll get going now.

761
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:33,960
Okay.

762
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,759
I'm coming. Let's go.

763
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,599
We have to dry your hair
after your shower.

764
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,680
Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.

765
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,359
Understand?

766
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,440
Yes.

767
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,319
You nag more than Min Hui.

768
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,359
Why did he suddenly give me a gift?

769
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,000
Heels?

770
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Why did he give me a pair of heels?

771
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,039
I don't wear heels usually.

772
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,960
Xin Qi!

773
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,920
My face is going to be scratched up
if you keep rubbing it.

774
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,239
Min Hui, look at Xin Qi.

775
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,159
He rubbed my face like this just now.

776
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,840
Look.

777
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,800
You can rub his face like that too.

778
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,039
He rubbed my face like this.

779
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:25,639
Okay.

780
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,199
My skin is scratched up now.

781
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,800
It's okay. You can do the same to him.

782
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,639
Is this a gift from Daddy Zhou?

783
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,440
Yes.

784
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,360
They look beautiful.

785
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,039
They look beautiful?

786
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,840
Huanhuan's mother

787
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,360
always wears this kind of heels.

788
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,599
Why do you start paying attention
to Huanhuan lately?

789
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,480
You were all about Yuanyuan
before this, right?

790
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,599
Yuanyuan is a picky eater.

791
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,360
I don't like her anymore.

792
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,679
Why are you so fickle?

793
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,679
I wonder who you resemble.

794
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,599
This is called sticking
to our principle.

795
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,239
Unlike someone

796
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,000
who is open to all, right?

797
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,480
He has such a bad taste.

798
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,480
Just like you.

799
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,719
Now that you say it,

800
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,239
they really look good.

801
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,760
The more I look at them,
the better they look.

802
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,119
They fit so well.

803
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,199
They look so elegant.

804
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,039
Do they look pretty?

805
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes.

806
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,559
They are not pretty.

807
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,559
This pair of heels is so pretty.

808
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,480
I have to treasure it.

809
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Move aside.

810
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,519
Don't get in my way.

811
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,920
This pair of heels sounds good too.

812
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,039
Min Hui.

813
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,199
Do you know Min Hui that well?

814
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
Stop rubbing my head.

815
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,519
Stop.

816
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,510
(Five years ago)

817
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,440
Sir.

818
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,159
Buy a stalk of flowers
for this beautiful lady.

819
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,920
How much is it per flower?

820
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,639
Five yuan.

821
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,440
I didn't bring any money.

822
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,079
I'll buy it.

823
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,559
I'll buy it for the handsome man.

824
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:31,960
Well...

825
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,039
The yellow ones are beautiful.

826
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,559
I bought this.

827
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,400
Thank you.

828
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,119
Thank you.

829
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,360
Then, I'll give it to you.

830
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,559
Come here.

831
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,519
Do you want to buy some flowers?

832
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,719
How much?

833
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,000
It's five yuan per stalk.

834
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,280
These lousy flowers

835
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,679
cost five yuan per stalk?

836
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,760
What a bloodsucker?

837
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,119
What are you doing?

838
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:49,840
You are grownups.

839
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,239
Don't you feel ashamed
for bullying a little girl?

840
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,239
Come here.

841
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,800
Are you okay? Be careful.

842
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,880
Who are you?

843
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,320
Mind your own business.

844
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,559
