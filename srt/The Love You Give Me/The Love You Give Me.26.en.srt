=Episode 26=

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,030
Ms. Min.

26
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,239
Hello?

27
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,480
I told Hardy to pick up Quanquan.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,320
I'll pick you up after work.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
(We haven't spent intimate time
together in some time.)

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,719
Ms. Min?

31
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll take you somewhere special.

32
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:24,920
(I got it.)

33
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,839
(I have work to do.
I have to hang up.)

34
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,679
Hello?

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,719
At least let me finish.

36
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,440
What is it?

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,600
Ms. Min.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,480
I wasn't in cahoot with Ding Yifeng.

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,279
I did as you said.

40
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,040
But somehow...

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,839
It's alright.

42
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,480
It's alright.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,360
I believe you.

44
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,760
This has nothing to do with you.

45
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,320
There were some errors
in other processes.

46
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,200
So...

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,760
Are you really leaving?

48
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,640
Words travel faster than expected.

49
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,279
I haven't decided yet.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,679
But Meimei,

51
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,760
whether I stay or leave,

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
you must keep up the good work.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,719
Stay alert and brave.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,360
Is that clear?

55
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,679
Understood, Ms. Min.

56
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,320
Alright.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,959
I haven't decided yet.

58
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,920
Get back to your work.

59
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,279
Is this the special place you mentioned?

60
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,559
Be patient.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
What is this about?

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,119
At this point, Qian and his family
had already moved in.

63
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,399
This is their house now.

64
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,040
Come on.

65
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:58,440
No.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,839
This is their home now.

67
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,239
This

68
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,200
has always been your home.

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,039
So...

70
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,320
You were the one who bought the house.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
Could you ask your friend a favor

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,599
and buy this house under their name?

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,039
I'll pay for the house.

74
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,719
Qian has already

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,240
transferred the house
to Quanquan's name.

76
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,839
Now we need your signature.

77
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,399
Are you upset?

78
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,719
Sorry, this was my fault.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,800
I didn't want the house to be sold off.

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,320
It carries so many

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,880
memories of you and Quanquan.

82
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,159
I didn't want you to regret selling it.

83
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,760
Why are you apologizing?

84
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:14,560
Xin Qi.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,039
Thank you.

86
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,039
Thank you for caring so much
about Quanquan and me.

87
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,359
Thank you for giving us a proper home.

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,159
In the past,

89
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,760
I was a little dramatic.

90
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,440
You are only a little bit
hard to persuade.

♪'Cause I always love you♪

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Alright.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
I know you feel sad at the moment.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
But don't forget,

95
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,120
you still have Quanquan and me.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,959
You will always have my support.

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,279
I'll root for you.

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,580

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,220

Are you hungry?

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,279
I haven't eaten anything today.

103
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,440
Say something sweet to me.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,839
Let your husband get you
some delicious food.

105
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,880
There is something

106
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,279
more insane

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,479
that I'd rather do now.

108
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,839
What is this place?

109
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,440
Are we here to let off some steam?

110
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,200
Yes.

111
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,880
Come on.

112
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:09,839
Xin Qi.

113
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,200
Hit that bottle as hard as you can.

114
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,519
It's very relaxing.

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,039
I'll get you a different bat
after you get the hang of it.

116
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:16,760
Okay.

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,399
How was that?

118
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,000
This is interesting.

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,959
I wish I could leave

120
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,599
just as Min Hui does.

121
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,320
Is Ms. Min really leaving Be Agile?

122
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,280
She hasn't decided yet.

123
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,200
But she is probably leaving

124
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,119
due to her past with Cheng Qirang.

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,839
So why can't you leave?

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,599
It's different for me.

127
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,759
I do marketing.

128
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,879
It's easy to step into this field,

129
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,040
but it's very tough
to get a high position.

130
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,400
Therefore, whether I like it or not,

131
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,680
staying in Be Agile is
the best option for me.

132
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,920
If you're not happy there,

133
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,759
just quit.

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,999
I can take care of you.

135
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm not saying we should get married.

136
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,239
I mean,

137
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,440
you don't have to put up with this job

138
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,680
for the sake of making a living.

139
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,239
I want you to be happy.

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm so glad to have you here.

141
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,879
What would I do

142
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,440
without you?

143
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,119
You will always have me by your side,

144
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:19,800
silly.

145
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,359
(How long have we been
in this relationship?)

146
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,239
(Over five years.)

147
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,040
(Do you regret it?)

148
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,999
(Why do you bring that up?)

149
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,160
(Answer me.)

150
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,759
Seriously?

151
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
You're crying?

152
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,400
What?

153
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,879
It's called "Cinema of Tears."

154
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,359
Why can't I cry?

155
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,479
You can cry.

156
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,440
I feel like crying too.

157
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
But it's hard

158
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,160
for me to cry while watching this.

159
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,400
Could we get a different movie?

160
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,599
Wait here.

161
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,719
(The sea turtle has been
living freely on Earth)

162
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,440
(for 200 million years.)

163
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,639
(Most sea turtles
live in shallow water.)

164
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,440
(Aside from laying eggs
and getting a sunbath,)

165
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,599
(they rarely get on shore.)

166
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,879
What is this?

167
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,920
Animal Planet.

168
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,100
(Female turtles only go on shore
to lay eggs.)

169
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,160
What's wrong?

170
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,130
(After the sea turtles mate,)

171
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,510
(the female goes to land to lay eggs.)
Don't you think...

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
Don't you think life is majestic?

173
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
Hush, hush.

174
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,840
(They then return to the sea.)
Hush.

175
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,560
Hush.

176
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,580
(Cash check: 2,500,000 Yuan)

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
What is the meaning of this?

178
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,839
Take the money.

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,680
Go abroad

180
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,599
or go home.

181
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,520
Don't stay in Bincheng.

182
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,639
Remember one thing.

183
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,560
Do not let me see you again.

184
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,560
Are you breaking up with me?

185
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,440
Why?

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,359
Cheng Qirang.

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,719
How could you...

188
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,239
Of course I can.

189
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,639
This relationship has always been

190
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,119
a fair deal.

191
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,119
A deal?

192
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,959
After all the time

193
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,239
we've spent together,

194
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,520
it's only a deal to you?

195
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,280
I gave you my heart.

196
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,639
I thought my love would be answered.

197
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,599
So you've been using me all this time?

198
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
You're getting rid of me now.

199
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,239
Is that right?

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,119
Not a chance, Cheng Qirang!

201
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,680
Cheng Qirang, I can ruin your entire life.

202
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,839
I'll tell the world
about this relationship.

203
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,999
I'll tell the world

204
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,800
how you sexually harassed Min Hui.

205
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:49,959
I still have the evidence.

206
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,359
I have it with me!

207
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
I'll ruin your life.

208
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,999
I'll get Zheng family to kick you
out of Guanchao!

209
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,440
What did you do five years ago?

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,839
Tell me.

211
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,160
Come on.

212
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,680
Say it!

213
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
You're scared.

214
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
You are right.

215
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,719
Ambition comes with a price.

216
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
I was too naive.

217
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,400
Now, it's your turn to choose.

218
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,639
You can either

219
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
make me Be Agile's general manager,

220
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,839
or

221
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
you can have your reputation
and wealth taken from you.

222
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,040
You have three days.

223
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,999
Think it through.

224
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,440
Let's see if you can ditch me

225
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,719
before I bring you down.

226
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,719
I need something done.

227
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,839
Wouldn't it be great if all the worries

228
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,280
could be washed away

229
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
by crying your heart out?

230
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,040
But reality won't let us escape.

231
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,639
Well? Have you made up your mind?

232
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,520
Cheng Qirang is in Be Agile now.

233
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,599
I can't stay there for another second.

234
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,959
I'm sensing a "but".

235
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
But,

236
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,239
he's blackmailing me
with Cai Wenji and the others' jobs.

237
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,320
If I leave,

238
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,479
the whole R&D Team B
is in a tough time.

239
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,719
That's true.

240
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,599
He never ceases to surprise me

241
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,479
with how low he can stoop.

242
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,719
Yeah.

243
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,999
I recruited the whole team myself.

244
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,599
We've worked on so many projects.

245
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:53,560
I watch them grow and become mature.

246
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,119
This job is very important to them.

247
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:58,080
If they resign now,

248
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,599
due to the NCC,

249
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,839
they won't find any new positions
for quite some time.

250
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,639
Not to mention the AI modeling project

251
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,200
I've worked on for so long.

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,599
If I leave,

253
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,400
the project will be put to a halt.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,999
It will be shelved for good.

255
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,999
But when I think about

256
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,719
all the patients in the rural regions

257
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,400
who lack medical assistance

258
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,479
and might not be able
to get the treatment they need

259
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,839
due to the lack of
transportation or medical facilities,

260
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,080
I realize they might spend

261
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,560
their lives in fear and pain.

262
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
They could be children
about Quanquan's age,

263
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
or they could be elderly.

264
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,999
There are many who have
the same condition as yours.

265
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,839
They have great potential,

266
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,200
but they can't have a future
due to the sicknesses.

267
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,800
If these people are abandoned,

268
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,119
what should they do?

269
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,560
The thought of it makes me sad.

270
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,920
Just as you said,

271
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,520
destiny doesn't allow us to escape.

272
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,160
I've decided to stay.

273
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,320
That is my duty.

274
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,599
You act like you had already known.

275
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,639
If I didn't know you this well,

276
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,239
would you still love me?

277
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,159
Do I love you?

278
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,080
Don't you?

279
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,359
Not really.

280
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,159
Not really?

281
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,000
Not really. Get over yourself.

282
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,240
Who do you mean?

283
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,919
You.

284
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,000

(Kind reminder: Playing at the fountain

298
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,160
(Guanchao)
You can't enter without an appointment.

299
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,240
That's company policy.

300
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,599
I hope you understand.

301
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:29,800
This is Director Min from Be Agile.

302
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,199
She doesn't need an appointment.

303
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,280
Yes, Mr. Cheng.

304
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
Seeing you're here,

305
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,359
you must have made up your mind.

306
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,760
Why not take a seat?

307
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,119
I can stay in Be Agile

308
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,439
on two conditions.

309
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,040
Do tell.

310
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:06,240
First off,

311
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,919
I'm only in charge
of the AI heart modeling project.

312
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,720
I won't intervene or be involved

313
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,639
in other projects.

314
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,639
Secondly,

315
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
only Cao Mu can be my superior.

316
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,960
Ding Yifeng has no right to intervene

317
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,839
with my projects

318
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,599
or anything regarding my team.

319
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:21,800
These are challenging to fulfill, but...

320
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,240
For you,

321
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,119
I can make an exception.

322
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:28,919
Actually...

323
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,240
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

324
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,879
Cheng Qirang.

325
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,199
Watch out!

326
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,240
Mr. Xin!

327
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,879
Jiang.

328
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm tired of nagging at you.

329
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,600
Let's go.

330
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,839
Did you finish your work?

331
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,240
I'll get back to work.

332
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,599
Only now?

333
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,639
You're only fooling around or eating.

334
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,520
Meimei.

335
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,679
I need these PPT printed out.

336
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,320
What is it?

337
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,520
I am the R&D Director.

338
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,399
I'm in charge of all of you.

339
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
So is Min Hui.

340
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,199
Take the files.

341
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,800
Mr. Ding, mind your manners.

342
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Manners?

343
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,639
Could you show me

344
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,560
what that means?

345
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,839
- Min Hui?
- Ms. Min?

346
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,119
Meimei, get back to your work.

347
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,639
Yes.

348
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:46,839
Zhong Meimei!

349
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,760
Ding Yifeng.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm warning you.

351
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,439
You couldn't bring me down before.

352
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,879
You still can't now.

353
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,080
Cheng Qirang promised me

354
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,000
that my team and I

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,480
no longer report to you.

356
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,720
You have no right to question us.

357
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,159
Cheng Qirang is out of his mind!

358
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,399
Why would he agree to this?

359
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,760
You can ask him yourself.

360
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,520
Fine. I'll go to him now.

361
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,280
I got this room with my assistant's ID.

362
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Cheng Qirang can't find you here.

363
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,919
You can stay here safely.

364
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,879
I know what you want.

365
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Even if Cheng Qirang
and I had a fallout,

366
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,320
I'd never help you or Min Hui.

367
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,399
You can give up now.

368
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,199
Don't be so certain of it.

369
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,439
You know very well

370
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,040
what kind of person he is.

371
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,240
I am the only one

372
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,320
who can help you.

373
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
Will she help us?

374
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
Don't worry.

375
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,960
Do not underestimate
a woman's urge for revenge.

376
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,820
(Chatting records with Qirang)

377
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,720
Are you sure you got everything?

378
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I looked through

379
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,720
all the electronic devices,

380
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,839
including the obsolete phones.

381
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
They are all here.

382
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,199
You can go now.

383
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,720
What else

384
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,399
have I not discovered?

385
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,560
Was she lying to me?

386
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,080
I was just looking for you.

387
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,760
What are the odds?

388
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,159
Pull over up ahead.

389
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,159
Get in the car.

390
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,919
We're meeting a client.

391
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,879
That's not part of my job.

392
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,599
Besides, I already got off work.

393
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,679
I decide when you get off work.

394
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,879
Get in the car.

395
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,639
What's wrong with you?
Don't touch me!

396
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:03,280
Cheng Qirang!

397
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,879
Get in the car.

398
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,439
You...

399
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,560
I told you to stay away from her.

400
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,320
He always comes at the nick of time.

401
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,320
I wonder if he can
always get to you in time

402
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,159
in the future.

403
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,560
Are you hurt?

404
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:49,480
Let's go.

405
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,280
Meimei, why haven't you gone home?

406
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,080
Go ahead without me.

407
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,480
I'll go after finishing the PPT.

408
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,919
Alright. I'll be going now. Bye.

409
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,359
Bye.

410
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,159
Meimei!

411
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,159
Did I scare you?

412
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,720
Mr. Ding, you are drunk.

413
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,199
Not at all.

414
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,480
I only took a sip.

415
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,679
Where are you going, Meimei?

416
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,040
You think you're so capable now.

417
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,599
You wouldn't pour me some coffee.

418
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,639
You even worked with
Min Hui to set me up.

419
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,480
Tell me, why?

420
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,599
Ding Yifeng, let go of me!

421
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,439
Have you lost your mind?

422
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,480
You've lost your mind! Let go!

423
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,919
I have lost my mind!

424
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,040
Do you think I don't know

425
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,199
you've been talking behind my back?

426
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,359
You look down on me.

427
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,599
Zhong Meimei,

428
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,159
I'll show you.

429
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,439
I'll make you understand

430
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,240
the consequences of
ruffling my feathers!

431
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,760
Let go of me, Ding Yifeng!

432
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,839
You sure enjoy the food.

433
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,960
I thought you knew boxing.

434
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,399
Why didn't you retaliate?

435
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,639
Trust me.

436
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:24,960
Had you come a second later,

437
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,520
Cheng Qirang would've been hospitalized.

438
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,639
How did you get hurt?

439
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,240
It's nothing. I knocked on something.

440
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,000
Let me see it.

441
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm fine.

442
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,560
This is too serious for an accident.

443
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,599
Does it hurt?

444
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,679
No. I'm alright.

445
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:58,760
You've been acting weird lately.

446
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
I feel like you're hiding
something from me.

447
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,879
You're always so mysterious.

448
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,879
What? Do you suspect
I'm cheating on you?

449
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't be paranoid.

450
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,839
If you were,

451
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,320
I'd break your legs right now.

452
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,359
How can I protect you, then?

453
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't need your protection.

454
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,720
It's up to you whether

455
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,839
you need it or not.

456
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,960
But protecting you is my duty.

457
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,879
Don't look at me that way.

458
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,760
I can't stand it.

459
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,199
You're a princess
who doesn't need her knight.

460
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
So, I must so wishfully

461
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,280
be your loyal guard.

462
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,399
That is so cringe.

463
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,359
A phone call.

464
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,080
Forget it.

465
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
I got a phone call. Hold on.

466
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,919
Hello, Meimei.

467
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,679
What?

468
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,720
What's wrong?

469
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,620
(Jueyue Mansion)

470
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,359
Ms. Min, Mr. Xin,

471
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,119
thank you for sending me back.

472
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,119
You must have been terrified.

473
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,240
But Meimei,

474
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,080
aren't you going
to file a police report?

475
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,480
He didn't get what he wanted.

476
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,560
If I let this matter escalate,

477
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,480
I'll have a hard time in the workplace.

478
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,040
I understand how you feel.

479
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,359
But think about this.

480
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,000
If you compromise once,

481
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,439
he might do it again.

482
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:46,879
Again?

483
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Actually,

484
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,720
I went through the same thing.

485
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,280
After I graduated from college,
I had my internship in Guanchao.

486
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,560
Cheng Qirang almost violated me.

487
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,080
I reported the incident
to HR right away.

488
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,960
In the end,

489
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,919
they alleged that I failed
to seduce my superior

490
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,159
and fired me.

491
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,560
But you know what?

492
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,280
All these years,

493
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,040
my greatest regret isn't filing a report
against Cheng Qirang.

494
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,359
It's not going through with it.

495
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,280
I can relate to how you feel.

496
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,919
But this isn't our fault.

497
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:23,760
Right?

498
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,159
It's them who should be despised

499
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,919
and ashamed.

500
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,080
Not us.

501
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,599
We did nothing wrong.

502
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,879
If every victim chooses to be in silence,

503
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,159
there will be more victims.

504
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,839
But...

505
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,439
Alright, it's getting late.

506
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,599
She is distraught.

507
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,359
Let her go home and get some rest.

508
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,280
Meimei.

509
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,480
Some final words before we leave.

510
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,359
You can make your own decision

511
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,520
about your life.

512
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,000
But whatever choice

513
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,879
you make in the end,

514
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,800
we will always be there for you.

515
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,639
Thank you, Ms. Min.

516
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,639
Alright, you must be terrified.

517
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,080
Go home and get some rest.

518
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,040
Let's go.

519
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,119
Alright.

520
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,599
It's her life.

521
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,800
She has to discover it on her own.

522
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,399
She must experience it,

523
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,679
try it,

524
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,080
and reflect on it.

525
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,520
You did all you could for her.

526
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,199
I know.

527
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,639
But I feel sorry.

528
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,720
After all these years,

529
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,599
women are still facing
so many challenges in workplaces.

530
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:05,560
Actually,

531
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,119
even though I can't
experience it myself,

532
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,639
I can still somewhat understand

533
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:13,080
the challenges you face,

534
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,760
especially at the workplace.

535
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,560
Due to childbirth,

536
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,199
some malicious rumors,

537
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,919
and many other factors,

538
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,359
women must put in

539
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,439
a lot more efforts to have

540
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,439
equal rights to voice out.

541
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,560
When she finally
gets a high-ranking position,

542
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,919
people will start saying
she got it through connections with men.

543
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,599
When there are cases
of sexual harassment,

544
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,359
women are always
at the center of attention

545
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,679
and gossip.

546
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,439
Back at our office...

547
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,359
Don't look at me that way.

548
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,320
Not every man

549
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,560
is as worthless
as Cheng Qirang and Ding Yifeng.

550
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,159
Of course I won't think so badly

551
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,280
of all men.

552
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,159
There are many good men in the world.

553
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,359
Zhou Ruji is one.

554
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,919
You too.

555
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,879
You are somewhat of a good man.

556
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,159
Ms. Min.

557
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,639
What do you mean
I'm somewhat of a good man?

558
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,279
What's so funny?

559
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,199
You laughed first.

560
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,480
You laughed because I did?

561
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,279
I'm happy when you laugh.

562
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,639
Come on. Let's go home.

563
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,480
Why must I come
here in person every time?

564
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,119
Right?

565
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,520
My office is right over there.

566
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,119
We are less than five meters apart.

567
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,480
Can't you use your ears for once?

568
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,560
Who is it?

569
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,199
What...

570
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,560
What's wrong with you?

571
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,319
Why did you hit me?

572
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,159
I'll hit you whenever I want!

573
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,599
Min Hui.

574
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,480
Listen up!

575
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,560
I've put up with you long enough.

576
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,199
I...

577
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,960
My hand!

578
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,639
Mr. Ding?

579
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,639
Are you alright, Mr. Ding?

580
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,920
My hand!

581
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,360
What is it?

582
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,239
It hurts!

583
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,000
Sorry, Mr. Ding.

584
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,360
You stepped on it.

585
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,199
Are you alright?

586
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,360
Jiang, I...

587
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,520
Mr. Ding, your parcels.

588
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,679
Fine!

589
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm calling the police.

590
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,279
I'm doing it now!

591
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:35,440
None of you can get away with this!

592
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,000
Especially you!

593
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
Who's calling the police?

594
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Officer, you came just in time.

595
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,000
She hit me for no reason.

596
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,279
Arrest her now.

597
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,520
Arrest all of them!

598
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,560
Officer.

599
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,119
Last night,

600
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,000
he almost raped me.

601
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,759
- What?
- Rape?

602
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
What is this nonsense?

603
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,119
Who would rape you?

604
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,760
- You were seducing me!
- You...

605
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,840
I firmly turned you down.

606
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,599
Ding Yifeng, stop arguing.

607
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,480
You know very well

608
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,560
what you did.

609
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,440
What did I do?

610
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,279
Listen to this.

611
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,840
(Ding Yifeng, have you lost your mind?)

612
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
(Let go of me!)

613
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
(Stop resisting.)

614
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,520
(You lose nothing if you date me!)

615
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,840
(Records)
(For a woman like you,)

616
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,400
(to be with someone as successful as me,)

617
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,599
(is more than you deserve!)

618
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,440
(Let go of me!)

619
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,480
(Ms. Min won't let you
get away with this!)

620
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,880
(Do you think I'd be scared)

621
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
(knowing she has your back?)

622
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,599
(I'll show you)

623
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,520
(who you shouldn't mess with in Be Agile!)

624
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,319
(Let go of me, Ding Yifeng!)

625
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:28,440
No!

626
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,400
This was fabricated!

627
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,520
Officer, this recording was fabricated.

628
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,840
She tried to seduce me.

629
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,119
She wanted a raise and promotion.

630
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,880
I said no, so she took revenge on me!

631
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,199
Officer, I've been wronged.

632
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,400
Enough.

633
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,799
We'll know if it's fabricated

634
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
after a thorough investigation.

635
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,560
I've been wronged!

636
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
- Come with us.
- You should investigate them!

637
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,480
Come with us.

638
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,880
Officer!

639
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,159
Shut it.

640
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:46,920
I've been wronged!

641
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,920
I've been wronged!

642
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,360
Who started it first?

643
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,480
I started it.

644
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,360
Alright, come with us.

645
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,239
No.

646
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,840
Are you done yet?

647
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,199
Quiet.

648
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,000
Alright, that's enough.

649
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,920
Don't be so petty.

650
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,560
I can't bring Min Hui here
because I want to

651
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,159
give her a surprise.

652
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,199
Why else would I need you here?

653
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,080
Miss?

654
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,360
Hello.

655
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
I want a ring of this size.

656
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,719
Sure.

657
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,960
I want a pair of these.

658
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:41,800
(Marry Me)
Yes. In a moment.

659
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,719
I'll pack it up for you.

660
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,480
Thank you.

661
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,799
Are you sure about this?

662
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:50,279
Getting envious?

663
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,319
Let me tell you something.

664
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,400
I've found my love.

665
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,080
Don't get so cocky.

666
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,679
The girl is pretty.

667
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,960
But compared to Min Hui,

668
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,000
she's slightly inferior.

669
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:06,880
I should check your eyes

670
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,040
the next time you come to the hospital.

671
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:19,719

672
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,719
