=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 13=

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,900
(No Photos. Wear Swimming Cap)

26
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,034
Chen Jiajun,

27
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,154
why do you want to see me?

28
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:49,833
This isn't funny.

29
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,874
Come out now before I leave.

30
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,713
Cao Mu!

31
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:01,713
What are you doing, Chen Jiajun?

32
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,473
What are you doing?

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,850
(Cao Mu, be my girlfriend)
Be my girlfriend, Cao Mu.

34
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:36,954
You're out of your mind.

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,500
(Cao Mu, be my girlfriend)

36
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,114
Any decision yet?

37
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:09,794
Okay.

38
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:11,753
I see.

39
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:21,954
I guess the board members

40
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:23,914
are still against it, huh?

41
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,553
I didn't say that.

42
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,074
Really?

43
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,634
Xin Qi, you're so annoying.

44
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:44,074
Don't you have any confidence

45
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:45,074
in your model presentation?

46
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,593
Of course, not.

47
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:48,833
I...

48
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:56,234
I don't have confidence

49
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:57,394
in RG's board members' ability
to make wise decisions.

50
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:00,474
It was indeed a heated discussion.

51
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,753
But the Chairwoman said

52
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,354
they eventually agreed

53
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,873
to the research of this technology.

54
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:07,194
So, how about a celebration?

55
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:08,713
That's a must.

56
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:10,753
Are you free the night after tomorrow?

57
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:11,674
I want to buy you dinner.

58
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,074
In that case,

59
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,513
bring Quanquan along too.

60
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:18,753
Okay.

61
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:20,354
Then

62
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,073
I'll let you know
after I make the reservation.

63
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:22,834
Okay.

64
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:28,674
I've been watching all sorts of videos

65
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,193
and reading love advice online

66
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,313
these days.

67
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,794
But none of them really fit me.

68
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:35,953
I've always been good at swimming.

69
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,953
So I learned

70
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,354
some synchronized swimming.

71
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:42,193
I thought it would be romantic.

72
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,073
But it turned out to be funny.

73
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:46,313
I never thought it would be...

74
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,274
Who says it's funny?

75
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,393
It's the most thoughtful

76
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,513
and romantic confession I've ever seen.

77
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,393
It's the best.

78
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,393
So

79
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:59,993
are we officially dating now?

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,234
What do you think?

81
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:16,753
Maybe

82
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,553
I'll know for sure if we kiss again.

83
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,513
I have a call coming in.

84
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:28,753
Yes, Min Hui?

85
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:30,714
Really?

86
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,274
That's great!

87
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,953
Didn't I tell you that you'd make it?

88
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:35,553
Me?

89
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,834
I'm currently occupied with something.

90
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,674
I'll talk to you at the office later.

91
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:42,873
Okay, see you.

92
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,513
You often mentioned Min Hui.

93
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,553
Is she really that capable?

94
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,794
Of course.

95
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,474
She's the best
at Be Agile Medical Technology.

96
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,873
It's time for my handsome boyfriend
to meet my best friend, right?

97
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,234
It's time to show everyone

98
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,034
how handsome my boyfriend is.

99
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:02,953
Okay.

100
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,234
I thought only Min Hui and Quanquan

101
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,834
will have dinner with you tonight.

102
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,114
Is there someone else coming?

103
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,594
That would be you.

104
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,114
You didn't try four sets of outfits

105
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,594
just for me, right?

106
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,313
What do you think?

107
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:27,433
This outfit looks good.

108
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,034
It's understated yet stylish,

109
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,433
which suits your personality.

110
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,034
But I feel like
there is something missing.

111
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,513
She's been busy lately.

112
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,594
Should I prepare a gift for her?

113
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:43,753
A gift?

114
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,034
Excuse me.

115
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,154
Do you have lipstick

116
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,914
in this color at your store?

117
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:53,474
Yes, we do.

118
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:54,914
I want ten of them.

119
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,034
Of course.

120
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,753
Hello, where are you now?

121
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:16,313
Stop rushing me.

122
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,114
I'm already at the entrance.

123
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,633
I'm about to get in the elevator.

124
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,914
It's the restaurant on the 30th floor.

125
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,193
Reservation under Miss Cao.

126
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,993
I know. How many times
do you need to repeat this?

127
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:25,714
It's just a new boyfriend.

128
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,393
Why are you so chatty this time?

129
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:29,633
It's different this time.

130
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,433
All right, I'll stop for now.

131
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,513
Just come here quickly.

132
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,594
Okay, I'll see you there.

133
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:57,513
Why you...

134
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:58,674
What's wrong with you?

135
00:07:58,914 --> 00:07:59,633
What's the problem?

136
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:01,873
Pervert.

137
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,714
What?

138
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,154
He grabbed my butt.

139
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,553
You molested this young lady
in front of you.

140
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:06,633
But you don't see her complaining.

141
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,433
Hey, watch what you're saying.

142
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,274
You know very well

143
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,714
if he's telling the truth.

144
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:11,714
There's a surveillance camera
in the elevator.

145
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:13,393
Everything you did is recorded.

146
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:14,873
This guy must be the one
who molested her.

147
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:15,553
See how guilty he looks.

148
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:16,914
Call the police now.

149
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,274
Yes, we must call the police.

150
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:19,313
I'm getting off now. Get out of my way.

151
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:20,114
Hey, you.

152
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:20,953
You can't leave.

153
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:21,433
Don't block my way.

154
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:21,914
You can't leave!

155
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:22,953
Move aside!

156
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:32,600
You molested someone in broad daylight.
We're sending you to the police.

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm being very kind to you now.

158
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,554
That hurts.

159
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:35,074
It's all okay now.

160
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,673
Buddy, that hurts.

161
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:42,234
Officer,

162
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,594
it's a misunderstanding. I...

163
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,194
Stop talking.

164
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:47,834
What a scum.

165
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,793
Miss, listen.

166
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,873
When you face such an incident,
you must not be scared.

167
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,793
The more you're scared,
the more daring he'll be.

168
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,354
Should you run into
such an incident again,

169
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:56,314
you must report it to the police

170
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,314
even if you have no proof.

171
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:58,273
You must trust the police.

172
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,834
They won't
let such people get away that easily.

173
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,753
I'll remember that.
Thank you for your help.

174
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:02,513
It wasn't a big deal.

175
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:03,714
Miss,

176
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,513
please come with us to the station
to make your statement.

177
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,114
Okay.

178
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:14,474
Didn't I tell you not
to come and see me?

179
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:15,554
I can go up after taking care of this.

180
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,793
I'm not here for you.

181
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:19,594
Are you okay?

182
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,873
I'm fine.

183
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:24,194
Thank you for helping out, young man.

184
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:24,873
It's nothing.

185
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,314
Young man?

186
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:27,753
Is he the one you mentioned

187
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:28,993
over the phone

188
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:30,633
about catching a pervert together?

189
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:31,314
Yeah.

190
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:43,834
Is he your new boyfriend?

191
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,594
So you're Min Hui.

192
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,673
Hello.

193
00:09:58,273 --> 00:09:59,594
Why don't we order some drinks?

194
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:00,954
Okay.

195
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:03,153
I'll order for you.

196
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:07,474
I'd like a glass of lemonade

197
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,633
and a glass of orange juice.

198
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,273
Isn't he handsome?

199
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:11,314
I wasn't lying, right?

200
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:13,554
Your taste is pretty good this time.

201
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,594
Of course,

202
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,314
his taste is even better.

203
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,594
Of course.

204
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,314
After the elevator incident just now,

205
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,873
I'm completely at ease.

206
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,474
Congratulations.
You found a reliable one.

207
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:29,673
Hui.

208
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:30,673
Thank you.

209
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:33,954
You had a headache this morning, right?

210
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,074
So you shouldn't drink coffee today.

211
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,673
Drink this orange juice
to replenish vitamins.

212
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,114
All right. Anything you say.

213
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,434
Thank you, my love.

214
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:43,834
I can't take this.

215
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:44,753
Jeez...

216
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,673
Can you guys not say

217
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,114
such lovey-dovey words before me?

218
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,633
It's making me uncomfortable.

219
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,234
Why?

220
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,194
I did it to provoke you.

221
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,273
For heaven's sake.

222
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,714
Where's Daddy?

223
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,474
You'll see him soon enough.

224
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:21,314
Daddy!

225
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,434
Quanquan!

226
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:25,513
I'm not late, am I?

227
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,474
No, I came early.

228
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,753
Why isn't Hardy here?

229
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:32,913
He said he didn't want to disturb us

230
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,393
since we're having a family dinner.

231
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,234
You said you wanted to thank me.

232
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,474
Is this place good enough to thank me?

233
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,993
What's wrong with this place?

234
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,434
Mr. Xin,

235
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,513
you'll know my sincerity

236
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,594
when they serve the dishes.

237
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,554
Quanquan,

238
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:51,194
pick all the delicious food.

239
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:51,873
Okay.

240
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,580
(Jiaren Hospital)

241
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,314
I have something to say to you.

242
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:11,993
So drive.

243
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:14,753
Where are we going?

244
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,714
Just drive when I tell you to.

245
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:17,314
Come on.

246
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:30,714
What do you think?

247
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,714
Can you feel my sincerity now?

248
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:36,793
A little.

249
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,793
How is it a little
when you enjoy the food so much?

250
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,633
What's this?

251
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:49,714
See it for yourself.

252
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:58,793
Is this a gift you prepare for Min Hui?

253
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:00,633
That's my sincerity.

254
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,594
Lipstick?

255
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:14,393
How did you know the color I'm wearing?

256
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:28,673
Quanquan.

257
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:29,834
Eat up

258
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,153
before your mommy finishes it all.

259
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,993
You were the one who ate the most.

260
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,234
Let's eat.

261
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:38,354
Quanquan, here.

262
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:50,474
Zizhu,

263
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:51,714
I can't find the bubble milk tea shop

264
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:52,834
you wanted in the area.

265
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:53,714
They said the one from this store
is pretty good.

266
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:54,354
Try it.

267
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,074
Thank you.

268
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,834
Doesn't that Ferris wheel look pretty?

269
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,434
Let's ride it one day.

270
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:02,993
If I have the time.

271
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:04,834
By the way,

272
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:08,234
about that person you like,

273
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,114
does she like you too?

274
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,474
No, she doesn't.

275
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:14,633
What?

276
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:15,834
Why not?

277
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,753
You like her.

278
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,314
Why wouldn't she like you back?

279
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,633
Just because you like someone

280
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,153
doesn't mean they will like you back.

281
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,194
It would be great if a relationship

282
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,393
is as simple as you think.

283
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:26,993
You make a good point.

284
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,474
Actually,

285
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,354
I've been thinking a lot lately.

286
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:31,753
If you and the person you like

287
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:32,434
are already together,

288
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,153
I won't interfere with you guys.

289
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,074
But since

290
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,074
she's not your girlfriend yet,

291
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:38,354
I'll compete with her fairly.

292
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:39,074
I don't think you understand.

293
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:40,954
I'm not as good as you think.

294
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:42,114
Besides, I like someone else.

295
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,753
You don't have

296
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:43,834
to waste your time on me.

297
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,354
It's up to me to decide
if you're a good person.

298
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,194
Besides,

299
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,074
it's my time that I'm willing to waste.

300
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,114
What can you do about it?

301
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:51,954
What if the person you like tells you

302
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:53,633
not to waste your time on her,

303
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:54,673
would you be able to do it?

304
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:59,513
That girl was pretty decent.

305
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:02,393
Would you like her
just because she's nice to you?

306
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,114
I can't.

307
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:06,873
Now, that solves everything.

308
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,314
Besides,

309
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:09,873
you also said

310
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:11,714
that love isn't easy.

311
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,913
I want to try my best for my own love.

312
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,153
Even if you end up not liking me,

313
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:17,834
I won't regret it.

314
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,194
I have one last question.

315
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,594
What's the name of the person you like?

316
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:29,993
It's getting late.
Let me send you home.

317
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:34,474
Yao Zizhu,

318
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,474
you can do this.

319
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,240
(Hainanli)
Did you enjoy your dinner?

320
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,074
Yes, I did.

321
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,273
Which one is your favorite?

322
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:40,873
The chicken soup.

323
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,434
Chicken soup?

324
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,273
Wait here. Let me take this call.

325
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:45,673
Hello?

326
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:47,513
What?

327
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,033
The files for groundwork data?

328
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,714
Didn't I send them to you before?

329
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:53,074
All right, then.

330
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,834
I'll email another copy to you.

331
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,074
Okay.

332
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,993
It's okay.

333
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,033
Why are you here alone?
Where's Quanquan?

334
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:07,194
He was just here.

335
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:08,993
I guess he went to the restroom.

336
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,114
I don't think so.
I just came out of the restroom.

337
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:13,714
Excuse me.

338
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,633
Did you see a boy going in?

339
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:16,234
No.

340
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:16,913
He's about this tall.

341
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:18,354
He was just standing next to me.

342
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:19,393
I'm sorry. I didn't notice.

343
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:22,753
Why don't you search that way?

344
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:23,513
I'll search over here.

345
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:24,273
Call me if you find him.

346
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:24,793
Calm down.

347
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,554
I'll be fine.

348
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:27,354
Excuse me, have you seen

349
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,393
this kid?

350
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:30,273
He's wearing a gray shirt
and is about this tall.

351
00:16:59,194 --> 00:16:59,913
Quanquan!

352
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:02,993
What are you doing?

353
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,193
Sorry, I mistook him for someone else.

354
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:06,913
Sorry about that.

355
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:10,393
So, how is it?

356
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,074
I asked around.

357
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:12,913
But no one has seen him.
What should we do?

358
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:14,913
We should call the police.

359
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:18,514
Hello?

360
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:23,794
Thank you, miss.

361
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,034
My mommy will be here soon.

362
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:27,433
Quanquan!

363
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:30,794
Mommy, what took you so long?

364
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:32,233
Quanquan.

365
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:35,473
You scared me to death!

366
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,433
I'm sorry, Mommy.

367
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:41,433
I wanted to buy you a gift as Daddy did.

368
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,314
But I have no money.

369
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,554
Why did you wander off like that?

370
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,433
You've scared your mommy to death.

371
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:48,913
It's okay now.

372
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:49,754
It's okay. Don't cry.

373
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:52,673
I'm sorry for wandering off, Mommy.

374
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,233
I won't do it again.

375
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,433
It's okay, Quanquan.

376
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,794
Let's stop crying, okay?

377
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:57,794
It's okay.

378
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:01,794
Don't cry.

379
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,473
There, there.

380
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,074
There, there. Don't cry.

381
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:07,994
It's all okay now.

382
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,994
I shouldn't have raised my voice.

383
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,393
It's okay.

384
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:27,913
I can finally feel

385
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,354
at ease right now.

386
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:33,754
I really can't imagine

387
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,354
what to do

388
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:36,433
if I didn't find Quanquan today.

389
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,193
It was my fault

390
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,034
for not watching Quanquan.

391
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,393
You did very well.

392
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,594
If you didn't tell him
to memorize your number,

393
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,953
it could be a real problem tonight.

394
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,114
You have taken
such good care of Quanquan.

395
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,514
Thank you.

396
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,913
He's my son.

397
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,354
It's my duty to take care of him.

398
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,114
But you made me realize

399
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,514
how difficult it is

400
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,274
to take care of a child

401
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:10,633
with a heart condition.

402
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:12,953
It also made me believe

403
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,794
that there must have been a reason

404
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:17,393
why my parents abandoned me.

405
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,274
Actually, I should thank you.

406
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,473
After spending time together,

407
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,114
I can see

408
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,713
that Quanquan is becoming
more and more dependent on you.

409
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,554
Of course, I feel a bit jealous.

410
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:34,393
But I also understand

411
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,393
that the happiness

412
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,633
a child has with their parents

413
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,554
is something that I can't give alone.

414
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:45,114
You have given Quanquan
a complete family.

415
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,314
Maybe

416
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,794
we can put aside

417
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:50,713
all the past

418
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,554
and take care of Quanquan together

419
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,913
as his parents.

420
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:02,873
What do you think?

421
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:10,074
Sure.

422
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,713
Isn't this the shirt that I...

423
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,594
Why does he cherish this shirt so much

424
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,193
that he hangs it here on purpose?

425
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,274
Unbelievable.

426
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,193
So should I get him a gift

427
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:53,873
in return?

428
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,994
Mr. Xin and Hardy
are on the way back here.

429
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,713
Please wait here for a moment.

430
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:07,913
Okay, thank you.

(But do you realize)

433
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:39,794
(that a child without a father)

434
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,713
(will always have a gap in their heart?)

435
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,594
(This is something you can't replace.)

436
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:45,153
(I'll never leave him.)

437
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,153
(I've promised Quanquan)

438
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:47,633
(that I'll stay by his side.)

439
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,193

441
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,473

(How about we bake a cake

443
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,633
(that belongs to our family?)

444
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:01,274
(What do you think?)

445
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:02,193
(Okay.)

446
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:04,034
(Thank you for not giving up on him.)

447
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,794

(Plaintiff: Xin Qi)

450
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:18,794
Mr. Yan sent over

451
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:19,594
the settlement agreement this morning.

452
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:20,673
I've already put it on your desk.

453
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,594
You need to sign it.

454
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:23,754
Settlement agreement?

455
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:24,834
Who are we suing?

456
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:25,794
Min Hui.

457
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,754
I thought you wanted
to get Quanquan back.

458
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,274
When did I say that?

459
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:31,233
Don't you know?

460
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:32,913
The Chairwoman told me that you...

461
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:33,834
The Chairwoman?

462
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,114
You snitched on me again, didn't you?

463
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:36,114
No, I didn't.

464
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:37,193
Well, you found your son.

465
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:38,554
Isn't this a piece of good news?

466
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:40,473
So I told her about it.

467
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,233
Then what's the deal
about the litigation?

468
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,034
The Chairwoman said

469
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,433
since you're fond of Quanquan,

470
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:46,153
we must help you get him back.

471
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,514
I never said that.

472
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,794
The Chairwoman said it.

473
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,034
Now listen to me.

474
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:54,754
End the litigation process.

475
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,554
Okay, I'll take care of it right away.

476
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,074
Madam,

477
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:00,193
can you please stop meddling
in my affairs?

478
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:02,393
You're here.

479
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:04,873
Get lost.

482
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:29,633
Wait, Min Hui.

483
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,114
I know you're upset now.

484
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:33,233
Can you give me a chance to explain?

485
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:34,074
Okay.

486
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,153
Explain it to me now.

487
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:41,673
Why aren't you saying anything?

488
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:43,473
So tell me now.

489
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,393
Say that you didn't approach me
and Quanquan

490
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,673
just to win our favor

491
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:49,354
and increase your chances
of winning the lawsuit.

492
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:50,554
Say that you didn't
have ulterior motives

493
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,713
when you were being nice to us
during this time.

494
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:53,873
Say that you never intended

495
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:55,193
to take Quanquan away from me.

496
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:55,953
Just say it!

497
00:23:58,193 --> 00:23:59,153
Okay, I admit it.

498
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:00,873
When I first started getting
to know Quanquan,

499
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:02,114
I did want to spend more time with him

500
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:03,393
and build a relationship.

501
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:04,673
But I never had any intention

502
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:05,994
of taking him away from you.

503
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,074
Do you think I'll believe that?

504
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,433
You said you never thought

505
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,953
of taking Quanquan away from me.

506
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:12,953
But you already hired a lawyer
to sue me.

507
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,433
That wasn't my idea.

508
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,233
I never hired a lawyer.

509
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,233
Xin Qi, I know what's on your mind.

510
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:22,514
You think I lied to you
five years ago.

511
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,834
We ended up having Quanquan

512
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,034
because I lied to you first.

513
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:26,754
You hate me for giving birth to him

514
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,433
without telling you.

515
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,953
So you think

516
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,393
even if you take Quanquan away from me,

517
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:32,393
it's because I owe you

518
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:33,953
and I deserve it, right?

519
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,074
No,

520
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,913
that's not it. Why can't you believe me?

521
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:41,193
You asked me
the same question five years ago.

522
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,153
How did you answer it then?

523
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,834
You said you only believe
what you see with your eyes.

524
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:47,994
Xin Qi,

525
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:50,713
you're really cruel.
Do you know that?

526
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,754
I can accept you hating me

527
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:53,953
and venting all your anger

528
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:55,034
on me.

529
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,433
I can take it all.

530
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:57,994
But not Quanquan.

531
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:01,633
No one can take him away from me,

532
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:03,233
not even you.

533
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:05,994
From today on,
you won't see Quanquan anymore.

534
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:07,233
Min Hui, Min Hui!

535
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,314
I know that you're not listening

536
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,354
to anything I say right now.

537
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:10,834
Even if you think of me

538
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,633
as a ruthless person,

539
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:13,873
I won't do something

540
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,713
like taking a child away
from his mother.

541
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,153
Min Hui, how long will Xin Qi be away
on his business trip?

542
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:45,354
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

543
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:48,794
But he didn't say goodbye to me either.

544
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:52,153
Xin Qi is very busy
so he didn't have time.

545
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:55,034
Then why did he take
all his clothes with him?

546
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,433
He even took his toothbrush and razor

547
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:58,074
from the bathroom.

548
00:25:58,074 --> 00:25:59,314
How would I know?

549
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:00,713
He didn't tell me.

550
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:05,834
Okay, it's late now.

551
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:06,554
Go to bed quickly.

552
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:07,233
No,

553
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,034
I want to call and ask him.

554
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,713
Quanquan, what's wrong with you?

555
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,594
Are you not listening to me anymore?

556
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:17,074
I already said it's late now

557
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:17,913
and you need to go to bed.

558
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:18,754
Don't you know that?

559
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,514
Quanquan, listen to me, okay?

560
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:27,594
Isn't it already late now?

561
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,713
Xin Qi is already sleeping
and resting now.

562
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:32,514
If you call him now, you'll disturb him.

563
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:34,314
If you want to call him,

564
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,594
can you do it tomorrow?

565
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:44,034
You used to put this on my right wrist.

566
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,393
(If I knew this is the outcome,)

567
00:26:58,594 --> 00:26:59,913
(I would rather not have let you know)

568
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:02,074
(that he's your father.)

569
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:36,274
Why are you still awake?

570
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,233
Why are you sleeping here?

571
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:40,153
I'm worried you might be in a bad mood

572
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:41,233
and have trouble sleeping at night.

573
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:42,393
So I stayed to keep you company.

574
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:44,074
Why would I have trouble sleeping?
I was...

575
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,153
I just woke up.

576
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,953
You woke up at three in the morning?

577
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:58,074
Don't be anxious.

578
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,794
Min Hui was just angry for the moment.

579
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:02,274
Give her some time to cool down.

580
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:03,834
After she's no longer upset.

581
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,354
you can explain to her nicely later.

582
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,633
Then she'll forgive you.

583
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,673
Who says I'm anxious?

584
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,994
I've been wanting to leave

585
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:12,193
that small and shabby house of hers.

586
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,433
Besides, I didn't do anything.

587
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:16,433
She's the one who doesn't believe me.

588
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:20,034
You seemed to be quite happy living
at her place.

589
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,354
At least, you slept well.

590
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,314
Do you want me to warm up
a glass of milk for you?

591
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,354
No need.

592
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,193
Min Hui said

593
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,433
she won't let me see Quanquan anymore.

594
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,673
Does that mean I can't see him too?

595
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:46,393
I'll miss him a lot then.

596
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,200
(Be Agile Medical Technology)

597
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:53,114
This hot weather is killing me.

598
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:54,873
Zhong Meimei,
don't you feel hot wearing that?

599
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,074
It's 38 degrees out there.

600
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:57,274
Not at all.

601
00:28:57,554 --> 00:28:58,994
It's safer this way.

602
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:02,473
Okay, done.

603
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,554
Oh heavens!

604
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:07,074
You scared me to death.

605
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,193
Ms. Min.

606
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,994
Oh, I saw what happened yesterday.

607
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,314
You were really brave.

608
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:16,193
If you want,

609
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,233
you can be as brave as I am.

610
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:22,994
I know.

611
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:24,274
I'll get back to work then.

612
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,354
You can do it, Meimei.

613
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,514
What did you two talk about?

614
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,153
Nothing.

615
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:31,514
Cao Mu,

616
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,594
I need to take the day off
because I don't feel well.

617
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,114
You're sick?

618
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:38,473
So what kind of sickness
does my wonder woman have?

619
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:40,274
Did you catch a cold?

620
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:42,274
Then what's the matter?

621
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:44,354
Headache.

622
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:46,193
Headache?

623
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,633
You don't have any fever.

624
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,074
Okay, then go home and rest.

625
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:54,754
I'll get going then.

626
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:55,834
Are you really okay?

627
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:56,953
Yeah, I'm really okay.

628
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,554
Just need to rest.

629
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,193
She never takes a day off
even with a high fever.

630
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:08,233
Why is she acting weird today?

631
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,354
You don't have to come in person

632
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,514
to check on the Mist system upgrade.

633
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,274
I know they don't need me
but they need her.

634
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,834
Is Min Hui still refusing
to answer your calls?

635
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:24,354
She blocked me.

636
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:29,953
Mr. Xin?

637
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:31,673
I didn't know you'd be here.

638
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,514
I'm here to see Director Yao
for something else.

639
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,554
It just happened
that the Mist system is upgrading,

640
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:39,713
so I came to check it out.

641
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,594
Yeah, that's really convenient
to wait for 40 minutes.

642
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:44,794
You and your big mouth.

643
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:48,913
Well...

644
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,440
(Jiaren Hospital)
Are you alone?

645
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:53,193
Mr. Xin, stop joking.

646
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:54,514
I'm not part
of the technology department.

647
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:55,514
I should let the professionals

648
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:57,233
handle professional matters.

649
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,673
Ms. Cao, the traffic was terrible.

650
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,433
Mr. Xin, you're here too.

651
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:08,754
Mr. Xin.

652
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:10,873
Are you looking for someone?

653
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:11,794
No one.

654
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:15,594
Zhou Ruji.

655
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:18,754
I'm glad to see you.

656
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,794
Min Hui took the day off
because of a headache this morning.

657
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:21,913
I'm sure you know

658
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,354
she never takes the day off easily.

659
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:23,754
So

660
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:25,314
can you help me check on her after work?

661
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:26,193
Sure.

662
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:28,953
Min Hui is sick?

663
00:31:30,193 --> 00:31:31,794
I thought you were staying together.

664
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:33,354
Don't you know if she's sick?

665
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,074
Did anything happen?

666
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:36,794
You're not giving me
a good impression now.

667
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:44,473
Let's go.

668
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:53,594
Wait.

669
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:54,393
Be careful.

670
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,594
Thanks.

671
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:00,633
You're welcome.

672
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:06,794
I thought you live in Block A.

673
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,354
Cao Mu wanted me to check on Min Hui.

674
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:10,514
I'm sure you heard her.

675
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,153
I can take care of Min Hui.

676
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,713
She doesn't need you
to take care of her.

677
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:15,114
I'm a doctor.

678
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:16,834
Taking care of patients is my duty.

679
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,074
So don't worry about it.

680
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:31,274
You first.

681
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:31,994
Thanks.

682
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,274
Who's there?

683
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:44,673
- It's me.
- It's me.

684
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:51,314
Cao Mu asked me to check on you

685
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:52,514
because you're not feeling well.

686
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,794
Are you feeling okay?
Do you need to go to the hospital?

687
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:09,514
Come in.

688
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,354
Are you okay?

689
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:26,153
Yeah, I'm fine.

690
00:33:26,393 --> 00:33:28,074
I just have headaches lately.

691
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,473
What happened?
Did you have a fight with Xin Qi?

692
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:31,913
Thank you.

693
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,473
He filed a lawsuit against me.

694
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:37,994
He even
had a legal notice prepared already.

695
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:40,153
He's planning to fight
for full custody of Quanquan.

696
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:42,673
What?

697
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:48,074
Min Hui said Xin Qi
is away on a business trip.

698
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,994
He's too busy to answer my calls.

699
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:50,994
Why are you so free

700
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,233
to take me out for ice cream?

701
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,314
Don't let Quanquan know about this.

702
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:59,794
We'll wait until Min Hui decides.

703
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,034
Because

704
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:03,873
my most important job now

705
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:05,233
is to keep you company.

706
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:08,313
But you're Xin Qi's assistant.

707
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,034
Min Hui said
you're Xin Qi's competent assistant.

708
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,153
That's why my boss asked me
to keep you company.

709
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,753
Because you are very important to him.

710
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,034
If he wants you

711
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:21,034
to live with him in the future,

712
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,554
would you agree?

713
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:25,673
But I'm very important to Min Hui too.

714
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:28,114
Why are adults so troublesome?

715
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:31,713
Why do you guys keep making
a kid like me decide?

716
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:33,594
You have a point.

717
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,554
It would be fine
if both of them stay together.

718
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:38,633
Why must they trouble you?

719
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:44,874
Quanquan,

720
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,554
this is my phone number.

721
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:47,793
You must memorize it.

722
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:49,153
If you need help,

723
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,394
you must call me.

724
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:58,233
Have you memorized the number?

725
00:34:59,114 --> 00:34:59,914
Eat up.

726
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,434
I'll send you back to the kindergarten
after you finish it.

727
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,474
That's what happened.

728
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:05,233
I have a patient

729
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,673
whose son specializes
in these divorce cases.

730
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,074
I'll contact him tomorrow

731
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:09,874
and introduce you to him

732
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,074
if you need it.

733
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,673
Since Xin Qi has already prepared
the lawyer's letter,

734
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,193
it means he's fully prepared.

735
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:17,994
You must prepare too.

736
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,394
You're right.

737
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:22,554
Can you help me

738
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,474
contact the lawyer?

739
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:24,833
Sure, I'll do it right now.

740
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,633
Thank you.

741
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,554
Don't mention it.

742
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:36,233
I heard

743
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:38,713
from my lawyer friend before

744
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:39,833
that in cases like yours,

745
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,313
the judge would tend to give custody

746
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:44,034
to the healthier family.

747
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:46,233
If you don't mind,
I can sacrifice myself.

748
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,394
We can get married.

749
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:48,874
After you get custody,

750
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:49,994
we can divorce.

751
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,034
Zhou Ruji,

752
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:01,793
you don't have to do this.

753
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,233
I can't bring you down like this.

754
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:05,474
How is this considered bringing me down?

755
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:07,273
We're doing this for Quanquan.

756
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:10,594
Zhou Ruji,

757
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,313
I know you want to help me.

758
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,153
I have always considered you

759
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:16,514
my most trusted friend.

760
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:18,954
But because of that, I can't use you.

761
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,954
Even if you're willing to,

762
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:22,233
I still can't do that.

763
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,034
Why take it so seriously?

764
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,514
I was just joking.

765
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:34,793
Even if you're willing to do it,

766
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,353
I may not be willing to.

767
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:37,833
I knew it.

768
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:44,753
So...

769
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:46,353
Well,

770
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,833
I have to go and pick Quanquan up.

771
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,074
Then

772
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:53,074
if there's nothing else,
I'll get going too.

773
00:36:53,074 --> 00:36:53,954
So

774
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,273
if you're not well, call me.

775
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:57,793
Okay, I'll do that.

776
00:36:58,114 --> 00:36:58,994
Call me.

777
00:36:58,994 --> 00:36:59,633
Okay.

778
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:00,673
You don't have to see me off.

779
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,713
(Min Hui,)

780
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:09,633
(when will you understand)

781
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,713
(that I don't want
to be your best friend?)

782
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,500
(Five years ago)

783
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:34,193
There are so many fish.

784
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,153
I see jellyfish too.

785
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:40,594
Okay,

786
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:41,673
I'll help you catch a couple.

787
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:42,474
No, stop.

788
00:37:42,673 --> 00:37:43,353
You shouldn't go in there.

789
00:37:43,353 --> 00:37:43,833
I can do it.

790
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,153
It's dangerous.
You'll fall into the water.

791
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,034
You won't be able to catch them.

792
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:47,994
How is that even possible?

793
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:49,233
I got it.

794
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:51,313
You got it?

795
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:55,434
What's this...

796
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:58,233
I wanted

797
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:00,114
to give it to you
by hiding it in the cake.

798
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:01,594
But it didn't...

799
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:06,193
I don't think formality is important.

800
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,833
What matters is my feelings for you.

801
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:16,273
Min Hui,

802
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:20,793
will you marry me?

803
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:28,713
Help me wear it.

804
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:42,554
Does it look pretty?

805
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:44,594
Yes, it does.

806
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,633
But shouldn't it be a ring?

807
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:53,153
Ring?

808
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,874
Ring...

809
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,514
I forgot.

810
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:57,193
You forgot.

811
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:58,114
I didn't have time.

812
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,193
No time?

813
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:02,273
Then I can't agree.

814
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,793
I'll make it up to you after this.

815
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:06,193
Fine, I'll throw this away.
