25
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,839
Who is it so early in the morning?

26
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,880
Can't you see the "Do Not Disturb" sign?

27
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:01,919
Good morning.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Why are you here?

29
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,759
You said that you miss me, right?

30
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,040
So, here I am.

31
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,560
I miss you?

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
When did I say that?

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,040
I didn't say that.

34
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,160
(Chen Jiajun!)

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Here.

36
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,479
(You haven't contacted me
the whole day.)

37
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:29,959
I...

38
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:30,959
(Who do you think you are?)

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,919
You...

40
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,679
How could you film me
without me knowing it?

41
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,840
You are a pervert. Give it to me.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
I filmed it because you're cute.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,359
Give it to me.

44
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,040
No.

45
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm going to keep it
as a memento forever.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
(And you say you love me?)

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
Give it to me.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,880
No.

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,479
Give it to me.

50
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,639
How could you...

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,359
I miss you.

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,000
(Intelligent Medical Summit)

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,320
This place is so beautiful and big.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,079
Are you sure you want to take Quanquan?

55
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,160
You have to socialize
with others later, right?

56
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,759
Maybe I should let Cao Mu take him?

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,880
It's better for me to take care
of my own son.

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,600
Right?

59
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,519
Besides, I've already told
the organizing committee.

60
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,359
I'm just an audience at today's summit.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,359
Besides, I don't have
to socialize with everyone.

62
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,519
Okay.

63
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,400
If there's any problem,

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,759
you can message me at any time.

65
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,759
Just focus on your speech.

66
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,359
Leave the rest to me.

67
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,160
All the best, Mommy.

68
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:56,840
Such a good boy.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,160
Hello,

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,000
are you Ms. Min Hui from
Be Agile Medi Tech?

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,840
Hello.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,720
Hello. This way, please.

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,120
I'll get going now.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Go ahead.

75
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:03,959
Let's go.

76
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:32,679
Look.

77
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,999
Why is she the first?

78
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,439
Who's the leader
of the organizing committee?

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,799
I think it's Mr. Tang, Tang Jiangong.

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,439
Bring him here.

81
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,800
(The Future of AI Heart Modeling
Speaker: Min Hui)

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,360
(Guest Speaker)
Min Hui.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,960
Min Hui.

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,559
Mr. Tang.

85
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
It's like this.

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,080
Due to time constraints,

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
there have been some changes
to the schedule.

88
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,960
We'll have to cancel

89
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,439
your segment.

90
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,799
I hope you can understand.

91
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,879
Why?

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,760
Aren't I the first speaker?

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,640
Besides, you are the one who invited me.

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,160
How can you cancel it all of a sudden?

95
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,720
The decision is made after
taking various aspects,

96
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,400
time and follow-up issues
into consideration.

97
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,040
I have thought...

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Mr. Tang.

99
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,799
I promise you that I'll give my speech
in less than 12 minutes.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,119
Please reconsider.

101
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,720
Besides, this is a crucial project.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,200
We really need this opportunity.

103
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,720
Alright then.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
You'll give your speech
at the end of the summit.

105
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,879
If there's enough time,
you can give your speech.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,359
Otherwise,

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,879
it'll have to be cancelled.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,559
I understand.

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Thank you.

110
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,919
Actually, I was not angry.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,760
I just felt embarrassed.

112
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,400
I didn't know anything about your work.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,239
Not only could I not
help you with anything,

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,280
I almost caused you
to lose your documents.

115
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,319
But you shouldn't have gone into hiding.

116
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,999
I wasn't hiding.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,999
I was trying to come up

118
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:43,960
with a way to close the gap

119
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,160
between us.

120
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,479
Close the gap between us?

121
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,359
You are so adorable.

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,919
Sparks are flying between us
because of our difference.

123
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:55,479
Right?

124
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,760
I like you because of your difference.

125
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,319
Really?

126
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,239
What's the time now?

127
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,439
This is bad.

128
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,280
Min Hui's speech is going to end soon.

129
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,799
It's your fault for seducing me.

130
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,040
You are the one who can't resist me.

131
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:26,840
Just you wait.

132
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,640
(Intelligent Medical Summit)

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,319
The AI doctor that we've developed

134
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,239
is better in doing diagnosis,
assessments

135
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,720
and giving treatment suggestions,
compared to

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,960
the other products in the market.

137
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,120
(Aren't you supposed
to be the first one?)

138
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,799
(The last speaker is almost done.)

139
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,239
(Why isn't it your turn yet?)

140
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,080
Overall, it's more advantageous.

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,000
(Cheng Qirang asked
the organizing committee)

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
(to cancel my segment.)

143
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,559
(But I stood my ground)

144
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,999
(and they agreed to let me)

145
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,280
(go last if there's extra time.)

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,760
(Let's see how
they'll arrange it later.)

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
(I'll ask the organizing committee
about it.)

148
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,200
(It's okay. I can handle this myself.)

149
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,679
(Just wait and see.)

150
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,359
If you want to know more
about the AI doctor,

151
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,439
feel free to ask me about it.

152
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,200
That's it for my speech today.

153
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:18,840
Thank you.

154
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,799
Thank you to Mr. Feng Shijie
for sharing this with us.

155
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,160
And thank you to all the other speakers

156
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
for their interesting topics.

157
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,319
That's the end of this forum.

158
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,040
We'll have a cocktail party later

159
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,880
so that you can find out more
about each topic.

160
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,799
Thank you, everyone.

161
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,599
My fellow specialists, scholars

162
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,000
and friends who came all the way here.

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,839
I am the R&D Director
of Bincheng Be Agile Medi Tech.

164
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,919
I am Min Hui.

165
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,439
I would like to share with you

166
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,079
the latest ideas and achievements

167
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,880
of our AI heart modeling technology.

168
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,400
Ms. Min.

169
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,559
The summit has ended.

170
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,400
Mr. Tang, I was supposed

171
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,439
to be the first speaker today.

172
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,760
But you put me last without any reason.

173
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,480
And now, you want to cancel my segment.

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
Can I know why?

175
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:10,760
Is someone trying to stop me

176
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,839
from giving my speech under the table?

177
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,120
Of course not. I just...

178
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,360
That's good.

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just need 10 minutes.

180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,280
I promise that it won't take
much of your time.

181
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,439
If you are willing to,

182
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,559
please stay for my presentation.

183
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,679
I heard that Ms. Min

184
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,160
has been working on this AI technology
for a long time.

185
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's listen to her presentation.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,799
It's a high-tech project
that even foreigners can't master yet.

187
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,480
Let's stay here and listen.

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,079
Thank you, everyone.

189
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,959
Thank you for staying here
for my presentation.

190
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,919
According to Albert Einstein,

191
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,599
everybody is a genius.

192
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,000
But if you judge a fish

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,599
by its ability to climb a tree,

194
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,319
it will live its whole life

195
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,319
believing that it is stupid.

196
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
But I want to be that fish today.

197
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,319
Please give me the water source I need.

198
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,120
I'll prove to you in the future

199
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
that I'm not stupid.

200
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,120
Next, I'm going to share

201
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,160
about our

202
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,319
AI Heart Modeling Technology.

203
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,360
(AI Heart Modeling Technology)
First,

204
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,719
our project is separated
into three parts.

205
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,280
The first part is to create
a basic heart model.

206
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,480
We'll create a basic heart model for
our patients through AI modeling.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,760
Not only that,

208
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,040
our AI heart modeling can be used...

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,360
Finally, I found you.

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,439
Quanquan.

211
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,319
Aunt.

212
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,160
It can also identify the risk

213
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,319
of structural heart disease

214
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,959
in advance before the diagnosis,

215
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,880
flagging any patients
with high-risk structural heart disease.

216
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
(R&D Reference Data)

217
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,679
That's it for

218
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,079
our AI heart modeling technology.

219
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,959
Thank you, everyone,

220
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,000
for giving me your precious time.

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Thank you for listening.

222
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,319
Quanquan.

223
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:23,640
Look.

224
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,839
Look at your father.

225
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:28,880
What is it called?

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,559
What's the idiom for that?

227
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,040
I know the answer to that.

228
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,880
What is it?

229
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,079
Falling in love.

230
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
That's right.

231
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,439
How do you know that?

232
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I know a lot of things.

233
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,520
Quanquan knows everything.

234
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,959
You should learn from him.

235
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,439
Are you

236
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,120
admitting that you like Min Hui?

237
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,280
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,319
I'm sure Min Hui
will be busy for a while.

240
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,000
You should take Quanquan back first.

241
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,439
What about you?

242
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:15,040
I need to handle something.

243
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,880
Go to your aunt's room.

244
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Great.

245
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,160
Mr. Tang. Thank you for today.

246
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,799
You are too kind. This is my duty.

247
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,120
Hopefully, we can collaborate next time.

248
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,719
Sure.

249
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,520
Goodbye.

250
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,360
Mr. Xin.

251
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,559
It seems like we always
run into each other.

252
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,959
You are being funny.

253
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,000
I came here on purpose to remind you

254
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,919
that no matter if it's in terms
of professional ethics

255
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,719
or the morals as a man,

256
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,919
it's better not to play any dirty tricks
behind someone's back.

257
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,599
Otherwise, if you are exposed,

258
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,880
it'll hurt your reputation.

259
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:01,240
Mr. Xin.

260
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,480
Let me remind you as well.

261
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,599
As a man,

262
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,640
Min Hui is indeed

263
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,799
a capable, beautiful

264
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,880
and attractive woman.

265
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
She's like

266
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,959
the pearl-banded rat snake.

267
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,599
The little snake that looks beautiful.

268
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,919
But

269
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
it's full of venom.

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,880
You don't have to worry about me.

271
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,599
I'm tough.

272
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,919
Slow down. No one
will take your food from you.

273
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,760
You don't know.

274
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,280
I talked to them
for three hours straight.

275
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,439
My throat was burning up.

276
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,520
I was famished.

277
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,360
If I didn't get you out,

278
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,480
you would still
be stuck with them, right?

279
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,160
But

280
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,679
I'm quite happy

281
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,799
that so many people are interested

282
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,160
in the AI heart modeling technology.

283
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,799
You don't know.

284
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,400
Just now, there was a student
who just graduated

285
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,280
from a medical university.

286
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,199
He has given me

287
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,280
a lot of constructive suggestions.

288
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,319
Ms. Min.

289
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,520
The most important thing for you now

290
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,400
is to replenish your energy.

291
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
Then, you have to think

292
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
about what to wear
for tonight's dinner party, okay?

293
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Dinner party?

294
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Don't tell me
that you didn't prepare anything.

295
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,319
Of course I did.

296
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,839
My outfit today is brand new.

297
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,959
I knew it.

298
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,160
I think this outfit looks nice.

299
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,839
We still have time.

300
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,439
We'll go and buy one later.

301
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:26,919
No.

302
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,480
You have to.

303
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,760
It's a waste of money and time.

304
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,160
I won't wear it much.

305
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,000
I won't go.

306
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,599
Are you sure?

307
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,400
Yes.

308
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,439
Then, I'll be the lone beauty tonight.

309
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,240
Don't be jealous of me.

310
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,000
Go ahead. You are the prettiest.

311
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,360
Enough. Hurry up and eat.

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm back.

313
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
I'll go and get Quanquan later.

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,919
What did he buy for Quanquan again?

315
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,840
(For: Min Hui)

316
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,919
It's for me?

317
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,559
(Thank you for your gift.)

318
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,040
(How do you know it's me?)

319
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,160
(You are the only one)

320
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
(with such a bad taste.)

321
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,599
(Is it that hard to compliment me?)

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,880
(Everyone needs to dress accordingly.)

323
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,640
(And I think this dress
suits you the most.)

324
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,520
Is he complimenting me

325
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,799
or making fun of me?

326
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,559
(Where's Quanquan?)

327
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,160
(Cindy took him out
to get some ice cream.)

328
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,040
(She'll send him back
to your room later.)

329
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,760
(Get a good rest.)

330
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,040
(See you tonight.)

331
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,559
(See you tonight.)

332
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,080
Nice working with you.

333
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,799
Who's this beautiful lady here?

334
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:00,040
Xin Qi has great taste.

335
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,439
This dress compliments you so much.

336
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,280
Be honest with me.

337
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,880
Does he know your body measurements?

338
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,879
What are you doing, Cao Mu?

339
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,520
There's a kid here.

340
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,240
You look amazing too.

341
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,599
Of course.

342
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,040
Mr. Xin, long time no see.

343
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,879
Long time no see.

344
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,639
Hello.

345
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,399
It has just been a few days.

346
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,440
Who's that beautiful lady beside him?

347
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Does he have a change of mind?

348
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,799
That's Aunt Cindy.

349
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,520
My father's sister.

350
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,559
Quanquan.

351
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,119
Do you remember the game of secret

352
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,799
that you are playing with your dad?

353
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,839
You need to pretend

354
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,599
not to know them in front of others.

355
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,680
Are you playing Mission Impossible?

356
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,599
How fun.

357
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
You have great taste.

358
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,480
Why were the presents that you bought me

359
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,200
so tasteless?

360
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,159
You have to reflect on yourself.

361
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,839
Quanquan.

362
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,000
Aunt.

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,159
Looks like they are not interested
in the game of Mission Impossible.

364
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,119
Quanquan.

365
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,399
You are wearing the gift.

366
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,440
Do you like it?

367
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,359
Yes.

368
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:23,960
Hello, Min Hui.

369
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,119
Let me introduce you two.

370
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,119
She is Cao Mu.

371
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,839
The deputy director of Be Agile
Medi Tech. She's my best friend too.

372
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:28,799
She is Cindy.

373
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,559
Xin Qi's sister.

374
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,799
The Chairwoman of RG Group.

375
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,359
Hello, nice meeting you.

376
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,159
Hello.

377
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,559
Quanquan.

378
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,079
Do you want to get some ice cream?

379
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,119
Yes.

380
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,399
Let me get some for you then.

381
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,639
Let's go.

382
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,839
I'll leave you to it.

383
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,839
You look beautiful today.

384
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,079
Thank you.

385
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,639
It has been a long time
since I last saw Xin Qi

386
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,520
with so much light in his eyes.

387
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:06,920
There's something

388
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,159
that I have to explain to you.

389
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,119
Xin Qi didn't know

390
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,159
that we sued you.

391
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,119
I made the decision myself.

392
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
I was the one who contacted the lawyer.

393
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,399
Cindy, I think...

394
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,799
Come on. Don't be nervous.

395
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,119
I've completely given up on that idea.

396
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,720
And Xin Qi gave me a good scolding.

397
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,359
But

398
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,599
I still need

399
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,559
to apologize to you for that.

400
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,879
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,359
It's already in the past now.

402
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,799
I accept your apology.

403
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,359
Please excuse me.

404
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,159
Ms. Min.

405
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,879
Please excuse me.

406
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,760
Mr. Gao.

407
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,520
Ms. Min, hello.

408
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,440
We meet again.

409
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,839
I saw your presentation this afternoon.

410
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,520
It's very interesting.
I'll look forward to it.

411
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,200
You are a young and promising lady.

412
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,760
What you shared today

413
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,280
was truly impressive.

414
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,240
Yes. When
the AI heart modeling technology

415
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,280
has come to fruition,

416
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,920
it'll be the pride of our nation

417
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,440
on the international platform.

418
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,720
Those men

419
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
forget everything
after seeing a beautiful woman.

420
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,080
(We are sincere with our compliments.)

421
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,079
You are a woman too.

422
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,399
Why can't you attract

423
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,000
the attention of Mr. Gao?

424
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,359
(Most importantly, this technology)

425
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,879
(can help a lot of patients
who suffer from heart disease.)

426
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,359
(But I'll need the help
from all of you.)

427
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,159
I still have things to do.

428
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,879
Look at her.

429
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,079
She's bold. She's capable.

430
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,079
And most importantly, she's humble.

431
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,079
Ms. Min.

432
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,319
If you need our help after this,

433
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,440
don't be shy to ask me for help.

434
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,599
I'll do my best to help you.

435
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes.

436
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,440
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

437
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,399
Thank you to all of you too.

438
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,319
Cheers.

439
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,520
You are Ms. Min's son, right?

440
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,839
You are so big now.

441
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,680
So cute.

442
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,399
Don't you remember me?

443
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,040
I don't know you.

444
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,119
I am your mommy's colleague.

445
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,079
Come back.

446
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,799
Didn't your mommy teach you
that this is rude?

447
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,680
You are hurting me.

448
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,839
Mommy.

449
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,559
Mommy.

450
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,390
- Mommy!
- I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

451
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:11,159
Quanquan.

452
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,200
Mommy!

453
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,520
Lin Xiyue, what are you doing?

454
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:17,920
Mommy,

455
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,960
this strange lady hurt me.

456
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,119
Where are you hurt?

457
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,480
Here.

458
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
Is this your son?

459
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
He's so big now.

460
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
I didn't expect this.

461
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,119
Mr. Gao.

462
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm sure you don't know.

463
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,799
Ms. Min can juggle between
her career and family well.

464
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,399
Even though she raises her son alone,

465
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,159
her career is thriving.

466
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,599
You can't find another woman like her

467
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,440
in this industry in Bincheng.

468
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,639
Who is that woman?

469
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,159
(Indeed.)

470
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,040
(She's a single mother.)

471
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,639
She works for Guanchao.

472
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,280
(It must be hard for you.)

473
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
(I'm sure it's not easy.)

474
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,319
That's admirable.

475
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,359
Of course.

476
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,359
Other single mothers
have their children's fathers

477
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,920
help even after the divorce.

478
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,879
But Ms. Min is not that fortunate.

479
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,359
Her kid is already so grown up now.

480
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:00,319
But he still doesn't know
who the father is.

481
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,280
This is a piece of groundbreaking news.

482
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,720
I never thought that Min Hui
would be someone like that.

483
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,040
This child is quite pitiful.

484
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,680
He doesn't know
who his father is, right?

485
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,720
Lin Xiyue.

486
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,079
Are you out of your mind?

487
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,760
Do you need me to sober you up?

488
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
Was I wrong?

489
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Was I not telling the truth?

490
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,680
This is bad.

491
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,040
Will Ms. Min sue me for slander?

492
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
I wonder if Ms. Min will
give us an explanation.

493
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,970
That's right.

494
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,140
She rejected me when
I asked her out for a meal.

495
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,920
Maybe she was just playing hard to get.

496
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,680
Ms. Min, say something.

497
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,839
I'm sorry, everyone.

498
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,720
Regarding Ms. Min's private matter...

499
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,920
Who says Min Hui's child
doesn't have a father?

500
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,879
Come here, son.

501
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,319
What's going on?

502
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,559
Is he Mr. Xin's son?

503
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,820
No.

504
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,559
You...

505
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,720
I am his father.

506
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,599
Xin Qi.

507
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,960
I already told you

508
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,240
that you don't have to keep this
a secret for my sake.

509
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
You and our son matter the most to me.

510
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,399
I won't let you get bullied.

511
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,559
Looks like you are very interested

512
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,000
in others' private affairs, Ms. Lin.

513
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,159
But do you know

514
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,599
that this is one of the reasons

515
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,520
why I don't want to invest in Guanchao?

516
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,119
I don't like to collaborate
with despicable people.

517
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,680
Sorry for ruining the party.

518
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,520
But it's almost time.

519
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
Min Hui and I need
to put our son to bed.

520
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
Please enjoy your night.

521
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,960
He's so cool, right?

522
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,000
He's my brother.

523
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
She's so beautiful, right?

524
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,839
She's my best friend.

525
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,119
Cheers.

526
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,599
Daddy, let me down.

527
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,440
I want to walk by myself.

528
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,119
Okay.

529
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,480

to enjoy this kind of heroic act?

542
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,760
Are you envious of them?

543
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,159
If you give me the chance,

544
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,480
I can be your hero too.

545
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,079
Really?

546
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
But for me to be heroic,

547
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,480
you'll have to be in danger first.

548
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,040
So, I'd rather if you don't
give me that chance.

549
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,440
Actually, it had been hard on Min Hui
for the past few years.

550
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,319
She had to raise her son

551
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,480
and work on her career.

552
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm really happy to see

553
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,319
where she stands today.

554
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm happy for her.

555
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:24,319
Do you know?

556
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,079
I think Xin Qi and Min Hui

557
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,440
are destined to be together.

558
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,599
Otherwise, they wouldn't have

559
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,240
run into each other again in Bincheng

560
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,599
and got back together.

561
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,760
Looks like Min Hui
has gone through a lot.

562
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,839
Xin Qi and Min Hui

563
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:37,960
knew each other from five years ago.

564
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,960
I think they met each other
in Shi'an Town.

565
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,599
The prince was bespelled by the witch.

566
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,319
Only the tears of true love

567
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,920
can turn him back to human.

568
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,280
And then,

569
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,079
they live happily ever after.

570
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:27,760
What's wrong?

571
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,599
Why did you drink so much?

572
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,399
If it's because of
what happened tonight,

573
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,599
don't let it get to it.

574
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,319
You've raised Quanquan

575
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,559
into a healthy boy.

576
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,159
I don't care what they said.

577
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,359
I have something to ask you.

578
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,200
What is it?

579
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,319
It's something very important.

580
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,240
Go ahead.

581
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,920
Enough.

582
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,920
Do you like me?

583
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,000
Forget it.

584
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,920
Don't say anything.

585
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,559
Xin Qi.

586
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,440
I think you are sick.

587
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,559
I think you have schizophrenia.

588
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,760
One moment,
you want full custody of Quanquan.

589
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,319
In the next moment,
you don't want it anymore.

590
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,119
One moment, you ask me

591
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,680
to stay away from you.

592
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,559
But in the next moment,

593
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,559
you...

594
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,000
You say that I matter the most to you.

595
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,200
You are so strange.

596
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,839
It's so hard to understand
a man's heart.

597
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm so confused.

598
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,280
Why did you...

599
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Look at me.

600
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,319
I'll give you the answer now.

601
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,839
I...

602
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,119
Actually, I...

603
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,680
That's the story.

604
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,639
It has been five years.

605
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,920
What kind of fate it is

606
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,720
that brought

607
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,480
two separated people together

608
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,839
and made them fall in love again?

609
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,159
Sometimes, I think

610
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,319
that maybe it's Heaven's will.

611
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,960
Maybe somehow,

612
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,760
that girl named Su Tian

613
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
is protecting them.

614
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,440
Don't you think so?

615
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,240
I'm tired. Let's go back.

616
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,599
What's wrong?

617
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
How kind you are.

618
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,399
You just fell asleep after
asking me that question.

619
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,920
Forget it.

620
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,480
I'll give you the answer

621
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,200
when you wake up tomorrow.

622
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,079
(Hello, Officer Deng.)

623
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,960
(Do you have news for me?)

624
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,879
According to the clues and photo
you gave us,

625
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:14,359
we've found someone
who matched the description.

626
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,040
Where is she? I'll go and find her.

627
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,960
This lady called Su Tian

628
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,520
was involved

629
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
in a bus accident

630
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,280
three years ago.

631
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,680
(It's unfortunate for that lady
named Su Tian.)

632
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
(She could've been able)

633
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,599
(to be alive together with Min Hui.)

634
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,159
(Min Hui was really lucky.)

635
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,200
What happened last night?

636
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,159
Do you like me?

637
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,960
Look at me.

638
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,359
I'll give you the answer now.

639
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,599
Oh my goodness.

640
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,960
Alcohol is such a bad thing.

641
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,839
I won't drink alcohol anymore.

642
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:30,359
No.

643
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,040
Since I already asked the question,

644
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,639
I have to get the answer.

645
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,440
Xin Qi.

646
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,399
Xin Qi.

647
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,440
You are too mean.

648
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,720
You said that you didn't want
to see me ever again.

649
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,359
Do you know how sad I was?

650
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,319
I'm sorry, Min Hui.

651
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,799
I know that you didn't tell me the truth

652
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,159
because you were afraid
that I couldn't accept it.

653
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,040
I know that you felt even worse than me.

654
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,839
I shouldn't have been so mean to you.

655
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,000
I shouldn't have broken up with you.

656
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,720
I was petty.

657
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,040
I was foolish.

658
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,599
Since you had left,

659
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,359
why did you come back?

660
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
And why are you bullying me?

661
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,639
Actually...

662
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
Actually, in the past five years,

663
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,520
I tried so hard to forget about you.

664
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,200
But I couldn't do it.

665
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Thank you for giving birth
to Quanquan alone

666
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,000
and taking such good care of him.

667
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,040
I'm sure the ordeal
that you've been through

668
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,200
is something that I can't imagine.

669
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,799
Everything is my fault.

670
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,760
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

671
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,079
I'm willing to use the rest of my life

672
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,159
to compensate for it.

673
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,200
But

674
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,280
can you give me another chance?

675
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,520
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,679
Because of my stubbornness,

677
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,559
we wasted five years of time.

678
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,079
Now, I believe

679
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,920
that everything has happened

680
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,679
for a reason.

681
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,960
The last five years that we missed

682
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:39,040
is probably a test for us,

683
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,920
so that we can see

684
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,880
the love we have for each other.

685
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,679
This...

686
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,279
You kept this?

687
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,159
You broke it five years ago
when you left.

688
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,400
I found someone to fix it.

689
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
The sunflower symbolizes

690
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,920
the yearning for a reunion.

691
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,159
As long as two hearts

692
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,559
long for each other,

693
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,279
they'll be reunited one day.

694
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,960
Yesterday, you asked me

695
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,440
whether or not I like you.

696
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,360
I think you already

697
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,199
knew my answer.

698
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,000
But I still want to tell you
in all my sincerity

699
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,480
that Min Hui,

700
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,119
I...

701
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,800
Who are you?

702
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,279
Chen Jiajun.

703
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,360
Cao Mu's boyfriend.

704
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,920
Why are you...

705
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,000
What do you want?

706
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,040
Let me ask you.

707
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,679
Five years ago,

708
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,920
did Su Tian really
die in a bus accident?

709
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,079
Did you push yourself ahead of her
in the last moment

710
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,520
to save yourself?

711
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,279
You took away her chance to live.

712
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,119
You were supposed to be
the one who died, right?

713
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
You killed Su Tian.

714
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,639
You killed my sister.

715
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,199
My biological sister!

716
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,599
Your biological sister?

717
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,940
(Five Years Ago)

718
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:33,679
Xin Qi.

719
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,679
I need to tell you something.

720
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,079
What is it?

721
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,239
Actually...

722
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,000
You can take the call first.

723
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,960
Hello, what is it?

724
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,279
(You asked me to make
a passport for Ms. Min.)

725
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,960
(But after comparing the documents,)

726
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,440
(we found out that Ms. Min
is not the Su Tian)

727
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,320
(who you've been talking about.)

728
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,159
Be specific.

729
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,440
Did something happen?

730
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,480
Who are you?

731
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:35,719
Xin Qi.

732
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,159
You said that you aren't Su Tian.

733
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,400
I didn't expect that it would be true.

734
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,000
Min Hui.

735
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,719
I should've known.

736
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,360
You are way smarter than Su Tian.

737
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,679
You have more confidence than her.

738
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,239
I thought

739
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,199
that she was finally adopted
by a good family.

740
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:57,840
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,719
Xin Qi, I'm sorry.

742
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,199
Now, can you tell me

743
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,199
where Su Tian is?

744
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,679
Why didn't she come to see me?

745
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,119
Su Tian was planning
to come and meet you.

746
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
But she got into a bus accident.

747
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,920
Su Tian has passed away.

748
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,800
Impossible.

749
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,960
I don't believe it.

750
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,159
You are lying to me, right?

751
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,320
You pretended to be Su Tian
to deceive me.

752
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
Why?

753
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,719
Say something!

754
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,400
Xin Qi, your body can't take this.

755
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:44,679
Take your medicine.

756
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:45,520
Hurry up.

757
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:46,599
Xin Qi.

758
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:50,759
Xin Qi.

759
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,679
On her last breath,
Su Tian pleaded with me to come

760
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,400
and see you

761
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,199
on her behalf,

762
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,800
and to pass that thing to you.

763
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,159
I didn't mean to deceive you, Xin Qi.

764
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,920
Then, I found out
about your health condition.

765
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,719
I was afraid that you couldn't take it

766
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,800
if you find out the truth.

767
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,360
So, I thought

768
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,800
that I could keep it a secret

769
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,960
until you get your surgery in America.

770
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,759
I thought that I could keep it from you.

771
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
But...

772
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,400
But I've fallen in love with you.

773
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,320
I've really fallen in love with you,
Xin Qi.

774
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,520
I didn't plan for this to happen.

775
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,679
I'll get you your medicine,

776
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,920
okay?

777
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,440
Get lost.

778
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,960
Get lost.

779
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,279
I don't want to see you anymore.

780
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,719
I'll leave right away.

781
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,400
Take this back, Xin Qi. I'm sorry.

782
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,360
Listen to me.

783
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,880
From now on,

784
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,400
there'll be nothing

785
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,599
between us.

786
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,239
Get lost!

787
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,360
I'll go.

788
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,719
Xin Qi!
