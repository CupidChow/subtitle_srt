=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
=Episode 20=

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,879
These don't work together.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
This looks quite nice.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
(Are you kidding me?)

28
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,720
(You don't have any outfit
that's suitable for a blind date.)

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,679
(Oh my goodness.)

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,840
(What kind of outfit
is suitable for a blind date?)

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,560
(Are they doing this for real?)

32
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,000
(I think every outfit here is suitable)

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
(for a blind date.)

34
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,840
This dress looks nice.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
(What do you mean by it's nice?)

36
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,399
(According to others,)

37
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,200
(the outfit that we wear
to a blind date is important.)

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
(First, it can't be too cheap.)

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,679
(You don't want to be looked down on.)

40
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,080
It can't be too expensive too.

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,559
What if they just want you
for your money.

42
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,040
Second, it can't be too showy.

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,160
It'll be stressful for them.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,040
But it can't be too plain as well.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,719
Otherwise, you'll look dull.

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,959
Look at this skirt.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
It looks so dull.

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,959
No.

49
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,760
This is too complicated.
I don't understand.

50
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,160
Cao Mu.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,679
If I dress up as

52
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,959
a completely different person
to go on a blind date,

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,600
isn't that deceiving?

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
How is that deceiving?

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,080
It's called positive socializing skills.

56
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:34,959
(Another thing.)

57
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,360
When you go on the blind date,

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,239
can you put more make-up on your face?

59
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,600
Apply more eye shadow and lipstick.

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,559
Go there with a pretty face, okay?

61
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,880
(Did you see that?)

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,519
(You have to do something about it.)

63
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,399
(Quanquan.)

64
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,640
(Calm down.)

65
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,160
(I'll think of something.)

66
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,480
We have to come up
with a solution at once.

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,839
I'm thinking right now.

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,119
I'm thinking.

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Quanquan.

70
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
What are you doing?

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm building a wall.

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,719
Why are you building a wall?

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,920
Min Hui, you look so ugly.

74
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Ugly? Which part is ugly?

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,399
Your outfit is ugly, your make-up
is ugly and your hair is ugly.

76
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,360
Everything is ugly.

77
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,999
That's not possible.

78
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,160
Your godmother

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,279
asked me to dress up like this.

80
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,040
It means that she has bad taste too.

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,760
You better stay at home today.

82
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,600
Hello, where are you?

83
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,080
(I'm sorry.)

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,200
(I have things to do
at the office today.)

85
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,399
(I can't leave.)

86
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,200
I won't be picking up Quanquan today.

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I'll go there next week.

88
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,279
No. You can't do that.

89
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,160
Why is he like this?

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,480
Why does he have to be busy
at this very moment?

91
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,719
What's wrong?

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
Xin Qi said that he can't pick you up

93
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
because he has work to do
at the office.

94
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,200
What should I do with you?

95
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,839
Quanquan, how about

96
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,679
you stay at Daddy Zhou's house first?

97
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm going to have dinner
with Daddy Zhou this afternoon.

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,239
Then, he can bring you along later.

99
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,679
No.

100
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,320
No?

101
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,560
How about...

102
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:20,640
What's wrong?

103
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,680
My stomach is in pain.

104
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,159
What's wrong?

105
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,479
My stomach is in pain.

106
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,279
Your stomach is in pain?

107
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,200
Is it that painful?

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,599
Looks like I have to take you
to the hospital.

109
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,479
No.

110
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,039
We have to go.

111
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,159
You are in so much pain.

112
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,919
You'll feel better after getting a shot

113
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,839
at the hospital.

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,479
It's not that painful anymore.

115
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,880
It's not painful now?

116
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,359
Quanquan.

117
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,479
You pretended to have a stomachache

118
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
and you even built a wall.

119
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Is it because you don't want me
to go on a blind date?

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,200
It's not that I'm against it.

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,760
But I don't really support it either.

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,279
Understood.

123
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
But I've already promised
to meet him today.

124
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,599
If I suddenly stand him up,

125
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,359
it'll be very rude, right?

126
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,680
How about I bring you along?

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
You can meet that person too.

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,919
If you don't like him,

129
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,240
I promise you that I won't
contact him ever again.

130
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,120
Okay?

131
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,760
Okay.

132
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,080
It's a deal then.

133
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,240
Go and get changed.

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,159
Okay.

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,719
I have to succeed. I can't fail.

136
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,700
(He is not here yet. Have I scared
him off by being a single mom?)

137
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,820
(Daddy)

138
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
Plan B.

139
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,039
Quan...

140
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,919
Quanquan, what are you doing?

141
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm practicing various
finger-tutting styles.

142
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,479
Where did you learn these from?

143
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,519
(Luckily, I can spy on my enemy
with this mirror.)

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,919
I'm looking for someone.

145
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,399
Be good later.

146
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,919
Don't cause any trouble.

147
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,519
Hello.

148
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,760
Are you Ms. Min Hui?

149
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Hello.

150
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,039
Are you Mr. Cai Wenbin?

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Yes.

152
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
I had something to take care
of at the office.

154
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,760
That's why I'm late.

155
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,240
No matter what,

156
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,200
I would like to treat you...

157
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,680
No. I would like to treat both of you
to some good food today

158
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,519
to make it up to you.

159
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,640
You are too kind. Please have a seat.

160
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,599
This smart and cute boy

161
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,120
must be your son.

162
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,599
Yes.

163
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,399
Quanquan. Greet him.

164
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,640
Quanquan.

165
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,159
He was alone at home today

166
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:01,839
without anyone to look after him.

167
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,919
So, I brought him with me.

168
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:03,839
I hope you don't mind.

169
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
Why would I mind?

170
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,080
At first, I was quite nervous to meet

171
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,159
someone as beautiful as you.

172
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,599
But with this adorable child here,

173
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,839
I feel more at ease now.

174
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,919
I like kids.

175
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,800
That's good.

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,519
It has just been a few minutes.

177
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,880
Why is she smiling so happily?

178
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,599
I've never seen you smile like that
when you're with me.

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,880
(Pretend to get hit by Cao Mu.)

180
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,039
But don't overdo it.

181
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,360
(Xin Qi's Classroom)
Don't hurt yourself.

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,440
(Xin Qi's Classroom)

183
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
(Xin Qi's Classroom)
Pay attention to this.

184
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,479
(Xin Qi's Classroom)
Make sure that she feels sorry for you.

185
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,880
(Xin Qi's Classroom)
Once she does,

186
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,519
she won't go on her blind date.

187
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,120
Look where you are going!

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,959
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,640
My leg!

190
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,320
Is this how you drive?

191
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

192
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,640
I can't even move.

193
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,959
You hit me so badly.

194
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,560
Pay me 6,000 yuan right now.

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,399
And that doesn't include the money
for my bike and medical expenses.

196
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,640
Sure. I can compensate you.

197
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,800
Show me how much your bike costs.

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
I'll pay you the original price for it.

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
Are you saying
that I'm lying about the price?

200
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,399
A female driver.

201
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,120
Your driving skill is bad.
And your personality is even worse!

202
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
You want to worm your way out, right?

203
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,839
Let me tell you.

204
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,639
I won't let you leave
until you compensate me today.

205
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,400
Since you can't settle the dispute,
let's call the police.

206
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
When the police officers are here,

207
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
they just need to check the dashcam

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,520
to find out if it's
a staged crash or not.

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,999
Even if the police are here,

210
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,400
she still has to compensate me
for hitting me.

211
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
Her car is so expensive.

212
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm sure it'll cost a lot
to fix this area.

213
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,359
I'm afraid that you'll lose
a lot of money today.

214
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,359
You can't get away from this.

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,520
Isn't your knee in pain?

216
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,440
If I see you trying to extort money
from others again,

217
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
I'll take you to the police station!

218
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Are you satisfied with this outcome,
beautiful lady?

219
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I thought that you would
be stern because you work

220
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,479
in the R&D industry.

221
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,599
I never thought that you would
be so humorous and interesting.

222
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,800
I thought that those who work
in the financial industry

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
would be meticulous and domineering too.

224
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,719
But you look like an easy-going person.

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
Plan C.

226
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,479
(Plan C)
By the way,

227
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,879
about what you said just now...

228
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,280
Quanquan.

229
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,119
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,200
You are indeed my son.

231
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,119
You are too rude.

232
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm sorry. He's still young.

233
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,639
It's okay. But back then,

234
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,879
our technology was still
in the development stage.

235
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,440
But things have progressed
so quickly in the past few years.

236
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,959
I thought that you would be bored

237
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,680
when I kept talking

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,959
about my work just now.

239
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,239
I think you are very professional.

240
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:56,800
Thank you.

241
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,560
Most importantly,

242
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,200
you are able to explain
something so professional

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,359
in layman's terms

244
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,759
for me to understand.

245
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,759
It must be because the others...

246
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:07,879
I...

247
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

248
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,520
Be good.

249
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,400
What is it?

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
(I need to talk to you
about some work matters.)

251
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,999
I'm busy now.

252
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:28,999
Can we talk later?

253
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,839
Little kid.

254
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,639
If you suck so hard on the straw,

255
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,239
your facial muscles will scrunch up,

256
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,400
and you won't be handsome
when you grow up.

257
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,959
Don't lie to me.

258
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,680
It's true.

259
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,119
My father is a doctor.

260
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,680
He has been telling me that
since I was a kid.

261
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,560
You are a handsome man.

262
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,359
Thank you.

263
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,280
But you are not
as handsome as my father.

264
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,599
I am your investor.

265
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,879
Of course this concerns me.

266
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,839
Investor?

267
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,680
Yes. You are the investor.

268
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,200
But this is my private time, right?

269
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,759
I don't care.

270
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,599
We have to talk about this in person.

271
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,479
Fine. Let's do that.

272
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,879
Tell me where you are. I'll come to you.

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
Tell me where you are.

274
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,280
I'll come to you instead.

275
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm here.

276
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,359
Mr. Xin.

277
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,040
What are you trying to do?

278
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
I...

279
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,119
It's my turn to see Quanquan today.

280
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,119
I'm here to pick him up.

281
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,920
Xin Qi, don't cause any trouble.

282
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:33,759
Daddy.

283
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,200
Are you done?

284
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm here to pick you up.

285
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm done.

286
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,920
Hello.

287
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
I am Quanquan's father.

288
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,599
We may see each other often after this.

289
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,560
Nice to meet you.

290
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,920
Mr. Cai.

291
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm sorry.

292
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,800
- Ms. Min.
- Because he...

293
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,719
It's nice to meet you today.

294
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
But I think

295
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,080
you still have a lot of things
to take care of.

296
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,999
You can contact me again
when you have settled everything.

297
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm sorry.

298
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,239
Farewell.

299
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,400
Is it painful?

300
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes.

301
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,440
Serves you right.

302
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,440
Why did you chase after me?

303
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,359
I wanted to stop you
from going on a blind date.

304
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,400
That's none of your business.

305
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,280
How is that none of my business?

306
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,280
Why is it your business?

307
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,479
You don't know how
I had lived in the past few days.

308
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,320
When I was swimming a few days ago,

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,200
I choked on the water because
I was distracted by thinking about you.

310
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Liar.

311
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,400
With your skills,
you can swim in your sleep.

312
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm not lying to you.

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
Other than my stupidity last time,
the only thing on my mind now

314
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,040
is you.

315
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:42,719
Cao Mu.

316
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,599
I know that we haven't
been together for long.

317
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,560
But I can't get used
to a life without you.

318
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,879
I feel so heartbroken

319
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,520
when you ignore me.

320
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,359
Remember to change the dressing

321
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,759
on your hand when you go back.

322
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,280
Don't let it get infected.

323
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,200
So, you still like me, right?

324
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,999
You are just imagining it.
I don't like you.

325
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,479
You got hurt because
you chased after my car.

326
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,759
And you helped me just now.

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,520
So, for someone with virtues like me,

328
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,719
I can't just leave you be.

329
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,080
Another thing, you were too reckless.

330
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,879
You followed my car and rode so fast.

331
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,359
Don't you know how dangerous it was?

332
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,759
What if something happened to you?

333
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,320
I couldn't help it
when I thought about you

334
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,160
meeting another man.

335
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,999
I couldn't care less about my safety.

336
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,160
You can't even protect yourself.

337
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,359
How can you protect me
if we are together after this?

338
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,999
Are you going to reconcile with me?

339
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
Says who?

340
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,239
No. You said it just now.

341
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
You said that you wanted
to get back together with me.

342
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,999
Didn't it mean
that you'll reconcile with me?

343
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,119
Did I say anything just now?

344
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:43,839
No.

345
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,560
I didn't say anything.

346
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,479
What did I say just now?

347
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:45,959
Nothing.

348
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
You said it!

349
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,420
♪I've been tracing back♪

350
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,839
Let's get back together again.

351
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
You are not mad at me anymore, right?

352
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,719
First, you invited yourself
into my house

353
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,560
without my permission.

354
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,239
Then, you colluded with Quanquan

355
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,280
to ruin my blind date today.

356
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,959
You kept violating my boundaries

357
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,280
without any care.

358
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,920
Is this how you court someone?

359
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,479
I didn't do those things on purpose.

360
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,400
I did those things on purpose.

361
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm sorry

362
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
if I've made you unhappy.

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,520
But...

364
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,719
But I did those things

365
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,560
because of my feelings for you.

366
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,719
Your feelings?

367
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,160
You can't use that as an excuse

368
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,200
to do as you please, Xin Qi.

369
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,119
I feel like I don't even know you now.

370
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,719
I don't know myself too.

371
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,680
I don't know why I've turned into this.

372
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,959
Maybe I've become twisted
because of jealousy.

373
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
I can't accept

374
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,280
that you rather go on a blind date
with a stranger

375
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,639
instead of giving me

376
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,160
a chance to start over.

377
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,599
Do you really want to know why?

378
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,800
Let me tell you.

379
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,479
It's because there aren't many

380
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,680
misunderstandings and estrangements
between me and him.

381
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,400
And being Quanquan's mother will not be

382
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,839
a factor for him to accept me.

383
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,440
Me too.

384
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:09,520
No.

385
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,119
How can I make you believe me?

386
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:11,839
You don't have to prove it.

387
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,920
And I don't want
to believe in you anymore.

388
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,999
Just accept it, Xin Qi.

389
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,639
We met at that period of time

390
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,719
and we went through
that kind of situation.

391
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,080
And this is the end result.

392
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,119
We can't change it.

393
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,119
I won't accept it.

394
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,800
I won't give up.

395
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,479
What's the point?

396
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,040
Now, I just want to go back

397
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,800
to the time when I don't know you.

398
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,080
Today is your day with Quanquan.

399
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,479
Go and have fun with him.

400
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,999
I have to leave now.

401
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,440
Where are you going?

402
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,479
Take good care of Quanquan.

403
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,599
Where is Min Hui going?

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,400
She abandoned

405
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,879
both of us.

406
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,140
(Jiaren Hospital)

407
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,879
This way, please.

408
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,719
Chairman.

409
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,920
Mr. Cheng, Mrs. Cheng.

410
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,599
Chairman, how are you feeling today?

411
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:26,839
I'm feeling good.

412
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm glad to see you
in such a good spirit.

413
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,800
We lost a decision maker
when you fell ill.

414
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,359
There are a lot of things
that we can't proceed.

415
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,680
We are worried about it.

416
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,119
As an employee of the company,

417
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,119
you just need to do your job.

418
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
You don't have to worry
about other things.

419
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,759
Father.

420
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,359
Father.

421
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
Actually, Ms. Lin

422
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,239
is just doing this
for the sake of the company.

423
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:53,959
Look.

424
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,080
Now that you've fallen ill,

425
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,520
the company is without its leader.

426
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,359
But now is a critical moment
for Guanchao.

427
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,520
Don't you think you should

428
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,679
appoint someone

429
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,040
to take care of the company for now?

430
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,480
Father.

431
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:13,720
Father.

432
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I

433
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,679
am tried.

434
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,159
I'm going to sleep now.

435
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,480
Sleep.

436
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay.

437
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Okay now.

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,399
Mr. Cheng. Our finance director
needs to talk to you.

439
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,679
Go ahead and get back to your work.

440
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
I'll get going now, Father.

441
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,639
I thought you wanted
to have dinner together.

442
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,000
Why are we here?

443
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,080
You'll find out later.

444
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:57,839
Let's go.

445
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,000
What do you think?
This place is beautiful, right?

446
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,040
You've never been here, right?

447
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,960
It's indeed quite beautiful.

448
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,800
Here.

449
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,480
Look.

450
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,439
What do you think?

451
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,320
It's huge.

452
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
Why are we here?

453
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,599
To confess.

454
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,960
No.

455
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,599
Why are you so shocked?

456
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,560
Do you think that I'm going
to confess my love to you?

457
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,639
If it was true,

458
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,800
what would you do?

459
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,919
I'm not sure.

460
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,760
- You are a nice lady. But...
- Enough. I'll stop playing with you.

461
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,439
You are so serious.

462
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,240
I don't know what I like about you.

463
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,720
This is indeed

464
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,199
a place for someone to confess.

465
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,199
But I'm not the one
who will be confessing my love.

466
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,040
It's you.

467
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,760
Me?

468
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,439
Yes.

469
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,280
I had invited Ms. Min Hui to come here.

470
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,320
When she's here later,

471
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,480
confess the feelings

472
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
that you have for her all these years.

473
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,839
I'm sure she'll be so touched.

474
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,240
No. But I...

475
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,800
That is...

476
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,240
No buts.

477
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,000
If you like her,
you have to let her know.

478
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,839
Do you want to stay by her side

479
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,720
and watch while she falls in love
with another man?

480
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,119
No. That's true.

481
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,679
But the thing is, I...

482
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,560
Enough.

483
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
Later, I'll show you

484
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,159
the love confession kit
that I've prepared for you.

485
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,439
By the way,

486
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,480
you know what to say to Ms. Min Hui

487
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
when she is here later, right?

488
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,520
I knew it.

489
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,560
It's okay.

490
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,639
I'll help you till the end.

491
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,919
Let's rehearse for it.

492
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,080
We can rehearse it?

493
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,359
Of course.

494
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,439
Come. Let's go up first.

495
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,080
Do you know

496
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,560
how it feels to keep
watching over someone

497
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
from the back?

498
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,919
Do you know

499
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,359
that when you are happy,

500
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,159
I'll be happy too.

501
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
When you are sad,

502
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,879
I'll be more depressed than you.

503
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,399
I want to give the best
of everything to you.

504
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,000
But I'm afraid that you won't accept it.

505
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,000
But I don't want
to wait hopelessly anymore.

506
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,800
I like you.

507
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
Min Hui.

508
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:36,480
I like you.

509
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,879
Can you be my girlfriend?

510
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
What do you think?

511
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
Don't you feel touched?

512
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,720
Let me tell you.

513
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,119
This last step
is the most important step.

514
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,720
You need to look at her eyes

515
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,919
with deep affection.

516
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,119
Then, say the last sentence.

517
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,199
Can you...

518
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,320
I understand now.

519
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,560
Okay.

520
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,800
Let's rehearse it officially this time.

521
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,399
Min...

522
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,639
I don't remember

523
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,599
when I started to fall in love with you.

524
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,599
Maybe it was when you acted so tough

525
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,879
when you brought
Quanquan to the hospital.

526
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,439
Or maybe

527
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,919
it was when you looked so confident

528
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,960
when you achieved something.

529
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,599
Or maybe when you were at home...

530
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
- What are you doing, Zhou Ruji?
- I...

531
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,320
Be serious.

532
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
I told you.

533
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,240
You have to look at her eyes.

534
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's do it again.

535
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,199
I like to listen to you when you talk
about nonsensical things so seriously.

536
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,520
You are the sad second male lead
in her story.

537
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,839
But in my story,

538
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,280
you are definitely the first male lead.

539
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,320
I won't treat you
like an expendable person.

540
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,919
I'll give you

541
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,119
the best happy ending.

542
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,960
I like to watch you
when you laugh with so much joy.

543
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,599
I'm happy whenever I'm with him.

544
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,320
I even like it when
you are being unreasonable.

545
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,919
I'm someone

546
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,399
who will marry Daddy Zhou in the future.

547
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,119
I like to see the dazzling light

548
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,839
in your eyes.

549
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
You are the light in my eyes.

550
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:43,159
I...

551
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:47,800
Zhou Ruji.

552
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,439
You've surpassed me.

553
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,839
Even I was almost affected by you.

554
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,760
I believe that Min Hui
will feel touched too.

555
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,520
The view here is amazing.

556
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,119
You haven't seen
Cai Wenbin's face today.

557
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
It's obvious that he thinks of me

558
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,480
as a playgirl.

559
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,119
Xin Qi has ruined my reputation.

560
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,720
I won't forgive him.

561
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,599
Yes.

562
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Do not ever forgive him, okay?

563
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,960
No need to panic.

564
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,919
I'll find a better man
for you next time.

565
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
Forget it.

566
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,760
He may do something

567
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
even worse next time.

568
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,639
You just have to keep it
a secret from him.

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I wonder

570
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,639
who is the traitor

571
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,280
this time.

572
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,480
Who else other than Quanquan?

573
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
What about you?

574
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,320
Me?

575
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,480
It was a failure too.

576
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,320
We can't find the right man
on our first try.

577
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,439
We have to try a few more times.

578
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:53,080
Let's work harder next time.

579
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,639
We'll see.

580
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:57,080
By the way, I'm going to have dinner
with Zhou Ruji today.

581
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,800
I have to hang up now.

582
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,960
Okay. Bye.

583
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,919
Why didn't you tell Ms. Min Hui
that we have gotten back together?

584
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,639
I just told her

585
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,879
that I would forget about you.

586
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,159
I'm embarrassed to tell her

587
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,159
that I've gotten back together
with you so quickly.

588
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,240
I don't want her to look down on me.

589
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,879
We have gotten back together.

590
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,679
Why did you tell her
that you would go on more blind dates?

591
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,599
I did it

592
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,280
to encourage her.

593
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,199
With my company,

594
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,040
she'll be more willing
to go on those blind dates.

595
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,879
But why won't you help Mr. Xin Qi?

596
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,480
Why are you encouraging Ms. Min Hui
to go on those blind dates?

597
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:26,919
You don't know
how pitiful Mr. Xin Qi is.

598
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,439
That's because you didn't see

599
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,439
how pitiful Min Hui was
because of Xin Qi.

600
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,679
I don't care.

601
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,760
I just hope that my best friend can find
the happiness she deserves.

602
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
I don't care whom the happiness is from.

603
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,359
If Xin Qi can make Min Hui happy,

604
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,879
she'll go back to him.

605
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,040
The Ferris wheel?

606
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,599
Can we eat on a Ferris wheel?

607
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,560
Why are you doing this?

608
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,919
What do you mean?

609
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,480
You say that you like me, right?

610
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,520
Why are you helping me
to confess to Min Hui?

611
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Maybe

612
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,919
it's because I like you.

613
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,760
So, I don't want to see you

614
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
hurting for not being able
to get the love you want.

615
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,960
I feel bad for you.

616
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,159
I want to help you.

617
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,199
I want you to find
the happiness you deserve.

618
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,599
I like you.

619
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,760
I really like you.

620
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,040
But I know

621
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
that love can't be forced.

622
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,839
I had done

623
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,560
a lot of things all this while.

624
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,879
But I still can't make you
fall in love with me.

625
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,599
So, I think

626
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,119
it's time for me to give up.

627
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,500
♪'Cause I always love you♪

628
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,560
They say

629
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,040
that love is letting go and being brave.

630
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,480
Just accept this

631
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,679
as my last gift to you out of my love.

632
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,940
♪'Cause I always love you♪

633
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,960

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Be brave and confess
to the person you love.

635
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,599
You have to succeed.

636
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,439
I'll only be happy

637
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,720

I have to go.

All the best. You can do it.

644

Zhou Ruji.

645
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,960
Zhou Ruji.

646
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,760
Why did you ask me to come here?

647
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,240
(I like you.)

648

(But I know)

(that love can't be forced.)

653
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,240
It's time for me to give up.

654
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,599
There are so many flowers here.

655
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,080
Min Hui.

656
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,320
These are prepared for you.

657
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,800
I used to like you.

658
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,199
I fell for you when I first saw you

659
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,520
four years ago.

660
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,439
I...

661
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,040
Well...

662
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,280
Let me finish first.

663
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,839
When I first saw you,

664
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,599
I admired you for
your courage and determination.

665
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,880
You raised Quanquan alone

666
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,280
(Jiaren Hospital)
who had congenital heart disease.

667
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,720
But you never complained about it.

668
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,639
You just wanted to have a better life.

669
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,919
But as time passed by,

670
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,119
I became Quanquan's attending physician.

671
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,599
And I became your neighbor.

672
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,639
I realized that I started to treat you

673
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,080
more than just the family of my patient.

674
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,199
I started to want to get closer to you

675
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,560
and help you more.

676
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,040
I wanted to do everything
that can benefit

677
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,359
you and Quanquan.

678
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,599
I knew that it was a one-sided love.

679
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,679
I knew that you only thought of me

680
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,119
as a good friend.

681
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,080
In the past four years,

682
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,240
you were the only one I liked.

683
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,560
But

684
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:36,560
when we are standing

685
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,240
face-to-face like this today,

686
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,439
I'm thinking

687
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,159
about another woman instead.

688
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,800
I understand now.

689
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,399
You already know what you want

690
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,000
when you tell me about your feelings.

691
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,639
So, this is not a love confession.

692
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,000
You are just being honest
with me, right?

693
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,480
That's right.

694
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,480
After all, I had liked you
for so many years.

695
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,199
I should at least

696
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,560
tell you about it

697
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,159
so that I can give myself
a proper ending.

698
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,639
Let's get to know each other once again.

699
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,639
I am Quanquan's attending physician.

700
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,000
And I'm also your neighbor, Zhou Ruji.

701
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm going to chase
after my happiness now.

702
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,280
I hope that you can be happy too.

703
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,159
I'm really happy for you.

704
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,119
All the best.

705
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,679
Since I've decided to give up,

706
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:17,919
it should be clean-cut.

707
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,639
All the best, Yao Zizhu.

708
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,880
(Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed is powered off.)

709
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,900
(Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed is powered off.)

710
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,639
Xin Qi.

711
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,800
You need to work hard.

712
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,439
I really don't want to call
another man daddy.

713
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,119
Now, I don't know

714
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
who to work hard on.

715
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,599
Mr. Xin.

716
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,879
Mr. Xin Qi.

717
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,480
Quanquan.

718
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,639
Uncle Chen.

719
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,320
I'll get to work now.

720
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,560
Uncle Chen!

721
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,280
Have you gone mad
after getting hit by Cao Mu?

722
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,119
You look so happy.

723
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,159
Because everything is fine now.

724
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,320
I've reconciled with her.
Of course I'm happy.

725
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,080
What?

726
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,919
You've reconciled with her?

727
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,119
How?

728
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:30,919
How could you have succeeded

729
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,240
while I have failed?

730
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,199
No.

731
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,240
That's a wrong mindset.

732
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,399
I succeeded.

733
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,879
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

734
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,399
You are such a jealous type.

735
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,639
No wonder you failed.

736
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,359
What did you say?

737
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,199
Nothing.

738
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,560
I...

739
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,480
I think

740
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,839
that you should let go

741
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,399
of your emulation and pride
when it's necessary.

742
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,639
I'm being truthful.

743
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,879
I already did.

744
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,520
They are as low as they can go.

745
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
No. I think it's not enough.

746
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,480
You are still being stubborn.

747
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,040
I think you should learn from me.

748
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,359
Be charming and act cute
when you need to.

749
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:16,399
You can even act pitiful.

750
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,639
But only do it when
you are trying to coax them.

751
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,520
All women have the maternal instinct.

752
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,639
If you can arouse her maternal instinct,

753
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,560
it's more likely

754
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,359
that she won't abandon you.

755
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,199
Even if we ignore the fact
that it doesn't suit my personality,

756
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,639
don't you think
that this is a little bit

757
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,199
underhanded?

758
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,960
Wasn't it underhanded for you to ruin

759
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
her blind date today?

760
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,320
As long as your intention is well

761
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,439
and you are not hurting anyone,

762
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,520
the method doesn't matter.

763
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,359
Daddy.

764
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,480
Are you really not going

765
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,760
to take Uncle Chen's advice?

766
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,439
I think it'll be effective.

767
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,720
No.

768
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,560
A real man will prefer
death to humiliation.

769
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,599
Remember this, my son.

770
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
As a man, you need to have a backbone.

771
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,159
Quanquan, let's go home.

772
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,560
Why are you back so late?

773
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,560
Did you go on

774
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,399
other blind dates in the afternoon?

775
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,760
Yes.

776
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,040
I went on eight blind dates
this afternoon.

777
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,240
Every one of them is great.

778
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,280
One of them

779
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,439
is so gentle and handsome.

780
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,000
It's love at first sight.

781
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,240
I've already decided to get
into a relationship with him.

782
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,159
So, stay away.

783
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,080
Daddy!

784
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:37,879
What's wrong?

785
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,599
What's wrong?

786
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:40,320
Are you feeling ill again?

787
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,599
Quanquan, I'll call 120.

788
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,879
Min Hui.

789
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,919
Shouldn't you perform CPR on him?

790
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,720
I don't know how to perform CPR.

791
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,520
I don't know how to do that too.

792
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,040
Hurry up.

793
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,040
CPR?

794
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,800
You need CPR?

795
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,560
Yes. You do.

796
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,520
This CPR is quite effective.

797
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,480
What happened to me?

798
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,199
It must be because of hypoglycemia.

799
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:36,880
I haven't eaten the whole day.

800
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,239
If you feel dizzy,

801
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,360
you can lie down here for a while.

802
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,400
Quanquan, let's go.

803
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,360
Daddy.

804
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Let's go.

805
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,799
Help me get up.

806
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:45,639
Are you really leaving?

807
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,440
All of Chen Jiajun's suggestions
are useless.

808
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,719
Min Hui.

809
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,400
Min Hui.

810
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
She has even changed the password.

811
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,239
Quanquan.

812
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,880
Quanquan.

813
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,199
Min Hui said

814
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,639
that we don't welcome someone who lies.

815
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,599
Whose side are you on?

816
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:27,040
Yours.

817
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,119
But Min Hui said

818
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,440
that if I let you in,

819
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,759
she'll kick me out too.

820
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,599
These are from Min Hui.

821
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,599
Are you really not going to let me in?

822
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,520
She said that she was
not worried about me.

823
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,920
But the chocolates
are in the shape of love.

824
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:21,400
Zizhu.

825
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,440
Finally, you are back.

826
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,639
Why are you here?

827
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,520
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

828
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,440
You even switched it off.

829
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,560
I waited the whole night for you.

830
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
You waited for me?

831
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Did something go wrong with the venue?

832
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:38,840
It shouldn't have.

833
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,239
I had everything planned out.

834
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,440
Nothing should go wrong.

835
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,319
No.

836
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,159
It's because...

837
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,239
Aren't you afraid
of gaining weight anymore?

838
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm heartbroken.

839
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,639
Can't I treat myself for once?

840
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,040
You are not heartbroken.

841
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,960
Shouldn't you be with Min Hui now?

842
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,639
Why are you here?

843
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,239
Zizhu, I like you.

844
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,719
I did like Min Hui at first.

845
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,920
But I don't like her now.

846
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,920
No. Why?

847
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,159
Did she reject you?

848
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,679
No.

849
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,119
She didn't reject you.

850
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:31,000
Did she say that she likes you?

851
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,639
No. She doesn't like me.

852
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,920
No. Why?

853
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,679
I taught you everything, right?

854
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,199
No.

855
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,159
What did she say after that?

856
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:37,840
No.

857
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,360
I liked her at first.

858
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,040
But I like you now.

859
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:42,759
No.

860
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,000
I like her.

861
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
But I like you now.

862
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,040
No.

863
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,639
I realized in the end

864
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,360
that I don't like her.

865
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
I like you.

866
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,560
She said that she doesn't like me.

867
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,520
So, I'm here for you.

868
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,239
Because I think that you...

869
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:52,880
So, you are here

870
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,599
because you know
that she doesn't like you

871
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,360
and you can't be together with her.

872
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,040
No.

873
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Who do you think I am, Zhou Ruji?

874
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:00,840
Yes.

875
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,440
I like you.

876
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,960
I really like you.

877
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,080
I like you so much that I don't care

878
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,400
even if you don't like me.

879
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,319
You don't have to like me.

880
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:10,639
You can reject my love.

881
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,719
But don't use me as a substitute.

882
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,679
I don't think of you as a substitute.

883
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,719
I hate you.

884
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,159
Zizhu.

885
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,639
I... Zizhu.

886
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,599
I...

887
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,639
I...

888
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,719
What am I talking about?

889
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,199
Okay. If everything goes as planned,

890
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,880
I'll go to Jiangbei in two days.

891
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,679
I'm more familiar
with three of the hospitals there.

892
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,639
I have talked to them before this.

893
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,840
They are very interested in your

894
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,920
AI heart modeling technology.

895
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,639
It shouldn't be an issue
to put it to clinical use.

896
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:48,960
Are you going to go there yourself?

897
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,599
He Haixiang said

898
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,759
that the AI heart modeling technology
is our most important project.

899
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,159
I can't treat this lightly.

900
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,920
Finally, he sees the importance
of this project.

901
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,279
It's not because of that.

902
00:38:58,279 --> 00:38:59,880
It's because Xin Qi has increased
the amount of investment.

903
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Of course He Haixiang
is willing to support it.

904
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,440
By the way, Cao Mu.

905
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,360
Please arrange

906
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,560
more blind dates for me.

907
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,960
You still haven't given up?

908
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,080
We have to look forward in life.

909
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,759
What if I find someone suitable?

910
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,759
Okay.

911
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,759
I'll arrange for that.

912
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,719
(Min Hui still wants
to go on blind dates.)

913
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,279
(Don't let anyone know
that you heard this from me.)

914
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,700
(Blue Jay Investment)

915
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,820
(Let's have lunch together.)

916
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,119
Maybe you should just call her.

917
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,639
Even if you stare at your phone,

918
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,400
Ms. Min Hui won't reply to you
on WeChat.

919
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:10,960
What do you know?

920
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,840
She's not replying because she's busy.

921
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,319
It has just been
one hour and 56 minutes.

922
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm patient.

923
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,080
If you miss Ms. Min Hui,

924
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:26,520
buy something and visit her
at Be Agile Med Tech.

925
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,599
Give her a surprise.

926
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:28,639
Surprise.

927
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,199
Which novel did you learn it from again?

928
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
If I go to her,

929
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,759
won't it seem like I'm not manly enough?

930
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,759
It doesn't suit my personality.

931
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,480
When you say that,

932
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,279
it does seem that way.

933
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,000
According to the novels,

934
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,920
aggressive women can't resist
pestering suitors.

935
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,040
You need to be more proactive.

936
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
Forget it.

937
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:53,799
I can't trust

938
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,119
you and Chen Jiajun anymore.

939
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
How can you say that?

940
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,799
It has been two hours.

941
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,360
Hardy, it has been two hours.

942
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,639
She still hasn't replied to me
on WeChat.

943
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,239
Two hours.

944
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,159
Did something happen to her?

945
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,799
It's possible.

946
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,840
Maybe you should call her.

947
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,960
She won't think
that I'm annoying, right?

948
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,080
Definitely not.

949
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,860
(Chen Jiajun)

950
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,679
What is it? Spill it.

951
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:22,840
