=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 15=

25
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,521
Xin Qi, come in.

26
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,241
Where's Min Hui?

27
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,722
Mommy is taking a shower.

28
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:52,481
Are you here to apologize to her?

29
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,401
Apologize?

30
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,041
For what?

31
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:57,681
What did she tell you?

32
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,241
She didn't tell me anything.

33
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,002
But I can tell she's mad at you.

34
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,601
You should go and comfort her later.

35
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:07,442
That's how Mommy is.
You need to comfort her.

36
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:10,081
How do you know Min Hui so well
at this age?

37
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,442
Of course, I know her.

38
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:16,601
What are you watching, Quanquan?

39
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,442
Adults never keep their promises.

40
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:21,722
Min Hui said she would take me camping

41
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,122
when you came back
from your business trip.

42
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:25,041
But we never went.

43
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,081
She didn't tell me about it.

44
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,641
Min Quanquan,

45
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,761
did I not tell you not

46
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,682
to open the door for anyone at night?

47
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,481
He's Xin Qi, not just anyone.

48
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:41,201
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,682
I want to talk to you.

50
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:48,801
Quanquan,

51
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,442
go inside.

52
00:02:58,641 --> 00:02:59,442
So

53
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:00,601
what is it you want to talk about?

54
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,801
Cindy told me about your conversation.

55
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,122
She misused the idioms.

56
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:08,402
So you got her wrong.

57
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,321
She may misuse the idioms.

58
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,201
But the intention isn't, right?

59
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:13,321
Didn't your sister come

60
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,162
to help you win Quanquan?

61
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,361
Look at this first.

62
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,020
(Parental Waiver of Custodial Rights)

63
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,361
You're willing to give up Quanquan?

64
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:33,361
Why?

65
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,002
Didn't you do all those things

66
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,321
to take Quanquan away?

67
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,601
I still do even now.

68
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:42,921
But after spending time with him,

69
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,722
I realized you're irreplaceable

70
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:47,562
in Quanquan's heart.

71
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:49,722
I don't want him to choose

72
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,361
between his father and mother
at such a young age.

73
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,442
It's too cruel for him.

74
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,481
And I know you can't live

75
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,641
without Quanquan either.

76
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:05,481
Are you sure you won't regret it?

77
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,201
It's useless if I do.

78
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,122
The law doesn't permit it.

79
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:20,121
See Quanquan once a week?

80
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,441
That's my bottom line.

81
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:24,842
Fine.

82
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:27,601
Wait.

83
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:29,241
Why?

84
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,642
Are you having second thoughts
now I'm about to sign it?

85
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:31,882
It's not that.

86
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:33,522
I just...

87
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,601
Can I take Quanquan out

88
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,681
to have fun tomorrow?

89
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:38,601
Of course, you can join us

90
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:40,162
if you want.

91
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:42,921
Sorry.

92
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,842
You've already used up

93
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:46,882
your weekly visit quota.

94
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,601
It says once a week, right?

95
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,642
Besides, we have other plans tomorrow.

96
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,041
Now that the agreement is signed,

97
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:02,681
we'll adhere to it

98
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:05,441
from now on.

99
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:08,162
You can leave now.

100
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:23,322
Xin Qi, see you soon.

101
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,202
Remember to take me out to play, okay?

102
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:28,082
Then go to bed early, okay?

103
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,561
Bye.

104
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:31,522
Bye.

105
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,361
Quanquan,
were you eavesdropping just now?

106
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,642
Aren't you going home?

107
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,202
We have a meeting tomorrow.

108
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,642
Let's go home early.

109
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,762
What does that Weibo post mean?

110
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,882
What Weibo post?

111
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:07,962
Are you stupid

112
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,522
or do you think I'm stupid?

113
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:10,762
Do you want me to find someone now

114
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:11,801
and track down the IP address

115
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:12,642
of that Weibo account?

116
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:15,361
I love you so much.

117
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,681
I've done so much for you.

118
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:21,402
When you kissed me,
you called out Min Hui's name.

119
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,882
Me? Calling out Min Hui's name?

120
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:25,962
When did I do that?

121
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,241
You did!

122
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,842
You always praise her and put me down.

123
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:33,522
Do you know how much
that hurts my self-esteem?

124
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,522
Since you don't care about me,

125
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:37,481
I won't let you two have it easy too.

126
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:39,561
You're always like this.

127
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,202
You're always this petty.

128
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,082
That's why you can't achieve anything.

129
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,642
If things don't go well with me,

130
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,322
do you think you'll have it easy?

131
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,801
I don't care if it doesn't.

132
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:49,962
It has already been bad for me
from the beginning.

133
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,601
For you,

134
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,361
I betrayed my friend
and did many bad things.

135
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,121
I'm already on a bad path,

136
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,522
and getting more astray.

137
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:00,801
The Zheng family cares
about their image the most, right?

138
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,001
Then I'd like to know

139
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,962
what they'll do to you,

140
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:05,882
the one who makes them lose face

141
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:07,601
after everyone knows about our affair.

142
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,722
You're acting

143
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,001
like a child again.

144
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,801
Every time you get angry,

145
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,121
you act like a child.

146
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,402
And you talk about going down together.

147
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,481
Don't say that again in the future.

148
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:34,842
I admit I haven't been
in a great mood lately.

149
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,082
I've said a lot of mean things to you.

150
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:40,522
But that just proves how much I care
about you and trust you.

151
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,202
I don't want to pretend in front of you.

152
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:44,202
You're different

153
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:45,642
from everyone else in my heart.

154
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,402
But I still can't be compared
to Min Hui, can I?

155
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,322
You're the one

156
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:52,681
I like.

157
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,481
You know how to make me happy.

158
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,481
Well, have you seen me
comforting anyone else?

159
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,121
Can't I attend

160
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,361
the Intelligence Summit
in Shanghai?

161
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,082
All the top people
in the industry will be there.

162
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,882
I also want to expand my horizon.

163
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,041
Okay.

164
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:15,722
We'll take it

165
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,882
as a vacation.

166
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,841
Quanquan, the zoo is fun too.

167
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:36,522
There are many adorable animals there.

168
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:37,441
I didn't prepare anything

169
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,041
to go camping this time.

170
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,122
Why don't we go next time?

171
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:42,002
But you promised me.

172
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,002
I...

173
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,801
Yes, Cao Mu?

174
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,482
(So are you guys having fun?)

175
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,762
Okay, I'll let you talk to her.

176
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,180
(Cao Mu)
Godmother, I miss you.

177
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:57,242
Godmother, Min Hui broke her promise.

178
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,362
She's not taking me to go camping.

179
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,482
You little brat.

180
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:01,882
Why are you calling for backup?

181
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,402
(You came to
the right person this time.)

182
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,081
Do you know
what surprise I've prepared for you?

183
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,882
What is it?

184
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,201
Look ahead.

185
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,882
Are you Ms. Min Hui?

186
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:18,482
Yes.

187
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:20,362
Ms. Cao rented this vehicle for you.

188
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:22,482
You rented this car?

189
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,122
Yes, I rented a car for you.

190
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,801
There is camping equipment in the car.

191
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,801
And I also helped you choose a campsite.

192
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,282
So am I thoughtful?

193
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:31,362
Godmother is awesome!

194
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:34,441
Cao Mu, how did you know

195
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,841
Quanquan wants to go camping?

196
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:39,561
Sorry, what?

197
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,602
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

198
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:42,642
The signal is fine though.

199
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,362
I told her.

200
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,081
You told her?

201
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,482
Yes, Quanquan told me.

202
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,961
When did he tell you that?

203
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:54,321
Mommy, I want to go camping.

204
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:57,522
Come on, Mommy.

205
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:58,882
Okay, fine.

206
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,282
Since we're free today,

207
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,002
we'll go and have fun today, okay?

208
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,921
(That's right.
You should enjoy the day.)

209
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,321
So I'm hanging up now. Bye.

210
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:10,841
That was close.

211
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,561
I hope everything goes well.

212
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,041
Or else Min Hui will blame me.

213
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,321
Min Hui.

214
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:23,721
Listen,

215
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,282
camping is fun.

216
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,522
I'll teach you
how to set up a tent later.

217
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,961
Okay, please teach me later.

218
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,642
Mommy, there's sand over there.

219
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,242
Sand?

220
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,721
It's all sand!

221
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,362
That's the sea!

222
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,482
And there are horses too!

223
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,961
Mommy, this place is so beautiful!

224
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,801
This place looks amazing.

225
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,841
Your godmother really knows
how to pick a spot.

226
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,441
Do you like it?

227
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,561
I love it.

228
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:04,561
Okay,

229
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,002
let's call your godmother

230
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:07,402
and thank her, okay?

231
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,402
Okay.

232
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,522
Here you go.

233
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,602
Let me lend you a hand.

234
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,002
Godmother, this place is beautiful.

235
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:17,882
Really? Do you like it?

236
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,162
I do.

237
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,561
I'm glad you like it.

238
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,841
Cao Mu, not bad.

239
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,081
You made such a thorough preparation.

240
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,362
You even prepared children's
mosquito repellent.

241
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,602
What mosquito repellent?

242
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,841
Children's mosquito repellent.

243
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,002
It's in this transparent box.

244
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:35,841
Didn't you prepare it?

245
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,402
Ah, yes. I did.

246
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:40,362
Who else would have prepared it?

247
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:41,961
I'm busy now. So you guys have fun.

248
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:42,721
I have to go now.

249
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,402
Bye.

250
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,321
(Cao Mu...)

251
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,321
Mommy, what's wrong?

252
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,321
Something is fishy.

253
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,242
Never mind.

254
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,041
Quanquan, let's set up the tent, okay?

255
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,201
Time to set up the tent.

256
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,041
Okay!

257
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:07,882
Mr. Xin,

258
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,201
there may be hundreds

259
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,882
of camping sites in Shanghai.

260
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,961
We still have our advantages here.

261
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,002
Look at this unique natural resources

262
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,402
and scenery.

263
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:22,561
These cannot be compared
to other places.

264
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,122
Min Hui, do you know
how to set up the tent or not?

265
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,402
Quanquan, didn't you say
you know how to do it

266
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,321
and will teach me how to set it up?

267
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:32,721
I've read your proposal.

268
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:33,642
The problem isn't big.

269
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,081
As for whether we'll collaborate or not,

270
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,362
let me think about it.

271
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,561
Of course.

272
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:39,642
Let me study how to set it up.

273
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:40,441
Quanquan!

274
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,162
Daddy, what are you doing here?

275
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:47,762
I had a talk with Mr. Wang here.

276
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,362
I didn't expect
to run into you guys here.

277
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,081
What a coincidence.

278
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,041
Yeah, what are the odds, huh?

279
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:56,122
Mr. Xin,

280
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,602
how can we let your wife and son

281
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,921
set up the tent themselves?

282
00:12:58,921 --> 00:12:59,961
I'll get someone here to help out.

283
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,801
You can just rest here.

284
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,002
Oh, it's okay.

285
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,122
We can do it ourselves.

286
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:04,522
You can continue with your discussion.

287
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:05,162
We won't be in your way.

288
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,522
Quanquan, come here. Don't disturb them.

289
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,002
We're not busy at all.

290
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,242
You see...

291
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:12,482
Mr. Wang and I have finished
our discussion.

292
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,482
Ah, yes.

293
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:17,362
We're done discussing.

294
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:18,482
We'll keep in touch later.

295
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:19,721
Okay, you guys go ahead and have fun.

296
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,841
Call me if you need anything.

297
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,201
Okay.

298
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,081
All right, bye.

299
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,162
Thank you.

300
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,921
Mommy, I want to set up
the tent with Daddy.

301
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,002
Quanquan,
you said you'll do it yourself.

302
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:33,921
But other kids

303
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:36,362
set it up with their parents.

304
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:37,961
Fine.

305
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:39,561
You two can set the tent up.

306
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,081
I'll make some coffee.

307
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,402
Yeah! Daddy, let's go.

308
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:46,201
Okay.

309
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:56,482
Mommy,

310
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:57,282
help us out.

311
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,201
What's the matter?

312
00:13:58,201 --> 00:13:59,522
That's too long.

313
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:00,762
It's enough with the two of you.

314
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:01,882
Fine, I'll go with you.

315
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,961
Mommy, come quick.

316
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:03,882
Okay, I'll help out.

317
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:05,201
How do I do this, Quanquan?

318
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:07,201
Is this height okay?

319
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,841
Yes.

320
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:10,362
Come on.

321
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:11,240
Let me do it.

322
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,720
Okay.

323
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:12,721
I'll help you.

324
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,402
Here.

325
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,482
You guys do it.

326
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,402
Move it over a little.

327
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,402
That should do it.

328
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,642
Come on.

329
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,122
Mommy, sit on it.

330
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,282
For me?

331
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:43,721
Okay, I'll sit.

332
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,602
Sit down.

333
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:46,282
Not bad.

334
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:46,762
Is it okay?

335
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,522
It seems pretty sturdy.

336
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:56,362
I...

337
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,081
I can get up by myself.

338
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,162
I don't need you to help me.

339
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,882
This one, Daddy.

340
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,522
Min Hui, look.

341
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:11,961
Mine is stable.

342
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,162
Was it funny?

343
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,602
No, it wasn't funny.

344
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:19,402
It was funny.

345
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,002
No, it wasn't.

346
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,321
It was.

347
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,362
Mine is stable.

348
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:33,522
Let me do it, Quanquan.

349
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,362
Mommy, it's fun there.

350
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,961
Come with me!

351
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,681
Stop eating already.

352
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,801
It's fun to play

353
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,681
in the tent.

354
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:44,321
Okay.

355
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,681
Let me take off my shoes
and enter the tent first.

356
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:47,961
Take off the shoes.

357
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,282
It's almost set up.

358
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,642
Daddy, Mommy, come inside.

359
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:02,201
Come in quick.
Mommy, you sit here and Daddy sits here.

360
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:03,362
It's pretty fun.

361
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,002
Come here.

362
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:07,242
Quanquan.

363
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:07,721
Wait.

364
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:09,081
Quanquan!

365
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,522
Quanquan, stop jumping.

366
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:12,002
Quanquan!

367
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:12,561
Quanquan.

368
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,900
♪I've been tracing back♪

369
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Are you having fun?

370
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,162
Why don't I prepare some food?

371
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,482
Okay, you should go and prepare.

372
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,402
I'm going to prepare some food, okay?

373
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,921
Okay, both of you should go.

374
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,921
I want some lychees.

375
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,762
Don't eat it without me.

376
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:31,961
Min Quanquan.

377
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,201
You're eating it without me!

378
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,961
Have you been naughty recently?

379
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,321
No, I've been good.

380
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,762
Daddy is the naughty one.

381
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,402
No, you're the naughty one.

382
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:39,441
No, it's Daddy.

383
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,681

Thank you for letting me stay.

401
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,201
Didn't Quanquan let you stay?

402
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,602
I can't bear to let him down.

403
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,481
Besides,

404
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,521
you pretended
to have a business meeting here

405
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:52,122
and bumped into us.

406
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,521
If I chase you away,

407
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,362
won't that make me seem heartless?

408
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:56,842
Mr. Xin,

409
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,602
you can consider being a screenwriter

410
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,241
if you don't want
to be an entrepreneur in the future.

411
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,761
I really came here
for a business meeting.

412
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:06,402
You can check my phone
if you don't believe me.

413
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:07,882
Mr. Wang and I have been discussing

414
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:08,802
whether or not

415
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:10,681
to invest in this campsite lately.

416
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,602
It's okay.

417
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:15,201
If you can conspire with my best friend
to deceive me,

418
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,042
faking a chat history

419
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,441
won't be that hard, right?

420
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:20,681
Fine, I admit

421
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,521
I came here
after discussing with Cao Mu.

422
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,201
But it was out of good intentions.

423
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,842
I really didn't mean to trick you.

424
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,082
I know.

425
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,201
So you don't have to explain.

426
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,921
I've seen

427
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,562
how you treat Quanquan.

428
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:36,961
That's why I didn't have the heart
to chase you away,

429
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:37,681
did I?

430
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,082
But

431
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,721
even if you love Quanquan so much,

432
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,802
you can't take Quanquan away.

433
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,761
Even if you don't trust me,
don't you trust the law?

434
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:55,761
You have a point.

435
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,802
Well, according to the law,

436
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:00,681
you're only allowed
to see him once a week.

437
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,521
And you've exceeded that this week.

438
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,562
So you can't see him next week
to make up for it.

439
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,521
Wait, today doesn't count.

440
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,201
It was a chance encounter.

441
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,402
Yes, a chance encounter.

442
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:11,481
At this point,
you're not following the law?

443
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,162
Then we'll cancel the visitation
for the next few weeks.

444
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:14,322
Ms. Min Hui,

445
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,721
disregarding the law is not a quality

446
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,921
that a good citizen should possess.

447
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,160
(Jiaren Hospital)

448
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:21,921
Thank you.

449
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,602
It was all thanks to you
for the surgery today.

450
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:24,882
Or else, it would have been a disaster.

451
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,681
Don't just thank me.

452
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,802
We're close co-workers.

453
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:31,322
Anyway, I have another surgery later.

454
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:32,362
So I'm going to get some sleep first.

455
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,122
(No matter how much they bicker
with each other,)

456
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:03,001
(they will be connected
because of Quanquan.)

457
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,362
(Who am I anyway?)

458
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,802
(I should stop being delusional.)

459
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:13,882
Why are you here?

460
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:14,761
I came to woo you.

461
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,042
Didn't I tell you that last time?

462
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:19,122
Miss Yao Zizhu,

463
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,642
I'm not in the mood

464
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,122
to mess around with you here now.

465
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,802
I can tell that you're not
in a good mood.

466
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,162
But I guarantee

467
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,322
your mood will improve

468
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:31,681
as long as you follow me
to a certain place.

469
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:32,642
Let's go.

470
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,721
You can let me have him.

471
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:48,162
Are you hungry?

472
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,362
Do you want something to eat?

473
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,681
I'm not that hungry.

474
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:56,122
What to eat...

475
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:58,402
Let me take this.

476
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:01,642
Yes, Cao Mu?

477
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:03,441
You've arrived?

478
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:06,281
Slow down. Not too fast.

479
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,241
Okay, wait for me. I'll be there.

480
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:12,761
What's wrong with Cao Mu?

481
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:13,961
She's at the hotel now.

482
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:15,842
But she doesn't seem
to be in a good mood.

483
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,201
I'll go and check on her.

484
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:20,802
Why don't I take him to my room first?

485
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:22,322
You can come and pick him up later.

486
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,441
That will do.

487
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:25,602
Go ahead.

488
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:30,681
Cover him.

489
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,961
Have a good sleep, son.

490
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,420
(No updates available)

491
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,362
Ms. Cao,

492
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,122
why are you drinking
as soon as you arrived?

493
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,122
Did anything happen?

494
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,042
Chen Jiajun, that little brat.

495
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,642
I scolded him last night

496
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,882
and he got upset and left.

497
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,681
He didn't contact me all day.

498
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,681
I even said he's gentle
and considerate before.

499
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,322
I was wrong.

500
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,241
It was all an act.

501
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,961
What he did was really wrong.

502
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,001
You should break up with him.

503
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,122
What?

504
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,122
You're telling me to break up
as soon as you arrived?

505
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,681
Aren't you supposed to advise
so I won't?

506
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,802
He made my good friend so upset.

507
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:14,842
Why should you stay together then?

508
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:16,241
You better break it off right now.

509
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,521
He's not that bad.

510
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,921
I did overreact last night.

511
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:27,001
But he shouldn't have gone all day
without contacting me.

512
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:28,362
Petty brat.

513
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,842
So you knew you overreacted.

514
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,042
Instead of looking for him,

515
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,681
here you are blaming him
for not contacting you.

516
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,281
The essence of relationship
between man and woman

517
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,162
is that no matter whose fault it is,
it's always the man's fault.

518
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,402
What kind of distorted logic is that?

519
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,402
Aren't man and woman both humans?

520
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,001
Humans have emotions, don't they?

521
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:46,441
If you're wrong, you should admit it.

522
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,481
This is the demeanor
that Ms. Cao should have.

523
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:53,642
What about you?

524
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,441
If you were angry with Xin Qi,

525
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,802
would you apologize first?

526
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,001
Me?

527
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,402
I'm not in a relationship with Xin Qi

528
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:06,882
like you and Chen Jiajun.

529
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:08,921
How is it not?

530
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,642
You both like each other.

531
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:11,642
You even have a child together.

532
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:12,681
So how is it
that you're not in a relationship?

533
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,281
Who says

534
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:16,402
we like each other?

535
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,241
Cao Mu, how much did you drink

536
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:19,602
that you started spouting nonsense?

537
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:20,721
If he doesn't like you,

538
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:23,042
would he prepare a full set of itinerary
for you?

539
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,441
That was for Quanquan,

540
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,521
not me.

541
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,082
Nonsense.

542
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:29,562
You're one blind person.

543
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,001
Don't act reserved
and end up missing out on true love.

544
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:23,602
What?

545
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:27,521
What are you doing?

546
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,921
I'm scared.

547
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,761
Can't you let me hold your arm?

548
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,122
Don't be stingy.

549
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,681
There's no such thing
as ghosts in this world.

550
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:41,362
What people consider ghosts

551
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,402
are just energy bodies in the universe.

552
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,521
Besides,

553
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,721
the ghosts in this movie
are actually pretty stupid.

554
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:47,882
There's no need to be afraid.

555
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,122
The logic in this movie
is flawed anyway.

556
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:50,681
See that?

557
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:53,602
The description clearly depicts
a cold northern town.

558
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,882
But you can see tropical plants
that only grow in the south.

559
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,602
You're right.

560
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:03,082
You know so much, don't you?

561
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:04,842
How annoying.

562
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:05,721
Unbelievable.

563
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:07,842
You're so full of yourself.

564
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:12,122
You know what?

565
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,521
I was just about to pretend to be scared

566
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:14,602
and grab his arm.

567
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:15,961
Do you know what he said to me?

568
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:18,721
He told me about logical loopholes
in this horror movie.

569
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:21,322
Why is he so adorable?

570
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,961
I'm starting to like him more and more.

571
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:24,241
But

572
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,562
after he said that,

573
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:28,162
the horror movie wasn't
that interesting anymore.

574
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:42,642
Okay, I admit.

575
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:45,521
My favorite TV genre

576
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:46,681
is actually idol dramas,

577
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:49,001
and my favorite movie genre is horror.

578
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,761
I just wanted to cheer you up.

579
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,681
That's why I brought you
to watch a horror movie.

580
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,082
Aren't we supposed
to watch comedy to cheer people up?

581
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:01,281
Fine, I admit.

582
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:04,082
I just wanted
to increase physical contact with you.

583
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,642
So our feelings would develop more.

584
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:09,322
Who knows that you won't fall for it?

585
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,281
And I also know

586
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,562
you're unhappy
because of the person you like.

587
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,042
I also know you can't forget her now.

588
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:18,521
But it's okay.

589
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,961
I'm sure you'll give up on her one day.

590
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,562
I'll wait for that day to come too.

591
00:26:24,562 --> 00:26:26,521
Why are you so sure I'll give up on her?

592
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,162
Even I don't know when that will happen.

593
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:29,802
Of course, I'm sure.

594
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,241
That's how the second male leads end up

595
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,281
in TV dramas.

596
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:35,802
I believe it's the same
in real life too.

597
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:37,001
Second male leads?

598
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:38,642
What does that mean?

599
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:41,082
Haven't you watched TV dramas?

600
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,761
It's the kind of man

601
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:44,122
whose feelings are not reciprocated.

602
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:46,481
That's the standard
of a second male lead's character.

603
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,721
And usually,

604
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:48,842
these people

605
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,162
have to give up

606
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:51,642
because their love is not reciprocated.

607
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:55,642
But it's okay.

608
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,721
You may be the tragic second male lead
in her eyes.

609
00:26:57,842 --> 00:27:00,082
But with me,
you're definitely the male lead.

610
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,362
I'll make sure

611
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,281
you get a happy ending.

612
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:16,042
I'm a little hungry.

613
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:18,162
How about I treat you to some supper?

614
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,802
Consider it my way of thanking you
for our horror movie date.

615
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,162
That's great!

616
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:30,642
He's treating me to a meal.

617
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:32,882
It's a small step for Zhou Ruji,

618
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:34,882
but a big step forward
for our relationship.

619
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,882
Wait for me!

620
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:41,001
I just had one bottle,

621
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,882
and I feel so dizzy.

622
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,441
Why did you even start a relationship?

623
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:56,842
It's so troublesome.

624
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,362
Min Hui is right.

625
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,562
Women can apologize
when they're wrong too,

626
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:03,241
right?

627
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,602
I'm not scared to do so.

628
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,500
(Cao Mu)

629
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:20,721
Hello?

630
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:22,402
(Chen Jiajun!)

631
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:27,802
You haven't contacted me all day.

632
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:29,241
Who do you think you are?

633
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:33,761
Who gave you
the right to not contact me?

634
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:34,761
I wasn't.

635
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,122
I missed you so much,

636
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,082
and you said you love me.

637
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:42,761
Who said they love me?

638
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,402
You said you love me,

639
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:49,681
and now you're ignoring me.

640
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,882
You've been ignoring me all day!

641
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:53,721
Men are liars.

642
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:54,362
I wasn't...

643
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,281
You're ignoring me, right?

644
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:00,122
All I did was to get mad by mistake.

645
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:00,842
Okay.

646
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,761
I'll apologize.

647
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:05,642
I'll apologize to you.

648
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,241
I'm sorry.

649
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:09,961
Since you ignored me,
I'll ignore you too.

650
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:11,201
I didn't ignore you.

651
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,042
I'll ignore you from now on.

652
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,441
Chen Jiajun,
I'm going to ignore you from now on!

653
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:16,761
Goodbye!

654
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,241
What...

655
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,042
Why...

656
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:27,602
How adorable.

657
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:35,802
Come in quickly.

658
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,921
We've rescued the earth
for the third time now.

659
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:38,802
Is Quanquan awake?

660
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,042
Superman is here!

661
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,241
You, fake Thor.

662
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,001
Surrender now!

663
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,001
I'm the real Thor!

664
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:46,441
You're the fake one.

665
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,082
No, I'm the real Thor!

666
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:51,721
Holding a shield won't help you.

667
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,521
You can't run away now.

668
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,642
Have a taste of the heavenly lightning!

669
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,120
The heavenly lightning won't work.

670
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:57,921
Quanquan.

671
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:58,882
Quanquan.

672
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,322
Let's go back and sleep, okay?

673
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,322
Superman still
has a mission to complete.

674
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:05,721
He can't go back to sleep yet.

675
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,402
Superman,

676
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:08,481
what kind of mission
you haven't completed yet?

677
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,882
Iron Man is still fighting the monsters.

678
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,681
So the mission isn't completed yet.

679
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,681
That's right. Iron Man fights
for the peace of the earth.

680
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:23,162
I must wait for him to return safely

681
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,721
before I go back with you.

682
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:26,602
Yes, before he goes back with you.

683
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:30,961
Quanquan, it's the same

684
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:31,921
if we wait in our room.

685
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,362
I still have work tomorrow,

686
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:34,882
and I'm very sleepy now.

687
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:36,201
What now?

688
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,322
Why don't you let Quanquan sleep here?

689
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,721
I reserved this room for him anyway.

690
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,721
You have to deliver a speech tomorrow.

691
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:46,802
So you should get proper rest.

692
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:54,281
Never mind.

693
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,122
I'll prepare my speech

694
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:57,961
for tomorrow here.

695
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,001
Quanquan,

696
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:01,441
I'll let you play
for another half an hour, okay?

697
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,201
Hurry.

698
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:04,281
Yay! Xin Qi, let's continue!

699
00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:06,001
No! Please, don't!

700
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,420
Oh, no. It's done for now.

701
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,580
Don't run.

702
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,001
Okay, I surrender.

703
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:21,642
I surrender.

704
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:23,882
I give up.

705
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:25,281
Let's play with cars.

706
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:26,562
Okay, let's play with the cars.

00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:33,562
You were asleep just now.

720
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:35,402
So I wanted you
to sleep more comfortably.

721
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:38,201
You have a lecture tomorrow, right?

722
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:40,721
I think I may have been too tired today.

723
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,162
I had a few drinks earlier too.

724
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,162
How did I fall asleep?

725
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:47,441
I'll take Quanquan back to the room.

726
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:50,241
You can sleep here.

727
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:51,681
No, it's okay.
We can just go back to our room.

728
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,281
It's okay. Don't wake him.

729
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,481
I'll get another room.

730
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,082
But...

731
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,602
I'll get going now. So get back to bed.

732
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:57,642
Get some sleep.

733
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,180
(Five years ago)

734
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,602
Xin Qi,

735
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,042
good morning.

736
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,162
Morning.

737
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,281
Time to get up.

738
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,801
Come and have some breakfast.

739
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,162
I want you to carry me.

740
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:16,841
Carry me.

741
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:28,482
Time for breakfast.

742
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,002
Look.

743
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:31,562
Do you like it?

744
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,721
That's a lot.

745
00:35:38,642 --> 00:35:39,281
You see.

746
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,241
We've stayed here
for more than three months now.

747
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,801
When are you going
to the United States with me?

748
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,841
I know you don't want
to leave this place.

749
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:49,642
How about this?

750
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:50,881
When we have time,

751
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:53,401
we'll come back for the holidays, okay?

752
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:56,082
Here, eat this.

753
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,922
Can you get me a glass of milk?

754
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,002
I've already warmed it up for you.

755
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:04,201
Eat up.

756
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:05,442
I'll show you out after breakfast.

757
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:06,321
I'll go and get your milk.
