=Episode 24=

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,240
Since this acquisition meeting

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,559
involves our trade secrets,

27
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,040
I've arranged

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,479
this third-party meeting room for us.

29
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,839
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Xin.

30
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,160
I don't mind.

31
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:48,999
Okay.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
All of us are here today

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,080
to have a final discussion
on the financing issue

34
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,559
of the MBO.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,240
If there's no further issue,

36
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,399
it's better for us to sign
the contract today.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Based on

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,240
the investment plan
that I've drawn up with Ms. Cao,

39
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,160
Blue Jay will invest
500 million in this.

40
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,399
The executives will retain
the original percentage of the shares.

41
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,160
The plan is still the same.

42
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,199
And I'll give you an extra 0.5%,

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,759
making it 4% in total.

44
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,199
Mr. Xin is indeed
a decisive entrepreneur.

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,079
You are so resolute.

46
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:15,919
I'm not done yet.

47
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,959
I know that you'll have

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,400
more investors coming in.

49
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,359
I have only one request.

50
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,160
No matter how many investors you have,

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
they can't have
a higher percentage than Blue Jay.

52
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:28,040
We want to have absolute control
over Be Agile.

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,720
Mr. Xin, don't worry.

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,079
So far, other than Blue Jay,

55
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,320
there are two other venture capitalists
that we are working with.

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,359
One of them is willing
to offer us 300 million.

57
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,560
As for the other one,

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
we'll know when Min Hui and I
meet them later.

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,880
I promise you

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,040
that Blue Jay will be
our biggest shareholder.

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,600
Okay.

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,519
No more questions from me.

63
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
Okay then. Min Hui,

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,400
please...

65
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,280
Where does the barking come from?

66
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,639
I set an alarm.

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,160
Mr. Xin, your watch

69
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,120
is very unique.

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,440
Ms. Cao, you have great taste.

71
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,679
This is from my son.

72
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,799
My son has a matching watch too.
The one-and-only pair of watches.

73
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,919
Even his mother doesn't have it.

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
What do you think?

75
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,560
Does it suit me?

76
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,600
Yes.

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,799
It suits your outfit today very well.

78
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,560
Mr. Xin, if you have no other questions,

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,919
we can sign the contract now.

80
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,799
Yes, Mr. Xin.

81
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,359
Let's get down to business first.

84
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,359
Mr. Xin.

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,759
Is there something wrong
with the contract?

86
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,720
There's nothing wrong with the contract.

87
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,840
But after all,
this is a 500-million project.

88
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,079
I have to think about

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
what I'll get in return.

90
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't have to worry
about that, Mr. Xin.

91
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,759
You'll be satisfied with
what you'll get in return.

92
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,759
With this reassurance from Ms. Min,

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,639
I can rest assured.

94
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,799
How are you, my princess?

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,999
Come, baby.

96
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,559
Be good.

97
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,799
You are so pretty.

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,359
Dear.

99
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,720
Can you give me a hand?

100
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,879
My arm...

101
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:41,999
Dear.

102
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,200
Don't you want to know

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,720
how I got hurt?

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,999
I'm not a doctor.

105
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,439
Why do I need to know?

106
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
I just want...

107
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,679
I just want to receive
some care from my wife.

108
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,799
You don't need it.

109
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,040
You are just forcing yourself
to stay in the Zheng family,

110
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,520
because you want to be
the president of Guanchao, right?

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,439
We are just taking
what we need from each other.

112
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,919
There's no need to put
any feelings into this.

113
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,359
No, dear. Actually, I...

114
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,119
Sensen.

115
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,919
When you get hurt next time,

116
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,280
remember to protect your face.

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
After all, the PR Department
will have to spend

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,160
a lot of money to push down

119
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,679
the news
about Guanchao's CEO getting hit.

120
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay.

121
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,080
I have a business dinner tonight.

122
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,640
I won't be back for dinner.

123
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,359
Go ahead.

124
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,119
Mr. Xin, Mr. He.

125
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,960
This is as far as I can go.

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,239
Ms. Cao is still waiting for me
for the next meeting.

127
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,359
Okay. Go ahead.

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Farewell.

129
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,319
Mr. Xin, I have some work to do as well.

130
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,999
Pleasure working with you.

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,119
Pleasure working with you.

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,119
I'll take my leave now.

133
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:51,559
There's no one here.

134
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,080
Someone will see us.

135
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,359
We don't have to pretend anymore.

136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,919
You did well just now.

137
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,040
You deserve to be praised.

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
That's it?

139
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,479
What about the reward?

140
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
The reward?

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,879
You just signed the contract.
And you already want a reward?

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,239
I signed the contract with Be Agile.

143
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,040
I want the reward from you.

144
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,559
Stop. Someone will see us.

145
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,119
Stop it.

146
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:12,879
I'm not afraid.

147
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Why are you so afraid?

148
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,799
Here's your interest.

149
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,400
You can get the rest

150
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,200
tonight.

151
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,239
Okay?

152
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,080
Okay.

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,679
You can go now.

156
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
I got off work late today.
Here are your flowers.

157
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,879
I bought these flowers for you.

158
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,080
I don't want your flowers.

159
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,679
You...

160
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
May your love last for eternity.

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,160

want to take a rest?

Hardy should've been back with Quanquan
by now after their game.

188
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,719
You don't have to look

189
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,480
at your watch every 30 seconds.

190
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,959
Quanquan

191
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,719
must have chosen
this watch for me with care.

192
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,520
I asked him.

193
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,360
He didn't have enough money
after buying me the necklace.

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,719
Only this watch was at a discount.

195
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:30,199
So, it was basically
a buy-one-free-one watch.

196
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,559
Is it that hard for you
to admit that our son

197
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,400
loves me more?

198
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,599
If we were at the company,

199
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,120
I would say that our son loves you more.

200
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,679
But we are at home now.

201
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,199
How is that different?

202
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,199
You are our major shareholder
at the company.

203
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,040
So, I have to make you happy
at the company.

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,559
But at home,

205
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,199
you are my boyfriend
and the father to our son.

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,160
You have to make me happy instead.

207
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,760
So, you know.

208
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,400
You've been looking at your phone

209
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,719
the whole time we are eating.

210
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,199
You have such a handsome man
sitting right across from you.

211
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,199
But you don't even spare me a glance.

212
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,280
You want to buy a house?

213
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,599
No.

214
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,280
You want to sell your house?

215
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,959
I've thought about it.

216
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,439
The only way to get a lot of money

217
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,439
in such a short period
is to sell my house.

218
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,880
You don't have to do that.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,679
I can lend you the money
if you really need it.

220
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,160
Then, you can slowly pay me back.

221
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,559
If you sell your house now,

222
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,559
what about you and Quanquan?
Where will you stay?

223
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,079
Why are you smiling?

224
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:31,079
I'm not.

225
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,959
I saw you smiling just now.

226
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
Selling the house quickly

227
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,439
is indeed the only way.

228
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:37,439
Have you found yourself
a property agent?

229
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,079
Not yet.

230
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,199
Not yet? I'll find one for you.

231
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Hello, Hardy.

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,919
Get a property agent for me.

233
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,520
To sell a house.

234
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,240
Not me. It's Min Hui.

235
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,640
Another thing.

236
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,280
Where are you now?

237
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,319
What are you doing?

238
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

239
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Be careful.

240
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Where are they?

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,799
Are you full?

242
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,599
Not yet.

243
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,679
You should stop eating anyway.

244
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,439
You only paid the interest
this afternoon.

245
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,839
It's time for the final payment.

246
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,799
The final payment?

247
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,959
Here's your final payment.

248
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,880
You...

249
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,200
- Stop eating.
- Xin Qi.

250
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,400
Hurry up. They won't be back
for another two hours.

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,480
Hurry up.

252
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,719
You asked me to quit and I did.

253
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,919
When can I return to Guanchao?

254
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,919
I'm going to be bored to death.

255
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,799
How about

256
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,799
you do something for me?

257
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,280
What is it?

258
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
I heard that Cao Mu and He Haixiang

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,559
are planning to execute MBO.

260
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,559
Come up with a way

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,799
to find out

262
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,480
how much they are going to offer

263
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,360
in the takeover bid.

264
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,959
Are you really going
to acquire Be Agile?

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,719
No.

266
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,640
Is it because of Min Hui?

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Of course not.

268
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,319
She doesn't deserve my attention.

269
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,240
I want to acquire Be Agile

270
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,160
for Guanchao's future development.

271
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,360
Be Agile has developed at a fast pace
for the past two years.

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,880
It doesn't matter which company
will acquire it in the end.

273
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
It'll still become a major threat

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,719
to Guanchao in the future.

275
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,640
Rather than letting that happen,

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
we should take control of it.

277
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,439
You are right.

278
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
But Min Hui...

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,079
I promise you

280
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,719
that once I acquire the company,

281
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,040
I'll fire her at once.

282
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,200
(Yitang Serviced Apartment)

283
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,079
(Yitang Serviced Apartment)
Ms. Min.

284
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,240
(Yitang Serviced Apartment)

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,439
Your house is in a good condition.

286
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,599
It's open, spacious and in good shape.

287
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
The garden and
the management here are great too.

288
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,520
If you put it on sale,

289
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,919
I'm sure it'll be a great hit.

290
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,599
But the only problem is,

291
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
you want to get the payment in full.

292
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,319
And you want to sell it quickly.

293
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,839
If you do that,
you can't sell it at its best price.

294
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,319
I understand.

295
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,760
I'll sell this house for 3.5 million.

296
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,679
I'm sure that's a reasonable price.

297
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,679
Indeed.

298
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,439
I'll put this house on sale then.

299
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,120
If I have someone
who's interested in this house,

300
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
when will it be convenient for you
to show them the house?

301
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,319
Any time.

302
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,120
You can inform us

303
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,199
at any time.

304
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:18,760
Okay.

305
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
I'll put it up on sale when
I go back to my office then.

306
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,480
If there's nothing else,

307
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,400
I'll take my leave now.

308
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,640
Okay. Let me see you out.

309
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,120
Thank you.

310
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
You don't have to see me out.

311
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,120
I'll leave it to you then.

312
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,719
Okay.

313
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,400
Why are you so excited
about me selling the house?

314
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,280
Is it wrong for me to help you?

315
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,919
I'll admit it.

316
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,719
After you sell your house,

317
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,679
you'll have nowhere to stay.

318
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,640
So, does it mean

319
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,559
that you and Quanquan
will move in with me?

320
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,959
I knew it.

321
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,520
I know that you want
your personal space.

322
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
It's okay.

323
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,120
My house is big enough.

324
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,199
Not only can you have
your personal space,

325
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,719
it can also be like Inception.

326
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,559
Min Hui, I really want
to see you every day

327
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,599
when I wake up.

328
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,919
Can you sacrifice a little bit

329
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,199
for me?

330
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,480
Just a little bit.

331
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm sure Quanquan
will be happy about it.

332
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,400
It's indeed true

333
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,040
that I don't have a better place
to go right now.

334
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:14,959
Yes!

335
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Let's pack up your things.

336
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,640
Bring whatever you need

337
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,240
and for those you don't need,

338
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,120
we can just ask them to clear those out.

339
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,959
I'll do the packing.

340
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,000
Good morning.

341
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,640
Good morning.

342
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
I've made breakfast for you.

343
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,439
Eat it while it's hot.

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,079
Such a luxurious breakfast.

345
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,719
You even cooked egg, my favorite.

346
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,919
Do you want milk or orange juice?

347
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,079
Milk.

348
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,079
Let me pour it for you.

349
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you hiding? Why so mysterious?

350
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,679
Here you go.

351
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,120
By the way,

352
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,439
if you have nothing to do tonight,

353
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,599
can you come back earlier?

354
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,719
Why?

355
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,599
Nothing.

356
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,599
It's just that you've been
so busy lately.

357
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,280
So, I want to treat you
to some good food.

358
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,079
I'll do my best.

359
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,120
Okay.

360
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,640
Here's your milk.

(Yitang Serviced Apartment)

362
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,799
(Yitang Serviced Apartment)
We just talked about packing up

363
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,799
and you already have five boxes.

364
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,480
Are you testing me?

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,280
Stop.

366
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,000
I just want to pack a little bit
whenever I can,

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,520
so that it won't be too overwhelming

368
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,719
when we have to move.

369
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,319
What's wrong?

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Are you reluctant to sell the house?

371
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,719
From down payment to mortgage,

372
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,559
I bought this house with the money

373
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,000
that I had saved up little by little.

374
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,839
Look at this sofa.

375
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,079
Quanquan's toys.

376
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,160
And the design of this house.

377
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
I did it all by myself.

378
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,559
I really thought

379
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,120
that this house

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,240
would be me and Quanquan's forever home.

381
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,719
Don't cry.

382
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,919
Maybe

383
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,120
we shouldn't sell it.

384
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Let's not sell it. I don't want to move.

385
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,040
Sell it.

386
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,319
You have to sell it.

387
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,040
You can't keep it.

388
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,599
I know.

389
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm just

390
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,599
emotionally attached to it.

391
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,440
It's a house.

392
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:14,799
I know.

393
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,040
After I sell it,

394
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,960
I can buy it again
when I have the money.

395
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,720
A house

396
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,000
is not a home.

397
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:22,200
Home is where your family is.

398
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,159
I belong

399
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,599
with my family.

400
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,559
Quanquan and I will be your home

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
from now on.

402
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,000
It'll be yours too.

403
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,319
All of you belong to me.

404
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
(Good morning.)

405
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,460
(Goodnight. Have a good sleep.
I'm a little bit tired today.)

406
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,180
(Are you awake?
You have been blacklisted.)

407
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,839
I need Min Hui.

408
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,480
She's a woman.
I'm sure she knows what to do.

409
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,079
Come in. No need to change your shoes.

410
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,080
Why?

411
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,760
What are you doing?

412
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,799
I plan to sell this house soon.

413
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,920
So, I'm packing up.

414
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,079
You are going to sell the house?

415
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,839
Min Hui.

416
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,159
Where is Quanquan's Iron Man helmet?

417
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,119
It's just in there.

418
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,920
Look carefully. I'm sure you'll find it.

419
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,280
Yes. I plan to sell it.

420
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,119
You are going to lose

421
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,799
great neighbors like me and Quanquan.

422
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,799
But the good news is,

423
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,040
you are going to get the set of books

424
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
that you've always wanted.

425
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,599
Is it because you can't
take them with you?

426
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,760
It's painful for me to part with them.

427
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,040
Let me inform you

428
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:57,920
that I've officially become
Min Hui's boyfriend.

429
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,480
Her future husband.

430
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,559
So,

431
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,240
keep your distance from her.

432
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,280
You are just dating each other.

433
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Does she have to sell the house?

434
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,319
Can't Min Hui be my neighbor?

435
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,280
I'm not the one who wants
to sell the house.

436
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,200
The executives of Be Agile

437
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,960
plan to purchase Be Agile together.

438
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,559
So, I need a huge amount of money.

439
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,200
I've misunderstood you.

440
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,399
Are you going to become
a businesswoman after this?

441
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,079
Stop joking.

442
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,440
We'll have to succeed
in acquiring it first.

443
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,240
By the way,

444
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,559
I'm going to meet someone

445
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,040
from a private equity firm
this afternoon with Cao Mu.

446
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,879
Have a seat.

447
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,359
Where can you sit?

448
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,920
It's okay. You don't have
to entertain me. Just do your thing.

449
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,879
Okay. I'll get back to packing.

450
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,240
Iron Man.

451
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,720
You are so rich.

452
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
But why does Min Hui need
to sell her house to get the money?

453
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,280
I want to give her the money.

454
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,240
But she doesn't want it.

455
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,480
You look so despicable.

456
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,159
At first, I wanted
to give you some tips.

457
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,480
But now, I've changed

458
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,240
my mind.

459
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,040
I don't need tips from you.

460
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,559
But there's something
that you can help me with.

461
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,799
You look so despicable.

462
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,040
Mr. Cai is just like Xin Qi.

463
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,920
He comes from a family of investors too.

464
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,040
But the scale of their investment

465
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
is not as large as Blue Jay's.

466
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,319
And he's quite new

467
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,480
to the medical technology industry.

468
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,520
Of course.

469
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,079
Not everyone is as capable as Xin Qi.

470
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,200
Look at how proud you are of him.

471
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,399
I wonder who's the one

472
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,280
saying

473
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
that she would never get back together

474
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,879
with Xin Qi.

475
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,639
I wonder who's the one

476
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,879
saying that
she's so afraid of falling in love.

477
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,319
But now, you are in such

478
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,720
a passionate relationship
with Chen Jiajun.

479
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,399
I just hope that he won't be irrational.

480
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:44,520
Did you fight again?

481
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,799
If only we were fighting.

482
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,879
He's going to propose to me.

483
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,839
Really?

484
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,839
Yes.

485
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,159
I even saw the ring.

486
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,000
And our names are engraved on it.

487
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,760
I never thought

488
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,639
that he would be such a brave young man.

489
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,559
Not bad.

490
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,480
Excuse me.

491
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,240
Now is not the time to praise him.

492
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,599
You know

493
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,319
why I broke up
with my previous boyfriends, right?

494
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,680
I know. You don't want to get married.

495
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,599
Maybe Chen Jiajun

496
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,319
is different.

497
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,399
Yes.

498
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,440
He's different
from my previous boyfriends.

499
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,359
But it doesn't mean

500
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,839
that I'll accept marriage for him.

501
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,359
Okay.

502
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,240
What are you going to do then?

503
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,680
What else can I do?

504
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I'll just stay away from him.

505
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,159
He's here.
Let's get down to business first.

506
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
Hello, Mr. Cai.

507
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,319
Ms. Cao.

508
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,040
You know each other?

509
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,079
What a coincidence.

510
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,559
That's great. Please have a seat.

511
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,480
Please have a seat.

512
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,399
Excuse me.

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,159
Turn it off.

514
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,680
Stop cleaning this place.

515
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
There's a puddle of water
in the office kitchen.

516
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Go and clean it up.

517
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,720
It'll be bad if someone slips on it.

518
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,399
Here. Let me help you.

519
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,000
I can do it myself.

520
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,399
Go. It's over there.

521
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay.

522
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,900
(G.M. OFFICE)

523
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,159
I'm sure you are hiding
something from me.

524
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:54,820
(Be Agile Medical Technology
MBO Proposal)

525
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,200
He Haixiang.

526
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,159
Even you are going to discard me.

527
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,520
Mr. Cai.

528
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,079
Although Be Agile doesn't have
many patented technologies,

529
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,599
I can assure you
that each of our project

530
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,680
surpasses other inventions
in the same industry,

531
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,399
especially
the AI heart modeling technology

532
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,799
that we have mentioned just now.

533
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,559
For that technology...

534
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,599
About that,

535
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,159
you already told me enough info

536
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,839
when we met last time.

537
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,000
Mr. Cai.

538
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm really sorry for last time.

539
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,040
I didn't take care

540
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,359
of my personal matter properly.

541
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,720
I apologize for that.

542
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,480
Why?

543
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:42,440
Do you think

544
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,040
that I'm someone who holds a grudge?

545
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,280
Of course not.

546
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,119
When I met you last time,

547
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,200
you made a good impression on me.

548
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,559
Especially when you talked
about your field of expertise,

549
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,760
your confidence was quite attractive.

550
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,599
Thank you.

551
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,280
Yes.

552
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,280
Min Hui is a workaholic.

553
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,879
And she's very capable.

554
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,879
She's one of the best researchers
in this industry in Bincheng.

555
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,000
Everyone acknowledges it.

556
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,960
She leads the R&D

557
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,480
of all of Be Agile's core technologies.

558
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
She's the core of our company.

559
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,920
I believe that.

560
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,319
I have a rule of thumb
in my investment principles.

561
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,319
And it's to value talents.

562
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,559
Since Ms. Min is in Be Agile,

563
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,599
it's worth the investment.

564
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,040
I look forward to working with you.

565
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,920
I'll revise the contract and
send it to your e-mail account.

566
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,559
Okay.

567
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,319
I have another appointment later.

568
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:40,440
I have to leave now.

569
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay. Let me see you out.

570
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:42,799
You don't have to do that.

571
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,799
Farewell, Mr. Cai.

572
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,760
You are amazing, Ms. Cao.

573
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,960
You closed the deal so easily.

574
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,760
You should learn from me.

575
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Come. Let's eat.

576
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,760
Actually, I think Cai Wenbin
is a good man.

577
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,040
If Xin Qi didn't interrupt you
last time,

578
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,200
you might have gotten together with him.

579
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,319
Do you dare to say this
in front of Xin Qi?

580
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,559
Of course not.

581
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,879
He's our God of Fortune.

582
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,159
I wouldn't dare to offend him.

583
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,159
Your God of Fortune is here.

584
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,920
Hello, Mr. Xin.

585
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,440
Hello.

586
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,399
Why are you here?

587
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,839
Zhou Ruji told me that he has a friend
who wants to look at the house.

588
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,639
So, I'm here to pick you up.

589
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,159
Look at you now.

590
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,520
How did you pretend so well in front

591
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,680
of He Haixiang and the others?

592
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,040
You have to ask her.

593
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,359
Ms. Cao, let us send you back.

594
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,440
No.

595
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,399
Forget it.

596
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
I don't want to become

597
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,200
the third wheel.

598
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
I'll get going now.

599
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:46,480
Min Hui.

600
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
Remember to call Mr. Cai tomorrow

601
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,799
to thank him properly.

602
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,040
Me?

603
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,440
Mr. Cai?

604
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,040
Who is he?

605
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,119
The investor we've just met.

606
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,879
He's young and handsome.

607
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,760
He even went on a blind date
with Min Hui before.

608
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,720
He's going to invest in us

609
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,639
because of Min Hui.

610
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,440
Min Hui.

611
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,720
You are amazing.

612
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,879
Blind...

613
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
Blind date? Which one?

614
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,440
The one that you don't know.

615
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,960
Who is he?

616
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,040
You don't know him.

617
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,639
Who is he?

618
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,359
He's no one.

619
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,440
Cao Mu.

620
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,200
You need to let your man
feel some sense of crisis.

621
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,520
It's a free tip from me.

622
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,639
Mr. Xin, I'll get going now. Bye.

623
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,240
Thank you, Ms. Cao.

624
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,879
Cao Mu! Who is he?

625
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:24,440
He's no one.

626
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,040
Who is he?

627
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,440
Zhou Ruji must be waiting for us.

628
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,079
Zhou Ruji is waiting for us.
Let's go now.

629
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,359
This is not important.

630
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,760
Cao Mu.

631
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,639
Ms. Lin.

632
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,639
No. I forgot.

633
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,240
You are no longer
the director of Guanchao.

634
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
Cheng Qirang is so unmanly.

635
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,280
He has discarded you after using you.

636
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,920
I heard

637
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
that the executives of Be Agile
are pooling their funds

638
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,879
to execute the MBO.

639
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,040
If I'm not wrong,

640
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,119
you are not included, right?

641
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,920
Are you planning on leaving Be Agile?

642
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,200
What do you mean?

643
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
I'm sure you've heard

644
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,200
that Guanchao plans to acquire Be Agile.

645
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,480
Once we acquire it,

646
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,760
Mr. Cheng will have the power

647
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,799
to decide who to stay and who to leave.

648
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,159
You've been in Be Agile
for so many years.

649
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,559
You've always been eclipsed by Min Hui.

650
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,440
Don't you want to shine for once?

651
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,079
Nothing comes for free.

652
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,559
I'm sure it's not as simple as that.

653
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,440
Of course.

654
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,399
According to Mr. Cheng,

655
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
as long as you can

656
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,839
find out the amount
of their takeover bid for us,

657
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,040
you'll become the future deputy director

658
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,200
of the R&D of Be Agile.

659
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,399
According to Mr. Cheng?

660
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,799
Although I've quit Guanchao,

661
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,319
I'm sure you know about my relationship

662
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,480
with Cheng Qirang.

663
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,359
There are a lot of things that I'm doing

664
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,720
on his behalf because he can't do them.

665
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,440
It doesn't matter
if you don't believe me.

666
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,760
Just don't regret it in the future.

667
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,040
Help me inform Mr. Cheng

668
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,240
that I will

669
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,440
get him what he wants.

670
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Your house is beautiful.

671
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,720
And my budget is very close

672
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:20,559
to your selling price.

673
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,639
If there's no problem with you,

674
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,399
I can sign the contract
tomorrow morning.

675
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,760
And I'll pay you in full
by the afternoon.

676
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,879
Mr. Qian.

677
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:30,639
Don't you have to compare it
with the price of other houses?

678
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
Just call me Qian.

679
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,799
Or Qian Dele.

680
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,839
You are Mr. Zhou's friend.

681
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,559
And this house is in a prime location.

682
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,440
The price is also reasonable.

683
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,159
I don't want to cause any delay
and lose it to someone else.

684
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,200
He has been looking
at different houses for a month.

685
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,399
He has checked out
all the houses nearby.

686
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,879
So far, this is the one
he likes the most.

687
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,839
If that's the case,

688
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,920
I'll draw up the contract later

689
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,680
and we can sign it tomorrow morning.

690
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,440
Okay.

691
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,240
Yes. But I'm in a hurry to move in.

692
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,200
So...

693
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,480
I understand.

694
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,839
How about this?

695
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,559
After you sign the contract
and settle the payment,

696
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,520
I'll move everything out in five days.

697
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
Five days?

698
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,780
Well...

699
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,280
Five days?

700
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,200
After all, I have so many things here.

701
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:12,760
How about three days?

702
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
Give me three days.

703
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,639
Okay.

704
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,639
It's a deal then. Three days.

705
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,879
Okay. It's a deal.

706
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:19,639
Deal.

707
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,240
I have other things to do.

708
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
I have to leave now.

709
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,879
Okay. I'll see you out.

710
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,040
See you later, Qian.

711
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,680
See you later.

712
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,599
The lift is right in front of the door.

713
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,440
What's wrong?

714
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,040
Nothing.

715
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,399
Where is he?

716
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,799
He has already left.

717
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:42,960
What's wrong?

718
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,319
Ruji.

719
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,480
I think I have a love rival.

720
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,799
I hope I'm thinking too much.

721
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:23,920
Cao Mu.

722
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:28,680
Cao Mu.

723
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Take a seat first.

724
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,710
- Cao Mu.
- Chen Jiajun.

725
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
Don't say anything. Let me talk first.

726
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Let's

727
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,000
break up.

728
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,399
Why?

729
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,319
Do you know me?
Why would you propose to me?

730
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,520
Do you even know what I want?

731
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,359
I thought that you wouldn't want

732
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,799
to get married at such a young age.

733
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,079
If I had known,

734
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,280
I would tell you

735
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,000
that I don't plan to get married now.

736
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,079
But...

737
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,520
But you can't break up with me
just because

738
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,399
I want to marry you.

739
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,639
Why not?

740
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,159
If we have different

741
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:16,159
future expectations,

742
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,799
breaking up is the best choice.

743
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,440
Although I'm reluctant
to break up with you,

744
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,399
if you want to choose someone...

745
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,480
I can accept it.

746
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,839
I can really accept it.

747
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,079
Actually...

748
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,559
Actually, I don't really want
to get married too.

749
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,440
It's just that last time,

750
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,399
you said that you don't need me
to take care of you

751
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,599
because I'm not your husband.

752
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,760
So, I thought you were hinting at me
to propose to you.

753
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:49,559
No.

754
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,680
I was not hinting at you.

755
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,159
You scared me.

756
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,720
Well.

757
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,280
Maybe I was overthinking it.

758
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,480
When I think

759
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,799
about breaking up with you,

760
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,440
I feel so upset.

761
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
Let's be together

762
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,680
as usual.

763
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:12,639
We'll not get married

764
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,599
and we won't break up with each other.

765
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,240
I'll go and take a bath first.

766
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,760
Then, I'll freshen up

767
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,559
and we can go out
to have some good food.

768
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,399
Wait.

769
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,559
Let me fill the tub with water first.

770
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,839
Wait for me.

771
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,420
(Marry Me)

772
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,440
Can I

773
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,119
kiss you?

774
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,880
(You can't.)

775
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,520
(But I can.)

776
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,119
Moving is so tiring.

777
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,920
Oh my goodness.

778
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,159
Your house is so small.

779
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,480
Why are there so many things?

780
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,840
Are you saying
that I have too many things?

781
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:05,920
I'll move them back now.

782
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,759
No.

783
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,079
You've fallen into my trap now.

784
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,320
You can't run away.

785
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,840
I'm not trying to run away.

786
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,199
But I'm a little bit hungry now.

787
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,639
Do you want to grab a bite?

788
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,400
Let's eat out.

789
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,440
Before that,
let me have an appetizer first.

790
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,239
Wait.

791
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,159
Hello, Mr. Cai.

792
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,880
Okay.

793
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,000
Please wait for a while.
I'll go there at once.

794
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,400
Which Mr. Cai?

795
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Is he the one Cao Mu mentioned?

796
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,079
Why is he looking for you?

797
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,559
He wants to discuss something
with me in person

798
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,279
about the project.

799
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,199
So, I have to meet him for a while.

800
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,199
He can go to Cao Mu instead.

801
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,559
Why did he call you?

802
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,320
He wants to talk

803
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,759
about the technical part of the project.

804
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,800
Only I can give him
the answers he needs.

805
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,880
It's not Cao Mu's field of expertise.

806
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,800
I can't eat with you today.

807
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,040
But

808
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,719
if you feel bored,

809
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:17,000
you can unpack the things for me first.

810
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,320
Thank you. I'll get going now.

811
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,400
Mr. Xin, I've already cleaned out
the outside of the house.

812
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,320
Ms. Min Hui.

813
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,440
Why is she leaving?

814
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:26,880
I thought that she took a leave
for moving today.

815
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Clean this place up.

816
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,920
How can I do that by myself?

817
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:45,639
What is it?

818
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,000
Are you avoiding me because

819
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,559
you know that you've done
something wrong?

820
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,759
Mr. Ding.

821
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,079
Mr. He is the one
who approved my transfer.

822
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,520
I have done nothing wrong.

823
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,599
Do you think that
by working with Min Hui,

824
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,880
she can protect you forever?

825
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,719
Let me be truthful to you.

826
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:01,119
Her good days will end soon.

827
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,520
What are you talking about?

828
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,719
What's going to happen to Ms. Min?

829
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,040
Not only her,

830
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,679
He Haixiang,

831
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,159
Cao Mu

832
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,360
and the other executives

833
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,559
will find themselves in serious trouble.

834
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,239
Guanchao is determined
to acquire Be Agile.

835
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,320
Min Hui and the others are planning
to execute MBO.

836
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,800
They are fools.

837
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,759
After Guanchao acquires Be Agile,

838
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,840
who will have full power

839
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,719
over the R&D teams?

840
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,759
You are a smart person.

841
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,840
I'm sure you know.

842
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,920
You are too kind, Mr. Ding.

843
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,480
I don't know what you are talking about.

844
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,520
When I become
the deputy director of the R&D,

845
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,199
I'll appoint you as the project manager.

846
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,920
All you need to do as an assistant

847
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,719
is to find a chance

848
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,000
to put this listening device on Min Hui.

849
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,400
That's it.

850
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,400
Think carefully.

851
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,440
(Reading Mi)

852
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,679
Thank you for today.

853
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,679
You are willing to help me out
despite being so busy.

854
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,759
I feel hopeful for Be Agile to have

855
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,159
a future comrade like you.

856
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,520
It's an honor.

857
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,960
Actually, these two
are quite useful too.

858
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,639
You should read them as well.

859
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
More books?

860
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,400
When can I finish them?

861
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,559
With your reading speed,

862
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,759
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

863
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,159
Why is it him again?

864
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,279
Looks like the trick last time
didn't work.

865
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,599
I have to learn more
from you after this.

866
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,880
You are too humble.

867
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,599
Be careful.

868
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,079
I'm sorry.

869
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,840
It's okay.

870
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,040
Did he hit you?

871
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,279
No. I'm fine.

872
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,920
Thank you.

873
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,159
And he's still trying to woo her.

874
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,160
(The Love You Give Me)

875
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,639
Excuse me, are you going
to buy this book?

876
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes.

877
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,159
The counter is over there.

878
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,279
You can check out later.

879
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,079
Okay.

880
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,800
Mr. Cai.

881
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
You can check out your books first.

882
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,119
I want to buy some toys for my son.

883
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:31,840
