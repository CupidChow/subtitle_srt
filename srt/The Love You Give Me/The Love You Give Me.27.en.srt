=Episode 27=

25
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,239
Remember,

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,799
do not simply beat someone up again.

27
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
Go to the police if you need help.

28
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,480
Is that clear?

29
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
You should be glad
Ding Yifeng isn't pressing charges.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,679
Otherwise, things would have been worse.

31
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,560
Yes, you are right.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,439
I shouldn't have done it.

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,000
But that man was really
getting on my nerve.

34
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,159
I couldn't help it and lost it.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Officer,

36
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,560
will Ding Yifeng be convicted?

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
We have enough evidence.

38
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,600
He's confessed.

39
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,040
All that's left is the legal proceeding.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,799
Don't worry.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,440
You did well.

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,880
You should call the police right away
if you run into this kind of trouble.

43
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,040
Otherwise, a scoundrel like Ding Yifeng

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,999
would have harmed countless more women.

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,679
You saved a lot of people
by doing so.

46
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,200
Thank you.

47
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,239
It was Ms. Min who gave me the courage.

48
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,360
Alright. This is where I see you off.

49
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,679
Go back to your work.

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,320
Thank you so much, officer.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,239
Alright.

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,279
Thank you.

53
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,399
Sorry for the trouble.

54
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:43,959
Min Hui.

55
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:44,520
Well done.

(Be Agile Medi Tech)

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,559
What happened?

58
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,719
Did you get hurt?

59
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,119
Why were you at the police station?

60
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,799
I went there because

61
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,959
I beat up that bad man.

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:52,959
I'm alright.

63
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,200
But my hands are hurting a little
from beating him.

64
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,200
Let me see it.

65
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,519
There's someone else here.

66
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,640
Where were you?

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,719
What took you so long?

68
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,679
I was at the...

69
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,360
At the meeting.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
I was at the meeting.

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,959
Come on. Let's go inside.

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,600
Go inside.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,119
He's nervous.

74
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,080
Let me have a look.

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,999
Ms. Min was so cool!

76
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,920
But in all seriousness,

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
if you run into the same trouble
as Zhong Meimei,

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
you must inform me immediately.

79
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,200
Shouldn't I stand up and fight?

80
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,440
You should fight,

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
but it depends on the situation.

82
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
If the circumstances don't allow it,

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,239
your top priority is to ensure

84
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,200
your own safety, is that clear?

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,160
But in a situation like this,

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,839
the guy from the dramas

87
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,480
would tell the girl this,

88
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,839
"Baby,

89
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,040
don't you worry.

90
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,480
I won't let anyone hurt you.

91
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll forever be your guardian."

92
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,679
And that is why it only
happens in dramas!

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
No one could protect you

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,119
and stay by your side 24/7.

95
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,920
Should I shrink you down
and put you in my pocket?

96
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,719
Dr. Zhou's pickup lines

97
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,640
are certainly unconventional.

98
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,680
Can you smell what's on me?

99
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,240
You're getting better at this, Dr. Zhou.

100
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,919
I love you so much.

101
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,359
So, you like my cringe pickup lines?

102
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,719
He looked like a mutt.

103
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:43,959
Don't insult the canines.

104
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,359
Dogs are cute.

105
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,719
So, what does he look like?

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,680
Like a goofball!

107
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,120
One of the perks of being a man

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,680
is not going through

109
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,159
sexual harassment.

110
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,479
Who says so?

111
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,200
Plenty of men are
sexually harassed at work.

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,279
Seriously?

113
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,120
Why so surprised?

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,680
The thought of his hands

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,320
touching my shoulders

116
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,919
makes me want to chop off his hands!

117
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,839
Ms. Min did all of us a favor.

118
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,320
Of course.

119
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah.

120
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,080
When one of the ladies
wore a short skirt

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,719
or opened the neckline a little,

122
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,320
he wouldn't stop staring at her.

123
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
And he's full of lewd jokes.

124
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,959
It happened during summer.

126
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,640
Yeah.

127
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,440
That was unacceptable.

128
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,560
I thought our female colleagues
weren't that attractive.

129
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,919
Who is that?

130
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,959
Meimei!

131
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,479
You look stunning today!

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,039
You look great.

133
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,919
Ms. Cao and Ms. Min.

134
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,039
Starting today,

135
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,120
men and women in Be Agile

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,399
can dress as they please.

137
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,919
Everyone has the right to object

138
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,959
discrimination or violations.

139
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,399
Yes!

140
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,839
Wonderful!

141
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,120
It seems I missed
the best part of the show.

142
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,959
Be sure to tell me

143
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,039
how you beat up that cursed mutt.

144
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,880
Don't insult the canines.
Dogs are cute.

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes, I get it, Disappeared Amy.

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
What? Who disappeared?

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,599
Isn't "Disappeared Amy" your alias?

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
What alias?

149
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
I have no idea what you're saying.

150
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,919
An online ID went viral.

151
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,200
It's called "Disappeared Amy".

152
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
It exposed the sexual harassment culture
that's deeply rooted in Guanchao.

153
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,959
Besides,

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,440
all the details of how Cheng Qirang
sexually harassed you

155
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,399
are all there.

156
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,000
Why didn't the PR Department do anything?

157
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,279
Disappeared Amy.

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,719
This article has gone viral!

159
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,080
Didn't you know?

160
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,359
Mr. Cheng, it came out of nowhere.

161
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,680
The article was posted late at night.

162
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
We had all got off work.

163
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
It was already up-voted
and went viral in the morning.

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,760
Do not tell me that now.

165
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,719
You have one hour.

166
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,159
Take care of this or you're out!

167
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes. I'll handle it now.

168
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:16,680
And the rest of you,

169
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
issue an announcement now.

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,560
Tell everyone

171
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,919
we are firing Ding Yifeng.

172
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,120
Make sure people know
he works for Be Agile,

173
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,719
and has nothing to do with Guanchao.

174
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,959
Guanchao supports

175
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,000
all women who have been harmed
to fight for their rights.

176
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,159
But, everyone must be done by the law.

177
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, I'll get it done now.

(Be Agile Medi Tech)

182
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,640
Mr. Cheng, I left the coffee on the table.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,039
Ms. Min.

184
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,839
What do you need of me?

185
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,159
Do you think you can have vengeance

186
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,240
by digging up the incident
from five years ago

187
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,159
when Ding Yifeng's
misbehavior was exposed?

188
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,760
I've never thought that.

189
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,959
But judging by that look on your face...

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,760
What's wrong?

191
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,479
Are you afraid?

192
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,399
What should I be afraid of?

193
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,440
So you used a different ID

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,359
to post some articles online.

195
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,400
You won't make any waves.

196
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:34,920
Besides,

197
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,239
I can sue you for slander.

198
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,080
First of all, I didn't post the articles.

199
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,280
Secondly, you know very well

200
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,759
if that is slander.

201
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:47,999
Min Hui.

202
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,479
You're not acting like yourself.

203
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,239
I thought you never shy away
from admitting your doing.

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
Believe whatever you want.

205
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,560
You've hurt so many people.

206
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,680
I bet plenty of people

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,400
want to take revenge on you.

208
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,599
Yes.

209
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
There are many who want
to take revenge on me.

210
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,320
However,

211
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
there are more who bite off
more than they can chew.

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,839
Zheng Yiting used to have a dog.

213
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,400
She took it everywhere she went.

214
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,239
She even let it sleep
on our bed at night.

215
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,359
But I

216
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,999
really hated sharing my bed

217
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,879
with a dog.

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,759
It knew I didn't like it.

219
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,879
It always gave me that nasty look.

220
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,239
One day, Zheng Yiting and I got into a fight.

221
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,639
It came rushing at me

222
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,200
and bit me.

223
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:39,959
Right here.

224
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,119
What are you trying to say?

225
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,719
If you want to
whine about it, forget it.

226
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,920
Be patient.

227
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,479
I'm not done yet.

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,759
One day, Zheng Yiting was away.

229
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,239
She asked me to walk a dog that bit me.

230
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,520
So, I took it to the park.

231
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,479
I knew

232
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,920
there was a black pit bull

233
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,800
which was very fierce.

234
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,999
Soon after I arrived,

235
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,440
the two dogs started fighting.

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,280
I must hand it to the pit bull.

237
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,280
It bit the Husky's neck
and wouldn't let go.

238
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,839
Right here.

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,239
The most vital part.

240
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,160
That Husky

241
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,239
died a horrible death.

242
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,080
Why are you telling me this story?

243
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,719
It's nothing.

244
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,920
I want you to know

245
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,599
what happened

246
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,040
to the dog that I hated so much.

247
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,119
Is that a threat?

248
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,239
You can put it that way.

249
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Min Hui.

250
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,040
I also want you to know

251
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,479
that it's best to consider the price
before you take any action.

252
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,759
Consider if you can afford
to pay that price.

253
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,479
Cheng Qirang.

254
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,999
You are certainly right about that.

255
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,239
Before we do anything,

256
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
we must think about the price.

257
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,759
And now,

258
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,800
it's your turn to pay the price.

259
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,860
(Jiaren Hospital)

260
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,839
What is it?

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,520
We just met this morning.
Miss me already?

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,839
(Mr. Xin, your medical report.)

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,719
Are you at the hospital?

264
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah, for the regular checkup.

265
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,999
Mr. Yao specifically
asked me to come here.

266
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,400
(You should pay more attention to me.)

267
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,879
How are the results?

268
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,599
Everything is fine.

269
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
All stats are normal.

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,119
(I'm glad to hear that.)

271
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,520
Should we have lunch together?

272
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,400
There's something I want to talk about.

273
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,440
What is it? It sounded urgent.

274
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,280
Or you just miss me.

275
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
Could you pick me up later?

276
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,920
Sure, see you later.

277
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,239
Bye.

278
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,080
Bye.

279
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:30,999
Keep this hidden.

280
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Don't let Min Hui see this.

281
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,119
Should we inform the president?

282
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,759
You got smarter.

283
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,359
You actually asked for my permission.

284
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
Don't tell her just yet.

285
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,400
You heard Mr. Yao just now.

286
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,520
There's nothing serious so far.

287
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,759
I'll get plenty of rest.

288
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
Let's not make her worry.

289
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,040
Yes.

290
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,479
By the way.

291
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,719
I asked the manufacturer

292
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,040
to run a thorough check.

293
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,879
No issues.

294
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,560
Min Hui!

295
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,920
Min Hui!

296
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,879
Are you alright? Did you get hurt?

297
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,520
Ouch.

298
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,839
Wait here.

299
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,620
(Jiaren Hospital)

300
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,560
Dr. Zhou,

301
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,719
thank you.

302
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,560
It's nothing.

303
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,680
You and Zizhu must have a date.

304
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,839
You may go now.

305
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,040
It's alright.

306
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
He has a shift today anyway.

307
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,999
I'm here to keep him company.

308
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,959
Ms. Min, would you like some food?

309
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:08,639
I can get it for you.

310
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,239
It's alright.

311
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:09,920
Never mind.

312
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,800
Thank you.

313
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,879
Mommy, does your leg still hurt?

314
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,359
Quanquan, it's not hurting at all.

315
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,479
It's only a minor injury.

316
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:21,800
See? I can still make a peace sign.

317
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Don't move your leg.

318
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
You might get lame
if you don't recover well.

319
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,599
Don't jinx me, okay?

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,239
It's true. I've seen plenty of cases.

321
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,599
I'm a little hungry, Zhou Ruji.

322
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,719
Let's get our lunch.

323
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:35,560
But we just had it.

324
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,879
I got hungry again, okay?

325
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,959
Quanquan, would you like some ice cream?

326
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,400
Let's get you some, okay?

327
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,239
Quanquan, you can go with them.

328
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,359
Daddy can keep me company.

329
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,040
Don't worry.

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,239
Go on.

331
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,520
Come with us.

332
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,680
Okay.

333
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,160
Don't move your leg.

334
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,200
I got it.

335
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Take your time.

336
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,800
Go on.

337
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,839
This way.

338
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,999
I'm the one who got injured.

339
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,759
Why the long face?

340
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm mad at myself.

341
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,320
Had I arrived sooner...

342
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,560
You're not clairvoyant.

343
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,800
Besides, it's a minor injury.

344
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,680
It's only a fissure.

345
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
The doctors always
make it sound worse.

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,879
But I'm alright.

347
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,599
All I need is three to four weeks

348
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,160
of rest.

349
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,639
I can use the break.

350
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,719
You heard Zhou Ruji.

351
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,080
You might be lame.

352
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,239
It won't be that bad.

353
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,920
Don't listen to him.

354
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,479
I'm alright.

355
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,920
See?

356
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,800
See?

357
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,999
Trust me. I am okay.

358
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,839
What was wrong with you?

359
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,320
You knew Xin Qi would be worried

360
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
about Min Hui's condition.

361
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,280
Why did you tell him that?

362
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,879
Wait.

363
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm a doctor.

364
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,759
It's my duty to tell them the truth.

365
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,839
When did you learn to argue?

366
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,280
So, did you do anything wrong?

367
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,200
Yes.

368
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,560
Move your face here.

369
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,560
There are people around us.

370
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,680
So what?

371
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
Be gentle.

372
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,920
Why would I ever want
to slap my dear?

373
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,200
You're so cute and handsome.

374
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,879
Zhuzhu.

375
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,080
What is it?

376
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,639
Is it really so much fun

377
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
to be in love with Daddy Zhou?

378
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,920
That's not true.

379
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
Sure. It's so much fun.

380
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,959
When I grow up,

381
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,239
I'll show you things
that are even more fun.

382
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,999
Sure.

383
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,759
You'll have to grow up quickly

384
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,599
before I become an old lady.

385
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,719
Let me have a bite of your ice cream.

386
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,839
The ice cream is delicious.

387
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,040
It's sour.

388
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,639
There.

389
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,440
Let's switch it up.

390
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I asked Hardy to check
the plate of that motorbike.

391
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,479
It was fake.

392
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,320
I called the police.

393
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,280
It wasn't an accident.

394
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,080
It's Cheng Qirang.

395
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,520
He's losing his patience
and getting desperate.

396
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,399
Xin Qi, you never said it,

397
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,199
but I can sense it.

398
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,560
You're secretly investigating
Cheng Qirang, am I right?

399
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,040
I knew you'd find out eventually.

400
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,520
I didn't plan to
keep you in the dark.

401
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
But some preparation is needed.

402
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,720
It's almost time.

403
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,919
When you get better,

404
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,399
I'll take you to someone.

405
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,240
Xin Qi.

406
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,879
Cheng Qirang is a lot
more dangerous than you think.

407
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,839
I'm more worried about you right now.

408
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,960
Promise me

409
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,080
you will never do anything risky

410
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,119
for my sake.

411
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,199
Don't worry.

412
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,639
I have you and Quanquan with me now.

413
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,919
I won't do anything reckless.

414
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,560
Lie down.

415
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,879
Do you like the restaurant?

416
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
The food was good.

417
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,439
But you barely ate anything.

418
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,960
I am very particular
with weight management.

419
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,439
I can't afford to be fat.

420
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,560
Yes, our chief dancer.

421
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,800
I must head home now.

422
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,599
Yes. Rest well if you're exhausted.

423
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,240
What...

424
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,080
But...

425
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,159
What is it? Did you forget something?

426
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,520
(Zhou Ruji, you don't love me anymore.)

427
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,080
How did you come to that conclusion?

428
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:18,159
You didn't see me off at my house.

429
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,399
You didn't even look back.

430
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,520
You didn't hesitate to leave.

431
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,839
I wish I could turn back,

432
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,560
but I have a morning shift tomorrow.

433
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,199
(I must go home and get some rest.)

434
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,480
I understand your circumstances.

435
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,879
But I was a little bit disappointed.

436
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:35,960
(Whatever.)

437
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,919
Go home and rest well.

438
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,520
You wouldn't get it anyway.

439
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,119
(Hello?)

440
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,960
Zhuzhu?

441
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,839
Why did you come back?

442
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,199
How else can I show you
how much I miss you?

443
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,839
Good night.

444
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,919
One. Two. Three.

445
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,119
One. Two. Three.

446
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,760
One. Two. Three.

447
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,280
One. Two. Three.

448
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,040
See you tomorrow.

449
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,359
Why did you bring me here?

450
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,800
Are you hiding a mistress here?

451
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,760
You got that right.

452
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,560
But it's not mine.

453
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,159
It's been a long time.

454
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,879
Min Hui.

455
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,480
Talk to her.

456
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,119
I'll wait outside.

457
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,119
Is this about Cheng Qirang?

458
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,760
You sure know him well.

459
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,720
Why did you post those articles?

460
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,040
Why are you going against him?

461
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
It was Xin Qi's idea.

462
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,960
He asked me to do it.

463
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,199
Take a guess.

464
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,919
What did he promise me in return?

465
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,679
If promising rewards was enough

466
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,280
to convince you to do this,

467
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,599
Xin Qi would have done it
right from the start.

468
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,280
My guess is that
Cheng Qirang hurt you.

469
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,280
Xin Qi simply took advantage of it.

470
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,480
Actually,

471
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
I envy you and Xin Qi.

472
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,159
He understands you.

473
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,240
You understand him.

474
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,240
Unlike me,

475
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,879
I was so blind.

476
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,599
After all the time
I spent with Cheng Qirang,

477
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,280
I failed to see his true nature.

478
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,000
You weren't blind.

479
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,240
You chose not to believe it.

480
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,560
You stood up against him.

481
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,480
I thank you for that.

482
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,159
But you know what?

483
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,560
Even after you stood up against him,

484
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
we have no evidence.

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,320
Cheng Qirang is
officially pressing charges

486
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,280
against "Disappeared Amy".

487
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,399
You're the only one without evidence,

488
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,000
not us.

489
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,080
You can decide for yourself.

490
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,119
Will you work with me

491
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,679
and make Cheng Qirang pay?

492
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,110
(Min Hui: Live-Streaming)
(Greetings, everyone.)

493
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,879
(I am Min Hui.)

494
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,520
(I am the female employee)

495
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,080
(who was sexually
harassed by Cheng Qirang)

496
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,359
(five years ago as mentioned
in Disappeared Amy's articles.)

497
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,190
(Lin Xiyue: Live-Streaming)
(Hello, everyone.)

498
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,159
(I am "Disappeared Amy".)

499
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,720
(I am the female employee)

500
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,000
(in the article who helped Cheng Qirang
frame Employee Y.)

501
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,800
Cai, check this out.

502
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,280
Min Hui is doing a live stream.

503
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,159
(I was a fresh graduate five years ago.)

504
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,240
(I joined Guanchao's R&D Team.)

505
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,599
(Cheng Qirang was
the deputy director at the time.)

506
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,159
(He put me in charge
of an important project.)

507
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,439
(At first,)

508
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,000
(I thought he gave me the opportunity)

509
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,199
(because of my talent.)

510
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,679
(I was grateful to him at some point.)

511
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,919
But one night,

512
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,080
I was working overtime at the office.

513
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,119
He made up an excuse
about data errors

514
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,800
and summoned me to his office.

515
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr. Cheng, you asked for me?

516
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,159
Yes, come in.

517
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,599
Is there a problem with the programming?

518
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,520
Come in.

519
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,080
There's nothing wrong with your program.

520
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,599
You did a great job.

521
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,599
You're young.
Don't spend all your time working.

522
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,760
(I was working overtime
late into the night that day.)

523
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,240
(I was just about to leave)

524
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,879
(when I heard an intense quarrel)

525
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,399
(coming out of Cheng Qirang's office.)

526
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,399
(So, I walked there quietly.)

527
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,280
Let go of me!

528
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,740
Min Hui!

529
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,960
- Mr. Cheng!
- Mi Hui!

530
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,040
If you don't believe me,

531
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,560
I have the recording

532
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,240
(of Cheng Qirang asking me
to make false testimony for him.)

533
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
(I will go public
with this recording as well.)

534
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,430
(After the incident,)

535
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,910
(Cheng Qirang never showed any remorse.)

536
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
He even went as far as
oppressing me and accusing me.

537
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,960
(I was disheartened.)

538
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,320
(I so dishearteningly believed that)

539
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,760
(had I swallowed it down,)

540
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,080
(everything would have been over)

541
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,919
(as if nothing had ever happened.)

542
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,480
(But why?)

543
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,320
(I was the one who was harmed)

544
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,280
(and hurt.)

545
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,520
(Instead of questioning the victimizer,)

546
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,119
(everyone thought it was my fault.)

547
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,439
(That is why people who suffered
sexual harassment)

548
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,879
(chose silence instead.)

549
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,879
(But our silence will only)

550
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,560
(bolster the victimizers.)

551
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,480
(We must stand up and fight.)

552
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,359
This is the only way

553
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,480
to deter those who intend to
or are already harassing others.

554
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,280
Justice and equality

555
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,199
can only be acquired through
our constant struggles.

556
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,639
I don't know if my statement
will bear any results.

557
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,919
But I want everyone

558
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,960
who went through the same thing as I did

559
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,000
(to be brave.)

560
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,560
(You are not alone.)

561
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,199
(We are here for you.)

562
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,919
Ms. Min is so brave.

563
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,439
(From now on,)

564
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,599
(I won't let you
get mistreated ever again.)

565
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
(It's not your fault. Well done!)

566
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,800
(We are here for you.)

567
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,760
(A big thumb-up for you!
Let's share this!)

568
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,520
(You are not alone.)

569
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,879
(Let's share this and make
the bad guys pay!)

570
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:19,560
(- I'm here for you.
- I'm here for you.)

571
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,320
(- We are here for you.
- We are here for you.)

572
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,940
(Sexual harassment in Guanchao:
still happening after five years)

573
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:26,080
Worthless fools!

574
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,040
Leave!

575
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,000
Worthless fools!

576
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,879
Are you Cheng Qirang?

577
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,040
I told you to...

578
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,040
You are now a suspect in an attempted
sexual assault five years ago.

579
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,480
Please come with us.

580
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,839
Yes.

581
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,560
Ding Yifeng is sentenced
to three years in prison

582
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
for corporate espionage.

583
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,280
Cheng Qirang was arrested too.

584
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,960
(Guanchao's stock price)
Guanchao's stock price dropped again.

585
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,919
You don't seem surprised at all.

586
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,040
Actually, it felt strange.

587
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,240
Not a day goes by

588
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,760
without me wishing
for Cheng Qirang to be punished.

589
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,359
But when the day comes,

590
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,159
I feel peaceful.

591
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:54,560
Perhaps it's because I now have

592
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:56,599
a more important attachment.

593
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,439
When did you
start investigating Lin Xiyue?

594
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,960
Let me take a guess.

595
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,240
After Guanchao acquired Be Agile...

596
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,919
No.

597
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,000
It was after I told you about

598
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,199
the incident from five years ago,

599
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,800
am I right?

600
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,720
Back then, I told you

601
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,960
I would never let you get mistreated.

602
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,839
Not even five years ago.

603
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,919
But Lin Xiyue testified
against Cheng Qirang.

604
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,320
I don't think he would

605
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
let her get away with this.

606
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,839
Don't worry.

607
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,560
I have everything arranged.

608
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,800
After everything is over,

609
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,760
I'll arrange for her to leave Bincheng.

610
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,879
Everything?

611
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,040
Is it not over yet?

612
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,040
Blue Jay will make
a tender offer tomorrow

613
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,639
to buy out Guanchao.

614
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,560
You did all of these

615
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,119
in such a short time?

616
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,919
I made you a promise.

617
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,240
I will never let your life's work

618
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,119
fall into Cheng Qirang's hands.

619
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
At the same time,

620
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,119
I want him to pay for his crime
during these years.

621
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,839
I meant what I said.

622
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,839
I believe you.

642
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,420
(One month later)

643
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,399
So far,

644
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,960
we've acquired 26 percent

645
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,240
of Guanchao's shares.

646
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,119
Zheng Yiting and Zheng Bangguo

647
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,399
still hold 31 percent.

648
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,240
In other words,

649
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,320
we need five more percent

650
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,359
to have a controlling interest.

651
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,839
I can figure something out

652
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,800
with the funding while I'm abroad.

653
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,040
But how do you get the shares?

654
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,679
We've covered most Individual investors

655
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,960
from the secondary market.

656
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,639
Some of Guanchao's shareholders

657
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,040
are disappointed in Cheng Qirang

658
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,679
over the sexual harassment scandal.

659
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,919
We took over whatever we could.

660
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,960
As for the rest...

661
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,320
(What do you mean?)

662
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,879
Is getting five percent that difficult?

663
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,720
It's very challenging.

664
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
But there is someone

665
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,960
who can help us.

666
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,560
Take a seat.

667
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:50,280
Lin Xiyue, Cheng Qirang
treated you well.

668
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,599
He spent quite a fortune on you.

669
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,000
Is this how you repay him?

670
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,720
You knew about my relationship with him.

671
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,240
But you put up with it for so long.

672
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,439
I don't care

673
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,040
how many mistresses he has out there.

674
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,159
Besides, you threw yourself at him.

675
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,040
You don't understand him at all.

676
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,800
The harder it is to get,

677
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,919
the more he's obsessed with it.

678
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,720
She's a lot smarter.

679
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,439
Mr. Xin.

680
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,760
Are we here

681
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,159
just so you can tell me

682
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,879
my husband has been cheating on me?

683
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,879
Mrs. Cheng.

684
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,639
I asked you to come here

685
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,560
to make a deal with you.

686
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,639
If you're willing to sell me

687
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,439
five percent of Guanchao's shares
that you hold,

688
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,839
I promise you

689
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,199
in the future,

690
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,040
the Zheng family will still
have influence in Guanchao.

691
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,839
You brought this woman here

692
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,359
to tell me

693
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
my husband was having an affair.

694
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:42,919
You want me to hate him.

695
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,760
Then, you want me to help you
take Guanchao from my family.

696
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,040
You are wasting your time.

697
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,159
No matter how many mistresses
Cheng Qirang has out there,

698
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:52,960
for Guanchao's sake,

699
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,639
I'll never file a divorce.

700
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,359
I'll certainly never betray Guanchao.

701
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,720
The Husky you used to have

702
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,040
was bitten to death
by a black pit bull.

703
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,679
Do you remember that?

704
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,440
How did you know?

705
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,639
Cheng Qirang told me himself.

706
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,319
He was there when it happened.

707
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:21,319
He let the dogs fight on purpose.

708
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,920
It bit the Husky's neck
and wouldn't let go.

709
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,319
Right here.

710
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,560
The most vital part.

711
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,440
And he simply watched
as your dog

712
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,319
was bitten to death.

713
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,960
Impossible.

714
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Cheng Qirang didn't have the guts.

715
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,880
You know him

716
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,759
better than I do.

717
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,239
Is there anything he wouldn't do?

718
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,960
Cheng Qirang is cruel and vile.

719
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,440
He'd do anything for his goals.

720
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,360
Bribing, sexual harassment,
and physical harm.

721
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,840
Unlawful use of spying devices

722
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,360
for corporate espionage

723
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
got him ten years in prison.

724
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,679
You are aware of Guanchao's predicament.

725
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,880
The best course
of action for you right now

726
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,279
is to join hands with Blue Jay.

727
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,679
That is the only way to salvage

728
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,560
the company's losses and reputation.

729
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,840
Five percent.

730
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,639
Will that be enough?

731
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,319
Min Hui.

732
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm leaving Bincheng tomorrow.

733
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:33,440
I thank you for making that decision.

734
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
After all,

735
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,279
you actually loved Cheng Qirang.

736
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,159
In the end, the person
who understands me the most

737
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,440
is you.

738
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,480
I completed my mission.

739
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:50,119
The rest is up to you.

740
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,880
Sorry.

741
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,440
You finally got the apology you wanted.

742
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,279
May all go well for us.

743
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,560
May all go well for us.

744
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,140
(Equity Transfer Agreement
of Guanchao Group)

745
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,750
(The Youngest Boss of Guanchao)
This is my father! Isn't he handsome?

746
00:36:56,759 --> 00:37:02,080
- He's so cool!
- He's so cool!

747
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:11,759
Everyone, quiet down.

748
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:14,239
Up next,

749
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,880
please welcome our new boss,

750
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,719
Mr. Xin!

751
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,560
Give us a speech.
A round of applause for him.

752
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,679
We fought hard.

753
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,599
Thankfully, I didn't give up.

754
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:29,159
Otherwise, I would have
missed the chance to work with

755
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,520
a bunch of professional

756
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,960
and lovable colleagues.

757
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
Thank you.

758
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,560
This acquisition

759
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,159
means a lot to me.

760
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,119
In terms of business,

761
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,480
it concerns Blue Jay and RG Group's
development direction in China

762
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,560
in the next ten years.

763
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,080
For me personally,

764
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,040
I made someone a promise.

765
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,000
As long as I'm around,

766
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,960
I will never let her get mistreated.

767
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,080
Fine.

768
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,599
Kiss!

769
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,279
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

770
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,400
Alright.

771
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,799
Hardy, what is it?

772
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,159
Quit down.

773
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,119
I have something more serious
to tell everyone.

774
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,520
Congratulations to everyone

775
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,920
and Be Agile
for making it through this crisis.

776
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,520
Congratulations to
our AI modeling project

777
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
for surviving.

778
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,000
I raise a toast to everyone.

779
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
Come on.

780
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,679
- Everyone, cheers!
- Cheers!

781
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

782
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,440
Does your head still hurt?

783
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,920
Do you need medicine for the hangover?

784
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,719
Chen Jiajun.

785
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,080
You are so nice.

786
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,040
Because I like you.

787
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,360
Of course I have to treat you well.

788
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:51,719
So...

789
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,920
What if one day

790
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:58,080
you don't like me anymore?

791
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,080
That day will never come.

792
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:01,199
Silly.

793
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,920
When I was little,

794
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,360
my parents fought a lot.

795
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,000
At first, I was scared.

796
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,119
But I got used to it.

797
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,679
I didn't get it at the time.

798
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,440
If all that's left of a marriage
is constant fighting,

799
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
why bother getting married?

800
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,480
I don't know why they fought so much.

801
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,759
But it's different for everyone.

802
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,960
I've always wanted a home.

803
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,679
When I wake up every morning,

804
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
I have breakfast with my family.

805
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,400
I can share my joy

806
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,119
and have someone to console me
when I'm sad.

807
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,199
No matter how weary I am,

808
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:47,520
there is always a place

809
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
where I can let my guard down and rest.

810
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,080
It's all over.

811
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,000
What if people accuse us of nepotism?

812
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,960
Now you consider me your family?

813
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,000
Speaking of that,

814
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,560
maybe it's time
you give me the title.

815
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,040
What else do you want?

816
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,159
The whole company knows

817
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,440
you are my boyfriend.

818
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,599
What else can I give you?

819
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,920
That depends on your performance.

Min Hui.

821
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
As I said,

after everything is over,

823
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,840
it'd be time to think about our future.
