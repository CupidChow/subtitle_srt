=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
=Episode 22=

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
Time to take your medicine.

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,679
Well, Mr. Xin.

27
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,039
Do you have to work so hard?

28
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,480
The doctor sent you back

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,080
so you could rest and recover,

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,399
not to let you work in your bed.

31
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,000
Money can't buy you anything

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,519
in death.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,239
If anything happens to you,
Quanquan will be sad.

34
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,519
Don't stand so far away.

35
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,959
Sit here.

36
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,880
Can't we talk unless you are here
to send me medicine

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,959
or food?

38
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,839
Honestly,

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
knowing that you are in the living room

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,279
makes me miss you even more.

41
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,360
Come. Take a seat.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,399
Can you stop staring at me?

43
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,679
Finish your medicine.

44
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,040
Don't miss the time.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,239
Okay.

46
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:45,880
I'll take the pill.

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,959
I want to talk about something serious.

48
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,640
Yuanlai is going to sell Be Agile.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,999
Impossible.

50
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,760
Be Agile's business is taking off.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
And the AI modeling project is

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,160
now on the right track.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,360
It will start making a profit soon.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,799
But Cindy and I

55
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,119
have asked around
using different sources.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,200
There is no doubt about it.

57
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,320
There are already rumors on
the investment market.

58
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,119
I get it now.

59
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,839
I'll get to the bottom of this.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,239
I can't let our AI modeling project

61
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,559
run into a setback.

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Calm down.

63
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm telling you so you can be prepared,

64
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,239
not to be worried.

65
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,760
I know that.

66
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,880
I know what to do. But you?

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,559
Nothing is more
important than your health.

68
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,880
Do as I say. Turn off your computer.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
Go to sleep now.

70
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,880
What about you?

71
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,640
Have you cleaned the living room?

72
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,559
I'm taking Quanquan home.

73
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,760
I'll come back tomorrow.

74
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,719
It doesn't make a difference
where you are.

75
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,839
This is how heart disease is.

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,519
You can watch over me at all times,

77
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,119
but I might still leave
this world quietly

78
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,279
in my sleep.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
It's best that you go home.

80
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,480
What if...

81
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,760
I don't want to scare you.

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm warning you. Don't overstep it.

83
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,839
Daddy, don't worry.

84
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,599
I'll tell you a story
and put you to sleep.

85
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,479
Min Hui, you may go now.

86
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,359
Let us heart disease patients

87
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,000
have each other's company.

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,440
My dear son.

89
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,159
Min Quanquan!
You want to look after him?

90
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,080
I know what you're up to.

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,320
I can see right through
your little scheming.

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,640
Come on. We're going home.

93
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Mommy! I really pity Xin Qi.

94
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,159
Can't you look after him?

95
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,120
Fine, we're not leaving.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
No one is leaving.

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,359
We're staying

98
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,000
and looking after him.

99
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:54,760
Well done, son.

100
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Daddy.

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you really going to
leave us in your sleep?

102
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,200
No way.

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,399
I said that to trick Min Hui.

104
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,680
Because she is too cold-hearted.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
My body is well and strong.

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,039
I promised to be with you forever.

107
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,880
Don't you remember?

108
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,560
But remember,

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
do not do what I just did.

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,919
Do not make Min Hui
worry about your sickness.

111
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:17,719
Is that clear?

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
Don't worry.

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,800
I care more about her feelings than you.

114
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,159
Come on. Give me a hug.

115
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,800
Sleep with me tonight.

116
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,839
Wait.

117
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,039
You can't sleep here.

118
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,839
It's too far from your room.

119
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,159
I'll sleep here tonight.

120
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,599
It's closer here.

121
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,000
If anything happens to you at night,

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,039
or if you have any needs,

123
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,519
it's easier for me to tend to you.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,719
Any needs?

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
What is that supposed to mean?

126
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,519
I'm warning you,

127
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,080
I can still leave this room.

128
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,519
What's wrong?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,880
My heart is palpitating.

130
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Palpitation? Let me check it.

131
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,959
Your heart rate monitor

132
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,120
is not showing anything, so...

133
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,760
The stats can lie sometimes.

134
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,560
But the heart won't.

135
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,599
You...

136
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,640
Well?

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,279
It's steady.

138
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,640
It's healthy.

139
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,200
I wish you're always so healthy.

140
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,519
I'll do my best,

141
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
as long as you are with me.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,080
Judging by your strong heart rate,

143
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,000
you will be perfectly fine tonight.

144
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,760
You don't need me here.

145
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,519
I'm sleeping in the guest room.

146
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,440
Xin Qi?

147
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,680
Xin Qi, wake up.

148
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,080
Xin Qi?

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
You have a phone conference.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Wake up.

151
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,359
Xin Qi?

152
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,560
What?

153
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,159
Are you worried that my death
would make Quanquan sad?

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,120
Don't be so childish.

155
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Don't worry.

156
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,959
I'll live well.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,080
I promised Quanquan
to always be with him.

158
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,599
Of course, I have to be with you too.

159
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,200
I won't let you

160
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,399
be alone again.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm done talking with you.

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Get out of bed already.

(Jiangbei Central Hospital)

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,519
(Jiangbei Central Hospital)
Dr. Li, you don't have to see me off.

165
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,560
Thank you for your time today.

166
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
You're welcome, Ms. Cao.

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,000
It's the first batch of

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,119
the AI modeling project's
clinical application.

169
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,800
I'm honored that you considered us

170
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,119
before other competitors.

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,639
You are too modest.

172
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,280
I must thank you and the hospital

173
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,479
for supporting and trusting us.

174
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,040
Let's look forward to the fruition.

175
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes.

176
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,239
I must get going now.

177
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,040
Ms. Cao.

178
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,119
You traveled far to come here.

179
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,920
At least let me
treat my guest to a meal.

180
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
I have a meeting to attend.

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,719
Carry on. We'll meet up another day.

182
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,560
Sure. Have a nice day.

183
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,119
Bye.

185
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,599
Did you get drenched?

186
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,160
You've been working since you woke up.

187
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
I prepared some food and water for you.

188
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,599
I got your favorite
hand-brewed coffee in the cup.

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,080
Those can wait. I'm late.

190
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,040
We're meeting Professor Yu,

191
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,479
who is a cardiology expert.

192
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,839
It's not ease to convince
him to endorse us.

193
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,040
He will give me a hard time with

194
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,839
all the questions.

195
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,200
I have to check the files.

196
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,599
I know your career is important.

197
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,599
But you can't put your health at risk.

198
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,599
You never got

199
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,999
eight hours of sleep
in the past three days.

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,639
At this rate, your body will crumble.

201
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm used to this lifestyle.

202
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,160
But...

203
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,520
Hello?

204
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,719
(Hello? Cao Mu?)

205
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:35,040
I just got some news from Xin Qi.

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,920
Yuanlai might be
planning to sell Be Agile.

207
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
That's not possible.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,119
He Haixiang is working
so hard to promote it.

209
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:42,680
Hold on.

210
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,599
Do you notice anything fishy?

211
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,719
Think about how little He Haixiang

212
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,479
cared about

213
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,800
the AI modeling project.

214
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
We all know that.

215
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,839
His enthusiasm now
signals something sinister.

216
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,280
You're right.

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,239
I thought he had a change of mind.

218
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,040
Given the circumstances,

219
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,680
I bet he already knew about this.

220
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
That is why he is

221
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,719
so eager to make it a success,

222
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,639
so he can raise Be Agile's market value.

223
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,040
He is waiting for the highest bidder!

224
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,560
I knew it.

225
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
It was wrong to even think

226
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,080
he has any noble ambition.

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,560
I must confront him now.

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,119
Wait until I go back.

229
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,400
I'll rush back to you
after I meet Professor Yu.

230
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,839
Sure. I'll wait.

231
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,359
Okay. Bye.

232
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,280
Let's go.

233
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,119
The latest flight back
to Bincheng is at 7 p.m.

234
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,280
After you meet the professor,

235
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
we could grab a meal

236
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,879
before we rush to the airport.

237
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,879
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

238
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
If you want an earlier flight,
it will be around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m.

239
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,719
It's alright.

240
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,479
I thought letting you tag along

241
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,879
would bring me trouble.

242
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,839
You've actually been
of great help to me.

243
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
I told you so.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,239
Taking me with you
will only do you good.

245
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,479
Now you get it.

246
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,959
What is it?

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,599
That came out of nowhere.

248
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
Alright.

249
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's go. We are late.

250
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:10,999
I was wondering

251
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,800
when you'd ever be here.

252
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,920
Enough about me.

253
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,400
How is the situation at Be Agile?

254
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:19,080
I've hired experts
to estimate Be Agile's value.

255
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
RG Group's board has been informed.

256
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,560
But as of now,

257
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
they have more suspicion than passion.

258
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,639
The capitalist market is
all about trust.

259
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,800
If no one is passionate enough,

260
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,959
it's hard to make any progress.

261
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,560
It's alright. I'll tend to that matter.

262
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,160
What about you?

263
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,400
When are you going back?

264
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,239
I was supposed to leave tomorrow.

265
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,680
I'll stay for a few more days.

266
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I'll use the next few days

267
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,560
to get a better understanding
of Be Agile's situation.

268
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,040
I'll bring back
the proposal we settle on.

269
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
It's easier for me to convince

270
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,999
the old geezers of the board.

271
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,680
Thanks.

272
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,639
Enough fancy talks.

273
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,200
Let's get practical.

274
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Listen, I'm sick
of staying in the hotel.

275
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,879
Not a chance.

276
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,520
My hips...

277
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,560
Not a chance!

278
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,639
You can stay at Hardy's place.

279
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,479
Sure.

280
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,440
Not a chance.

281
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,479
You put love before your sister!

282
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,400
I know you envy her.

283
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,920
Fine. To make it up to you,

284
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,400
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

285
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,920
That's a shame.

286
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,239
I have an important date tonight.

287
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,800
Do you have any friends here?

288
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm not telling you.

289
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,639
Ladies.

290
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,080
Have mercy on me.

291
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,560
You could just go to the board.

292
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,599
We're not worthy of questioning them.

293
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,239
Yeah.

294
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,879
Only someone like you
can have a nice conversation

295
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,839
with us.

296
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,040
Tell us the truth.

297
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
We'll move aside for you.

298
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Yes, we only have one question.

299
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,040
Is the board going to sell off Be Agile?

300
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,280
Answer or stay here.

301
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
You got me.

302
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,359
You got me, okay?

303
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,320
Ladies,

304
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,999
can't we talk sitting down?

305
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,350
- Start talking.
-Start talking.

306
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,879
Yuanlai's old chairman retired.

307
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,160
His son took the place.

308
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,599
You know about that too.

309
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,719
The new chairman
is bound to shake things up.

310
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,479
The first move is to sell Be Agile.

311
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,320
It hasn't been made official.

312
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,920
You can keep it to yourselves.

313
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,999
Do not spread the word about it.

314
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,560
But I don't get it.

315
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,080
Be Agile has been performing well.

316
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,719
Mist is now

317
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,719
in clinical tests.

318
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,680
The AI modeling project
is on the right track.

319
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,599
The business is thriving.
Why sell it off now?

320
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,320
Min Hui.

321
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
You are so tunneled in on your research

322
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,440
and data.

323
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,800
You have no idea
what's going on out there.

324
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,440
In the past three years,

325
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,040
Yuanlai's core business
has been losing money.

326
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,999
Be Agile is burning up a lot of money.

327
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,160
In your eyes,

328
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,839
Be Agile is the future and the ideal.

329
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,200
But for the new chairman,

330
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,359
Be Agile is a waste of money.

331
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,680
Of course he wants to sell it.

332
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,920
Not to mention

333
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,160
the old chairman only invested in it

334
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,119
to get on
the high-tech industry bandwagon.

335
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,119
Yuanlai's core business

336
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,080
ran into funding issues.

337
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,879
Be Agile is certainly the first
to be sold off.

338
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,520
But Be Agile is now...

339
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,400
Don't worry too much.

340
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,359
We are only employees.

341
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,479
The one running the company
has nothing to do with us.

342
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,560
Even if Be Agile is sold off,
the new boss will still

343
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,759
need people to carry out his operations

344
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,080
and do the work for the company.

345
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,040
From what I see,

346
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,119
our top priority

347
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,599
is to make huge progress quickly

348
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,599
with the AI modeling project.

349
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,639
It has to succeed and go into
clinical application soon.

350
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,400
At least Be Agile will be sold
at a good price.

351
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,520
We won't be at a disadvantage.

352
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,239
Right?

353
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:43,920
Ladies,

354
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,440
I've told you everything I know.

355
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,800
I must get off work.

356
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,879
He Haixiang thought
we were just afraid of

357
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,680
losing our jobs.

358
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,860
(Cindy)

359
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:08,839
Actually,

360
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,080
Xin Qi is a good man.

361
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,800
But he is stubborn.

362
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,440
Hardy taught me a new word.

363
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
What was it again?

364
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,759
"Tsundere?"

365
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,839
Yes, that's the word!

366
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,239
But he is a bit more adorable that way.

367
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,040
But when he's with me,

368
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,599
he doesn't act all that adorable.

369
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,999
Actually, I understand how it feels.

370
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,200
When Xin Qi first
came to our home as a boy,

371
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,560
he was a stranger

372
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,119
who was sick.

373
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,239
His episodes scared him the most.

374
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,959
Subconsciously,

375
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,239
he thought that

376
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,639
his episodes

377
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,320
were troublesome for the adults.

378
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,239
They might send him
back to the orphanage.

379
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,359
Ever since he was a kid,

380
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,639
he's learned to play down
the seriousness of his sickness.

381
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
The more it hurt,

382
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,119
the more he tried to act tough.

383
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,759
Sometimes,

384
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,280
his lips turned purple from the pain.

385
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,680
But he didn't want me to worry,

386
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,759
so he consoled me.

387
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,639
"Cindy, I'm okay. I'm alright."

388
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,560
I...

389
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm leaving the country next week.

390
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,719
After I leave,

391
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,719
I might hardly
get a chance to see him again.

392
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:40,080
Our entire family is abroad.

393
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,040
We are concerned about him.

394
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,040
But honestly,

395
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:46,800
after knowing
you'd been taking care of him,

396
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,520
I was relieved.

397
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:51,759
Cindy.

398
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
I want to say...

399
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,400
Min Hui.

400
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,359
Do not reject me.

401
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,560
Do not reject him.

402
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,999
You understand the situation.

403
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,960
He lost his family as a kid.

404
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
You and Quanquan

405
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,639
are all the light he has left.

406
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,399
I get it now.

407
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,599
Thank you.

408
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,080
Thank you.

409
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Come on. Give me a hug.

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,080
Thank you.

411
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Thank you.

412
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,320
Xin Qi.

413
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,599
You've checked the watch for 21 times.

414
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,240
Please.

415
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,679
As long as I am here,

416
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,679
Min Hui will certainly
come back, alright?

417
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,240
Fine. All thanks to you.

418
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,439
Don't be so nervous.

419
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm not nervous.

420
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,679
I'm worried about your mom.

421
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,839
Quanquan?

422
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,159
Min Hui, you're back!

423
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,280
- Come on.
- You're finally back!

424
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,720
Quanquan,

425
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,399
did you behave today?

426
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:23,879
Did you cause Xin Qi any trouble?

427
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:25,960
Did you make sure he took his pills?

428
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,639
Quanquan has been a good boy.

429
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Me too.

430
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
Can I get some compliments?

431
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,800
We all behaved.

432
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,240
That's very nice of you.

433
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,439
I can reward you with a small ice cream.

434
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,280
Really?

435
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah.

436
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,119
It's in the fridge. Get it yourself.

437
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,679
Alright.

438
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,000
Stop pretending. I saw it just now.

439
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,000
You drank wine. With whom?

440
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,839
Why do you care?

441
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,199
Why are you sniffing?

442
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,119
Are you a dog or something?

443
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,000
That perfume...

444
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,520
Cindy is the only one who would wear it.

445
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,560
So, Cindy had a date with you tonight.

446
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,480
That's a relief.

447
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,199
What was there to worry about?

448
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,320
No.

449
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,720
Who are you to be worried?

450
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,919
That reminds me of something.

451
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,320
These are some classic male fragrances.

452
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,119
Pick one.

453
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,679
Other men will know you're in love

454
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,159
with just one sniff.

455
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,240
They won't try to woo you.

456
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,760
When you had your last check-up,

457
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
did you get a brain scan?

458
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,159
I think there's something wrong with it.

459
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,000
You don't like these?

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
I have others for you to choose!

461
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,919
We could buy more tomorrow if you want!

462
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,240
I have to buy more.

463
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,159
Quanquan?

464
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,879
What a mess.

465
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:35,320
Do you like it?

466
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,159
Consider this my gift to you

467
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,599
for looking after me these few days.

468
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,560
It looks pretty.

469
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,839
Sit down.

470
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,359
Are you still concerned about Be Agile?

471
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,760
Let me take a guess.

472
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,560
You are worried the
AI modeling project

473
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
will go down the drain.

474
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,439
The AI modeling project

475
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,879
is like a child to me.

476
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,879
I watched as it grew
and became more mature.

477
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,040
The next few years

478
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,080
are the most critical time for it.

479
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,439
If Be Agile is acquired,

480
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,480
I may not even get to be

481
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
on the R&D team.

482
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,599
Not to mention that He Haixiang

483
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,720
is going after
the short-term profit anyway.

484
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,760
Let me help you.

485
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,639
How can you help?

486
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,760
Ask Blue Jay Group to acquire Be Agile?

487
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,639
Blue Jay is not a bank.

488
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,919
It's not like you can get
all the money you need.

489
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
Besides, Cindy told me

490
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,960
the old geezers on the board

491
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,080
are very stubborn.

492
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,159
I am serious about this.

493
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,000
Do things at your own pace.

494
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,679
Do what you must.

495
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,119
Run the tests you need.

496
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,839
Do the clinical tests as you should.

497
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,000
Leave the rest to me.

498
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,800
What? Don't you trust me?

499
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,960
It's nothing.

500
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,359
I just...

501
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,399
For years,

502
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,520
I've been fighting alone.

503
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,679
I faced and solved
every problem on my own.

504
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,800
But now it feels like

505
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,439
a lifesaver falling out of the sky.

506
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,760
I am not used to it now.

507
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,560
I'm not your lifesaver, okay?

508
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,320
I came back after years of absence.

509
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,520
From now until the end,

510
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,599
I'll stay on this post.

511
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll keep you safe.

512
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,240
I'll keep you company.

513
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,119
Look at the stars.

514
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Your head almost hit the window.

515
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:32,599
Thanks.

516
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
Hello, Zhou Ruji. What's up?

517
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,159
(Min Hui.)

518
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,599
(Are you busy?)

519
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,720
Not really.

520
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
What is it? How can I help you?

521
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,040
It's nothing serious.

522
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,800
I just wanted to talk to someone.

523
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,639
We can talk later
if you have work to do.

524
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,359
It's alright.

525
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm going to

526
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,639
Jiaren Hospital for Mr. Yao.

527
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,679
Let's meet up after it's done.

528
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,080
(Sure. I'll wait in the duty room.)

529
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,919
Bye.

530
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,760
What is it?

531
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,320
No time to look after me,

532
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,919
but enough time to
meet up with Zhou Ruji?

533
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,560
Mr. Xin.

534
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,800
Eavesdropping is wrong.

535
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,639
I wasn't eavesdropping.

536
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,199
I was listening right in front of you.

537
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,000
Hardy.

538
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,119
Drop me off at the next junction.

539
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,720
I can go to Jiaren Hospital by taxi.

540
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,439
You don't have to.

541
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,879
I'm going to Mr. Yao
to get my medical report.

542
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:21,439
Let's go there.

543
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
Mr. Xin, you have an appointment
with the bank this afternoon.

544
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,199
Staring at me won't change a thing.

545
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,280
Carry on with your work, Mr. Xin.

546
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,399
I'll get the report for you.

547
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,420
(Jiaren Hospital)

548
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,439
Dr. Han.

549
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,320
Dr. Zhou is over there.

550
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,359
Okay, thanks.

551
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,919
Dr. Zhou.

552
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,879
Have you met with Mr. Yao?

553
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,040
Take a seat.

554
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,599
I even got Xin Qi's medical report.

555
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,639
Everything is normal.

556
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:05,760
Here.

557
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,679
What's wrong?

558
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,399
What happened?

559
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,480
It's nothing major.

560
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,639
It's about

561
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,800
Yao Zizhu and me.

562
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,560
I wanted to ask the other day.

563
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,199
How are things between
you two afterward?

564
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,960
I went to her the other day.

565
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,199
I told her I like her.

566
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,800
She thought I only went for her

567
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,639
because I got rejected by you.

568
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,040
It's alright. I'll explain it for you.

569
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,960
It's no use.

570
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,240
I think I really
hurt her feelings this time.

571
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,639
I have no idea

572
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,280
what to do right now.

573
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't think

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,199
I'm the one
to give any constructive advice.

575
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:51,080
My life is a mess too.

576
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,679
But I think

577
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,439
many people
who wish the other one a happy life

578
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,119
don't really mean it.

579
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,919
Only a few mean what they say.

580
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:01,960
But Yao Zizhu did it.

581
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,839
The deeper her love for you is,

582
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
the more she hates to be mistreated.

583
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,839
She gave her 100 percent.

584
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,960
So, I think she wanted

585
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,639
your 100 percent in return.

586
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,439
I think I get it now.

587
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,560
All I have to do

588
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,760
is to use whatever means necessary

589
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,240
to prove to her that my feelings
are 100 percent real.

590
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
I can probably
expect good news from you.

591
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,439
Ms. Min.

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,119
We meet again.

593
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,000
It seems we are destined to meet.

594
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,359
Be Agile will have a new owner soon.

595
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,520
Have you thought about your future?

596
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,480
Does it have anything to do with you?

597
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,679
I feel sorry for you.

598
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,320
What for?

599
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,080
I feel sorry for the bee

600
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,800
that works hard for an entire year

601
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,599
only for others to taste

602
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:08,080
the honey.

603
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,720
What is that supposed to mean?

604
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
I miss the day

605
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,879
when we were colleagues in Guanchao.

606
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:17,199
You're the one acquiring Be Agile?

607
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,480
Now you know how I'm involved.

608
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,280
Let me put it this way.

609
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,000
I can tell you that

610
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,760
I have met Chairman Gao from Yuanlai.

611
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,439
Aren't you eager to find out

612
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,520
what we talked about?

613
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,280
My mood got better after seeing you.

614
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,359
If someone could take
a walk with me outside,

615
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,599
perhaps I could
disclose more information.

616
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,140
(Outpatient Department)

617
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,080
If you're so concerned,

618
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
you should've gone after her.

619
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,320
It's no use worrying now.

620
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,320
Of course I have faith in Min Hui.

621
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,199
So why...

622
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,919
But I don't trust Zhou Ruji.

623
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,879
Ms. Min is coming out.

624
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,879
Cheng Qirang?

625
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,320
Why are they together?

626
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,960
Min Hui hates Cheng Qirang.

627
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,480
Why would she get into his car?

628
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,159
Quick. Follow them.

629
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,879
Yes.

630
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,520
Can you tell me now?

631
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,240
Why are you acquiring Be Agile?

632
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,119
It's certainly because of

633
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,919
its value.

634
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,159
I didn't buy it because of you.

635
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,520
If you're acquiring Be Agile
for the sake of profit,

636
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
you should give up now.

637
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,919
As soon as the acquisition goes through,

638
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,359
I will resign.

639
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,480
Do you really think
you are that important

640
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,720
to Be Agile?

641
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,480
Be Agile's greatest value

642
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,560
lies in its AI modeling project.

643
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:20,399
And I

644
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,599
am in charge of the core R&D.

645
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,199
After I leave,

646
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,760
the whole project will be put to a halt.

647
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
There is no way
you can find a replacement

648
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,720
in such a short amount of time.

649
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,000
Otherwise, Guanchao would've
done the R&D,

650
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,199
instead of giving
Be Agile the advantage.

651
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,839
Even if you are right,

652
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,560
I believe

653
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,760
you wouldn't give up
on the AI modeling project.

654
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,879
Yes, you're right.

655
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,760
But I despise working
with you even more.

656
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,119
Every second I spend
looking at you disgusts me.

657
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,040
I told you five years ago.

658
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
You are mine.

659
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,080
You can only be mine.

660
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,720
What's wrong with me?

661
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,919
Why won't you accept me?

662
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,639
Maybe I can't marry you

663
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,639
now that

664
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:07,879
I've married someone else.

665
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:10,320
But I can give you anything else
that you want.

666
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,439
I care about you the most.

667
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,359
I saw her going this way.

668
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,199
Where did she go?

669
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,879
You took too long to park the car.

670
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,800
Hold on.

671
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,080
Something doesn't feel right.

672
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,199
Search that way. I'll go this way.

673
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:30,720
Yes.

674
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,000
You want to use this to blackmail me
into giving up Be Agile?

675
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,159
You almost succeeded.

676
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,960
Let go of me.

677
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,399
Min Hui.

678
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,320
You're the only woman I can't forget
even after five years.

679
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
You really disgust me.

680
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,679
You said the same thing five years ago.

681
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,800
If you agree,

682
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,879
I swear

683
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,679
I can give you everything.

684
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,199
I can divorce Zheng Yiting.

685
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:02,480
If Zheng Bangguo is dead,
Guanchao will be yours!

686
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,040
Let go of me!

687
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,320
Is Xin Qi that much better than me?

688
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,280
How am I not good enough?

689
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,679
Let me go!

690
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,480
Why did you choose Xin Qi over me?

691
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,399
What must I do to make you mine?

692
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:19,919
Let go!

693
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,599
Min Hui, tell me!

694
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,760
Tell me!

695
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:30,960
Min Hui!

696
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,480
Mr. Cheng!

697
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,080
Help!

698
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:48,919
Min Hui!

699
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What happened? Are you hurt?

700
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,359
Hello?

701
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,359
I'm by the lake. Get over here.

702
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,760
There's something to tend to.

703
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,240
Don't be afraid.

704
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,720
I'll take care of it.

705
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,480
Have some water.

706
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,040
Don't be afraid.

707
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,520
You're home now.

708
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,000
Don't be afraid.

709
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm here for you.

710
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,279
Let it out.

711
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,319
Xin Qi!

712
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,520
Xin Qi!

713
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,239
You're awake.

714
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,920
I think I owe you another shirt now.

715
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,159
You cracked a joke.

716
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,920
Not bad.

717
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,239
The last time I saw you cry so hard

718
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:19,480
was when we broke up five years ago.

719
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,520
Mr. Xin Qi.

720
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,759
That thing five years ago
wasn't a breakup.

721
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,119
You ditched me.

722
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
So...

723
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,560
I've been paying for my foolish action

724
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,639
from five years ago.

725
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,119
You finally smile.

726
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,480
Thank you.

727
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
So...

728
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,960
Could you tell me what happened?

729
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,119
Do you know why I was fired

730
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,639
from Guanchao five years ago?

731
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,440
They claimed that

732
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,840
I accused my superior
of sexual harassment

733
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,360
after failing to seduce him.

734
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,520
That superior was Cheng Qirang.

735
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,119
Five years ago,
I just graduated from college.

736
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,119
I got into Guanchao as I wished.

737
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,440
Cheng Qirang was only

738
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,159
the deputy director of the R&D team.

739
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,759
Min Hui?

740
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,639
Mr. Cheng.

741
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,639
Do you know we went to the same school?

742
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,599
Professor Ding
mentioned a lot about you.

743
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,239
I'm flattered.

744
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
I will be paying attention
to your performance.

745
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
Thank you.

746
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,599
(We went to the same school,)

747
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,890
(and he was friendly.)

748
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,520
Mr. Cheng.

749
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,080
(He was nicer to the newcomers,)

750
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,940
(so I wasn't wary of him.)

751
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,900
Have some coffee.

752
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,840
Thank you for letting me
be part of this project.

753
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,759
It's nothing. Get back to your work.

754
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,440
Thank you.

755
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,520
(Soon after I joined the team,)

756
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,040
(he put me in charge
of the most important project)

757
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,679
(at the time.)

758
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,679
The others went to have lunch.

759
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,040
Why are you still here?

760
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,960
Mr. Cheng.

761
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,679
Look.

762
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,639
It's alright now.
Thank you, Mr. Cheng!

763
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,880
I thought he valued my ability.

764
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,279
Then, one day...

765
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,639
Mr. Cheng, you asked for me?

766
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,520
Yes, come in.

767
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,319
Is there a problem with the programming?

768
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,119
Come in.

769
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
There's nothing wrong with your program.

770
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,480
You did a great job.

771
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,319
I mean it.

772
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,639
You're young.
Don't spend all your time working.

773
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,279
You should relax sometimes.

774
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,000
Look at the time now.

775
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,599
The working hour is over.

776
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,080
Yes.

777
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,560
We can be friends.

778
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,639
Come.

779
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,199
Have a drink with me.

780
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,279
Mr. Cheng, I'm not much of a drinker.

781
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,159
Min Hui, I'm in a really bad mood today.

782
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,799
Can you have a drink with me?

783
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:11,920
Just one drink.

784
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,719
May everything
goes smoothly for your work.

785
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,719
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

786
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,679
Don't you know how to drink?

787
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Mr. Cheng, I have more codes to write.

788
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,239
I must go now.

789
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,119
Min Hui!

790
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,599
Let go of me. I have to go now.

791
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,319
Min Hui.

792
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,159
Mr. Cheng, let go!

793
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,000
Min Hui!

794
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,000
Help!

795
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,480
Min Hui!

796
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,639
Mr. Cheng! Someone!

797
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,319
Help!

798
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:07,679
And then?

799
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,319
I reported

800
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,400
the sexual harassment to HR.

801
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,840
Lin Xiyue said she would
be my witness.

802
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,840
But who would've thought

803
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:20,000
that in the end,

804
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,400
she sided with Cheng Qirang.

805
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Lin Xiyue.

806
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,000
How could you make false statements?

807
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,960
What else should I do?

808
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,239
Should I help you
stand against Mr. Cheng?

809
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,520
The price is too high.

810
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,199
The best we can do now

811
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,840
is to swallow it down,

812
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,920
especially when it's Cheng Qirang.

813
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,560
With Lin Xiyue's statement,

814
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,520
Cheng Qirang

815
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,360
was ruled as the innocent victim.

816
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,400
And me?

817
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,920
I became the vile woman who seduced

818
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,119
her superior for the sake of promotion.

819
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,520
You knew what kind of monster he is.

820
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
That day at the cocktail party...

821
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,000
Cheng Qirang's father,
Professor Cheng

822
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,440
is a mitral valve expert.

823
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,799
Quanquan was in critical condition.

824
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,239
If I did it,

825
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,480
he promised to ask for his father

826
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,279
to return and operate on Quanquan.

827
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,119
So...

828
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,080
When you needed me the most,

829
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,880
not only was I not with you,

830
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,279
I even said those horrible things.

831
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,880
I'm sorry, Min Hui.

832
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,080
I can't make it up to you

833
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,759
for my absence in the past.

834
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,119
But I am back now.

835
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,480
I won't let him hurt you again.

836
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,159
This won't be the end of it.

837
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,119
Xin Qi, listen to me.

838
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,400
Cheng Qirang is a scoundrel

839
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,679
who doesn't deserve your time.

840
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,040
He may seem like a gentleman,

841
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,239
but he can be a vile beast
when he's cornered.

842
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,560
I don't want him to pester you.

843
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,799
Trust me.

844
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,360
Think and do nothing.

845
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,880
