=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 14=

25
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,278
Mr. Xin.

26
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:49,677
You should at least eat
or drink something.

27
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,797
It's your own health.

28
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:53,998
Mr. Xin?

29
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:01,998
I never swim in this pool.

30
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:06,918
This sofa.

31
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,078
I never even sit on it. Change it.

32
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:08,957
I'll have it changed tomorrow.

33
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:09,677
Change this one too.

34
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,158
This one too.

35
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:12,358
Look at this dining table.

36
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,038
Do we even have
that many people eating here?

37
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,358
Why do we need such a big dining table?

38
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,038
Change it!

39
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:17,038
I'll change it tomorrow.

40
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,038
Why do we need such a huge house?

41
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:18,997
What's the point of living alone?

42
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,677
All I see is your face!

43
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,198
What's wrong with my face?

44
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,598
I think I look okay.

45
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,358
What's the point
of venting your anger at me

46
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,038
when she's ignoring you?

47
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,277
Yes, Min Hui?

48
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,277
Hardy, this is Quanquan.

49
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:43,997
It's Quanquan.

50
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,758
Are you with Xin Qi?

51
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,038
I wanted to call Xin Qi.

52
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,797
But Min Hui didn't have Xin Qi's WeChat

53
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,358
on her phone.

54
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,397
Luckily I've memorized
your phone number.

55
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,878
I'm smart, right?

56
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,797
Yes, Quanquan. You're the smartest.

57
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:00,638
Quanquan,

58
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:01,557
listen to me carefully.

59
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,198
I'll tell you my phone number.

60
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,117
So please memorize it, okay?

61
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,557
Okay.

62
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:08,677
Quanquan.

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,837
(Who are you calling?)

64
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,158
(Xin Qi.)

65
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:14,717
Quanquan,

66
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,198
ask your mommy

67
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,797
why she doesn't have my WeChat
on her phone.

68
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:20,797
Min Hui, why isn't Xin Qi's WeChat

69
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:23,038
on your phone?

70
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,397
I blocked him.

71
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,038
Why did she block me?

72
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:29,997
Why did you block Xin Qi?

73
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:31,957
He knows why.

74
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,997
She said you know why.

75
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:37,318
Okay.

76
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,198
Your godmother said
your mommy is not well.

77
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,078
Is she feeling better now?

78
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,758
Min Hui, are you sick?

79
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,797
I'm fine now.

80
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:49,358
She's okay now.

81
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,117
Xin Qi, how much longer
do you have to travel?

82
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:53,918
When will you come home?

83
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:55,797
(I'll be busy for a while.)

84
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,557
(It will be a while
before I can go home.)

85
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,318
(Listen to Mommy)

86
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,638
(and don't mess around, okay?)

87
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,670
When I come back,
I'll take you out to have fun.

88
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:03,478
Okay?

89
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,438
Okay, you better keep your promise.

90
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:10,918
You...

91
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,918
Xin Qi said
he'll take me out to have fun!

92
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,118
Sit down.

93
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:31,678
I went through
the quarter's financial report today.

94
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:35,758
Dad,

95
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:37,037
let me explain.

96
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,717
I did screw up on the investment

97
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:42,198
by the Blue Jay Group.

98
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:45,438
Be Agile intercepted the deal
at the last minute.

99
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:46,758
But don't worry.

100
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:49,037
I've invited Professor Dong

101
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,998
from the Medical College

102
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:51,758
to endorse our cancer screening plan.

103
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,037
And Professor Dong

104
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:55,558
is a famous cancer specialist in China.

105
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,678
So with his support,

106
00:04:57,758 --> 00:04:59,837
I believe we can get funding soon.

107
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,717
Guanchao is my life's work.

108
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,198
It'll eventually

109
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,397
be handed over to you and Yiting.

110
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:11,717
Don't let me down.

111
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:14,878
I won't, Dad.

112
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:16,717
Dad,

113
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,597
can you stop talking

114
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,878
about work over mealtime?

115
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:22,837
If you didn't find

116
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,438
a capable husband, like Qirang,

117
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:26,998
do you think I can rely on you?

118
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,917
Dad, you mustn't say that.

119
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,357
I can't live a single second

120
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,517
without Yiting now.

121
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:32,198
Thank you.

122
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:35,118
Yeah, exactly.

123
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,957
Qirang alone is enough for Guanchao.

124
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:39,238
Are you not happy
that I can accompany you and Mom?

125
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,277
Of course,

126
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:42,357
I'm happy.

127
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:43,917
Let's eat.

128
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:45,758
Cheers

129
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,078
to your health.

130
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:49,638
Thank you.

131
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,318
Cheers.

132
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:55,037
(Listen to your mom. Eat well)

133
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,318
(and take your medicine on time, okay?)

134
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,678
My phone's battery is almost dead.

135
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:01,198
See you, Daddy.

136
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,238
Did you fight with Xin Qi again?

137
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,318
No.

138
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,678
Adults are so complicated.

139
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,717
They pretend to be happy
when they're not.

140
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,597
They even deny it
when they're in a fight.

141
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:17,438
Yet, they always teach kids like us

142
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,157
to be honest.

143
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:24,397
Quanquan.

144
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,558
Come here for a bit.

145
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:29,477
Well, here's the thing.

146
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,438
Xin Qi and I

147
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,638
couldn't agree

148
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:34,517
on something

149
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,198
very important.

150
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:37,878
So

151
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,318
he'll move back to his own place
for a while.

152
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,998
But it won't change the fact

153
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:43,597
that he's your dad.

154
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:46,277
Can I still see him in the future?

155
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,717
Of course, you can still see him.

156
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,157
You can meet him.

157
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:51,357
Didn't you ask him

158
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:52,318
to take you out to play today?

159
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,758
Can we go camping?

160
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:56,198
Many kids in my class went camping

161
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,597
with their parents.

162
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:00,078
I want Daddy and Mommy
to take me camping too.

163
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,438
No problem.

164
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:04,357
I promise you.

165
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,998
Camping! Camping!

166
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:12,397
Daddy and Mommy
are taking me to go camping!

167
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:20,277
I'm so happy and excited!

168
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,477
You don't have to send me off.

169
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:23,998
Dad, make sure to stay safe.

170
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:24,917
Okay.

171
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,318
Sleep early
and don't work late into the night.

172
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,118
Okay.

173
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:27,917
See you guys around.

174
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:28,717
Good night.

175
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,318
Dear.

176
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:35,318
Come back. Dear.

177
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:35,957
Dear,

178
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,157
thank you for what you did today.

179
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:40,638
If you weren't here,

180
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:42,397
I don't know how to handle your dad.

181
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:45,957
If you know it's not easy
to handle my dad,

182
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:48,438
you should focus
your attention on Guanchao.

183
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:50,558
If you want Dad to hand over
the company to you without worries,

184
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:51,597
you need to prove to him

185
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,157
that you're truly capable.

186
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:54,477
I understand.

187
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:55,357
Don't worry.

188
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,118
I'll certainly prove myself after this.

189
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,157
Then I'll head back to the company.

190
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,238
You should get some rest early.

191
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:01,758
Okay?

192
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:02,397
Go ahead.

193
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,798
He said he'll hand over Guanchao to me.

194
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:17,957
But look what happened?

195
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:22,357
All the shares are still in the hands

196
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:23,917
of that old man and Zheng Yiting.

197
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:26,638
If it weren't
for the old man's failing health,

198
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:28,957
would he let me be the CEO?

199
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:31,477
No way.

200
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,518
But one day,

201
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:37,918
Guanchao will belong

202
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:39,038
to Cheng.

203
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,278
I have faith in you.

204
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:42,558
I really do.

205
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:44,918
Besides, I'll do my best to help you.

206
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:48,798
By the way,

207
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:51,798
I heard there's an intelligence summit
in Shanghai next week.

208
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,078
And Guanchao has a special session.

209
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:54,398
What do you think about us...

210
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:55,477
You're not suitable.

211
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:56,757
You're not suitable.

212
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:58,637
Why?

213
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,117
I spent hundreds of thousands of yuan

214
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,357
to get this session.

215
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,038
I want Guanchao's
cancer screening technology

216
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:09,438
to be the focus of the entire summit.

217
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:12,117
I've already handed it over to Mr. Qiu.

218
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,278
I'm also the head of the R&D department.

219
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,078
Why can he represent Guanchao
to attend the summit

220
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:16,717
but I can't?

221
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:17,477
Besides,

222
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,877
I heard that Min Hui from Be Agile

223
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:20,357
will also be there.

224
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,798
I want to take this opportunity
to kill her limelight.

225
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:27,597
Don't you remember

226
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,518
how you became
the head of this department?

227
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,278
Am I really that incompetent to you?

228
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:35,278
Fine.

229
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,798
Go and find Min Hui.

230
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,518
Look at you pulling a tantrum again.

231
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:54,558
Min Hui.

232
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,660
(Be Agile Medical Technology)

233
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,837
High-Tech Summit?

234
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,470
(Invitation)
Yes, I just received the invitation.

235
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,558
(Invitation)
The organizing committee

236
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,438
(Invitation)
is very interested in your research

237
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:20,318
(Invitation)
on AI cardiac modeling software.

238
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,837
They want to invite you
to give a speech.

239
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,798
That's great!

240
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,957
This is a perfect opportunity

241
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:26,957
to showcase my AI technology

242
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,877
and meet

243
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,357
some like-minded partners.

244
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,038
I can also strengthen my research team

245
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,278
and attract better investment.

246
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:37,757
Will Xin Qi be unhappy
if he hears that?

247
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:39,678
I don't care if he's happy or not.

248
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,398
How long is the summit?

249
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:43,518
Probably around a week.

250
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,558
I'll go with you

251
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,717
as a representative of Be Agile.

252
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,877
Will He Haixiang give up
this opportunity to shine

253
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:50,678
and let you take the spotlight?

254
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:52,438
Compared to taking the spotlight,

255
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:54,318
he'd probably rather not
travel with you.

256
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:55,957
You have a point.

257
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,158
Wait a minute.

258
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,877
If both of us go,

259
00:10:58,877 --> 00:10:59,597
who'll take care

260
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:00,278
of Quanquan?

261
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:01,438
Let Xin Qi take care of him.

262
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,318
Absolutely not!

263
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:03,597
Why?

264
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,357
No means no.

265
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:09,237
What's going on?

266
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,518
He's trying to take back Min Quanquan?

267
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,558
He's delusional.

268
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,798
It's true

269
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:17,678
that good-looking guys
are never good people.

270
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,637
The more handsome, the worse they are.

271
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:19,798
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

272
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,158
He didn't even ask if you,
the godmother, agreed or not.

273
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,918
That's right. I don't agree either.

274
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,637
Take Quanquan with you.

275
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:26,558
Consider it a holiday.

276
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:27,357
Don't worry.

277
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:29,518
Can't two of us handle only one child?

278
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,158
The conference schedule
isn't that tight either.

279
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:32,678
Trust me.

280
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:33,997
You're right.

281
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,318
Quanquan will definitely be happy.

282
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:37,477
Yes.

283
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:38,717
Here you are.

284
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:39,837
Mr. He.

285
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,318
Ms. Min, I was on my way to see you.

286
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:43,918
Here's the thing.

287
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,757
Let Mr. Ding

288
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:46,997
go to the High-Tech Summit

289
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,198
in your place.

290
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:49,637
Why?

291
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,110
(Female Director
of Be Agile Seduces CEO)

292
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,357
Well, I think

293
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:03,477
it's enough to lose face
in Bincheng alone.

294
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:06,117
Be Agile will be too embarrassed

295
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,477
if the news travels all the way
to the High-Tech Summit.

296
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:10,597
Min Hui is going
to the High-Tech summit,

297
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,117
not some gossip reporters' gathering.

298
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:14,438
Mr. Ding, you're going?

299
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,398
Then are you familiar
with the AI cardiac modeling software?

300
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,398
The people in the audience
are all professionals.

301
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,038
You might embarrass Be Agile if you go.

302
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:23,398
It's just a PowerPoint presentation.

303
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,357
One just needs to be able to read
and can give the talk.

304
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,078
What do you mean by that?

305
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,637
Are you planning
to have me write the speech

306
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,678
and then have Ding Yifeng deliver it?

307
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:35,158
My name is on the invitation.

308
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,518
Even if you don't want me to go,

309
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:37,757
you can't let Ding Yifeng go.

310
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:39,117
Worst case scenario, just don't go.

311
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,158
It's just one missed opportunity

312
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,357
for Be Agile to showcase its strength

313
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,837
to the capital and the industry.

314
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:47,798
If HQ finds out,

315
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:48,997
it might not be good, right?

316
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:49,637
Mr. He,

317
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:50,398
what do you think?

318
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,518
No, Ms. Cao.

319
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:56,558
It's all right.

320
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,717
Since Ms. Min thinks it's not a problem,

321
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:00,597
it means I'm overthinking it.

322
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:01,558
Mr. He...

323
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,518
Who's the one messing around?

324
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,400
(Female Director
of Be Agile Seduces CEO)

325
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,877
This is clearly setting you up

326
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,357
so you'd be criticized
during the summit.

327
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:20,798
No matter who uploaded it,

328
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:22,717
I won't let them succeed.

329
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,540
(Female Director
of Be Agile Seduces CEO)

330
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,060
(His wife is just next to him.)

331
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:42,198
Well...

332
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,117
I want you to investigate

333
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:44,398
who uploaded these.

334
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:46,318
Okay.

335
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,078
Mr. Yan is here.

336
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:49,158
Do you want to reconsider?

337
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,318
There's nothing to reconsider.

338
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,237
Tell him to come in.

339
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,678
Okay.

340
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,398
We're here.

341
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:18,117
He looks handsome even when he sleeps.

342
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,278
How nice it would be

343
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,198
if I could see him every day.

344
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,198
What's wrong?

345
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,078
Nothing.

346
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:40,798
We're already here.

347
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:41,477
Let's go.

348
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:01,678
Then

349
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,357
I'll get going.

350
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,477
Okay.

351
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:12,198
Then...

352
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,837
Be careful on your way back.

353
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:19,318
Okay.

354
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:23,597
Chen Jiajun!

355
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:27,918
Don't leave today.

356
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:28,597
Don't leave tomorrow either.

357
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:29,398
Never leave again.

358
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,198
Do you dare to stay?

359
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:33,237
Okay.

360
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:55,997
What are you doing?

361
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:58,637
You scared me.

362
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,237
Aren't you going to Shanghai
in a couple of days

363
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,398
to attend the High-Tech Summit?

364
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:03,877
I'm packing your luggage for you.

365
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:05,117
There's no need to rush.

366
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:06,477
There are still a few days left.

367
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,798
Has Mr. Yan sent the documents
that I asked him to draft?

368
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,038
Yes, he has sent it over.

369
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,237
Just waiting for you to sign it.

370
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,237
I won't go to the office today.

371
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,038
I need to take care of something.

372
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:18,997
Okay.

373
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,798
Then I'll unpack your luggage.

374
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:26,078
Mr. Xin, good morning.

375
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:26,798
Morning.

376
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,477
Are you here to see Ms. Min?

377
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:30,477
Where's she?

378
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,957
She went to Shanghai
to attend the High-Tech Summit.

379
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,877
But isn't the summit still
a few days away?

380
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,597
Ms. Min took two days off in advance

381
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,158
to take her child to Shanghai

382
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,997
for a little vacation.

383
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,918
She's probably on the way
to the airport by now.

384
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:45,717
Mr. Xin, do you have something urgent
to discuss?

385
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:46,837
Should I give her a call?

386
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:47,678
No need.

387
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:48,997
Let her enjoy her vacation.

388
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:49,957
My matter can wait.

389
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:51,318
But

390
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,278
he looked like he was
in a hurry just now.

391
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,080
(Be Agile Medical Technology)
Hello, book a ticket to Shanghai for me.

392
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:57,877
(Be Agile Medical Technology)
The sooner, the better.

393
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,597
Help me pack my luggage.

394
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:00,278
Sure.

395
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:04,397
Didn't you just say
I didn't need to pack?

396
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,558
Quanquan, what did you put in here
that it's so heavy?

397
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:14,478
Okay, come sit down.

398
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:17,278
Let me fasten your seat belt.

399
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,038
Okay.

400
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:22,518
Hello.

401
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,758
I'm the flight attendant
in charge of this flight.

402
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,677
We noticed in your passenger information

403
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:29,078
that your son had heart surgery before,
is that correct?

404
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:29,758
Yes.

405
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,718
But I didn't fill out any information.

406
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:32,677
I'm sorry.

407
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,998
I'm not too sure about that.

408
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,437
But I received an instruction
from our ground staff

409
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,238
that the captain has decided
to upgrade your seats.

410
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,318
Why don't you and your son follow me?

411
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:43,197
What does it mean to upgrade seats?

412
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,677
Upgrading means

413
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,718
we'll offer you a bigger, wider,
and more comfortable seat.

414
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,718
Do you want to go?

415
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:51,478
Yes. Min Hui, let's go and take a look.

416
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,078
If I don't like it,
we won't go.

417
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,558
If you don't like it,
then we won't go, okay?

418
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,197
Then we'll go and take a look.

419
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:57,998
Okay.

420
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,278
Thank you.
Also, please thank the captain for us.

421
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:01,597
No problem.

422
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,718
Please take a seat.

423
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:06,558
Min Hui, look how big
and comfortable it is here.

424
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:07,917
We'll stay here.

425
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:09,877
Thank you for everything.

426
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:10,798
Don't mention it.

427
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:16,558
Thank you so much.

428
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,318
It's okay.

429
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,637
Let us know

430
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:19,597
if you need anything.

431
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:20,160
Okay.

432
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,080
(Attention all passengers.)

433
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,400
(Flight K1825)

434
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,590
(from Bincheng to Shanghai is...)

435
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:33,357
Let's go.

436
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:39,998
It's so beautiful here.

437
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:42,078
Yes, it's pretty.

438
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:42,837
Welcome.

439
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:43,758
Hello.

440
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,917
We're here
to attend the High-Tech Summit

441
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,518
and the organizing committee
has booked our room.

442
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,117
Please wait for a moment.

443
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:52,597
Sir.

444
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:55,758
Please wait for a moment.

445
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,837
Hello, Ms. Min.

446
00:18:58,998 --> 00:18:59,877
Congratulations.

447
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,397
You're the 2,888th guest

448
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:03,238
of our hotel this year.

449
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:04,677
According to our hotel tradition,

450
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,238
we'll automatically upgrade your room

451
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:07,958
to a larger suite.

452
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:12,397
Thank you, but we don't need it.

453
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:13,837
Our original room is just fine.

454
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,318
Please don't get me wrong.

455
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:16,837
This is not a disguised marketing ploy.

456
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,478
It really is our hotel's tradition.

457
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:19,397
How about this?

458
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:21,478
Let me take you to see the room first.

459
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:22,718
Hey, kid.

460
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,038
Would you like to see the room?

461
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,597
Thank you, mister.

462
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:28,478
Mommy, let's go see it.

463
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:29,197
Quanquan.

464
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,998
Sorry about that.
Please take us to the room.

465
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:32,677
Okay.

466
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:34,837
Ms. Min, this way, please.

467
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:35,837
Please come in.

468
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:42,958
It's so beautiful here.

469
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:48,917
Captain America.

470
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:51,357
Sir,

471
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:52,718
we didn't have much time to prepare.

472
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:53,958
This is the best we could do.

473
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:54,998
Okay.

474
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:58,078
Who told you to set this up?

475
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:00,278
No one.

476
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:01,837
What he was trying to say

477
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,837
was that we couldn't determine

478
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,437
who the 2,888th guest

479
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,478
would be.

480
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:07,038
So

481
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,278
we decorated it for a family of three.

482
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:10,917
I'm sorry.

483
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,478
We cannot stay in this room.

484
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,278
Please book
the room we originally had.

485
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,157
If you're concerned
about hidden charges,

486
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:18,038
we can sign a contract with you.

487
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,397
That's not what I meant.

488
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,558
I just don't feel comfortable
accepting things

489
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:23,078
that I don't deserve.

490
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:26,078
Please book
the room we originally had.

491
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:26,637
Thank you.

492
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:27,917
Quanquan,

493
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:28,917
come here.

494
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:30,518
We're not staying here.

495
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:31,157
Let's go.

496
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,478
Mommy, we're not staying here?

497
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:36,958
Give this to me.

498
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,197
Listen to me.

499
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:41,078
Next time,

500
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,238
I'll let you stay here
with my own money.

501
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:43,877
Okay?

502
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,998
That's a good boy.

503
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:48,117
Thank you.

504
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,117
(Hello?)

505
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,397
Godmother, we've arrived in Shanghai.

506
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,677
I figured you would've arrived
by now too.

507
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:03,758
How was it, Quanquan?

508
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:04,758
Did you have fun on the plane?

509
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:05,637
Yeah, it was fun.

510
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:07,197
The pretty flight attendant even gave me

511
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,157
some chocolate to eat.

512
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,877
But Mommy wouldn't let me stay

513
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:13,478
in the Iron Man and Spider-Man room.

514
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:14,478
What room?

515
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:15,558
What do you mean?

516
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:17,958
(Go wash your hands quickly.)

517
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,357
(Later, I will take you out to eat.)

518
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:20,877
(See you later, godmother.)

519
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,877
(Bye-bye.)

520
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:23,357
(Listen to your mommy, okay?)

521
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:24,837
(I'll be there in a couple of days.)

522
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,437
Okay, go on now.

523
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:29,238
Quanquan, wash your hands carefully.

524
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:30,397
Okay.

525
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:34,597
Cao Mu,

526
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:35,998
did you tell Xin Qi

527
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:37,117
that I was coming to Shanghai?

528
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,718
What? I didn't say anything.

529
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,837
Cai Wenji said he was looking
for you this morning.

530
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,478
It must have been her. What's wrong?

531
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,637
No way.

532
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,600
Did he follow you there
so he could pursue you?

533
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,798
He's really going
to the end of the earth like this.

534
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:53,397
Stop talking nonsense.

535
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,478
He's not here.

536
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,278
But his hand is pretty long.

537
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:58,318
What do you mean?

538
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,038
I knew it.

539
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:01,318
All my life,

540
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:03,318
I never won any prizes ever.

541
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:06,157
Firstly, he upgraded my seats.

542
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,357
When I arrived at the hotel,

543
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:09,798
they were saying
about upgrading our room to a suite.

544
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,397
I could easily guess
he's the one behind this.

545
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:14,597
It's that romantic?

546
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:15,958
How is this romantic?

547
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:19,437
He just wants to win Quanquan
over with these sweet tricks.

548
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,677
I won't give him that chance.

549
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,798
Yeah, I'm not going
to give him that chance.

550
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:25,958
You're right.
We cannot give him the chance.

551
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,597
Besides, do we lack money?

552
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:28,478
It'll be on me next time.

553
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,318
Ms. Cao, you sure are generous.

554
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:32,078
Remember what you said today.

555
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:33,677
(Next time, I'll let you take me)

556
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:34,758
(to stay somewhere nicer.)

557
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:36,637
By the way, Cao Mu.

558
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:38,117
How's the preparation

559
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,038
for the brand promotion?

560
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:40,197
The deadline is too tight.

561
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:41,677
I'm definitely going to
work overnight these next few days.

562
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:42,958
That's all. I won't talk to you anymore.

563
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,798
I'll get back to work.

564
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,637
Okay, go ahead.

565
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,437
Ms. Min refused to stay in this room,

566
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:55,877
and we can't force her.

567
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,238
Sorry about that, Mr. Xin.

568
00:22:58,038 --> 00:22:58,677
It's okay.

569
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:00,078
Just clear everything.

570
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:01,117
Okay.

571
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,157
Let's clean up the place.

572
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,758
I knew it won't be easy to trick her.

573
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:19,197
Come on, Quanquan.

574
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,197
I'm taking you to the Bund, okay?

575
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:22,758
I want to go camping.

576
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:23,437
We're not going camping.

577
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,558
Why don't we go to the Bund instead?

578
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,720
- No, I want to go camping.
- Xin Qi.

579
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:29,798
Surprise!

580
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:34,238
Do you miss me?

581
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:41,478
She kissed Daddy!

582
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:42,278
Quanquan,

583
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:43,038
let's get out of here.

584
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:43,478
Come on.

585
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:45,758
Why did you kiss me?

586
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:46,478
Min Hui!

587
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:50,278
Don't get it wrong.

588
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:51,677
Mr. Xin,

589
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:52,917
what a coincidence.

590
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,157
You can continue where you left off.

591
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:55,278
Don't get it wrong, Min Hui.

592
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:55,917
Let me go.

593
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,078
So you're Min Hui.

594
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,157
Then you must be Quanquan.

595
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:03,278
Who are you?

596
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:04,837
Why did you kiss my daddy?

597
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,597
Even Mommy hasn't kissed him yet.

598
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:08,197
Quanquan...

599
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:13,238
Xin Qi,

600
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:14,558
tell them

601
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,958
Who I am.

602
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:18,397
Let me introduce you

603
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:19,958
to Cindy,

604
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,197
my older sister.

605
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:22,718
Older sister?

606
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:23,798
Yes.

607
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:25,718
The Chairwoman of RG

608
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:26,998
and also

609
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,357
my boss.

610
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:30,238
Hi.

611
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,958
You're even cuter in person
than in your photos.

612
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:44,958
I've fallen in love with you
at first sight.

613
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,278
That's not how you use the phrase.

614
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:51,917
Where did you get my photo?

615
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:54,238
Xin Qi sent it to me, of course.

616
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:56,078
I thought you've returned to Beijing.

617
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:58,117
I was supposed to

618
00:24:58,318 --> 00:24:59,837
but I was delayed by some things.

619
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:01,197
Hardy also said

620
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:03,397
you'll be attending
the High-Tech Summit.

621
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:04,958
So I decided to postpone my stay here.

622
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,478
Or else I wouldn't be able

623
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,238
to meet my adorable nephew

624
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:09,117
and...

625
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:11,478
You can call me Min Hui.

626
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,278
Okay.

627
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,278
Min Hui,

628
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,758
you're also more beautiful in person
than in photos.

629
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:17,117
You have all five flavors.
[*Well-rounded characters]

630
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,318
That's not how you use that phrase.

631
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:22,958
Where did you learn
all these weird idioms?

632
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,478
I just started learning.

633
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,677
I think it's cool to speak

634
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,998
in four-word phrases.

635
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:30,798
Did he send you my photos too?

636
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,877
I sent photos of you
and Quanquan together.

637
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,437
I couldn't cut you out.

638
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:35,917
No, no, no.

639
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,038
You sent me a family photo

640
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,478
of the three of you.

641
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:46,318
Ignore him.

642
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:47,917
He's always been like this.

643
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:49,478
He speaks...

644
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:51,917
He speaks without thinking.

645
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:53,958
That's right.

646
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:57,078
You're very good
at the Chinese language.

647
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,597
It looks like you're not only cute
but also smart.

648
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:00,518
Love you.

649
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:05,558
He's too cute.

650
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,357
I booked a restaurant for tonight.

651
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,397
Let's have dinner together.

652
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:10,478
- I'm busy.
- I'm busy.

653
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:15,238
You two pretty much clicked.

654
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:16,877
Cindy,

655
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,597
I have a meeting tonight.

656
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:21,078
So I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

657
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,157
I'm going...

658
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,597
It doesn't matter what you want to do.

659
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,117
Min Hui, I rarely come back from abroad.

660
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:29,877
I even extended my stay on purpose

661
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:33,197
so I could see you and Quanquan.

662
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:36,917
All right, then.

663
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,558
That's great.

664
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,078
It's decided then.

665
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:42,038
What do you want to eat?

666
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,340
(Guanchao)

667
00:26:58,998 --> 00:26:59,877
Dear,

668
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:01,518
what brings you here?

669
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:04,558
What is this about?

670
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,900
(Female Director
of Be Agile Seduces CEO)

671
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,637
Dear, you were there that day.

672
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,117
You know this has nothing to do with me.

673
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,238
That woman drank too much...

674
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:18,917
I was having afternoon tea
with friends today,

675
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:22,238
and this became the talk
of the whole place.

676
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:24,718
Everyone was asking me about it.

677
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:26,677
Even my mom called from out of town

678
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:30,758
asking what kind of relationship

679
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,078
you have with Min Hui.

680
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,637
This is already in the past.

681
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:36,437
Why would someone want
to bring up the past?

682
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:36,877
It has to be...

683
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:38,437
Who would be interested in this matter?

684
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,837
It's either interested in Min Hui

685
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:43,518
or...

686
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:46,117
Cheng Qirang,

687
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,597
I don't care what you do out there.

688
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,558
But don't embarrass me

689
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,998
and make me clean up your mess.

690
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,117
Keep an eye on
the people you need to take care of.

691
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:57,958
If this kind of thing reaches

692
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,437
my father's ears,

693
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:01,677
don't blame me for not helping you.

694
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:05,318
Dear. Dear!

695
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:12,478
I think that's it.

696
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:13,397
Let's leave it at that.

697
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:14,197
Okay.

698
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:15,998
Oh, by the way.

699
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:18,958
Give me four pails of soda water.

700
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:20,998
Four pails?

701
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:22,397
She meant four bottles.

702
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,798
All right, just a moment.

703
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:25,238
Now, where was I?

704
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:27,677
When Xin Qi first came
to our house as a child,

705
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:30,078
he didn't dare to sleep alone at night.

706
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:31,117
He had

707
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:33,238
to hold a small teddy bear every night.

708
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,877
I even gave him a nickname,

709
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,278
"Koala".

710
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:37,998
Do you remember that?

711
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:40,758
It's really hard to imagine him

712
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:41,998
being like that now.

713
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:43,917
You have no idea.

714
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:44,917
Okay, that's enough.

715
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:45,437
Are you done?

716
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:46,397
You've been talking

717
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:47,518
without stopping.

718
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,197
I'll tell you more slowly in the future.

719
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:54,798
Quanquan.

720
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,917
It's our first meeting.

721
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:58,637
So I prepared a gift for you.

722
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,877
What is it?

723
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:01,318
Take a look.

724
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:03,078
Thank you.

725
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:08,117
It's a phone watch.

726
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:09,877
This watch is awesome.

727
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,038
Do you like it?

728
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:16,357
If you like it, call me Aunt.

729
00:29:16,518 --> 00:29:17,718
Aunt!

730
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,877
That feels amazing.

731
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,278
You're so adorable.

732
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,038
You're so sweet.

733
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:26,958
You have such a good temper.

734
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,357
You're so easy to get along with.

735
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,278
You're not like Xin Qi at all.

736
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:32,837
Cheers.

737
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,877
It must be hard taking care
of Quanquan alone.

738
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:51,078
Xin Qi also asked me the same question.

739
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:52,877
I showed Quanquan's medical record

740
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:55,397
to a heart specialist abroad.

741
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,437
He said the surgery was perfect.

742
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:59,278
So you don't have to worry anymore.

743
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:01,478
Did Xin Qi show you the record?

744
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,478
Yes, he did.

745
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:04,637
Actually, he has been worried
about Quanquan.

746
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:05,958
As you know,

747
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,397
Xin Qi's heart condition only started

748
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:09,518
to improve slowly

749
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,278
after his surgery five years ago.

750
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,117
Over the past twenty years,

751
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:15,318
he almost died several times.

752
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,998
So I understand

753
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:20,437
the difficulties of taking care
of a child with a heart condition.

754
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,518
You have a successful career too.

755
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:23,837
If it were me,

756
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:24,998
I wouldn't be able to juggle both.

757
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:27,038
Did Xin Qi tell you all this too?

758
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:28,998
No, he didn't.

759
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,357
I did a little digging myself.

760
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,478
There's a saying,

761
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:34,078
"Know thyself, know thy..."

762
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:37,837
What was it again?

763
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:38,837
"He who knows himself and his enemy
shall never be defeated."

764
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:40,917
Yeah, that's right.

765
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:43,238
I just wanted to understand you
and Quanquan better.

766
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:44,238
So you wouldn't have

767
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:45,558
to struggle so much in the future.

768
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:46,558
We can take care of Quanquan...

769
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:47,357
No need.

770
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:50,157
My son is my responsibility.

771
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,197
I don't need you.

772
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,597
Quanquan, come with me.

773
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,478
I haven't had a bite yet.

774
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:00,798
Let's not eat here, okay?

775
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:02,117
I'll take you to eat something else.

776
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:02,677
Come on.

777
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:03,478
What's the matter?

778
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:06,197
I think I should be asking you, Xin Qi.

779
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,478
First, it was a cabin upgrade,
then a room upgrade.

780
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:10,397
Now you suddenly have a sister.

781
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,078
Aren't you going too far in your efforts

782
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,798
to fight for Quanquan's custody?

783
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:15,758
No, I didn't mean it that way.

784
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:16,958
Then what did you mean?

785
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,758
I'm warning you one last time.

786
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,637
I won't let anyone

787
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:22,197
take Quanquan away from me.

788
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:23,637
Don't even bother trying.

789
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:25,357
Let's go.

790
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:30,078
What's wrong with her?

791
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,877
What did you say to her?

792
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,357
I didn't say anything, I think.

793
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,917
I just talked

794
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,518
about how knowing oneself
and others can help.

795
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:48,597
Then I said
we can take care of Quanquan.

796
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:50,518
But then she got upset

797
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,837
and said she can take care
of Quanquan herself

798
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:53,837
without our help.

799
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:55,038
Miss Cindy,

800
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:56,078
do you know

801
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:58,478
what "know yourself and your enemy,
and you will not be defeated" means?

802
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:02,117
Isn't it about understanding
oneself and others

803
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:04,478
so we're able to help others?

804
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:07,998
I think you meant to say empathy, right?

805
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:09,998
Actually, "know yourself and your enemy"

806
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:11,758
means the opposite.

807
00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:12,998
Is that so?

808
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:14,518
It's about understanding oneself

809
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,117
and the enemy to win battles.

810
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,157
Min Hui already saw me
as the enemy.

811
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:18,958
Look at what you did.

812
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:21,197
She's definitely going
to think I'm up to no good.

813
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,798
Stop misusing the idioms.

814
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:26,917
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

815
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,518
Oh, you didn't mean it?

816
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,078
What about trying to take her son away?

817
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:31,078
Was that done not on purpose?

818
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,758
I have to explain this to you.

819
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:34,397
This was what Hardy told me.

820
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,238
He said

821
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:36,718
you have a son.

822
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:39,197
But the child's mother
didn't allow you to meet your son.

823
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:41,278
So I planned to file a lawsuit.

824
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,718
Jeez, Hardy and his miscommunication.

825
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,078
Later, you explained everything to me.

826
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:49,478
So I got a clear picture.

827
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:50,677
Yes,

828
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,238
Min Hui worked so hard
to raise Quanquan.

829
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,998
We shouldn't take him away.

830
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:57,197
It wasn't us.

831
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:58,437
It has nothing to do with you.

832
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,798
What do you mean it's not related to me?

833
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,117
Didn't you hear Quanquan

834
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:04,318
calling me Aunt just now?

835
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:09,558
I really love the sound of it.

836
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:14,078
Jason,

837
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,038
why

838
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,758
don't you two get married?

839
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:21,038
Once you're married,
you can raise Quanquan together.

840
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:22,357
Problem solved.

841
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:24,677
Get married?

842
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,278
Did I say anything wrong?

843
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:30,038
I can see you like Min Hui.

844
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:31,518
Then you should get married.

845
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:32,998
It's killing two birds with one stone.

846
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:34,758
You mean, achieve two goals
with one strike.

847
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:35,837
Wait.

848
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:38,038
When did I say I like her?

849
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:43,558
Don't tell me you don't even know

850
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:44,998
that you like her.

851
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:48,397
Can't you tell
from the way you look at her

852
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:49,837
and how nervous you were

853
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:52,078
while explaining that I'm your sister?

854
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:55,677
Even a three-year-old
can see that you like her.

855
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:58,718
You should check your eyes.

856
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,318
You can lie to anyone

857
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,677
but don't lie to yourself. OK?

858
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:04,117
What do you call this again?

859
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:05,917
That's called self-deception.

860
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,998
I got it right?

861
00:34:09,277 --> 00:34:09,958
Yes,

862
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:12,358
I'm improving.

863
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,637
Min Hui.

864
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:23,277
Min Hui!

865
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:24,878
What's wrong?

866
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:26,237
Did I burn your scalp?

867
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,038
If you keep blowing like that,

868
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:30,078
my hair is going to catch fire.

869
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:31,998
Are you in a bad mood?

870
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,637
No, I'm not.

871
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,438
I'm happy
that I'm on vacation with you.

872
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:41,878
Every time you fake a smile,
you look so ugly.

873
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:44,717
How could you say that about me?

874
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:47,637
So you admit you were faking your smile.

875
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,157
Min Quanquan, you're growing up

876
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:51,797
to be quite mischievous,

877
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,717
aren't you?

878
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,717
Did Xin Qi bully you again?

879
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,838
Tell me if he bullies you again,

880
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:00,478
and I'll take care of him for you.

881
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:02,998
It seems like

882
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,590
you love me more
than you love him, right?

883
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,878
Of course.

884
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:08,838
But if he asked you

885
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,518
to live with him,

886
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,880
you wouldn't agree, right?

887
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:12,838
I would.

888
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:13,918
You would?

889
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:16,197
As long as you are there too.

890
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,438
And if it's just you and him,
without me,

891
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,237
would you still want to?

892
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,438
Of course not.

893
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:24,277
Of course, I won't agree.

894
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:25,998
I'm glad to hear that.

895
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,317
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

896
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,478
Why are you asking me these questions?

897
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,358
You're not going to give me
to Xin Qi, are you?

898
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,558
Min Hui,

899
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:35,398
I know raising me is tiring for you.

900
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:37,237
But soon,

901
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,637
I'll grow up and be able
to take care of you.

902
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,918
Don't give me to Xin Qi.

903
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,878
Even though Xin Qi is great,

904
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,078
I still love you the most.

905
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:52,078
Quanquan,

906
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,117
you're so adorable.

907
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,998
How could I bear
to give you away to someone else,

908
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:55,637
right?

909
00:35:58,597 --> 00:35:59,878
Then I don't have to worry anymore.

910
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:02,038
Go take a shower now. You stink.

911
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,078
Excuse me for a moment.

912
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:23,237
Hi, handsome.

913
00:36:23,677 --> 00:36:24,717
Are you alone?

914
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,277
Do you want to have a drink with me?

915
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,398
How about adding my WeChat?

916
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,438
My son.

917
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:34,918
My son's mother.

918
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,637
It's a pity.

919
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,038
(Xin Qi,)

920
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,317
(you can lie to anyone.)

921
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:49,358
(But don't lie to yourself.)

922
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:52,637
(You've slept together.)

923
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:55,558
(Does that mean
you won't be separated forever?)

924
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,358
(Don't tell me)

925
00:36:57,358 --> 00:36:58,998
(you don't even know)

926
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:00,503
(that you like her.)

927
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:03,157
(Can't you tell
from the way you look at her)

928
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,197
(and how nervous you were)

929
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:07,197
(while explaining that I'm your sister?)

930
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:10,197
(Even a kid knows you like her.)

931
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,597
(I wanted to thank you)

932
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:17,078
(for not making me regret
reuniting you and my son.)

933
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,197
(You're really cruel.
Do you know that?)

934
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,237
I can accept you hating me

935
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:23,438
and venting

936
00:37:23,438 --> 00:37:24,597
all your anger at me.

937
00:37:24,597 --> 00:37:25,958
I can take it all.

938
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,597
But not Quanquan.

939
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:31,157
No one can take him away from me,

you won't see Quanquan anymore.)
