=The Love You Give Me=
(Adapted from Shi Dingrou's novel of the same name)

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,980
=Episode 17=

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,140
(My beloved sister, Su Tian)

26
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,671
Su Tian?

27
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,272
Yes.

28
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,511
I'm Su Tian's younger brother.

29
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,472
At the age of two,

30
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,552
we lost our parents to an accident.

31
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:10,192
My sister and I
were sent to an orphanage.

32
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:12,791
Then, I was adopted
by my foster parents.

33
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,192
Since then,

34
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:15,791
I've never seen her again.

35
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:17,711
But she told me

36
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,872
that she would come to see me
when she grew up.

37
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,632
For these years,
I've gone to many places

38
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,312
(asking around.)

39
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,872
(I plastered missing person notices
on the street,)

40
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,592
(asked around in several local chat groups,)

41
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,472
(and went to the police station
many times.)

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,111
Finally, two years ago,

43
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,711
I received news about her.

44
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:37,671
Unexpectedly,
it's the news of her death.

45
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:39,872
So,

46
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,032
you're Su Tian's younger brother?

47
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:44,831
Why?

48
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,271
Are you scared now?

49
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:49,231
Why did you claim that Min Hui's
involved in Su Tian's death?

50
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,632
After learning of her death,

51
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:52,592
I found several survivors

52
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,432
from the accident.

53
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,711
I wanted to know if my sister

54
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,032
had left any last words
before she passed away.

55
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,231
They all said

56
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:02,352
that she was with another girl

57
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,511
(on the bus.)

58
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,032
(My sister could have gotten
off the bus first,)

59
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:08,152
(but that girl)

60
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,592
(had an argument with my sister)

61
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:10,951
(and pushed her.)

62
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,152
And that girl got off the bus,

63
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:15,912
but my sister died.

64
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:17,872
Now,

65
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,791
in front of me,

66
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,432
and my sister's soul,

67
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,072
can you confess to me,

68
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,551
that you did cause my sister's death?

69
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:28,072
Was it you?

70
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,711
I...I didn't.

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,831
I don't know how to explain this.

72
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:32,551
Min Hui.

73
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,791
What has happened to Su Tian?

74
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:42,912
Is it like what he said?

75
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,391
Are you suspecting me?

76
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,352
No, I don't.

77
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:53,391
I'm just...

78
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,152
You don't believe me, right?

79
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,231
You can't trust me completely,

80
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:58,872
right?

81
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,472
Min Hui.

82
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,511
I have something serious to tell you.

83
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,352
Su Tian's younger brother...

84
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,511
I know

85
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:12,312
you won't listen to me

86
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:13,671
however I explain.

87
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:16,552
So, I'm not going to say anything.

88
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,552
If you're not satisfied with this

89
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,992
to vent your anger,

90
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,391
you can sue me in court.

91
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:24,992
Wait.

92
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,792
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,192
What has it got to do with the court?

94
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:33,312
Min Hui.

95
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:36,872
I don't suspect you.

96
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,632
I just want to know the truth.

97
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,511
I believe you didn't harm Su Tian.

98
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,031
You know what,

99
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,632
every time you only

100
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,232
think about what you want to do

101
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:51,632
and you accuse me of lying to you
and using you.

102
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:53,271
You know,

103
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,151
the way you looked at me just now

104
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,271
is exactly the same as
when you were in Bincheng.

105
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,632
You've never trusted me.

106
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,471
Deep inside you,

107
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,432
I'm always a liar.

108
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:04,711
Do I get that right, Xin Qi?

109
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:05,792
Get out of here.

110
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,672
Scram.

111
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,711
Get out of here.

112
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,151
Min Hui.

113
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,511
Cao Mu, please leave me alone.

114
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,351
Stay right there.

115
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,031
Can you tell me

116
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,031
what was going on just now?

117
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,312
What has happened to Min Hui?

118
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,672
Min Hui is the one
who caused my sister's death.

119
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,872
What?

120
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:34,591
I know better than you two

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,831
what kind of person Min Hui is.

122
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,072
Do you have evidence

123
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,072
that she harmed your sister?

124
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,192
Do you, Chen Jiajun?

125
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:42,792
And you, Xin Qi.

126
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,752
I was so wrong about you.

127
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,351
Min Hui fell in love with you
over and over again.

128
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,192
I really feel sorry for her.

129
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,552
Listen.

130
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,271
Women are simple.

131
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,072
We don't give a darn

132
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:56,391
if you have no complete trust in us.

133
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,432
Think about it carefully.

134
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,112
No one paid attention to me

135
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,031
when I was in the orphanage,

136
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,591
except for Su Tian.

137
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,312
She always talked
about her younger brother

138
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,632
who had been adopted

139
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,432
and she would find him
when she grew up.

140
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,552
Do you know why Su Tian
refused to be adopted

141
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,031
and go abroad?

142
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,752
Because she never forgot

143
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:33,911
the promise with you.

144
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,031
She never forgot about you.

145
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,072
I didn't know you were
so close to her.

146
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:43,312
What makes you suspect Min Hui?

147
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,632
What did the witnesses say about this?

148
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:46,992
Have you asked the officer
in charge of this?

149
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,591
What's their conclusion?

150
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,151
Officer Deng was in charge of this case.

151
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,752
He told me about
the passengers' testimonies.

152
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,711
This is a matter of life and death.

153
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,591
They wouldn't lie about it.

154
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:03,031
I believe the situation
must be complex at that time.

155
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:04,232
People outside the bus

156
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,312
couldn't see what was happening inside.

157
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,672
We shouldn't only listen
to what they said.

158
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,112
You said you were
the closest person to my sister.

159
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:13,951
Why do you defend Min Hui?

160
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,831
Is it because you like her?

When I heard about Su Tian's death,

176
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,951
I was angry and upset.

177
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,632
I even blamed innocent people.

178
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,192
But it was useless.

to the day when I could reunite
with my sister.

182
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,232
Now that I've grown up

183
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,072
and I could go find her,

184
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,072
yet she wasn't around.

185
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:17,951
Can you understand this?

186
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:21,872
Regardless, I will never
forgive Min Hui.

187
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,192
I don't need that.

188
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,511
And I've never harmed Su Tian.

189
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,711
Do you want to know

190
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,591
what Su Tian had said
before she passed away?

191
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:33,272
What did she say?

192
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,471
Go to Shi'an Town with me.

193
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,951
Whatever the result
of the investigation is,

194
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,831
I'll tell you every word

195
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,512
Su Tian had said before she died.

196
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:58,871
Cao Mu.

197
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,032
I'm not going back to Bincheng.

198
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,152
I will head to Shi'an Town.

199
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:02,552
What are you going to do there?

200
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,792
There were many passengers
on the bus at that time.

201
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,432
I must find someone
to prove my innocence.

202
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,432
You're right.

203
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,231
That's what you should do.

204
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,432
As expected of you, Superwoman.

205
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,072
Let's see what Xin Qi has to argue
when things get clear.

206
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:16,951
I'm not doing this for Xin Qi.

207
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:19,552
It's because of Chen Jiajun.

208
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:20,991
He hates me so much now.

209
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:23,392
I don't want him to live with hatred

210
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:24,751
and a misunderstanding
that the murderer of his sister

211
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,111
was left unpunished.

212
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:27,951
I wish that he can

213
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,912
be happy, upright, and bright,

214
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:31,871
just like how he used to be
when you met him.

215
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,432
Hold on.

216
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,192
Did he come to Bincheng for you?

217
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:40,792
Could he be approaching me

218
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,272
for the same reason too?

219
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,672
Goodness.

220
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,512
I'm overwhelmed now.

221
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:48,831
Stop being dramatic

222
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,432
and just focus on your love life, okay?

223
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,831
By the way, Cao Mu.

224
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,111
Ms. Cao.

225
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,351
I'll be gone for a few days.

226
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,072
Please take care of Quanquan for me.

227
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,792
Call me anytime.

228
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:03,711
Rest assured.

229
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:23,672
Min Hui.

230
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,831
There are a lot to take in today.

231
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,951
We need some time to process them.

232
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:32,152
Get rest early.

233
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,152
We will sleep on it tonight.

234
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,432
I suppose you're familiar
with this place.

235
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,272
The orphanage
where Su Tian and I grew up

236
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,032
is around here.

237
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,471
There's a huge Banyan tree
beside the ancient town.

238
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,672
We used to sneak out

239
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,631
and enjoy the sunlight over there.

240
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,672
Come and catch me.

241
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,512
Don't run.

242
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,432
So, here's where you met Min Hui

243
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:46,912
for the first time.

244
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,871
Back then, I mistook her for Su Tian.

245
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:53,072
So, she has been a liar from the get-go.

246
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,192
That's what I thought at that time.

247
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,591
Xin Qi.

248
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,072
If our investigation

249
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,312
shows that Min Hui is the culprit,

250
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,312
what will you do?

251
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,272
No need to check on me.

252
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,231
I won't let go of those
who harmed Su Tian.

253
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,711
But I have faith in Min Hui too.

254
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,152
She wouldn't have done that.

255
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,792
Oh my.

256
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,392
When did I tell you

257
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:49,991
that she caused Su Tian's death?

258
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,672
I only told you

259
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,432
that a girl seemed to be
having an argument

260
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:56,032
with Su Tian on the bus.

261
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:57,871
After that, that girl got off the bus

262
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,192
but Su Tian didn't.

263
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,231
I didn't even

264
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,591
tell him your name.

265
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:03,991
Officer Deng.

266
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,032
I've found two witnesses.

267
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:07,711
They told me

268
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,751
it wasn't a simple argument,
but also involved pushing.

269
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,831
Who else could be it except for her?

270
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,831
Young man.

271
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,991
We try a case on the evidence.

272
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,351
You must have faith in the police.

273
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,631
We won't let any bad people
go unpunished,

274
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,831
nor will we wrong innocent people.

275
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:26,871
Officer Deng.

276
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,672
We come here

277
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:29,912
because I need to find

278
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,312
witnesses of the accident

279
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:32,792
to prove my innocence.

280
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,672
Including the driver,

281
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:37,152
there were nine people

282
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,672
o the bus.

283
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,231
You should tell me
whom you are looking for.

284
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,072
I can't just give you

285
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,751
all their contact information.

286
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:45,231
That's not appropriate.

287
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:47,792
Don't move.

288
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,032
Move to this side.

289
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,512
There's one person

290
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:57,032
who can prove my innocence.

291
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,591
But I only remember what he looks like.

292
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,272
I don't know his name.

293
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,111
Do you have any information
about this person?

294
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,312
These are the news photos
of the accident

295
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,231
and the interviews with the injured.

296
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,711
You can find the person in here.

297
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,500
(Tour bus suffered blown tire
on Hua'an Road in Shi'an Town)

298
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,100
(Bus lost control and crashed into
mountain, one dead)

299
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,700
(1 dead and 5 injured in a bus
accident on Hua'an Road in Shi'an Town)

300
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,740
(Blown tire caused the bus to overturn
on Hua'an Road in Shi'an Town)

301
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,880
(Blown-tire bus overturned
on Hua'an Road in Shi'an Town, 1 dead)

302
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,231
Officer Deng, it's him.

303
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,871
Do you know where he's now?

304
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:35,711
Well...

305
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,871
Finally, we're home. I'm fried already.

306
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,231
Quanquan.

307
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,471
Don't be upset.

308
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,312
Mommy has something important to handle.

309
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:56,951
Why?

310
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,672
Are you not happy staying with me?

311
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:00,792
Don't lie to me.

312
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,512
Xin Qi and Min Hui

313
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,512
must have gone
to spend time together.

314
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,991
That's why they left me with you.

315
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,111
How could she choose the husband
over her son?

316
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,312
She didn't even give me a call.

317
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:14,831
Rightfully so.

318
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,192
She didn't even give us a call.

319
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:17,831
Don't worry. Once they return,

320
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,152
I will call them out.

321
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,432
Smile.

322
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:33,192
Godmother.

323
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,631
Are you waiting for calls
from your mommy too?

324
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,392
I...

325
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,392
I'm not waiting

326
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:42,672
for that brat's call.

327
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:43,871
He better not come back.

328
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:53,432
Yes?

329
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:54,672
(Have you finished work?)

330
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:55,672
(I'll treat you to dinner.)

331
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:56,991
Why?

332
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,032
(Huh?)

333
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,072
(Do you need a reason for a meal?)

334
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:00,552
(You're alone, anyway.)

335
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:03,471
Okay. So what are you treating me to?

336
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,631
Surprise!

337
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,272
Why aren't you surprised?

338
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:12,552
I won't be surprised

339
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:13,831
by everything you do.

340
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:14,871
What's in there?

341
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,231
Our dinner.

342
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,072
Come on. Let's go.

343
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,312
My hands are hurt carrying these.

344
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:20,912
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

345
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:21,831
Hello.

346
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:24,591
Steak, mushroom, and pear.

347
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,272
Well, that's the ingredients for today.

348
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:26,951
It should be enough.

349
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,471
You're going to taste
my cooking skills today.

350
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,351
How did you know about my address?

351
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,032
Yang Yangyang told me.

352
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:37,552
What a blabbermouth.

353
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,751
It's better if you can
notify me earlier next time.

354
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,751
You won't let me in if I do.

355
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,272
So, this is where you live.

356
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,471
Pretty nice.

357
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:52,272
What?

358
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,152
I'm already here.

359
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,711
Don't tell me you want to chase me out.

360
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:57,192
I won't go overboard.

361
00:16:58,951 --> 00:16:59,792
Sorry.

362
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:04,671
Cao Mu.

363
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,312
Zhou Ruji, have you gone off from work?

364
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:07,911
Min Hui asked me to look after Quanquan.

365
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,151
But something came up in the office.

366
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:10,831
Can you come over after work?

367
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:12,792
Sure.

368
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,472
I'm in the neighborhood now.

369
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:15,952
Well, I'm coming right away.

370
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:16,952
Sure thing.

371
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,952
Are you serious, Zhou Ruji?

372
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:21,911
Did you actually fake a call

373
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,831
to chase me away?

374
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:24,671
No, I didn't.

375
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:25,312
Something came up.

376
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,512
Perhaps we can eat dinner next time.

377
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,631
I'm not buying it.

378
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,312
Please, I will get you a meal next time.

379
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,312
Fine, tell me what your business is.

380
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:32,312
I will go with you.

381
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:51,992
You're...

382
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,312
Su Tian?

383
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:06,871
We went round and round

384
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:09,591
and ended up here again.

385
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,512
Perhaps it's fate trying

386
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,671
to tell us

387
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:16,312
to make an end

388
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,272
where we started.

389
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,391
Why do you have information about
the bus accident from five years ago?

390
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,552
After I woke up from surgery,

391
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,591
it was already half a year later.

392
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,952
Then, I returned to Shi'an Town

393
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:42,072
and collected as much information
as possible about the accident.

394
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:44,151
I wanted to figure out

395
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,351
how Su Tian died.

396
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,232
How did Su Tian die?

397
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:50,072
I've told you clearly

398
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,312
five years ago,

399
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:53,992
but you didn't believe me.

400
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:56,952
Never.

401
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,272
I've got the address of that witness.

402
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,591
Let's go there now.

403
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:09,952
Let's go.

404
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,631
Are you done?

405
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:40,591
How's it?

406
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:41,952
Am I doing good?

407
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:42,952
Great!

408
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:43,831
Let me see

409
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,831
the video.

410
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,792
Did you forget to use a filter?

411
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,072
I look dull in here.

412
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:50,232
You're pretty,

413
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,431
and you don't need filters.

414
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,992
Quanquan, you're so sweet.

415
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,072
You actually know how to talk.

416
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:57,351
Quanquan, can you dance?

417
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:58,072
Yes.

418
00:19:58,351 --> 00:19:59,992
Can you show it to me?

419
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,431
Come on.

420
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,911
Is this all you can dance?

421
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:06,591
Do you want to learn ballet from me?

422
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:07,232
Sure.

423
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:07,831
Come on.

424
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:09,272
Extend your leg

425
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:10,151
and move out.

426
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:18,512
Create an arc.

427
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,032
Move your left leg outward.

428
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:21,992
Extend your arms.

429
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:23,712
Zhou Ruji.

430
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,712
Where did you meet such a gorgeous lady?

431
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:26,712
I didn't expect that from you.

432
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,111
Look at her posture.

433
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,431
Nonsense.

434
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:32,272
She's Director Yao's daughter.

435
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,752
I see.

436
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:36,871
Don't overthink.

437
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,111
It's not what you're thinking.

438
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,472
Don't point the knife at me.

439
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,431
We've known each other for so long.

440
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:41,911
You haven't brought back a woman yet.

441
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:43,391
I wonder what's going on.

442
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,431
You said something came up
in your office. You should leave now.

443
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,871
I didn't prepare anything for you.

444
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,312
Quanquan, I'm leaving.

445
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,591
Godmother.

446
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,712
Please be nice to her, okay?

447
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,552
Sure.

448
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:55,552
I'm so sorry

449
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:56,631
to interrupt your date.

450
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:59,512
I told you it's not a date.

451
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:00,151
It's fine.

452
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:01,431
I'm happy

453
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:02,431
as long as he's with me.

454
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,472
Cao Mu.

455
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,431
You can leave without worry.

456
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,712
I'll handle this well.

457
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:07,752
Remind me of your name.

458
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:08,712
I'm Zhuzhu.

459
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:10,552
I like you.

460
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:12,512
Good luck.

461
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,191
Say goodbye to Cao Mu.

462
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,820
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

463
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,920
It's mealtime. Go wash your hands.

464
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,871
Washing hands and ready to eat.

465
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:30,631
I'm so sorry.

466
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:31,431
Sorry.

467
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:32,431
Are you all right?

468
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:33,191
Yes.

469
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:35,272
Hello, sir.

470
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:38,111
I wonder if you still remember me.

471
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,552
It's about the bus accident
that happened five years ago.

472
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,151
It's you.

473
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,831
Please come in.

474
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,072
Come on in.

475
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:55,911
Right this way.

476
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,191
I didn't expect to meet you here.

477
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,752
Are you here for traveling?

478
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:03,831
No.

479
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:04,952
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

480
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,272
I'm Su Tian's brother.

481
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,952
The girl who passed away

482
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,072
in the bus accident five years ago.

483
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:09,952
Do you still remember her?

484
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,151
Yes, of course.

485
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:14,272
She was such a lovely girl.

486
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:16,072
She always spoke

487
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,591
so softly

488
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,312
and was wearing

489
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,831
a smile on her face.

490
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,312
What a pitiful girl.

491
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:26,712
You were so lucky.

492
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:28,191
Mr. Jiang.

493
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:31,591
I remember you were near
the door of the bus

494
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,591
and you pulled me out.

495
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:34,671
Yes.

496
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,391
In that case,

497
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,032
I'm your life savior.

498
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,151
At that time,

499
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,151
you wanted

500
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,911
to wait for that girl.

501
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,111
(If I hadn't)

502
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,631
(pulled you out,)

503
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,272
(you would've fallen with her.)

504
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,712
Unfortunately,

505
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,391
I couldn't have pulled you both

506
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:58,871
out together.

507
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:03,792
Can you please

508
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,911
tell us more details?

509
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,472
The more detailed, the better.

510
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,871
Sure.

511
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:13,191
At that time,

512
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:14,472
the bus suddenly

513
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:15,472
went out of control.

514
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:35,831
Open the door.

515
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:42,671
Open the door.

516
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:43,792
Move to the side.

517
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,072
This side.

518
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,272
Here. Faster.

519
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:54,032
Give me your hand.

520
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,552
Don't move.

521
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:03,232
Here. Give me your hand.

522
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:04,232
My photo.

523
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,950
- Come on.
- My photo.

524
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,880
My photo.

525
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,752
Come back, Su Tian.

526
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:09,512
You go down first.

527
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,272
Go down first.

528
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,191
Get off.

529
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,920
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

530
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,272
Su Tian.

531
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:20,472
Su Tian, grab my hand.

532
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:21,671
Watch out.

533
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,952
Su Tian.

534
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:37,911
Wait.

535
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:40,591
Are you sure Su Tian went back herself?

536
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:41,752
Are you not mistaken?

537
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,712
Why would I be mistaken?

538
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:44,792
But

539
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,431
it's different from
what other people have said.

540
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,671
I don't know

541
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:50,631
what they've told you.

542
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,111
I was the only person on the bus

543
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,712
closest to the two girls at that time.

544
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:55,591
Let me put it this way.

545
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:57,871
I put my reputation on the line for you.

546
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,431
Every word I said

547
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:00,752
is true.

548
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:10,151
Why had this happened?

549
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:13,391
Why did she go back?

550
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,351
Why didn't she get off the bus?

551
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:20,272
Why did she want to go back?

552
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,232
On the day of the accident,

553
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:49,191
I was in a terrible mood.

554
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:52,032
But Su Tian's smile melted me.

555
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,512
She was really

556
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:57,871
a warm and sunshine girl.

557
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,151
What exactly did my sister

558
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:03,472
go back to get

559
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:04,552
even at the risk of death?

560
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:18,871
My photo.

561
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,460
- Hurry up.
- My photo.

562
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,660
- My photo.
- It's dangerous.

563
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,540
- Su Tian, come back.
- My photo.

564
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,390
- You go down first.
- Come out.

565
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:28,032
Su Tian.

566
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:42,992
This photo

567
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,472
was taken by the director

568
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,871
before I left the orphanage.

569
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:50,312
My sister said

570
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,512
we might not recognize each other
when we grew up.

571
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,591
So, I must keep this photo well.

572
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,191
Su Tian had been carrying this with her.

573
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,151
When we were on the bus,

574
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,472
she told me that she had two wishes.

575
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:08,351
One was to reunite with Xin Qi,

576
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:10,552
while the other one,

577
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,671
was to find her little brother.

578
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:32,831
Chen Jiajun.

579
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:36,792
I'm truly sorry

580
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,351
that I couldn't bring her out with me.

581
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,232
I'm the one who should apologize.

582
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,232
In fact, among the witnesses,

583
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:45,431
no one could confirm

584
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,871
that you were responsible for her death.

585
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:50,351
But I just hate to accept the truth

586
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,391
that she's died.

587
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,552
And I don't know
where to put my blame on.

588
00:27:57,591 --> 00:27:59,191
If you don't mind,

589
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:03,191
I can be your sister.

590
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,992
Help!

591
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:29,831
Oh, it's an apple.

592
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,032
Wicked witch.

593
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,472
This is a poisonous apple.

594
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:38,752
Prince, save me.

595
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,032
Snow White, I'm here for you.

596
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,032
Snow White.

597
00:28:42,032 --> 00:28:44,671
Wake up.

598
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,992
Wait, that's not right.

599
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:50,151
The princess can only wake up
if the prince kisses her.

600
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,712
Why were you shaking me instead?

601
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:54,072
Only the Frog Prince
kisses the princess.

602
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,072
Snow White is choked
by the poisonous apple at her throat.

603
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:58,712
So, I should shake you.

604
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:01,871
Clever boy, Quanquan.

605
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:03,232
You deserve my kiss.

606
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:06,552
Where are you going?

607
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:07,871
I'm going to catch you.

608
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:08,992
Where are you going?

609
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,752
Daddy Zhou.

610
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:10,792
Got you.

611
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,792
Yes? What has happened?

612
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,191
She kissed me.

613
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:15,191
Don't go overboard.

614
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:15,952
His heart is weak

615
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:16,992
and he can't get too excited.

616
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:18,992
It's all right now.

617
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:20,831
Daddy Zhou.

618
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:22,552
You've mistaken Zhuzhu.

619
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,591
I like her very much.

620
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,472
Be nice to her.

621
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:28,831
What to do now?

622
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:30,472
I'm going

623
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:32,552
to marry Daddy Zhou in the future.

624
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,831
Well.

625
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:40,272
You should go to bed now.

626
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:41,232
It's late. Chop-chop.

627
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:43,512
But I want to play with Zhuzhu.

628
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:45,871
I prefer kids who go to bed early.

629
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:47,871
All right. I'm going to bed now.

630
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,072
Good boy.

631
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:50,992
Zhuzhu.

632
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:53,391
Will you come here tomorrow?

633
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:54,792
It's a deal.

634
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,151
Goodnight.

635
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,111
By now, you should know
how charming I am.

636
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:07,431
I do, Snow White.

637
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,191
I will escort you back
to the castle now.

638
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:22,431
Thank you so much for today.

639
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,431
You went all the way here and
took care of the child.

640
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,431
No problem.

641
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,272
I quite like children.

642
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:28,952
Besides, Quanquan is so adorable.

643
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:30,431
By the way,

644
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,032
I've only heard you and Cao Mu

645
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,032
mentioning Quanquan's mom.

646
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:34,992
What about his dad?

647
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,871
They split up.

648
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,512
It must be tough for her

649
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:42,792
to raise the child by herself,

650
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,911
and still manage to keep the child
so good-natured.

651
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,752
She must be super amazing.

652
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:49,752
Min Hui.

653
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,391
Her name is Min Hui.

654
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:01,151
Is she

655
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,472
the one you've been liking?

656
00:31:11,312 --> 00:31:12,512
I wish I could meet her.

657
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:13,992
Someone

658
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:15,911
whom you've been admiring all this time

659
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,591
must be very beautiful.

660
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,272
To me, she's quite pretty.

661
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,032
I didn't know you would say
such cheesy things.

662
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:31,871
Well, besides being pretty,

663
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,191
what else do you like
about her the most?

664
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,712
The most?

665
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:37,992
Please don't tell me

666
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:39,552
you like everything about her.

667
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,431
I don't believe
there's such a perfect person.

668
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:43,552
Well, not.

669
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:45,591
She's not perfect

670
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,232
and she has many flaws.

671
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,792
She can't cook,

672
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,272
and she's single-minded
when dealing with things.

673
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:55,712
Also, she's so forgetful
when she's busy.

674
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,272
She's too straightforward.

675
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,712
Despite this, she always
exudes a beam of light

676
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:05,911
attracting my attention,

677
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,312
and I want to stay by her side.

678
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,671
So, you know now

679
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:17,072
how I feel

680
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,591
whenever I see you.

681
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:21,151
You're the light in my eyes and heart.

682
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,232
But I...

683
00:32:25,232 --> 00:32:25,952
I know.

684
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,272
No need to explain.

685
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,191
As I said before,

686
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:30,232
I want to compete
with your crush equally.

687
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:32,111
Even though you think Min Hui highly,

688
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,111
I'm not inferior too.

689
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:34,631
What I'm trying to say...

690
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:36,232
My car is here. I got to go.

691
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:37,831
Go back and stay with Quanquan.

692
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:38,671
Bye-bye.

693
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,111
Young lady.

694
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:06,871
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

695
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:10,871
I wouldn't be willing to fight with him

696
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,831
if he were my boyfriend.

697
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:13,952
Don't be dejected.

698
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,072
As the old saying goes,

699
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:16,792
"Only a thin veil in the way
when a woman pursues a man".

700
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:17,911
You're so pretty.

701
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:19,391
You will win over his heart
sooner or later.

702
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:23,191
You're right. I won't give up.

703
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:24,631
Thank you, sir.

704
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,671
You're welcome.

705
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:47,871
It's going to rain.

706
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:49,631
You should head back.

707
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,671
If we didn't meet with Jiang Sheng today

708
00:33:53,671 --> 00:33:55,871
or he failed to prove my innocence,

709
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,591
what would you do?

710
00:33:59,072 --> 00:33:59,952
Min Hui.

711
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:02,512
The whole thing is straightened out now.

712
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:04,312
Can you please

713
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:06,312
not talk to me with this attitude?

714
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,711
That's my right

715
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:10,791
to talk to you with any attitude.

716
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:13,872
If you have any dissatisfaction,

717
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:15,191
you can express it to me,

718
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:17,432
if it helps calm you down.

719
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:20,751
I felt wronged at first.

720
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:22,392
But it doesn't matter

721
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:24,631
now.

722
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,952
I understand Chen Jiajun's rage.

723
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,032
He was helpless

724
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:31,591
when he faced the situation,

725
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,472
because he couldn't
do anything about it.

726
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:37,432
But I never believed
that you harmed Su Tian.

727
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:39,711
Regarding this,

728
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,032
I hope that you can trust me.

729
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:42,231
I did trust you.

730
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,352
But you never realized

731
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:46,791
what's important

732
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,711
to me.

733
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:20,512
Min Hui.

734
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,072
I bought breakfast.

735
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:31,711
Jiajun.

736
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:33,751
Have you seen Min Hui?

737
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:35,072
She texted me this morning

738
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:35,791
and said she went back first.

739
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,992
She's not joining us.

740
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,832
Probably she's still mad at me.

741
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,311
I'm sorry, Xin Qi.

742
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:45,552
If it wasn't for me...

743
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:46,552
It's not related to you.

744
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:47,671
Give me a second.

745
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:48,912
I'll take you somewhere.

746
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:00,711
Your sister had always
been a likable person,

747
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,711
(Shi'an Town Orphanage)
unlike me

748
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,992
who always rubbed people the wrong way.

749
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:07,711
When my foster parents returned here,

750
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,311
they wanted to adopt your sister

751
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,111
when they first saw her.

752
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:16,151
But she refused

753
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:19,352
and cried.

754
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:22,191
She said that I had a heart problem

755
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:25,552
and might not live long

756
00:36:27,472 --> 00:36:29,032
if they didn't adopt me.

757
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,151
I've always felt uneasy,

758
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,352
as if I stole her life.

759
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,512
But she told me

760
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,552
that she didn't want to go abroad.

761
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,631
Because she was going
to look for her brother

762
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,392
when she grew up.

763
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,832
At that time, I promised myself

764
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,191
that I would help her
to find her brother

765
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,912
if I could live long.

766
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:54,311
Xin Qi.

767
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:56,432
If you didn't mistake Min Hui

768
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:57,912
for my sister,

769
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,271
would you've fallen in love with her?

770
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:02,591
I would.

771
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:06,512
Because what I love
isn't the name Su Tian,

772
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:09,912
but Min Hui as a person.

773
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,631
It's a shame

774
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,271
that I only came to realize this

775
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,432
recently.

776
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,872
What about my sister?

777
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:26,151
She's like my blood sister.

778
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:28,352
She'd always be.

779
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:32,392
Got it.

780
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:35,832
You must be Xin Qi, right?

781
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:38,352
We only got to see each other
via screen over the years.

782
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:40,591
Finally, we met in person.

783
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,591
It's been years.

784
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:42,751
Yes, that's right.

785
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,311
Five years ago,

786
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:46,751
you started donating to our orphanage

787
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:49,271
and sponsoring the kids
in their education.

788
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,711
I've always wanted you

789
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,591
to come back and visit here.

790
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:53,671
Finally,

791
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,671
you've come today.

792
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,671
This is the director
of the orphanage, Director Li.

793
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,432
Nice to meet you, Director Li.

794
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:01,271
Nice to meet you.

795
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:02,072
Director Li.

796
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,311
He's

797
00:38:03,392 --> 00:38:04,512
Su Tian's younger brother.

798
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:06,912
You've grown so tall

799
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,671
after many years.

800
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:09,671
Good to see you.

801
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:11,631
I brought him here

802
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,992
as we'd like to know more
about Su Tian's childhood

803
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,631
from you.

804
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:17,872
Sure, no problem.

805
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:19,111
How fortuitous.

806
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,472
Earlier this morning,
there was also a lady

807
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:24,311
who asked me to tell her
about Su Tian.

808
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,352
Is her name Min Hui?

809
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,032
Yes.

810
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,352
That's her name.

811
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:30,791
Director Li, I will leave you here.

812
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:31,791
I need to go somewhere.

813
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,552
Oh my.

814
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,512
He used to be composed though.

815
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,751
Excuse me, have you seen this lady?

816
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:45,711
No.
