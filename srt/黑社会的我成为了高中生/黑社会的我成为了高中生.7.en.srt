(Incoming call)

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,539
It was quite a shock to get a phone call from the police...

9
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,869
in the morning, wasn't it?

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,909
Nonetheless, we should still meet.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,310
Come to the parking lot.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,549
I should have figured out...

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,060
that you were behind this...

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,560
when those punks caused this kind of trouble.

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,030
I let my guard down.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,929
Come on. You managed to win over the guys from the Dongsoo Gang too.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,170
So they're your uncles. Right?

18
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,170
But this is too bad. I don't need your uncles anymore.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,969
I plan to get things done my way.

20
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,609
So it suits my style.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,060
We filed a complaint against him like you told us to do.

22
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,730
We deleted all the videos from social media.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,430
Some kids saw us when he beat us up. So we talked them into...

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,599
becoming our witnesses.

25
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,769
What about our reward?

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,269
Awesome.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,180
Hey, what are you doing? We're in front of a police station.

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,680
Song Yi Heon's family is loaded.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,349
I'm certain he's going to challenge us on this.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,579
You will get us a lawyer, right?

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,790
Right. You'll get us jobs too.

32
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,890
Have you been fooled all your life?

33
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,620
Why are you guys so suspicious of everything?

34
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,390
Come here.

35
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,790
Don't worry.

36
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,260
As long as you help me send him to a juvenile detention centre,

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,469
I'll be taking care of you guys for life.

38
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,270
- Gosh. - Nice.

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,400
Thank you!

40
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,310
- Let's go. - Nice.

41
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,979
Giving drugs to my mother wasn't enough?

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,409
How could you do something like this?

43
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,479
Drugs?

44
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,580
Me?

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,879
Oh, my. You should double-check on that.

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,620
Are you sure I gave her the drugs?

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,689
The record must say that she got them prescribed herself.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Oh, my.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
You're scaring me.

50
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,770
Even if you're angry, you should try to hold back...

51
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,469
because I didn't come here alone.

52
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,509
You won't be able to catch me.

53
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,419
You can try all you want,

54
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,250
but you must have realized that you can't beat me. So decide.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,490
Will you go abroad to study? Or will you go to juvie?

56
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,650
I see.

57
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,930
You tried to abduct my mother, but you failed.

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,629
So you want to get rid of me first?

59
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,460
It doesn't matter if I go abroad or juvie.

60
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,669
My mother will be sent to a psychiatric institution.

61
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,099
Once his wife passes away and my mother is in a hospital,

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,340
you must think you will become his next wife.

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,069
Have you heard of this saying?

64
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,539
"If you try to filter out makgeolli, you'll even lose the dregs."

65
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,539
It means trying to score big...

66
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,050
can backfire and cause you to suffer a loss.

67
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,810
Enough is enough.

68
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,620
I want you to stop meddling in my life.

69
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,520
Go and tell your homeroom teacher that you're going abroad to study.

70
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,789
If you don't do that, you'll end up in juvie.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,889
Then you'll never be able to find your mother. Why?

72
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,800
Because I'll lock her up in a place that's not even listed on the map.

(Episode 7)

75
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,789
I'm going to school.

76
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,090
Have the driver drop you off at school starting today.

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,030
Try to adjust to the changes at school.

78
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,129
These changes are taking you to the right direction.

79
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,100
So stop acting out.

80
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
It's the student government president.

81
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,279
He came to school today.

82
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,949
Right. I wonder if he's okay.

83
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,189
You're in my class as of today.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,959
- What? - You got separated...

85
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,990
from Song Yi Heon.

86
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,000
You asked the school to do that...

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,360
because a victim and a school bully shouldn't be in the same class.

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,600
So you were moved to my class.

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,370
What are you talking about? The school bully?

90
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,870
The principal, the school violence committee,

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,870
and the parents' association...

92
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,040
decided on that before the weekend.

93
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,980
Song Yi Heon was called by the school violence committee.

94
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,470
The person you have reached is unavailable.

95
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,939
You'll be directed to voicemail after the tone.

96
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,370
You will be charged then.

97
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,899
- He's here. - Hey.

98
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,540
Ice Cream is dead. How?

99
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,079
Did it freeze to death?

100
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,350
The more you eat this, the colder you get. What is this dish?

101
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Chili?

102
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,420
What kind of bread can you wear across your body?

103
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,689
- Bag-it... Baguette. - Correct.

104
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
You pass.

105
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Are you all right?

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,660
You must feel uncomfortable too.

107
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,029
You don't have to force yourselves to act like my friends.

108
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,430
Gosh.

109
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,329
Now that Se Kyung isn't here, you must be nicer to us...

110
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,540
because I'll be helping you study math.

111
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,769
I might not be as smart as Se Kyung,

112
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,610
but I got a Grade One for math.

113
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,040
I'll help you study Korean and science.

114
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,649
I'll go to the snack bar with you.

115
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,680
It was my idea to buy all this.

116
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,850
Respect.

117
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,120
Nice.

118
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,750
Thank you.

119
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,620
How could you be called by the school violence committee?

120
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,459
If they had known how close you guys were,

121
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,629
they would've never done that.

122
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,730
Exactly.

123
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,629
When I saw Se Kyung smile while hanging out with you,

124
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,970
it made me wonder if he was the same Se Kyung I knew.

125
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,600
For some reason, something about him sparkled.

126
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,740
Like that?

127
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,149
I heard you moved to Class One. Did I hear wrong?

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,180
As for the school violence committee,

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,680
the adults must've gotten the wrong idea.

130
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,449
I already told the principal.

131
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,819
Everything will go away soon. So don't treat us differently.

132
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,160
- Have you been well? - Yes.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,129
What about you?

134
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,459
Hey, student government president.

135
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,959
You look especially handsome today.

136
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,170
- Come on. - Right.

137
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,970
There's no way Yi Heon hit Se Kyung.

138
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,199
Yi Heon. I never doubted you.

139
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,670
Hey. What do you mean, the hearing will go away?

140
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,740
I can fill out a form to request to cancel the hearing.

141
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,680
The victim and the guardian have to sign the form. That's it.

142
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,980
I doubt your father will do that.

143
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,879
Don't worry. This happened because of me.

144
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,519
I want to fix it.

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,990
You're all grown up now.

146
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,389
You!

147
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,829
I heard Byung Chul and Duk Jun reported you for school violence.

148
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:12,899
- What? - What?

149
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,029
- They reported him? - What?

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,600
- Yi Heon did what? - Yi Heon did that?

151
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,399
- What did he do? - What?

152
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,569
Apparently, I beat them up.

153
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,139
You must have beaten them up badly if they reported you to the police.

154
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,579
Gosh. You're so dense. Do you think he really did that?

155
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,009
If he didn't, why did they report him?

156
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't know why.

157
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,379
They bullied Yi Heon. But they reported Yi Heon.

158
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,779
They're probably trying to make him the school bully...

159
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,389
when he's the victim by beating him to the punch.

160
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,490
They're trying to send me to juvie. That's why.

161
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,460
There's a woman named Lee Mi Kyung.

162
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,830
She's the one who ordered the gang to abduct my mother.

163
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,059
She sweet-talked them into reporting me to the police.

164
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,970
But where did you hear the news?

165
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,039
Well, I happened to overhear it...

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,470
on my way to school.

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,539
So those jerks won't be coming to school today.

168
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,679
Do you now realize you had been hanging out with such dirtbags?

169
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,179
Darn it. Why are you taking it out on me again?

170
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,580
You, maybes sicko.

171
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,649
What's "maybes?"

172
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,049
Hey, if someone bites you,

173
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,120
you can report him for assault, right?

174
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,090
Yes, probably.

175
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,059
Hey, do you have proof?

176
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,929
Even if I have to search all the hidden cameras in that area,

177
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,259
I'll find the video for proof.

178
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,399
Hidden cameras?

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,370
- You must mean security cameras. - Tomato tomahto!

180
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,970
Hey, stop fighting.

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,039
So tell me. Where are Byung Chul and Duk Jun now?

182
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,110
They're probably idling away at the billiard club around school.

183
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,809
I'll be back.

184
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,649
What? Are you sure you'll be okay?

185
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,850
The class found out that they reported you.

186
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,350
So the whole school must know about it by now.

187
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,820
I've done nothing wrong. Why should I be worried?

188
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Wait. Am I responsible for making everyone find out about this?

189
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,190
Because of what I said out loud earlier?

190
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,360
Even if you didn't say anything,

191
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,899
they were bound to find out once the police came to school.

192
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,769
Get back inside.

193
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,899
The study hall will start soon.

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,909
Right? I have nothing to worry about. Right?

195
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,110
You still don't understand...

196
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,320
that you caused everything that's happening now. Right?

197
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,960
What do you mean? Why is this my fault?

198
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,620
Ask your best friends.

199
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,690
They know exactly...

200
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,690
what you've done.

201
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,570
I know that...

202
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,500
you're not behind the recent turn of events.

203
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,039
I feel bad that you're being used as disposable pawns...

204
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,039
in this mess, created by adults.

205
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,809
So let me give you one last chance.

206
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,210
Withdraw your complaint and come back to school now.

207
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,980
Then I won't take issue with this.

208
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,980
You need a high school diploma to have a decent life.

209
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,019
This is your last chance.

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,990
What? You did beat us up.

211
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,960
If you don't drop the charges,

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,299
I'll report you to the police too.

213
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,429
Then we'll find out who the real school bully is.

214
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,600
"Kihojise."

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,639
(A metaphor to describe a situation when one cannot stop one's pursuit)

216
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,269
I'll take charge as if I were galloping on a tiger.

217
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,639
And once I bite, I won't let go.

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,379
If you're curious, take this matter to the end and see.

219
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,850
- That jerk. - No way.

220
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,389
- Gallop? - Guys.

221
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,789
Do you think you can give up the money?

222
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Are you out of your mind?

223
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,460
We haven't had a big score like this in a while. How can we give it up?

224
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,259
Then let's get Hong Jae Min to report him to the police too.

225
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,299
What?

226
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,929
The kids we beat up will never testify against us...

227
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,799
because they're scared of us.

228
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,269
We never bullied him in the classroom.

229
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,840
So the only person who knows exactly how we bullied Song Yi Heon...

230
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,940
is Hong Jae Min.

231
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,179
You're right.

232
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,980
There are no videos or witnesses.

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,350
Even if Song Yi Heon says that we bullied him,

234
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
there's no evidence.

235
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,350
We just have to get Hong Jae Min on our side. That's it.

236
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,419
Yes.

237
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,419
Hey, call him now.

238
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,929
Hey. If you do this, you might end up in big trouble.

239
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,159
Haven't you heard of colony?

240
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,230
If you try to frame an innocent person...

241
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,899
for a crime they didn't commit,

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,399
you'll be arrested for colony.

243
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,500
Well, isn't it "calumny?"

244
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,940
Anyway, if you trust that lady...

245
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,340
and try to send Song Yi Heon to juvie,

246
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,309
you might end up getting in trouble.

247
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,039
Hey, we have nothing to lose.

248
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,509
I don't know when it will be,

249
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,710
but when he reports us for school violence,

250
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,879
we must prepare to fight back.

251
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,919
And that lady will help us do that.

252
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,519
Hey, she'll get us a lawyer too.

253
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,419
When we graduate, we'll get us jobs too.

254
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,659
Gosh. That lady sounds scary.

255
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,529
But to report him...

256
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,059
for school violence, don't you need a medical note?

257
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,029
It's been ages since he hit you.

258
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,970
Besides, you hit him too.

259
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,669
We already got the medical note...

260
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,309
when you beat us up a while ago.

261
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,710
- What? - Hey. If you didn't beat us up,

262
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,710
we probably had to punch each other.

263
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,980
Hey, that's not right.

264
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,279
How could you use that to report him?

265
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,580
That's fraud.

266
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,419
I get that you guys love money.

267
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,820
But don't you have a conscience, you tricksters?

268
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,690
Gosh. Talk about having double standards, Jae Min.

269
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,129
You were the one who started bullying him for money.

270
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,730
You were the one who made him bring alcohol...

271
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,600
because his family seemed rich.

272
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,230
You made him bring jewellery from his house too.

273
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,730
When Song Yi Heon got scared and indeed brought the jewellery,

274
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,840
you were over the moon.

275
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,909
Don't you think we'll at least get 5,000 dollars?

276
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,370
No way. That's too much.

277
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,779
Hey. If we get 5,000 dollars, the 5 of us can...

278
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,210
- We're getting 3,000 dollars? - He signalled 3,000 dollars.

279
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,509
- If we're getting 3,000 dollars... - Hey, let's divide that by...

280
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,679
Gosh.

281
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,720
This is cool.

282
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,960
- Come here. - Hey. Over here.

283
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,019
When he told you he didn't have any more stuff to bring,

284
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,159
you slapped him and told him to steal some.

285
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,730
That's when we started to beat him up.

286
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,399
We locked him up, threw milk at him,

287
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,330
singed him. We even made him strip.

288
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,639
If I were him, I would've committed suicide a long time ago.

289
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,210
You bullied him for two years. How could you not remember that?

290
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,679
Exactly. If you make this mistake again,

291
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,340
you'll be the school bully. Got it?

292
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,450
Don't even think about testifying or anything like that.

293
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,850
If you do, you'll end up going to juvie.

294
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,320
Besides, when he reports us, your name is bound to come up.

295
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,519
Do you think he won't name you because you didn't report him?

296
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,850
You started this whole thing.

297
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,259
We must beat him to the punch before he gets a chance.

298
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,330
Let's report him together.

299
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,830
We have the upper hand.

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,639
This case is unfavourable to me?

303
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,370
Yes. They said they had witnesses who saw you beat up...

Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun near the garbage incinerator.

305

Detective, I'm the victim.

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,679
So you're telling me you're the victim,

307
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,679
not the school bully?

308
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,659
They told me that you've been bullying them...

I mean, I've been bullied...

312
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,169
by them ever since I started high school.

313
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,399
I even have a journal where I recorded how they bullied me.

314
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,110

where you wrote down how they bullied you...

327

or videos you just mentioned at the next questioning.

328

that you were bullied at school,

331

bring that friend no matter what.

332

That way, you can only prove that you're not the school bully.

Yes, sir.

I shouldn't.

But I can only focus on my studies once I handle this matter.

00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,049
They're claiming that I beat them up.

355
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,389
What?

356
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,659
Gosh.

357
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,500
I talked to my classmates, so they would come to their senses.

358
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,930
If they still don't withdraw their complaint,

359
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,940
we must get Lee Mi Kyung, so she makes them drop the charges.

360
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,839
Besides, we must get Lee Mi Kyung no matter what...

361
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,109
because there's no guarantee...

362
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,180
that she won't try to come after my mom again.

363
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,950
I told her to go to you and beg for your forgiveness.

364
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,549
But that's what she had been up to.

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,819
By the way, what do you plan to do after getting Lee Mi Kyung?

366
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,559
I'll make her face Chairman Bae first.

367
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,559
That woman is someone who wants Chairman Bae's money, power,

368
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,799
and even his heart.

369
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,670
So if she gets out of his shadow, she will lose everything.

370
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,799
I'm going to bring her in front of Chairman Bae...

371
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,869
to reveal everything and have her completely thrown out.

372
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,950
So that she may never approach Mother and Song Yi Heon.

373
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,579
We will bring her no matter what. Don't worry.

374
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,150
Then I will trust you...

375
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,450
and care for Mother...

376
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,759
while focusing on midterms.

377
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,130
"Midterms?"

378
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,329
This test...

379
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,829
will be the first test to be reflected in his records.

380
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,140
It's the test that decides whether he can go to college or not.

381
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,240
So whether I end up in juvenile hall or not,

382
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,109
and whether I go to college or not both depend on you.

383
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,609
- Please do your best. - Yes, Boss.

384
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,720
- Good luck. - Yes, sir.

385
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,289
Take care, Boss.

386
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,369
I heard you were fired from the hair salon.

387
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,309
Where are you going, when you have no place to sleep?

388
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,910
I wasn't fired, I just quit.

389
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,819
And what would I do here? It doesn't even feel like home.

390
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,119
Why, you...

391
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,390
If it's not home, then what is it?

392
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,190
You don't even come home often,

393
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,759
so why are you going nuts?

394
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,089
What did you call me?

395
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,589
And "nuts"? To your brother?

396
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,460
I already have a headache. Why are you acting out as well?

397
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,369
Dad said to give this to you.

398
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,569
(Prepare For Tomorrow Savings Account Bankbook)

399
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,410
They cut off the water.

400
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,339
How is this a home when you can't even shower?

401
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,880
What did you just say?

402
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,549
Come here, you. Hey!

403
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,250
That little...

404
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,990
Don't even think about testifying or anything like that.

405
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,519
If you do, you'll end up going to juvie.

406
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,890
Crazy. Why would I go to juvie?

407
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:53,829
Whatever.

408
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,339
Lawsuit or testifying, I'm going to ignore it all.

409
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,240
Besides, when he reports us, your name is bound to come up.

410
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,609
Do you think he won't name you...

411
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:04,710
because you didn't report him?

412
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,410
You started this whole thing.

413
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,480
He won't say my name during the investigation, will he?

414
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,890
Should I ask him not to say it?

415
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,400
(Prepare For Tomorrow Savings Account Bankbook)

416
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,619
I can somehow manage to solve probability problems.

417
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,390
But I really can't understand functions.

418
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,430
Watch.

419
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,559
For this problem...

420
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,269
You got it wrong here.

421
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,269
You have to substitute it here.

422
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,740
Do you mean I could be a substitute teacher?

423
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,609
I'm not even done with these problems.

424
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,950
No, you need to substitute this, not the other one.

425
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,150
They cancelled the school violence committee.

426
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,720
I saw it.

427
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,589
Did your father sign the cancellation request?

428
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,660
You have a lot of problems on your hands,

429
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,130
with the lawsuit and your mother.

430
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,059
I wanted to handle at least the committee for you.

431
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,970
Are you sure it wasn't because you wanted to make me study...

432
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,869
so that you can see Song Yi Heon earlier?

433
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,910
There's also that, but...

434
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,609
I didn't want to lose a friend.

435
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,220
You're the only real friend I have.

436
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,890
So you can't ever go to juvie.

437
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,490
Fine.

438
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,490
Make sure to say the same even when Song Yi Heon returns.

439
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,589
That you're friends.

440
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,940
I'm sure I told you that I won't wait for long.

441
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,680
(I'm sure I told you that I won't wait for long. Yi Heon)

442
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,750
I'm sure you heard that we have an advantage.

443
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,420
We decided not to drop it.

444
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,789
Was it, "I'll take charge as if I were galloping on a tiger?"

445
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,759
We will charge like that as well, so let's take this until the end.

446
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,960
They will only come to their senses once they fall off the tiger.

447
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,759
Those unethical kids...

448
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,329
(Jong Cheol)

449
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,970
This is best for waking up.

450
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,839
Boss Chil Sung showed up.

451
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,779
He met the retired bosses at an inn in Gangneung...

452
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,750
and said that he would visit soon after asking about us.

453
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,680
It's a relief to hear that...

454
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,420
he's doing well.

455
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,589
He heard about his nephew, so he will be here soon.

456
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,589
What about Chairman Bae and Lee Mi Kyung?

457
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,529
We kept an eye on them these past few days,

458
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,730
but there's no sign of Lee Mi Kyung and Chairman Bae at the office.

459
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,299
It seems like...

460
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,970
the appellants have no intentions of dropping it.

461
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,910
Then if we don't find Lee Mi Kyung, will you become the assailant?

462
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,980
We will do whatever it takes to find where Lee Mi Kyung is.

463
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,049
You can't ever go to juvie.

464
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,950
Right.

465
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,420
It may be hard, but you just focus on your exams.

466
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,359
Good luck.

467
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,329
Number 16, 5. Number 17, 1.

468
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,809
Number 18, 1.

469
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,869
Number 19, 4.

470
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,940
Number 20, 5.

471
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,410
That's it.

472
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,819
You got everything on the last page, Song Yi Heon?

473
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,450
- What? - Goodness.

474
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,390
- Really? - The questions were really hard.

475
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,589
- Amazing. - Gosh.

476
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,630
President, we're done marking them, right?

477
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,130
What? Yes.

478
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,529
Take your phones, and we don't have an assembly today,

479
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,400
so you can all go home except for those on cleaning duty.

480
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,799
Good job on your exams.

481
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Here.

482
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,339
Go on and tell him.

483
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,680
(Detective Min, The case has been sent to the prosecution.)

484
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,079
(And your father is abroad at the moment.)

485
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,519
Gosh...

486
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:43,789
Yi Heon.

487
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,960
Do you want to go and have tteokbokki with me?

488
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,960
Sorry, I have to go somewhere today.

489
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,069
Yi Heon.

490
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,309
What? You go to my school?

491
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,809
What are you doing, since exams are over?

492
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,150
I have something to tell you.

493
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,349
Do you want to go and eat tteokbokki?

494
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,549
Sorry, there's something I have to do.

495
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,420
Instead, I will buy tteokbokki and tea next time.

496
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,920
What do you say we talk then?

497
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,029
Okay. For sure.

498
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
She's...

499
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,769
Hey...

500
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,869
Song Yi Heon! What was that?

501
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,970
Why would Choi Seol Hee eat tteokbokki with you?

502
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,410
What will you talk about?

503
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,079
- How do you know him? - Choi Seol Hee.

504
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,349
She wins medals at the National Sports Festival,

505
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,549
and she's on the archery national team.

506
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,779
She's so famous.

507
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,349
Are you having a fling with Choi Seol Hee?

508
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,349
No, it's not like that.

509
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,490
I just saw her a few times at the study room. That's all.

510
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,190
Is she prettier, or am I?

511
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,759
What?

512
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,130
Both of you are pretty, of course.

513
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,539
But maybe it's because Seol Hee has a small face,

514
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,670
she seems to have good proportions.

515
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,609
So you're saying...

516
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,869
I have a big face?

517
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,339
No, I...

518
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,279
"You don't have a big face."

519
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,549
No, I don't like small faces.

520
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,049
You have to have a big face...

521
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,990
to have big eyes, nose, and mouth, which looks cool.

522
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,190
So you're saying my face is big.

523
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,859
No, I mean...

524
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,160
Your face isn't big.

525
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,029
It's just that Seol Hee has an exceptionally small face.

526
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,230
You're so annoying!

527
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,430
Min Ji!

528
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,369
You don't know anything about women.

529
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,470
Hey, Nam Min Ji!

530
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,640
Why is it even more difficult...

531
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,980
to figure out ladies' hearts than solving problems?

532
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,579
Do you also have something with Min Ji?

533
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,079
Are you two-timing them?

534
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,779
No. I have something important, so I should go.

535
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,990
Where are you going? You need to follow Nam Min Ji.

536
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,490
You can't go like that even if you don't know women!

537
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,059
You'll ruin your school life!

538
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,220
Hey!

539
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,029
For cases involving minors, we contact the guardians first.

540
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:09,529
But OK Construction won't give us Chairman Bae's personal number,

541
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,130
he won't go to work at all,

542
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,269
and it didn't seem like he was at home,

543
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,470
so we checked just in case,

544
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,910
and we found a departure record.

545
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,410
But...

546
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:22,150
How did this get turned over to the prosecution so quickly?

547
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm baffled as well.

548
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,079
The prosecution suddenly contacted us in the morning,

549
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,549
saying they will handle it quickly.

550
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,150
They said they would investigate as soon as possible,

551
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,019
so you should better prepare in advance.

552
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,630
The assailant and victim's claims are completely different,

553
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,029
so the investigation will be a three-party encounter.

554
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,940
(Your criminal mediation schedule will be held on May 8, 2023.)

555
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,200
(Please attend at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.)

556
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,470
It says...

557
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,480
to come next Monday.

558
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,710
It's right after this weekend?

559
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,349
There are many victims,

560
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:01,079
and the violence is quite severe,

561
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,250
but it isn't something to be processed this quickly.

562
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,849
If this goes on,

563
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,460
then the assailant will be taken in right after the investigation.

564
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,630
Then if I become the assailant,

565
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,900
I guess I won't be able to attend school.

566
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,970
I think someone who is very interested in this case...

567
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,539
is influencing the prosecution.

568
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,910
(School Violence Committee Cancellation Request, Guardian)

569
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,579
My Se Kyung turned this in?

570
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,910
Yes.

571
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,849
Still, how can you cancel it without additional confirmation?

572
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,789
Who would trust the school to handle work?

573
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,849
Sir...

574
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,859
Don't get too upset.

575
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,190
Ma'am, what do I do with the extra...

576
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,339
Did you turn in the cancellation form?

577
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,970
After getting it signed by your mother?

578
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,440
I didn't think you would do it.

579
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,880
Regarding Song Yi Heon's charges for school violence,

580
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,079
I told them to hand it over to the prosecutor's office.

581
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,049
What do you mean?

582
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,990
I already told the local precinct.

583
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,759
I told them to tell me first...

584
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,329
if they receive any case related to Song Yi Heon.

585
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,859
When I heard that the meeting was cancelled,

586
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,329
I handed it over.

587
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,500
Yi Heon didn't do that.

588
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,740
- Yi Heon is the victim. - Wake up!

589
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,910
I can't even handle the fact that he coaxed my son...

590
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,039
and led him astray,

591
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,680
but he's the kind that cancels the meeting behind my back...

592
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,940
and says for himself that he's a gangster,

593
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,750
and he's a scum that hits other kids.

594
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,880
If the school can't, he should be punished through legislation.

595
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,920
I'll do everything I can to send him to juvie...

596
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,859
as soon as possible,

597
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,960
so that he may never set foot in school again.

598
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,359
Watch what you say, please.

599
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm the one who cancelled the meeting.

600
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,029
Because I'm not a victim.

601
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,099
Are you...

602
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,069
even the Se Kyung I know?

603
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,279
I'm doing my best...

604
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,480
to raise you properly.

605
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,650
Why are you breaking down like this?

606
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,579
Are you by any chance...

607
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,920
thinking about testifying?

608
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,589
If you do testify,

609
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,089
don't think of ever seeing me again.

610
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,660
You won't be my son.

611
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,829
(Hello. This is the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.)

612
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,000
(Your criminal mediation schedule will be held on May 8, 2023.)

613
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
(Please attend at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.)

614
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,869
It's not Lee Mi Kyung.

615
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,410
If it was Lee Mi Kyung, she would have already reported it.

616
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,480
She wouldn't wait for weeks.

617
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,380
Someone who would suddenly report it to the prosecution...

618
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,690
and handle the work this fast...

619
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,329
I'll do everything I can to send him to juvie...

620
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,299
as soon as possible,

621
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,740
so that he may never set foot in school again.

622
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,369
Make sure to say the same even when Song Yi Heon returns.

623
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,609
That you're friends.

624
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,160
Why were you looking at Yi Heon these past few days?

625
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,069
Are you going to sue him, along with Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun?

626
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
No way.

627
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,440
I'm ignoring the calls from those guys.

628
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,470
Then what is it?

629
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,440
Are you going to get information from Yi Heon and give it to them?

630
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,539
Who the witness is, and whether he has testimony?

631
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,480
No, that's not it.

632
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,509
I just want to graduate quietly.

633
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,720
Yi Heon will go to the juvie,

634
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,589
and you want to graduate, jerk?

635
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,490
At first, I only teased Song Yi Heon...

636
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,630
because he was all dark,

637
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,529
and I only wanted him to buy alcohol...

638
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,329
and cigarettes since he was rich.

639
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,200
I don't know how it came this far.

640
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,470
How am I supposed to fix this?

641
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,839
I'll give you the solution.

642
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,470
You, Jang Byung Chul, and Park Duk Jun...

643
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,440
have the video in your phones, right?

644
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,710
The proof where we hit and harassed Yi Heon?

645
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,180
Yi Heon told you to delete it, but I'm sure you didn't.

646
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,180
Do whatever it takes, whether it's stealing their phones...

647
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
or hacking their cloud storage, to gather them all...

648
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,490
and reveal them at the investigation.

649
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,160
You, Jang Byung Chul, Park Duk Jun, and all the other guys.

650
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,259
That they are the real assailants and that Yi Heon was sued...

651
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,559
when he was the victim.

652
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,730
And also search all the CCTVs...

653
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,000
to reveal that Yi Heon is the victim, understand?

654
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,970
That's the solution? Then what about me?

655
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,039
I won't be able to attend school and go to juvie.

656
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,940
My father handed this case over to the prosecution, you fool.

657
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,839
If we can't testify that Yi Heon is the victim,

658
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,210
Yi Heon will be arrested and sent to juvie...

659
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,240
when he is innocent.

660
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,250
I don't want to.

661
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,390
Yi Heon even forgave you when you tried to kidnap his mother.

662
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,730
He didn't even have the school violence committee held...

663
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,400
because he didn't want you to get expelled.

664
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,960
Do you think Yi Heon doesn't know that the tables will be turned...

665
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,329
if you say that you're the assailant?

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,599
He isn't saying anything to you when he knows everything.

667
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,869
He's protecting you so you can attend school.

668
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,710
You choose.

669
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,609
Will you neglect it like a coward, or...

670
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,750
Will you testify, like Yi Heon did,

671
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,880
and help him out?

672
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm not doing anything.

673
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,630
It has nothing to do with me.

674
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:53,400
Do you think Yi Heon doesn't know that the tables will be turned...

675
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,569
if you say that you're the assailant?

676
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,170
He isn't saying anything to you when he knows everything.

677
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,940
He's protecting you so you can attend school.

678
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,079
Why did he have to say that nonsense?

679
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,219
(Byung Chul)

680
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,469
Why won't you pick up?

681
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,210
- You came? - What are you going to do?

682
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,539
I'm not suing him.

683
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,579
Are you really on Yi Heon's side now?

684
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,880
Are you going to testify or something?

685
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,679
And what if I do?

686
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,250
Then we're all dead.

687
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,760
No, I mean...

688
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,789
If you testify that we're the assailants,

689
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,789
I'm saying that we can't just stay still.

690
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,429
We have no choice...

691
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,860
but to say that you made us do it, and that you led it.

692
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,400
You and I are both dead.

693
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,070
Is that a threat?

694
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,840
No, I mean...

695
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,710
- So let's sue him together. - Forget it.

696
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,710
I'm not going to do anything. That's that.

697
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,420
Hey, Jae Min.

698
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,719
Darn it.

699
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,289
Why isn't he teaming up with us?

700
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,510
Se Kyung told me...

701
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,210
his father transferred your case to the prosecution.

702
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,550
It must have been tough...

703
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,219
- for Se Kyung. - But...

704
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:49,789
I'm not going to come forward.

705
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,389
I never asked you to.

706
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,130
Why aren't you...

707
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,369
asking me to do so?

708
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,300
If I testify, you won't go to juvie,

709
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,440
and Byung Chul and Duk Jun will get arrested.

710
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,440
I heard my testimony is your only way out.

711
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,239
Why aren't you asking for it, then?

712
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,650
You have no other choice.

713
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,349
Are you going to go to juvie, then?

714
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,099
My father opened an instalment savings account.

715
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,869
Prepare for Tomorrow Instalment Savings.

716
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,940
It's my college tuition.

717
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:42,570
Yes.

718
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,510
I know I might not get into college with my grades.

719
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,710
But I should at least graduate high school...

720
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,949
if I want to go to college.

721
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,380
I'm sorry.

722
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,090
But I'm so scared.

723
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:17,670
You won't go to juvie.

724
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,949
A real adult...

725
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,789
helps the kids so they won't be miserable.

726
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,190
That's what an adult should do.

727
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,760
Also, you apologized to the wrong person.

728
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,829
When the real Yi Heon comes back,

729
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,570
apologize to him...

730
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,570
on your knees.

731
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:53,940
Have you eaten?

732
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,389
Mother is in the hospital because she is ill.

733
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,929
The housekeeper is staying with her at the hospital,

734
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,730
so this is all I've got.

735
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,969
This rice is freaking hot.

736
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,409
Do you want to get yelled at until you explode?

737
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,409
Just eat what you have.

738
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,130
Some say people don't change.

739
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,269
But I believe you'll be able to change.

740
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,139
So show me how different you can be.

741
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,849
Just like now, don't bully others.

742
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,909
Don's skip school.

743
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,449
And try to study hard.

744
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,719
As I told you many times,

745
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,619
you have to graduate high school to function...

746
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,760
as a human being.

747
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,059
Stop lecturing me.

748
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:22,159
You'd be the high school dropout if you get arrested.

749
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,340
I mean...

750
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,469
You're ruining dinner.

751
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,110
Why are you lecturing me when my parents wouldn't?

752
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,510
My tongue slipped because of you.

753
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,429
You don't have to send me off.

754
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,730
I'm on my way to visit my mother in the hospital.

755
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:09,909
Hey.

756
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,650
Why did you invite me for dinner?

757
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:18,920
It was because...

758
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,889
you looked hungry.

759
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Jae Min.

760
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,300
Do you know what is the thing...

761
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,670
you can't have more even if you want more?

762
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,539
And the thing you want to stop, but it won't?

763
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,409
It's time.

764
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:40,409
So, study when you still can.

765
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,610
You should go to college, right?

766
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,349
You said I could just graduate high school.

767
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,880
Are you an old fart or what?

768
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,889
I get that a lot.

769
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,159
Get home safe.

770
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,909
(Hong Jae Min started calling me a stalker.)

771
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:13,909
(I hate school. I'm tired of this.)

772
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,079
(I want to quit. I want to die.)

773
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,150
(Will I be able to be friends with anyone?)

774
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,389
(I don't know what it is to share the same feelings.)

775
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,159
(In the end, even my friends will abandon me.)

776
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,909
(To Se Kyung: "Pure EHC." Read it backward.)

777
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,150
"Pure EHC." Read it backward

778
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,179
(Yi Heon: "Pure EHC." Read it backward.)

779
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,650
Cheer up.

780
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,730
I heard about your father.

781
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,559
It's okay. It's not your fault.

782
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,170
What about you? Are you doing okay?

783
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,670
You'll be examined by the prosecution tomorrow.

784
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,570
There were a few goals...

785
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,980
I wanted to achieve before Yi Heon came back.

786
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,940
Escape school violence.

787
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,309
Protect Mother.

788
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,280
Get into university. And, make friends.

789
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,090
I failed to achieve anything,

790
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,320
but I made one friend at least.

791
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,090
So I'm glad.

792
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:38,889
What do you mean? You can still achieve all your goals.

793
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,360
I'll testify.

794
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,769
Come to think of it,

795
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,099
I saw Yi Heon getting bullied many times.

796
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,469
Move over. I'll show it to you.

797
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,210
- I didn't get to go. - Move over.

798
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,469
- I didn't get to do it. - Okay.

799
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,409
I knew you'd be good at it.

800
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,150
Don't worry.

801
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,050
I'm going to protect you.

802
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,090
For some reason,

803
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,320
my father's threats didn't hurt as much and were bearable.

804
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,989
It's all thanks to you.

805
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,030
I'm going to return your favour.

806
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,159
Don't push yourself too hard.

807
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,630
It's grownups' job to solve a difficult problem.

808
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:21,039
Also, as you know, Yi Heon is innocent.

809
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,510
"A friend."

810
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,090
"A friend." I like that.

811
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,030
What?

812
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,630
You used to hang out with your friends all the time.

813
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,929
Why do you come here so often these days?

814
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,730
I have no place to sleep over, so I'm going to sleep here.

815
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,170
What about the water? Did you get it back?

816
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,849
Some say people don't change.

817
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
But I believe you'll be able to change.

818
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:15,760
So, show me how different you can be.

819
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:30,869
Darn it.

820
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,639
Why the heck are you crying? It's annoying.

821
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,000
You're up.

822
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,570
Yes.

823
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,269
You look good today.

824
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,969
Do you want some water?

825
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,150
Well... I might...

826
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,880
have to go out today.

827
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,920
It won't take long.

828
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,889
Focus on getting better until I come back.

829
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,659
Is there a girl you have a crush on?

830
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,030
You're more built now.

831
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,769
A man gets fitter when he likes someone.

832
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,500
Your father was like that too.

833
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,670
He started playing golf and going to the gym after seeing that witch.

834
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,280
"That witch?"

835
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,849
That witch, Lee Mi Kyung.

836
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,449
Recently, he even bought her an apartment to live in.

837
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,250
But I don't know if she knows...

838
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,960
that it means to take it and bugger off.

839
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,429
I'm sure he's seeing some other witch already.

840
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,059
That's your father.

841
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,269
When was this?

842
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,369
Two years ago?

843
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,510
Do you know...

844
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,309
where it is?

845
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,420
It's Unit 2402, 1-dong, Hwi Castle Apartment, Jangpyeon-dong.

846
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,019
That's Lee Mi Kyung's place. Go and get her.

847
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:00,389
When Byung Chul and Duk Jun's clan sees that we got her,

848
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,519
they'll get flustered, and the investigation will go sideways.

849
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,309
(Byung Chul)

850
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,579
I'll do it. Where do I have to be?

851
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,690
When you're home, eat and take a shower.

852
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,519
Sleep at home from now on.

853
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Darn it.

854
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,949
(Prosecution Service)

855
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:58,130
Open it.

856
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,599
I really shouldn't.

857
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,869
- This is housebreaking. - Open it.

858
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,440
If you don't open it, you'll be in trouble right away.

859
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,480
Open it! Move over.

860
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,989
(Prosecution Service)

861
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,130
We got this.

862
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:44,449
She's not here.

863
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,679
It's indeed her place,

864
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,619
but it looks like it has been vacant for a while.

865
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:02,860
Come on out.

866
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,530
- I'm not leaving. - Come.

867
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,929
I said I'm not leaving!

868
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:06,940
How dare you?

869
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,550
Aren't you supposed to be at school?

870
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,679
No. It's right for me to be here.

871
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,519
I told you that I wouldn't mention your name.

872
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,960
Couldn't you understand what I said?

873
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,889
What the heck are you doing right now?

874
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,929
Can't you tell?

875
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:38,429
I'm stabbing in the back.

876
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:55,449
When I see those punks,

877
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,719
I can see why guilty ones should get punished.

878
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,719
And this way, I'll feel less unfortunate.

879
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,719
Apologize.

880
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,860
Song Yi Heon...

881
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,429
might be a victim of this case.

882
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:09,199
But what he did to you makes him an assailant.

883
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,500
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

884
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,329
I wanted to, but I couldn't get the chance.

885
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,170
I'm sorry about everything.

886
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,139
I really want to be your friend too.

887
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:17,969
I'll think about it.

888
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,739
And about Yi Heon,

889
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,110
- is he going to another school? - "Another school?"

890
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,409
I didn't pay much attention back then,

891
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:29,250
but he told me to take care of you when he was gone.
