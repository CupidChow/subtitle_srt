of taking one packet of pills,

But look at your score on the CSAT.

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,649
Mr. Kim, I know that
you're trying your best.

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,150
But your understanding of math...

26
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,479
is equivalent to that of a ninth grader.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,489
- You're quite slow.
- By the way,

28
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,449
how come I'm not
getting any better at math?

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,318
That's why I emphasized that
the basics were very important.

30
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,760
Sir, we got Kwang Soo!

31
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,730

If you're too busy to finish a lesson,

35
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,400
you'd be better off quitting.

36
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,409
Mr. Kim. You need time to study for exams.

37
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,339
Goodness, I'll still get a transfer
discount for my transit fare.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Seriously.

39
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,139
- Escort my teacher.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,509
All right. I'll be escorting you, sir.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,249
No. Taking the bus will
be more convenient for me.

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,989
- No. A long time ago, -
I can get the transfer too.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,188
My boss told me that
teachers were like the sky.

44
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,159
In other words, they should be respected.

45

Do you know how many

53
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,149

Let's say that you never
caught me. Just let me go. Yes?

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Gosh.

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,330
This way.

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,569
Hey.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Stay there.

61
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,270
Put that down.

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,109
You drew a knife on the
chairman to take over our gang...

63
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,110
to be in this mess.

64
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,830
Yet, you're pulling out a knife again?

65
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,218
On my teacher at that?

66
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,919
Hey, if you want your teacher to live,

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,449
you'd better step back. Got it?

- Dong Soo.
- Yes, sir.

- Yes, sir.

- Dong Soo.
- Yes, sir.

{\an8}There's an idiom, "Machuljeo."

116
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,388
{\an8}It means anything is possible...

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,860
{\an8}no matter how hard it may
be as long as you give it a try.

118

{\an8}So let's keep on trying hard. Okay?

119
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,699
Yes, sir. So this idiom,
"Machuljeo," must mean...

"Hey, man. Keep chewing on
a bone." Or something like that.

121
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,039

extensive is your study?

122

After mastering English,

123
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,086
you've mastered four-character idioms too.

Wait for him and drive him home.

128

Sir. Your teacher...

129

131

your teacher finished getting...

132
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,930
the IV drip and drive him home.

133
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,300
He'll quit like the others.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,009
Sir, since we're at the ER,
why don't you get treated too?

isn't a big threat even if he tried.

Why did you knock him out?

146
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,289
He went after my teacher...

147
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,320
I just couldn't let that slide.

148
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,659

149
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,710
How did you score on the CSAT?

150
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,959
This year doesn't look promising.

151
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,139
I've been training myself...

152
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,980
to pass the CSAT next year.

I'm somewhere between Grade 7 and Grade 8.

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You are?

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,459
Isn't that a big achievement?

157
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,029
Lee Se Dol is a 9-dan go
player. You say you have Grade 8.

158
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,730
Well, but with the CSAT,

159
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,299
Grade One...

160
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,870
is the highest rank.

161
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,009
Is that so?

162
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,250
Are you done, sir?

163
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,759
You guys should go home.

164
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,288
I'll go home after I make a round.

165
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,830

You do that when you
have a lot on your mind.

have been studying for the CSAT.

00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,210
if meat stays too long on the grill,

175
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,480
it gets burned and won't be edible.

176
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,888
As if competing against Sangduk Gang...

177
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,419
and Rotary Gang wasn't enough,

178
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,190
even Kwang Soo whom I considered family...

179
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,230
stabbed me in the back.

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,000
This is the world we live in.

181
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,299
We should...

182
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,570
flip the meat too.

183
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,809
Take over the gang.

184
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,179
You should...

185
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,009
run our gang, Chilsung Gang, now.

186
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,658
(Your subscription to our
science lectures will end...)

187
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,819
(in 13 days. Hurry up and
listen to the lectures now.)

188
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:28,690
Gosh.

189
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
What?

190
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,919
Hey!

191
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,750
Hey! You punk!

192
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,259
Hey!

193
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,639
Hey, you!

194
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,700
What's happening?

195
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,759
Am I dead?

196
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,029
What?

197
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,799
Why am I in so much pain?

198
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,970
That's right.

199
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,768
I'm Kim Deuk Pal, the number
two man in the Chilsung Gang.

200
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,840
There's no way I...

201
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,359
How come I don't have
any strength in my legs?

202
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
What happened to my leg muscles?

203
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,659
How could I lose my muscles?
How long have I been out for?

204
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,299
Am I dreaming?

205
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,899
Wait. This punk...

206
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,049
Right. It's that punk.

207
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,220
Yes. I wonder if that kid is doing okay.

208
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,540
What's wrong with my voice?

209
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,759
How can a dream be so vivid?

210
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,330
Get out of my way!

211
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,528
What is this? Why won't
you open the door for us?

212
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,428
Because you guys keep coming here.

213
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,798
I told you I would call the
police if you kept coming here.

214
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,070
- Jong Cheol.
- Yes. Get out here now.

215
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,638
You're not coming out? Get out here!

216
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,678
You killed a man! Have the guts to face us!

217
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,008
- I see. Dong Soo. Jong Cheol.
- We'll call the police.

218
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,648
Go ahead. Call the police.

219
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,820
You guys are taking care
of me even in my dream?

220
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,419
You'd better come out now. Or else!

221
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,759
Hey, Dong Soo.

222
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,070
Get up, you jerk.

223
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,470
You...

224
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,099
Hey, what are you doing? Have you gone mad?

225
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,918
Let go.

226
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,049
Stop goofing around and let go of me now!

227
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,850
Why can't I breathe?

228
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,019
I really might die at this rate.

229
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,730
This isn't a dream.

230
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,869
What? What happened?

231
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,200
You punk!

232
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,739
Our boss passed away, trying to help...

233
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,109
this ungrateful, selfish jerk.

234
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,769
Pass away? Who died?

235
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,639
I'll personally show you...

236
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,250
where my boss has gone now.

237
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,779
Hey!

238
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,149
Let go of me. Hey.

239
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,159
- What?
- Let go of me!

240
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,259
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

241
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,000
Tell him you're sorry...

242
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,099
and thank him...

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,039
for saving you.

244
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,940
You jerk!

245
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,519
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

246
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,689
Don't be absurd. I'm not dead.

247
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,690
How dare you have my
funeral when I'm still alive?

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,558
I'm not dead. Look at me. I'm alive.

249
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,660
Get this jerk out of here.

250
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,960
Why, you...

251
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
Hey.

252
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,400
You must not recognize
me in this way, but...

253
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,469
How would I not recognize you?

254
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,909
You're only alive thanks to my boss,

255
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,140
and you're not even grateful.

256
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,250
Instead, you're insulting the dead.

257
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,950
A jerk like you deserves to die.

258
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,049
Follow me.

259
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,950
Jong Cheol.

260
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Leave.

261
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,509
Just go, okay?

262
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,269
Sir...

263
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,009
Get out.

264
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,250
Get out, you!

265
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,390
Hey.

266
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:39,720
Get a refund for my burial site.

267
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,059
I'll come back alive.

268
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,059
Don't you dare come back!

269
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,300
Our boss should be the one to come back!

270
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,500
You ungrateful thing!

271
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,140
A funeral means my body is dead.

272
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,710
My spirit escaped from my body,

273
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,460
so of course they'd think I was dead.

274
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,279
I need to put my spirit back
into my body that's in the morgue.

275
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,920
- Then I'll wake up.
- Yes.

276
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,589
We are about to do it.

277
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,990
Of course, I will take
extra care of Mr. Kim.

278
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,829
Hey, kid.

279
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,859
You can't go in there.

280
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,730
Move before you get hurt.

281
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,079
Is Mr. Kim Deuk Pal your father?

282
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,690
Here.

283
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:51,599
It's cold, isn't it?

284
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,430
We will soon salt and casket him.

285
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,569
He will be turned to ash tomorrow morning.

286
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,689
Then you won't be able
to hold his hand anymore.

287
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,760
You need to say your last
goodbyes, so you don't regret it.

288
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,079
How can he come back to life?

289
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,849
I'm sure you know well.

290
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,450
How do you bring back the spirit...

291
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,279
and make him come back to life?

292
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,819
You've seen too many movies.

293
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:19,890
Will holding his hand work?

294
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
Or...

295
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,859
hugging him like this?

296
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,000
He's already gone.

297
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,199
Holding his hand and hugging him is no use.

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,230
He can't come back.

299
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,140
Unless you turn back time...

300
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,240
and go back in time.

301
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Fine

302
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,150
Let's go back in time.

303
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,578
If I get the same shock as that night,

304
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,579
I'll be able to go back.

305
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,390
Let's go.

306
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,470
Give me...

307
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,309
Give me the mirror.

308
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,380
Don't worry, kid. Your face is fine.

309
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:06,829
No.

310
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,970
How many days was I out for?

311
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,500
The funeral...

312
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,539
It's already over. Mr. Kim's funeral.

313
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,109
The big guys came looking
for you before the cremation.

314
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,779
They wanted you to plead for forgiveness.

315
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:26,880
That was already three days ago.

316
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,250
Go on and rest.

317
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,769
(Kim Deuk Pal)

318
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,485
(Boss Deuk Pal, I won't
forget you. Dong Soo)

319
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,539
Boss Deuk Pal,

320
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,779
I won't forget you.

321
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,390
Where could...

322
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,390
(Song Yi Heon)

323
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:39,819
this kid's spirit be at?

324
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,089
Is it not coming back because of me?

325
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,470
(Song Yi Heon)

326
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,740
I should get out for him, though.

327
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,750
The kid is young...

328
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,279
and needs to go to school.

329
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,870
I thought he was a middle schooler,
but I guess he's in high school.

330
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,819
Gosh, how will he ever...

331
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,559
lead a household looking like this?

332
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,500
Doesn't he even have a
family? Why isn't anyone coming?

333
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,140
Aren't you even going to say hello?

334
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
Hello, ma'am.

335
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,319
You...

336
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,519
Is this some protest?

337
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,289
I mean...

338
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,990
Do you and your mom
have something against me?

339
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,630
Why are you both...

340
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,569
harassing me all the time?

341
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,440
Why would you be there...

342
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,069
that late...

343
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:04,369
at night?

344
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,240
Your mom put you up to it, right?

345
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,039
Sure.

346
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,508
Did you think the chairman would come...

347
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,450
running to you if he heard about this?

348
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,589
Is this because you want attention?

349
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,789
Stupid...

350
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,559
She doesn't seem like his mother.

351
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,529
The way she's mentioning the chairman,

352
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,868
maybe she's on his side?

353
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,170
I'm tired of covering up for your mom.

354
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,970
Now it's you?

355
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,670
What's your problem?

356
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,069
You're so...

357
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,509
You're good for nothing.

358
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,950
What was that look?

359
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,589
How dare you look at me like that?

360
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,460
You brat.

361
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,190
I don't know why...

362
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,299
I have to take care of you.

363
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,869
Gosh, that lady and her temper.

364
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,680
Why did she come instead of his parents?

365
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,210
And who's the chairman?

366
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
I guess the boy has a
complicated life as well.

367
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,329
What? It unlocked.

368
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,039
Why did it lock again?

369
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,529
(Facial recognition starting)

370
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,008
Gosh, this must be that
facial recognition thing.

371
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,710
This thing should be great...

372
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,680
when studying.

373
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,579
(Why is Hong Jae Min doing
this? Leave me alone. I hate school.)

374
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,460
"December 20."

375
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,859
"Why is Hong Jae Min doing this?"

376
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,329
"Leave me alone. I hate school."

377
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,630
"I'm tired of this. I want to quit."

378
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,000
"I want to die."

379
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,769
"I hope I die and disappear."

380
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
That kid...

381
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,849
"Song Yi Heon's diary?"

382
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,950
(Folder)

383
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,020
(First, he told me to steal alcohol
from home. Then it was jewellery.)

384
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,920
First, he told me to
steal alcohol from home.

385
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,769
Then it was jewellery.

386
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,409
- Let me see.
- Hey.

387
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,330
I told him that there
was nothing else to steal,

388
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,548
and he said to steal
cigarettes from the store.

389
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,579
Let's go.

390
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,750
If I told him I didn't want to,

391
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,349
then there was violence.

392
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:07,789
Those unworthy brats...

393
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,990
(There is no way to be saved anymore.)

394
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,098
I thought my second year was ruined...

395
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,828
because we were put in the same class.

396
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,299
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

397
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,609
But I'm so happy that Se
Kyung is also in our class.

398
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,309
Choi Se Kyung. I want
to be friends with him.

399
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,640
It won't ever be possible, though.

400
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,849
I only looked at him because
I wanted to be friends,

401
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,519
but Hong Jae Min started
calling me a stalker.

402
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,420
I became known as a stalker.

403
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,730
Darn it. It's you.

404
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,069
Move it.

405
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,099
Now, the whole school is avoiding me...

406
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,069
and pointing fingers.

407
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,439
Look, this is ten points.

408
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,710
- Okay.
- Ten.

409
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,749
This is 8 points. This one is for 5.

410
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,009
- Good.
- Okay.

411
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,549
Shoot continuously.

412
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,118
Don't be slow.

413
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,750
- I'm going for the ten.
- Let's go.

414
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,720
- Gosh.
- Move over.

415
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,358
What was that? That was no fun.

416
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,390
Go.

417
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:17,889
Do it properly.

418
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,960
- Okay.
- Stand properly.

419
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,539
- I didn't get to go.
- Move over.

420
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,509
Why is Hong Jae Min doing this?

421
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,950
Please leave me alone.

422
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:38,750
I hate school.

423
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm tired of this.

424
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,390
I want to quit.

425
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,559
I want to die.

426
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,329
I hope I die and disappear.

427
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,440
Now I understand...

428
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,940
why I am in your body.

429
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,179
Let me borrow your
body so I can go to school.

430
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,680
But I'll destroy all of them...

431
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,480
so that you can live your life...

432
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,289
when you return.

433
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,859
That's my area of expertise.

434
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,789
Let's do this, Song Yi Heon.

435
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,200
Let's live your life.

436
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
I am now...

437
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,509
Song Yi Heon.

438
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,210
Who is it?

439
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,519
It's me, Kim Deuk...

440
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,019
I mean, Song Yi Heon.

441
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,799
Where's your bag?

442
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,509
Are you sure you can leave
the hospital this quickly?

443
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,409
By the looks of her age,

444
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,140
she doesn't seem to be his mother.

445
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,509
A maid?

446
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,420
I'll be treated as an outpatient...

447
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,390
Ma'am.

448
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,460
Did you tell the secretary
that you were let out?

449
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:29,759
- "Secretary?"
- The chairman's secretary.

450
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,588
That crazy woman.

451
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,000
Why would you be there...

452
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,430
that late...

453
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,699
at night?

454
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,099
Is she talking about that lady?

455
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,670
I have to tell that lady my whereabouts?

456
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,469
Who does she think she is?

457
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,709
I'll take of myself.

458
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,230
If you get on the wrong side with her,

459
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,309
she might come after your mother again.

460
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,380
So she's Yi Heon's mother.

461
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,219
There's no sign of a man here,

462
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,690
so he must not have a father.

463
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,259
His mother, this woman,

464
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,690
and that secretary lady.

465
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,299
I'll get used to this easily.

466
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,359
Do you want lunch?

467
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,430
Why are you asking?

468
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:12,640
Of course, I want lunch.

469
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,639
How am I supposed to
get my strength with this?

470
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,180
Don't you have a bigger bowl?

471
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:47,500
That accident must have
gotten back your appetite.

472
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Why is she sleeping in the living room?

473
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,009
Why do you think? She's drunk again.

474
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,508
That secretary has come over
many times since your accident.

475
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,420
And she brought over
carts of alcohol each time.

476
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,190
She must be trying to get her addicted.

477
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,118
The chairman's wife is
at the hospital these days.

478
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,659
If she passes away,

479
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,029
you're the only son he has.

480
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,058
She's scared that your
mother will take over the place...

481
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,268
as the legal wife of the
OK Construction chairman.

482
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,970
Song Yi Heon is the son of
the OK Construction chairman?

483
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,609
OK Construction...

484
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,838
is one of the top three in the country.

485
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,839
(OK Construction)

486
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,909
(OK Engineering and OK
Construction Cleared for Construction)

487
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,710
They say when the cat
is away, the mice will play.

488
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,348
The secretary is taking the
reins since the chairman is absent.

489
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,349
Even the driver is watching...

490
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,419
your mother these days.

491
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,019
I'm scared that she might...

492
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:44,359
Gosh, I've been talking too much...

493
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,450
when you've just
returned from the hospital.

494
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,768
Where is my bag?

495
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:51,029
I've told the driver to bring it up...

496
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,700
to your room.

497
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,279
- Thank you for the meal.
- Sure.

498
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,250
I get that his appetite
and behaviour can change,

499
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,848
but how can an accident...

500
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,849
even change the way he speaks?

501
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,190
That's weird.

502
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,230
A big house.

503
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,239
A credit card without a limit.

504
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,739
A driver for the car.

505
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,909
If that's all to watch over them,

506
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,210
then there must be no one
who can protect Yi Heon at home.

507
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,058
Shave my head.

508
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,829
No one shaves their head these days.

509
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,030
Shave it off.

510
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,598
If you shave it,

511
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,669
your school teachers won't like
it, thinking you're being rebellious,

512
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,550
and your friends will
get scared and avoid you.

513
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:02,769
I can shave it if you really want to.

514
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,010
Honourable teachers won't like it?

515
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,579
And the kids will avoid
me? That can't happen.

516
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,949
I'll get a sports cut, then.

517
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,448
It's not a "sports cut."

518
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,449
Only older guys say it
like that. It's a crew cut.

519
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:17,889
"Crew cut."

520
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,119
Yes, crew cut. Look forward.

521
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,300
Gosh, are these pants or stockings?

522
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,840
Sir.

523
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,609
Please widen the pant legs.

524
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,610
What?

525
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,840
I've never had a student
who wanted wide-leg pants.

526
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,308
Wide-leg pants will stand out tremendously.

527
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,320
Really?

528
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Then, I'll keep them like this...

529
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
to look like a student.

530
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,700
That kind of jacket must
be trending these days.

531
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,760
Are they trying to look like gimbap?

532
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,869
(Complete the Concept
of Middle-School Math)

533
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,480
What am I supposed to buy
when they all look the same?

534
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,760
Sorry about that.

535
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,469
Gosh. Why were you...

536
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,380
Be careful next time, all right?

537
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,789
That workbook is no good.

538
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,390
It has abstruse explanations
and challenging questions.

539
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,328
Of all middle-school-level math workbooks,

540
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,169
this is the best one to
build basic knowledge.

541
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,269
Thanks.

542
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,840
I haven't fully built the basic skills yet.

543
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,448
Try solving the problems
after completing this book.

544
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:57,650
It'll be easier to understand.

545
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,119
Hey, kid.

546
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,119
Are you free right now?

547
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,190
Math isn't the only
subject I have to work on.

(Workbook)

550
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,040
You should complete this one, at least.

(A Full Collection of the Previous CSATs)

552
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,239
Thank you.

553
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,010
Hey,

554
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,039
how do the kids these days study?

555
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,750
"The kids these days?"

556
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,550
They study hard, focusing
on the school textbooks.

557
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,590
"Geungojiyoung," right?

558
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,089
Well, it means...

559
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,518
"The roots need to be healthy
for the trees to be leafy."

560
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,489
It means basic skills are crucial.

561
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Hey,

562
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,559
you must be popular among young ladies.

563
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,070
Why do you talk like that, though?

564
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,730
Do you live with the elders?

565
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,469
What about the way I speak?

566
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,908
You speak just like how
an uncle would speak.

567
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:31,909
What?

568
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,579
Hey, kids these days speak like this.

569
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,050
Kids these days don't call me
"kid," or say words like "young lady."

570
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,849
It doesn't logically
make sense for a kid...

571
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,618
to call a kid, "Kid," does it?

572
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,849
Hey, look who's talking.

573
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:46,949
Why are you acting like this?

574
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,489
Sorry. I thought you were someone I knew.

575
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,400
Hey. How would I know you?

576
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,670
The age difference between you and me...

577
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,300
could be huge.

578
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,409
Anyway, thank you.

579
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:15,480
Study hard and listen to your mother.

580
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:18,019
Go home early. Okay?

581
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:34,139
He had a similar frame,

582
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,530
so I thought he was Song Yi Heon.

583
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,909
(Father: Where are you?)

584
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,030
I should have gone into a body like his.

585
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,260
It's not easy to become a student.

586
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,139
That part is good. Take care of this first.

587
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,510
Move.

588
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,510
Come here.

589
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,179
Try standing up.

590
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,050
Try moving around. Is it all right?

591
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,760
Excuse me.

592
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,390
You can deliver all
these to my house, right?

(Delivery Service, Free delivery

594
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,860
Mr. Yi Heon, aren't you getting out?

595
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,368
- Here?
- I always dropped you off here...

596
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,169
because you didn't want to
get out in front of the school.

597
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,170
I see.

598
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,610
From now on, drop me
off in front of the school.

599
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,440
By the way, the name on your name tag is...

600
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,178
(Kim Deuk Pal)

601
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:06,119
Gosh. Why did I make such a
mistake on the first day of school?

602
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:11,690
Okay.

603
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,101
I'm more nervous than on my first
day of elementary school back then.

604
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,679
Good morning, sir!

605
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,519
I like your greeting.

606
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,090
But where...

607
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
Where's your name tag?

608
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,460
There has been a small mistake on my part.

609
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,800
My apologies.

610
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,460
You punk.

611
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,305
I'll let it pass only because
it's the first day of school.

612
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,809
From tomorrow, I won't let you slide.

613
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,170
Go ahead.

614
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,539
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes.

615
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,780
Gosh. I like how polite he is.

616
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,849
Hey, you punks.

617
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:12,609
Watch and learn from him.

618
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,919
Gosh. Look at your hair...

619
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,888
and how pathetic your uniform looks.

620
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,690
What am I supposed to do with you?

621
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:22,359
Come to the teachers'
office during lunchtime...

622
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,030
to write a letter of apology.

623
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:25,989
What?

624
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,459
- Hey, I'll tell you after school.
- Okay.

625
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,630
- See you later.
- Bye.

626
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,369
That doesn't make sense.

627
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,090
Where am I supposed to sit?

628
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,980
I've never been to high school to know.

629
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,820
- From Horse 3 to Horse 1.
- From Horse 1 to Horse 3.

630
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:57,129
- From Horse 3 to Horse 5.
- From Horse 5 to Horse 2.

631
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,159
- What?
- What?

632
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,428
- You can't say that.
- Hey.

633
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,429
Hey, classmates.

634
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,570
Do I sit wherever I want?

635
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,245
Our seats haven't been assigned yet.

636
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,369
I see. Okay.

637
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,349
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

638
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,150
Gosh. Schools have gotten much nicer.

639
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,130
They even have an air conditioner...

640
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:28,860
and an air purifier.

641
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,760
The kids...

642
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,030
are the same.

643
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,530
Do you know him?

644
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,070
Is he a transfer student?

645
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,469
- He's hot, though.
- I think he's hot.

646
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,339
I feel like I've seen him before.

647
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,069
Right? He looks familiar to me too.

648
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,309
Quiet, everybody.

649
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:56,590
Se Kyung?

650
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,489
I'm Jung Eun Chae, your homeroom teacher.

651
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,590
You've seen me around, right?

652
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,299
- Yes.
- Yes.

653
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,000
Let's do our best together for a year.

654
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,829
I'll take attendance first.

655
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,300
- "Kim Dong Hee."
- Here.

656
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,539
- "Kim Hye Ji."
- Yes.

657
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,409
- "Park Dong Gyu."
- Here!

658
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,639
"Song Yi Heon."

659
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,469
I'm here, ma'am.

660
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,738
Is he Song Yi Heon,

661
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,348
the stalker bullied by the whole school?

662
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,049
- He was Song Yi Heon.
- "Song Yi Heon?"

663
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,319
Song Yi Heon that I know of?

664
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,879
- Song Yi Heon?
- That loser?

665
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,518
Did he look like that?

666
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,118
He always kept his head down...

667
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,689
and covered his face with his hair.

668
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,288
- The one with the bowl cut?
- His hair is different.

669
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:35,859
- Did he cut it? It looks good.
- Why?

670
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,030
Quiet, everyone.

671
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,029
- "Lee Sung Min."
- Yes.

672
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,429
Okay. "Choi Se Kyung."

673
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Here.

674
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,429
Lastly, "Hong Jae Min."

675
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,868
- Here.
- Though it's the first day,

676
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,768
- keep in mind that you're seniors.
- We got into the problematic class.

677
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:53,909
Exactly.

678
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,979
I'm going to tell Mom to
put me into another class.

679
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,650
- I'm leaving.
- Hey.

680
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,049
I was in the same class with Yi
Heon, Jae Min, and Se Kyung...

681
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,018
last year too, and it felt terrible.

682
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,749
Why are we in the same
class with them again?

683
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,089
- Gosh.
- Help Se Kyung,

684
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,690
who will be the interim class president.

685
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,689
- Okay?
- Yes.

686
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,730
Okay.

687
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,409
Song Yi Heon.

688
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,809
You jerk. Why did you ignore
my texts during the vacation?

689
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Why?

690
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,849
Did you miss me too?

691
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,319
What?

692
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,359
(Hong Jae Min)

693
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,260
I really wanted to see you,

694
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:44,489
Jae Min.

695
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,269
Hey.

696
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,639
Let go.

697
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,079
Gosh. Is there something
wrong with my eyes?

698
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,429
Are you laughing right now?

699
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,420
Hey, Jae Min. This jerk is laughing.

700
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:14,320
Is there something wrong with your head?

701
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,860
Yes. I...

702
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,699
hurt my head due to a fall.

703
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,869
And that helped me open my eyes.

704
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,360
I fell from a pedestrian overpass.

705
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,550
You pushed me, didn't you?

706
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,578
Why are you blaming me
when you fell on your own?

707
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,949
After all that bullying, we
can say that you pushed me.

708
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,590
You're the murderer.

709
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,860
You crazy bastard.

710
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:50,960
Let go.

711
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,939
Hey. Let's get it over
with and get back to class.

712
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,999
Throw your punch first.

713
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,680
I can't throw it first on a bunch of kids.

714
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,110
You punk.

715
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,079
You punk!

716
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,590
What? I can't throw him over.

717
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:20,289
He'd be no match for me
if I were in my actual body.

718
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,090
That's right, jerk.

719
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,158
You had me scared...

720
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,305
when you said to throw the first punch too.

721
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:29,158
I thought he turned into someone else.

722
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,099
- Exactly.
- Hey, Yi Heon.

723
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,799
Did you grow a pair all of a sudden?

724
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,738
Just beg for mercy like before,

725
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:35,968
saying you don't want to get beaten.

726
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,639
That's more like you.

727
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,050
I won't get beat down like this.

728
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:47,349
I'm Kim Deuk Pal, the number
two man in the Chilsung Gang!

729
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:50,949
What?

730
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,630
Gosh. I'm so slow.

731
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,199
- Gosh.
- What are you doing?

732
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,210
I don't like this body at all.

733
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,530
You didn't even stand a
chance. Let me fix you up.

734
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:38,976
{\an8}Why did you pretend you
didn't know me at the bookstore?

735
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,238
{\an8}Because you have exactly the same face,

736
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,939
{\an8}others might fall for it.

737
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,939
{\an8}Including your frame,
way of speaking, walk,

738
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,479
{\an8}smile, and eyes.

739
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,210
{\an8}Everything has changed...

740
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,848
{\an8}as if you're a different person.

741
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:51,550
{\an8}- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

742
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,018
{\an8}A moment ago, a kid took up the slack...

743
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,419
{\an8}while mentioning Chilsung Gang's Deuk Pal.

744
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,019
{\an8}I'm here to do the paperwork.

745
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,360
{\an8}I'm going to send you
overseas or to a boarding school.

746
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,719
{\an8}You are not Song Yi Heon, are you?

747
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,590
{\an8}How did you know?

748
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,659
{\an8}I'm Kim Deuk Pal, the
underboss of the Chilsung Gang.
