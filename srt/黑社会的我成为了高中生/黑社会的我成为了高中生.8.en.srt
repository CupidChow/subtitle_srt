Did I make you surprise?

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,909
I'm Seo Chil Sung.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm a brother of Yi Heon's
father, Kim Deuk Pal.

10
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,320
I think you've got the wrong person.

11
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,359
I'm sure he is Song Yi Heon.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,559
Do you want to deny
that he's Deuk Pal's son?

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,770
Or are you keeping it a secret
so that no one can know...

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,600
he's not Chairman Bae's son?

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,499
No. I don't know who Deuk Pal is.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Is it true...

17
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,439
that you just got out of a drug addiction?

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,048
He prevented you from getting kidnapped.

19
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,049
He was a victim of school violence,

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,719
but he was named as the bully instead.

21
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,949
So he went to the police station
and the prosecutors' office.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,760
With all that going on, he's
still here to take care of you.

23
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,649
Did you know about all those?

24
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,060
Parents have to be...

25
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,530
Parents have to be guards.

26
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,619
The guards who protect their children.

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,739
The children without these guards...

28
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,969
are destined to be unfortunate.

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,510
Learning to live alone early
in life doesn't do any good.

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,920
Get a hold of yourself.

31
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,250
If you don't,

32
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,920
you might also lose your kid.

33
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:58,859
Do you get that?

34
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,129
What is our nephew doing?

35
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,599
Children are sleepyheads.

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,409
Yes. They say kids like to sleep.

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,110
How old is he again?

38
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,979
Yi Heon is 19 years old.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,479
That means it was 19 years ago.

40
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,919
Deuk Pal was in Gangwon
Province 19 years ago.

41
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,849
So there weren't any girls around him.

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,990
If he saw an actress,

43
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,189
I would have remembered.

mention your name.

{\an8}Couldn't you understand what I said?

47

{\an8}Can't you tell?

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,620
{\an8}I'm stabbing in the back.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,889
{\an8}In these punks' backs.

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,930
{\an8}- Hey.
- There's a tablet PC.

52
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,770
{\an8}Its password is 808706.

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,581
{\an8}Hey, take it away from him.
If he opens it, we're doomed.

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,969
{\an8}What are you doing?

Yes. I'm Chief Prosecutor Choi Myung Hyun.

all the kids on here?

65
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,120
Eat it already.

66
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,889
Chew it.

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,019
Chew and swallow it.

68
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,660
I'm the assailant.

69
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,959
With them, I beat up Song Yi Heon,

70
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,629
mugged, and harassed him.

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,930
Yi Heon jumped off the
pedestrian overpass...

72
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,870
because of me.

73
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,810
Why did you do this?

74
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,689
I was the only one who knew
he carried his tablet PC in his bag.

75
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,490
In other words,

76
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,189
no one could reveal you
were a victim except for me.

77
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,689
If the truth wasn't revealed,

78
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,699
that pervert would have kept
bragging about it like a war trophy.

79
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,430
No.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,029
Why didn't you listen to me?

81
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,230
I said I'd give you a chance.

82
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,175
Your father started the instalment savings.

83
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,768
I gave you a chance to use it,
but why did you throw it away?

84
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,009
It felt gross that you were
going to be put behind bars.

85
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:41,209
I despise Se Kyung, but he was right.

86
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,279
When I see those punks,

87
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,820
I can see why guilty
ones should get punished.

88
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,019
And this way, I'll feel less unfortunate.

89
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,829
You punk.

90
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,970

92
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,800

and apologized sincerely.

Do you have the lawyer's number?

98
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,699
I called him earlier,

99

but the lawyer said he was pulling out.

100

Why is he making a fuss when
the rest were quiet? Seriously!

Apologize.

110
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,808
Why do I have to apologize?

111
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,409
Because you made Yi Heon an assailant...

112
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
and made him nervous by sending him here.

113
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,019
I didn't mention it to him, but
you almost blackmailed him.

114
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,279
Apologize to him.

115
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,720
Song Yi Heon might
be a victim of this case.

116
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,429
But what he did to you
makes him an assailant.

117
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,730
I made myself clear.

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,659
That you should stay away
from him to live a decent life.

119
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,469
We moved here because they said...

120
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,470
it had a good school
district, but it wasn't true.

121
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,370
I should have sent you
to a private high school...

122
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,039
so that you could make better
friends with similar backgrounds.

123

124
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,878
Okay. You'll transfer to
another school at once!

125
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,159
I'm not going to another school.

126
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,919
If you force me,

127
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,950
I'll drop out of school.

128
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,259
I'll study by myself.

129

be friends with Yi Heon.

For goodness' sake.

131
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,570
Do you want to get kicked out?
Do you want us to abandon you?

132
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,669
You might abandon me,

133
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,210
but I won't abandon you.

134
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,110

operated on? Are you okay now?

143
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,929
I'm okay.

145
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,669
This is the problem.

146
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,298
You hurt your shoulders before.

147
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,268
And you also hurt your head...

148
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,668
while fighting in Gangneung.
You laughed it out...

149

while getting treated
and taking medication.

150

This is why we can't assist you properly.

151
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,809
You lost weight too. In
fact, you look starving.

I've never been this
heavy in my life, though.

By the way,

154
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,830
have we ever met personally before?

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,070
My father said...

156
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:39,139
he was like a father to him.

157
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,710

isn't the Chilsung Gang, is it?

160
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,919
I can see why they say you were his son.

161
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,058
I went up to the ward to see you.

162
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,129
And your mother...

163
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,699

before she leaves.

00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,460
I got scared of fighting.

If a gangster gets
afraid, it's over for him.

172
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,339
Maybe that was why...

173
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,440
I hurried to pass down the
Chilsung Gang to Deuk Pal.

174
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,110
Right.

175
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,690

our Chilsung Gang would be...

177
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,559
But he is not here, is he?

178
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,190
You should let him go.

179
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,269
When I...

180
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,769
first heard of Deuk Pal's
son, I thought it was ridiculous.

181
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,539
He was the one who made
a scene at Deuk Pal's funeral.

182
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,509
Still,

183
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,610
I came with the thought
of checking him myself.

184
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,919
When I met you,

185
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,149
I found it even more ridiculous.

186
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,759
Look.

187
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,759
I tried to find a resemblance.

188
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,490
But you look nothing like him.

189
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,909
I thought my boys were
being fooled by a kid.

190
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,750
I carry all sorts of
talismans in my wallet.

191
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,378
In spring, I pay tribute in a temple.

192
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,850
I believe in folk religions,
ghosts, and superstitions.

193
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,289
But...

194
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I...

195
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,200
I don't know...

196
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,769
if I should be sad or happy...

197
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,669
about feeling your presence...

198
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,279
momentarily like this.

199
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,250
He knows that I'm Kim Deuk Pal.

200
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,220
We need to...

201
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,690
let go of the dead and move on.

202
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,830
I stayed until now...

203
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,559
only to protect this young kid.

204
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,470
Right.

205
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,399
Right.

206
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,670
Wasn't it because you
wanted to go to school?

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,789
By the way, are you getting good scores?

208
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,289
I'm somewhere between Grade 4 and Grade 5.

209
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,330
If you couldn't get good grades
when you did nothing but studying,

210
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,500
you're just not bright.

211
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,029
Sir.

212
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,669
It isn't easy to get a Grade One.

213
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,669
Is that so?

214
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,320
For me,

215
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,990
Deuk Pal was always Grade 1.

216
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
It feels like...

217
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,649
I'm losing my man twice.

218
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,590
Did something happen
between you and our nephew?

219
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,200
You stay here and help Deuk Pal.

220
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,759
Take your time.

221
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,379
Why do you keep on insisting?

222
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,210
She can't, right?

223
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,625
She'll be in big trouble if
she goes home now, right?

224
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,178
Didn't you just hear him?

225
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,819
This hospital's psychiatric
clinic doesn't allow long-term stay,

226
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,388
but they took me in...

227
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,166
because Yi Heon begged
them about it so much.

228
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,620
He said I should get
discharged from the hospital.

229
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,730
Also,

230
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,359
I did get much better.

231
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,130
I don't know. You can't leave.

232
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,868
Whatever. You go ahead and live here, then.

233
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm leaving.

234
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,140
Tell her that I can go home.

235
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,108
Even the doctor said it was okay,

236
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,608
but she just wouldn't let me go.

237
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,079
Yi Heon, she'll be in big trouble
if she goes home now, right?

238
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,849
Is it okay for her to go home?

239
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,289
She got much better.

240
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,358
She still needs to be treated for a while,

241
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,735
so you can come and see the doctor.

242
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,489
It's important for her to
register at a rehab centre...

243
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,788
to beat the temptation...

244
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,229
by talking a lot to the survivors...

245
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,759
who have overcome the addiction.

246
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,099
Okay. Please discharge her, then.

247
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
I'm going home.

248
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,250
What if Lee Mi Kyung, that
crazy witch, comes for you?

249
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,980
How can I stop her when she
wants to go home so much?

250
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,289
Also, she'll have to
return to society one day.

251
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,789
I'll try my best to take care of
the issue regarding Mi Kyung.

252
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,660
Why is he taking so long?

253
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,200
It was Mr. Kim's day off today.

254
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,390
It must take some time
for him to get ready.

255
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,269
There's a girl, for sure.

256
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,369
When a man has a
girlfriend, he speaks softly.

257
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,078
On top of that, you looked me in the eye...

258
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,309
while speaking coherently.

259
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,509
Who is this girl?

260
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,719
You are the one who should
become independent from Father...

261
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,390
and meet a nice guy.

262
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,759
I stayed home for 20 years.

263
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,900
It's been more than 20 years
since I made money myself.

264
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,298
Also, you need to go to college.

265
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,099
- If I leave him now...
- This is why...

266
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,670
you and Song Yi Heon...

267
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,809
couldn't say anything while
suffering from Mi Kyung.

268
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,710
Think about it.

269
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,380
Will Chairman Bae come
to Yi Heon's graduation?

270
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,049
Do you think he's a guy...

271
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,950
who will sit on the father's
seat at Yi Heon's wedding?

272
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,190
He didn't even register Yi Heon as his son.

273
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,359
In times of trouble, he
wasn't by your side...

274
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,230
or listened to you. Then
he's not your family, is he?

275
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,859
Consider becoming independent from him.

276
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,630
You can do it.

277
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,410
Why isn't he coming?

278
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,070
Do you want to grab a cab instead?

279
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,370
{\an8}(Participating in Berlin

280
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,759
Yi Heon.

281
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,869
You can go first. I'm going
to go and see Chairman Bae.

282
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,369
Think about how you could be independent.

283
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,769
Please take her home.

284
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,669
How are you going to see him?

285
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,039
You can't even reach him.

286
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,809
I think I know where to find
him, so I'm going to go and check.

287
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,509
Goodness.

288
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Yi Heon!

289
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:15,990
To the airport, please.

Where are you?

293
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,430
Actually, we talked to
the guys about the future...

294
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,599
and sent off some.

295
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,069
We are on our way to
meet you. Where are you?

296
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,309
Come to the airport.
Chairman Bae was in Berlin.

297
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,620
We can get Lee Mi Kyung once
we see Chairman Bae, right?

298
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,809
How did you find out?

299
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,149
We couldn't find him
though we tried so hard.

(Participating in Berlin

301
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,250
He will land in an hour.

302
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Push the gas hard to get
to the airport within an hour.

303
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,470
Let's meet with Chairman Bae...

304
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,329
and put an end to Lee Mi Kyung.

305
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,869
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.

306
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Se Kyung.

307
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,509
Why isn't Yi Heon coming to school?

308
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,710
Well, actually...

309
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,950
Don't tell me...

310
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:17,750
he's trying to avoid apologizing to Min Ji.

311
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,619
Why isn't he coming
after saying her face is big?

312
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,190
Your face is not big. You know that, right?

313
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,559
Actually...

314
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,630
Please come closer.

315
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,730
Yi Heon was investigated
by the prosecution.

316
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,029
What?

317
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,140
Was it because Byung
Chul's clan filed a complaint?

318
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,768
Our teacher said he was
absent due to a family issue.

319
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,369
- Was that a pure lie, then?
- Gosh.

320
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
How's Yi Heon?

321
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Is he all right?

322
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes. Thanks to Jae Min's help.

323
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,848
I'm jealous of Yi Heon.

324
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,018
He has friends like you
who worry about him.

325
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,289
So how did it turn out?

326
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,529
Was Jae Min's help no use?

327
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,459
Did Yi Heon get arrested?

328
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,758
No. He is the victim.

329
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,130
The assailants were arrested.

330
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,098
Yi Heon told me he
wouldn't come to school...

331
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,539
to visit his mother in the hospital.

332
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,670
By the way,

333
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,098
why did Jae Min help Yi Heon?

334
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,910
I know. He bullied Yi Heon all the time.

335
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:18,809
Why help him now?

336
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,279
This is the Prosecutors'
Office. My workplace.

337
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,289
How dare you get into a fight here?

338
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,619
Were you born to humiliate me?

339
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,959
Come, everyone.

340
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,130
(Prosecutor's Room)

341
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,500
Follow me.

342
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,640
Why didn't you listen to me?

343
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,109
I said I'd give you a chance.

344
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,209
Your father started the instalment savings.

345
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,910
I gave you a chance to use it,
but why did you throw it away?

346
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,519
I know. He got bullied so much, but...

347
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,589
Have you ever had a friend...

348
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,890
who suddenly felt like a grown-up?

349
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,528
That their personality and how
they speak changed completely...

350
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,589
like a different person?

351
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,230
As if they have a dual personality.

352
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,730
Have you had anyone like that?

353
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,339
- I have.
- Me too.

354
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,970
You know Ji A from Class A, right?

355
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,608
She has a dual personality.

356
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,808
When she's with us,
she's such an extrovert.

357
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,779
But when she goes out with
someone, she turns into an introvert.

358
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,690
That's dual personality, right?

359
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,890
Byun Ji Hye, the popular one
who sang at the school festival.

360
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,288
Wonder of Born Boys is the same.
He has a severe dual personality.

361
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,329
But it's not just on a special
occasion or to a specific person.

362
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,959
What if they are like that to
everyone in every situation?

363
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,298
He looks just like the one
I know from the outside,

364
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,298
but he talks and behaves
like a different person.

365
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,970
That's not a dual personality.
That's being possessed.

366
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,769
I know well about it because
I'm into "DOD" these days.

367
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:58,809
"DOD."

368
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,608
It's a web-based novel
called "Debut or Die."

369
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,649
I see.

370
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,449
The soul who couldn't leave
behind the way he spoke...

371
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,219
and his lifestyle and behaviour...

372
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,019
goes into someone else's body...

373
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,690
and lives with that body.

374
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,318
That soul can really
be that of an adult, then.

375
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,529
That's right.

376
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,828
Like in "DOD,"

377
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:20,058
an ordinary student who
failed the national exam...

378
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,899
wakes up to find himself as an idol.

379
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,569
Or an ordinary employee suddenly
becomes a prince of a divine land.

380
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,769
That means a grown-up can be a kid too.

381
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,079
Does it make its title,

382
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,049
"High School Return..."

383
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,379
"of a Grown-Up?"

384
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,279
No. If he's an ordinary
grown-up, it's no fun.

385
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,450
Well...

386
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,858
What if a grown-up gangster
becomes a high school kid?

387
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:48,889
- What?
- Nice.

388
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,358
"High School Return of a Gangster."

389
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,059
- Nice. Yes.
- Sounds fun, right?

390
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,559
I like it.

391
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,099
By the way, who got possessed?

392
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,710
Goodness. Whenever I
smell the scent of Korea,

393
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,779
I crave seolleongtang
with lots of kkakdugi in it.

394
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,449
Mr. Jeon, since you won one contract,

395
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,819
have one piece of kkakdugi.

396
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,588
Mr. Goo, you also won one
contract, but it was a significant deal.

397
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,118
So you can have all the kkakdugi you want.

398
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,130
Thank you, sir.

399
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,859
I'll keep an eye on how
much kkakdugi you eat.

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,569
Girls, you can eat whatever
you want as much as you want.

401
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
At the Gate One...

402
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,640
(Lawyer Park)

403
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,509
How did it go with Song Yi Heon?

404
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,308
Were those students the assailants?

405
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,979
One kid made a testimony.

406
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,509
I told you not to let him walk free.

407
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,650
Then that punk will...

408
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,049
He will put me in jail.

409
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,849
Of course, he walks free. He's the victim.

410
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,929
I'm not going to defend
them, so don't call me.

411
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,559
Gosh. I made myself clear...

412
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,130
and told them to get rid of any problems.

413
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,129
The Dongsoo Gang and those school punks...

414
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,700
are both useless.

415
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,410
Mi Kyung, which seolleongtang
place are we going?

416
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,240
I don't think she'll be
able to find a place.

417
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,079
Because she'll get busy soon.

418
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,430
What's wrong with him?

419
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,289
Sir.

420
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,029
The Chinese food is good
around here, not seolleongtang.

421
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,240
So, do you care to join me in
having a bowl of jjamppong...

422
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,970
in a quiet room?

423
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,339
You.

424
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,809
You, Song Yi Heon.

425
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,849
Instead of calling me, "Song Yi Heon,"

426
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,250
you should call me "Son," shouldn't you?

427
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,420
Chairman Bae...

428
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:00,859
of OK Construction.

429
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,209
I can explain everything
to Chairman Bae later.

430
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,700
He'll understand me.

431
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,340
He's not going to abandon me, is he?

432
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,380
Gosh. For goodness' sake!

433
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,480
When I saw you five years ago,
you looked like a skinny beggar.

434
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,680
Did you get a makeover somewhere?

435
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,819
I have always looked good in any clothes.

436
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,829
I guess you've never
observed Yi Heon right.

437
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,630
It sounds like you're blaming me.

438
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,529
I think I've been nothing but good to you.

439
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,200
"Jirokwima."

440
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:21,940
What?

441
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
{\an8}It's as if you're pointing at a
deer and saying it is a horse.

442
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,109
{\an8}You're insisting that you're
a father when you're not.

443
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,210
Haven't you heard that
Song Yi Heon had become...

444
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,829
an assailant of school violence,
that he called your company...

445
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,619
so many times, and that
the police are looking...

446
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,019
for his father?

447
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,660
Mi Kyung will handle them.

448
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,430
Sir.

449
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,328
Do you know what kind of person she is?

450
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:49,169
She drugged my mother...

451
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,499
and made Yi Heon an
assailant of school violence case.

452
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,599
To take your legal wife's
place once she dies,

453
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,039
she ordered gangsters to kidnap my mother.

454
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,410
What are you talking about?

455
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,109
Sir, those are all lies!

456
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,950
It doesn't make sense.

457
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,480
How would I dare to hurt your son?

458
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,219
While you didn't play the part as a father,

459
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,519
Yi Heon lived in pain because of her.

460
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,660
Sir.

461
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,960
It's me, Mi Kyung.

462
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,600
Since I was hired as your secretary,

463
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,029
I worked for you for over ten years,

464
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,269
cleaning up the mess your
wife, Song Mi Sun, and he made!

465
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,900
We've been great for many years.

466
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,309
You said I was the only one you got.

467
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,100
Seeing how much you
got worked up, it's all true.

468
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,288
If what you did with the
kidnap and the drugs...

469
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,449
are revealed in connection
to the OK Construction...

470
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,289
Don't you know it's fatal?

471
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,900
Wrong place!

472
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,430
You kneel here.

473
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,500
You have to apologize to me.

474
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,769
What are you waiting for?

475
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,710
Goodness.

476
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,779
It slipped.

477
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,420
From now on, never come
near Mother and Song Yi Heon.

478
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,859
If not, I might really bury you in cement.

479
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,099
You.

480
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,298
You knew what Mi Kyung feared the most...

481
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,099
was getting abandoned by me.

482
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,210
So this is how you're
getting back at her, isn't it?

483
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,078
Yes. That's my boy.

484
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,119
I'll register you as my son.

485
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,819
Did you sleep through the Korean class?

486
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,770
Don't you know the
meaning of raising someone?

487
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,558
To raise is to grow
it by taking care of it.

488
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,630
You help...

489
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,569
a child so that he can grow
into a good, truthful adult.

490
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,839
That is the meaning of raising a child.

491
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,980
If you were to abandon
him once you don't need him,

492
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,210
you can't call yourself a parent.

493
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,029
Right. Good job.

494
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,269
I think we're done
here. You can leave first.

495
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,339
I'll go home after I make a round.

496
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,950
You guys should go home.

497
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,909
I'll go home after I make a round.

498
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,619
You stay here and help Deuk Pal.

499
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Take your time.

500
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:33,259
Do you still read "alligator" as "arigato?"

501
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Who...

502
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:37,989
in the world are you?

503
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,630
Dong Soo. You already know everything.

504
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,109
Did you get home safely?

505
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,220
I stopped by a park on my way home...

506
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,450
because it was nice and sunny.

507
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:05,960
Chairman Bae said he'd
register me as his son.

508
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,930
But I said no.

509
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Is it okay?

510
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,440
It caught me off guard,
but I'm not in shock.

511
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,609
It's nice to enjoy the
sunlight after a long time.

512
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,319
Actually, I...

513
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:34,980
want to act.

514
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,960
Do you think I can be an actress again?

515
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,430
Of course, you can. I'll help you.

516
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:47,900
I have to take care of some stuff,

517
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,029
so you should go to bed first.

518
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,920
How does it feel to be back?

519
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,920
For me,

520
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,960
Deuk Pal was always Grade 1.

521
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,119
Many things...

522
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,420
have changed.

523
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:18,960
I sort out the bullies.

524
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,159
I made friends.

525
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,090
I punished Lee Mi Kyung
and protected Mother.

526
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,800
I think I've done
everything I promised you.

527
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,400
Aren't I amazing?

528
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,620
Don't talk about killing yourself anymore.

529
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,670
Live fully as Song Yi Heon.

530
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,650
So that my efforts won't go to waste.

531
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,679
You didn't get into college.

532
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,909
That's...

533
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,750
because you came back too early.

534
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,078
After deciding which
college and major you want,

535
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,489
you should go to college.

536
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,019
How much time...

537
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,190
do we have?

538
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,260
A week.

539
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,099
After a week,

540
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,869
I'll return to my place, then.

541
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,510
I'm glad I can prepare myself for it.

542
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,949
I'll get things in order and
hand them over properly.

543
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,239
Don't forget that you're a
senior. Focus on studying.

544
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,630
(Dong Soo)

545
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,059
Why aren't you picking up?

546
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,599
Are you avoiding him?

547
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,849
Are you going to leave
him without telling him?

548
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,980
Aren't you going to tell Se Kyung either?

549
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,119
If I try to explain it to Se
Kyung, he'll know who I am.

550
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,719
Well...

551
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,719
He doesn't have to feel sad
because of an old guy, does he?

552
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,630
Even at this age,

553
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,199
it's hard to say goodbye.

554
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,010
(Hansong High School)

555
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,940
Hey, are you all right?

556
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,010
I was worried about you.

557
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,480
Did you hear it from Se Kyung?

558
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,650
Everything is okay now.
Those boys will go to juvie.

559
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,260
I know you had a tough time,

560
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,789
but Min Ji won't forgive you easily.

561
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,698
You told her she had a big face.

562
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,779
Do you know how hard it
was to comfort her that day?

563
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,869
Wait. When did I say Min Ji had a big face?

564
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,440
I just said Seol Hee's face was smaller.

565
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,909
Hey, that's the same thing.

566
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,780
Well, what I meant to say was...

567
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,619
Though it's true that Seol
Hee has a smaller face,

568
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,090
she's not my type.

569
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,789
I like the ones with
well-defined features Min Ji.

570
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,489
That's my type.

571
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,530
Okay.

572
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
I'll accept your apology
because I'm awesome.

573
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,239
We'll be watching you.

574
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,170
You really should watch your mouth.

575
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,179
Don't worry.

576
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,250
A proper high school student who speaks...

577
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,579
much nicely will be here.

578
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,810
- What is he talking about?
- Whatever.

579
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,960
Hey, why didn't you answer my calls?

580
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:51,469
Sorry, I was all over the place.

581
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,239
What happened?

582
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,830
This isn't the right
place to talk about it.

583
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,170
Come.

584
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,090
Hey. You're possessed, aren't you?

585
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,889
I mean you look the same.

586
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,840
The DNA test result also
said you were Song Yi Heon.

587
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Your soul went into Yi
Heon's body, didn't it?

588
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,969
Hey, how would I know?

589
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,480
I didn't know what happened to me either.

590
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,780
So, I'm just going with the flow right now.

591
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,190
Hey. The teacher called me.

592
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:44,849
I should get going.

593
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,530
Hey.

594
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,698
(For using violence against
classmate, 5 seniors are expelled.)

595
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,269
- They deserve to be expelled.
- They're finally kicked out.

596
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,030
What they did calls for an expulsion.

597
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,840
I wanted them to be expelled.

598
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,559
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

599
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,199
Actually,

600
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,969
for spreading...

601
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,340
the rumour that you bullied others,

602
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
and for telling Se
Kyung's father about you,

603
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,159
I wanted to apologize, but
I couldn't get the chance.

604
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm sorry about everything.

605
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,579
Take your phone out.

606
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,190
Erase Se Kyung's father's number...

607
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:52,860
and apologize to Se Kyung too.

608
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,090
(Se Kyung's father)

609
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:58,851
(Do you want to move
this contact to trash?)

610
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,630
Be nice to Se Kyung when I'm gone.

611
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,769
Don't treat him like a servant.

612
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,739
Be sincerely nice to him...

613
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,670
as his friend.

614
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,679
Can I be friends with you too?

615
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,619
Forget it.

616
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,719
You and Yi Heon don't have the same vibe.

617
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,300
Now, you can order everything you want.

618
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,329
Should we get a couple's combo?

619
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,299
(A couple's combo)

620
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,340
Yes. Sure.

621
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,610
One couple's combo, please.

622
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:45,769
Please enjoy.

623
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,289
If we're having a couple's combo,

624
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,590
does it make us a couple?

625
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,530
No. You can order it
when you're not a couple.

626
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm saying that I have feelings for you.

627
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,070
What?

628
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,050
Thank you.

629
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,449
Can you...

630
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:31,289
wait for two days?

631
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,659
I'll give you an answer in two days.

632
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,559
In two days?

633
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,800
Okay. I'll wait, then.

634
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,170
How could you...

635
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,440
pass along such a thing to me?

636
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm not passing along anything.
The decision was yours to take.

637
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,879
Going out with a girlfriend
and making new friends.

638
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,480
They are all for you to decide.

639
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,469
It's because it's your life.

640
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,760
Tomorrow is your last day.

641
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,230
Shouldn't you spend the
last day with Se Kyung?

642
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,099
He must be waiting for
you to tell him the truth.

643
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:20,769
It'll be better...

644
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:23,769
if he doesn't know.

645
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,119
(Dong Soo)

646
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,940
What time did you get in last night?

647
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,039
I had a part-time job.

648
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,885
A part-time job? You're
a high school senior.

649
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,340
Are you out of your mind?

650
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,226
I can still get into a good college
even if I have to work part-time.

651
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,849
And I get the feeling I must be
financially independent from you,

652
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,488
so you will come to acknowledge
my independence sooner.

653
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,489
Acknowledge?

654
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,035
Do you really expect me to
acknowledge your independence...

655
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:18,030
when you're still
friends with that lowlife?

656
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,929
He's not a lowlife. His
name is Song Yi Heon.

657
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,738
Besides, he's my best friend.

658
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,239
Don't speak badly of him.

659
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,280
I'm going to work.

660
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,510
I'm here to apologize.

661
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,340
I didn't know you were capable of that.

662
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,690
Song Yi Heon told me to apologize to you.

663
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,158
He said I should genuinely
treat you like a friend,

664
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,389
instead of trying to use you.

665
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,329
I really want to remain friends with you.

666
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,500
I'll think about it.

667
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,210
By the way, it's about Song Yi Heon.

668
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,510
What about him?

669
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,960
Is he transferring to another school?

670
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:45,849
Transfer?

671
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,719
I didn't think much of it then.

672
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,789
But he asked me to take care of you...

673
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,619
once he was gone.

674
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,349
What's wrong?

675
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,309
Are you back?

676
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,889
Is Yi Heon back?

677
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,110
He came back, but you didn't
tell me on purpose. Isn't that it?

678
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,960
When you knew how worried I had been!

679
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,699
Let's go.

680
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,769
I'll give you the answers
to all of your questions.

681
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,519
What are we doing here?

682
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:57,988
You said you would give me answers.

683
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:00,059
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

684
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,389
That's me.

685
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,428
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

686
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,659
"Kim Deuk Pal."

687
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,929
You were born in 1977.

688
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:14,300
Yes, I'm dead.

689
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,238
I tried to save Song Yi Heon...

690
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,969
when he jumped off the pedestrian overpass.

691
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,139
I think that's when my spirit
went into Song Yi Heon's body.

692
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,180
I guess it's similar to a spirit...

693
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:25,909
taking over a body.

694
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,760
So physically, you're dead.

695
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,340
But once Yi Heon's spirit comes back,

696
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,630
you have no place to go.

697
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,530
I don't.

698
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,030
Naturally, I'll die.

699
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,300
That's why I couldn't tell you.

700
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:51,289
I thought that once Yi Heon came back,

701
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,440
the joy of seeing your friend again...

702
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:56,980
might be able to make
the sadness go away...

703
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,649
because we would look the same.

704
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,489
Then why are you telling me the truth now?

705
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,519
You would have
definitely tried something...

706
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,710
after hearing everything from Jae Hoon.

707
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:11,030
You would have probably tried
to verify that the real Yi Heon...

708
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,389
came back.

709
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,199
Just like now.

710
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,639
Just like now?

711
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,239
Song Yi Heon is back.

712
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:55,969
Are you really...

713
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:58,269
Yi Heon?

714
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,010
Can Se Kyung also see his spirit?

715
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,280
(Emergency transport)

716
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:24,500
That's why on the bus...

717
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,809
I'm craving a shot of
soju on a day like today.

718
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,170
My dear nephew.

719
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,538
Why have you been dodging our calls lately?

720
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,678
He wanted to come and see you,

721
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,439
but I stopped him because I thought
you were studying for your exam.

722
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,760
I told him that you would call
him once the exam was over.

723
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,348
But funny running into you here.

724
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:48,349
We must have been...

725
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,649
on the same "website."

726
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,719
Gosh.

727
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:53,889
You mean "on the same page."

728
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,989
Don't you remember?
Our boss told us to study.

729
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:03,300
"On the same page."

730
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:05,969
Let's go and have soju.

731
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,579
Sir. Is it okay for a student
to drink soju, though?

732
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,820
Let's go.

733
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,050
I only brought two bottles.

734
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,230
That night,

735
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,950
you decided to jump off
the pedestrian overpass.

736
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,599
That's all my fault.

737
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,809
I didn't want to get hurt.

738
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,949
So I pushed you to the overpass.

739
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,820
I sincerely want to apologize to you.

740
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,420
I'm really scared.

741
00:51:58,289 --> 00:51:59,389
I feel suffocated.

742
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,730
Could you help me?

743
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,599
I know you can help me.

744
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,030
Why should I get involved?
This is your problem.

745
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,538
Tell your parents.

746
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:16,299
Or if you can't, transfer
to another school.

747
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:20,510
No. Transferring to a new
school won't solve anything.

748
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,909
I made up my mind.

749
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,195
I'll report them to the
school violence committee.

750
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:29,659
I'll also report them to the police.

751
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,959
So I'll make Jae Min and his
friends face criminal punishment.

752
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,989
So...

753
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,960
could you tell your father?

754
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,730
Your father is a prosecutor.

755
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,570
No.

756
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,409
To tell you the truth, I was
angry when I saw you that night.

757
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,909
"Why can't he fight back?"

758
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,139
"I helped him. But why
is he being so pathetic?"

759
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,510
Then I realized that I couldn't
fight back to my dad just like you.

760
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,569
Seeing you getting beaten
up, unable to fight back...

761
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,949
reminded me of myself.

762
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:10,829
I think that made me angry.

763
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:13,329
Then...

764
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,300
I will expose your true
nature to other people.

765
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,669
You are kind to them.

766
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,099
You act cheerful and smile at them.

767
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:23,869
But that's all fake.

768
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,150
What's your point?

769
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,050
When Jae Hoon broke his
ankle in the gym that day,

770
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,479
you were the first one
to see him. I'm sure of it.

771
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,080
But you acted as if you didn't see that.

772
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,360
Jae Hoon might think
of you as a true friend.

773
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,519
But you don't.

774
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,429
You just despise and hate people.

775
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,960
That's who you are.

776
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:54,070
No one had seen my
worst side except for you.

777
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:59,070
For the first time, I
felt like I was naked.

778
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,110
So I might have been harsher
on you than I wanted to.

779
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,010
I'm sorry.

780
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:07,849
No.

781
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,989
I was cruel to you that night too.

782
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,289
But still. I shouldn't
have been mean to you...

783
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,060
when you were desperately
asking for my help.

784
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,099
Please help me.

785
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm begging you.

786
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,469
If you tell your father,

787
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,739
they might...

788
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,309
confess what they've done.

789
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:39,379
When I reported them for school violence,

790
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,880
you said they didn't bully you.

791
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,389
Part of it is your fault.

792
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,989
No. It's all your fault.

793
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,190
Se Kyung.

794
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,559
This isn't your fault.

795
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:02,699
It would have been
great if I could fight back...

796
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,329
just like Mr. Kim Deuk Pal or the new you.

797
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:09,239
Facing my problem head-on...

798
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,969
would have been nice even if I failed.

799
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,579
Back then, I had no idea
what I was supposed to do.

800
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,280
But now, I know.

801
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,920
I learned it from Yi Heon.

802
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,760
I'll be the one helping you, not my father.

803
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,190
And I'll be your true friend.

804
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Yes.

805
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,130
Don't let your father hurt you anymore.

806
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,239
Hang in there.

807
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:44,369
I forgive you.

808
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:48,679
No. I've already forgiven you.

809
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:56,079
Thank you for telling
me that you would be...

810
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,849
my friend.

811
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,049
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

812
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,250
"I'm Deuk Pal."

813
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,349
"I'm your boss."

814
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,219
Why didn't you tell me?

815
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:33,150
I'm already dead.

816
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,959
I didn't want there to
be a second funeral...

817
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:38,829
for my dead spirit.

818
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,130
That would have been
too cruel for you guys.

819
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,730
Dong Soo.

820
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,070
Thank you for staying loyal to me...

821
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,329
for all these years.

822
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:29,980
I was happy...

823
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,050
that I got to work under you, sir.

824
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,820
In whatever body or form you come back,

825
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,219
I will never forget you.

826
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:13,789
You should go now.

827
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,320
You must go first for me to leave at peace.

828
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:20,559
Out of...

829
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,829
all the people I've met, you
were the most admirable friend...

830
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,170
and adult.

831
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:30,739
A friend I wish I had by my side.

832
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,679
A dear friend like that.

833
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,880
I was happy that you were my friend too.

834
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:43,949
You can be a much better adult than me.

835
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,789
Don't doubt yourself
and keep pushing forward.

836
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,929
Your parents must be waiting.

837
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,389
Sir, you should go back.

838
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,090
Go back where?

839
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,329
You know where to go.

840
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,260
I don't have any desires left in this life.

841
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,480
When I jumped off the pedestrian overpass,

842
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,739
I had let go of everything.

843
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,900
But still.

844
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,139
I can't steal your life.

845
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,239
I'm tired.

846
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,650
I don't have any
energy left to live my life.

847
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,949
But thanks to you,

848
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,389
I was happy to see a smile on my face.

849
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,630
If someone could be happy in my body,

850
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,269
that would be enough to make me happy.

851
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,809
- Hello.
- Hello.

852
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

853
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:08,960
You really are the school president.

854
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,489
You are still popular.

855
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,130
What are you still doing here?

856
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,500
We go to the same school.

857
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:17,670
Isn't it natural to run into each other?

858
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,869
No. Wasn't your first
period your major class?

859
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:25,170
I was watching the soccer game
late last night. So I overslept.

860
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,239
It's not too late. Attend the class now.

861
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,440
Hey, it's already too late.

862
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,150
How could you still act like
my tutor even in college?

863
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,349
This guy completely changed
now that he's in college.

864
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:40,690
Yi Heon should have stayed, not you.

865
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,030
Hey, do you want to go
on a group blind date?

866
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,729
I need to study for my exam.

867
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,869
Hey. Youth is there to be enjoyed.

868
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:56,940
That old saying only worked
when you went to school, old man.

869
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,109
Kids these days are busy...

870
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,468
learning foreign languages
and improving their skill set.

871
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,629
How come you're the only
one, taking it easy, old man?

872
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,550
Hey, let's go to Jong
Cheol's cafe and study there.

873
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,379
We can have a cup of coffee.

874
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,549
You want to hang out with
the uncles again, don't you?

875
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,619
Hang out with them?

876
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,448
They want to take the GED,

877
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,389
so I'm going there to help them. You know?

878
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:15,760
Gosh.

879
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,558
- Do you want to come with me?
- Forget it.

880
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,658
Come on. Let's go.

881
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:22,030
- Come with me. Let's go.
- I have to study.

882
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:25,669
Hey. Why don't we go and have makgeolli?

883
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,350
We can go to a bar in front of the school.

884
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,369
How about makgeolli? Yes?

885
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,340
(Thank you for watching High
School Return of a Gangster.)
