7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,589
Hey, Yi Heon. Did you
grow a pair all of a sudden?

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,600
{\an8}Just beg for mercy like before,

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,928
{\an8}saying you don't want to get beaten.

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,570
{\an8}That's more like you.

11
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,539
{\an8}I won't get beat down like this.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,009
{\an8}I'm Kim Deuk Pal, the number
two man in the Chilsung Gang!

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,149
Seriously.

14
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,820
- Hey.
- What was that?

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,719
Let's go.

16
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,409
Darn it.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,829
You... Are you back?

18
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,269
Don't do anything with my body.

19
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,400
You're a dead man.

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,780
Once your spirit leaves my
body, I'm going to die soon after.

21
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,509
So just forget about me and leave.

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,510
You little...

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,349
I saved your life. And
that's what you tell me?

24
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,218
Well, too bad. I don't know
how to leave your body either.

25
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,059
I have to stay in your
body until I can leave.

26
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,829
Don't worry.

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,069
I'll do my best...

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,409
to keep your grades up.

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,809
Besides, I'm a good fighter.

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,180
We should teach Hong Jae
Min a lesson for bullying you.

31
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,569
I got beaten up because
I'm not used to your body yet.

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
As for your grades...

33
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,566
Gosh, I'll make sure you get into college.

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,759
I'll make friends...

35
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,759
and protect your mother too.

36
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,860
Even if you try, my life won't change.

37
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,430
It's all pointless.

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,439
You just watch.

39
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,339
The version of Song Yi Heon
Kim Deuk Pal shapes up...

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,509
will be really cool.

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,960
You can come back when
I'm done and live your life...

42
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,389
Gosh. Darn it.

43
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,699
Was that a dream?

00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,740
(Choi Se Kyung)

45
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,120
Let's go to the nurse's office.

46
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,589
I don't need to go to
the infirmary for this.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,729
It's called the nurse's
office, not infirmary.

48
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,189
Besides,

49
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,330
you're bleeding.

50
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,069
Darn it.

51
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,968
If you go back to the
classroom looking like that,

52
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,599
the other kids will avoid you.

53
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,949
Let's go to the infirmary.

54
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,360
The school nurse isn't here.

55
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,029
She must have stepped out.

56
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,860
Let me fix you up.

57
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,569
- What about the class?
- We have homeroom now.

58
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,708
After getting our seats assigned
and electing the class president,

59
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,139
our teacher told us to study.

60
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,879
Hey. You didn't even stand a chance.

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,980
Why did you fight back at Hong Jae Min?

62
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,120
Who knew I had such a slow body?

63
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey, be gentle with that.

64
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,969
You said you didn't
want to get treated earlier.

65
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,170
Darn it. This is embarrassing. You know?

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,846
I got beaten up by young kids
and ended up in the infirmary.

67
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,278
Besides, this kind of wound...

68
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,956
wouldn't even count as
a wound in the military.

69
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,679
Even if your skin gets ripped to
the point that your bone shows,

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
they just tell you to put
some red ointment on it.

71
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,389
You'll know once you get there.

72
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,739
But you haven't served in the military yet.

73
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,339
How did you know I was
exempted from the military service?

74
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,119
Only a few people know
that I'm the only son...

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,640
in the three generations of my family.

76
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,049
Only son in the three
generations of your family?

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,529
I was joking.

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Hey.

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,069
That's a big smile.

80
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,209
- What?
- I mean...

81
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,189
Why did you pretend you
didn't know me at the bookstore?

82
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,995
Whereas I just failed to recognize you.

83
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,050
You cut your bangs off.

84
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,720
You changed a lot.

85
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,810
I had never seen you smile that big...

86
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,089
when you and I spent
a lot of time together.

87
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,329
You and I are...

88
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,029
best friends. You know?

89
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,610
Choi Se Kyung.

90
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,740
I want to be friends with Se Kyung.

91
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,009
It won't ever be possible, though.

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,649
The guy I met at the bookstore
is the Se Kyung in his diary?

93
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,778
He became best friends...

94
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,096
with the classmate, Choi Se
Kyung, since he wrote in his diary?

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
That inconsiderate jerk, Song Yi Heon.

96
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,059
He should write down
important events like this.

97
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,120
Actually,

98
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,019
I lost my memory.

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
- What?
- I was in a huge accident.

100
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,399
I hurt my head.

101
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,639
How could you...

102
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,550
not remember me?

103
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,949
You slept in my room and
studied together all the time.

104
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,180
We went on trips together too.

105
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,350
You even said my parents
felt like your own parents.

106
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,660
Gosh.

107
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,300
Then does it mean we're
not friends or anything?

108
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,910
Hey, I can't seem to remember anything.

109
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,938
But it's nice to meet you, my friend.

110
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,209
I hope we can keep our friendship going.

111
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,930
We were never friends.

112
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:41,899
You...

113
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,430
blackmailed me.

114
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,359
I only said we were
friends to see your reaction.

115
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,209
Remember that rainy day?

116
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,410
You came to my house
and said you would expose...

117
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,008
my true nature to people...

118
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,649
if I didn't do what you told me to do.

119
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,589
Is he talking about the day
Song Yi Heon fell off the bridge?

120
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,490
Then does it mean he met
with Choi Se Kyung that day?

121
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,829
I don't know what Song Yi
Heon thinks my true nature is.

122
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,029
But I know his true nature
better than most people...

123
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,470
because he had been watching
me for over two years like a stalker.

124
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,269
I only looked at Se Kyung
because I wanted to be friends,

125
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,439
but Hong Jae Min started
calling me a stalker.

126
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,480
I became known as a stalker.

127
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,220
Now, the whole school is avoiding me...

128
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,120
and pointing fingers.

129
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,889
I wasn't...

130
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:36,889
stalking you.

131
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
See?

132
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,190
You knew about that.

133
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,888
Don't try to weasel your way out of this...

134
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,899
by lying to me that you lost your memory.

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,299
Your height, frame,

136
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,970
and face look just like Song Yi Heon's.

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,830
So you might be able
to fool the other kids.

138
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,669
But the way you speak,

139
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,039
your gait, smile, and eyes...

140
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,379
Everything has changed...

141
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,289
as if you're a different person.

142
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,879
That gaze.

143
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,149
He can see right through people.

144
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,426
But he won't reveal anything about himself.

145
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,620
That persistent gaze.

146
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,820
He won't back down easily.

147
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,389
This guy, Choi Se
Kyung, is a dangerous guy.

148
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,159
You are not Song Yi Heon, are you?

149
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,110
(High School Return of a Gangster)

150
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,210
{\an8}(Episode 2)

151
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,950
Who do you think I am if I'm not Yi Heon?

152
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,220
{\an8}His twin or relative?

153
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,919
{\an8}Or someone who looks just
like him like a doppelganger.

154
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,690
{\an8}"Doppelganger," my foot.

155
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,929
{\an8}Even an apple would laugh at that.

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,329
{\an8}People change after a major life event.

157
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,699
{\an8}No matter how major the
event is, people don't change.

158
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,340
{\an8}People can change.

159
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,870
{\an8}You'll understand it when you reach my age.

160
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,240
{\an8}I thought we were of the same age.

161
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,649
My parents were late
in registering my birth.

162
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,649
For goodness' sake.

163
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,628
Haven't you considered that
everything is just your assumption,

164
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,390
from the personality to the eyes,
way of talking, walking, and smile?

165
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:27,700
This is enough.

166
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,470
We're seniors.

167
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,169
We should study instead
of wasting our time.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,509
We have to go to college...

169
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,139
to function as human beings.

170
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,570
Did Yi Heon get tutored on
speech during vacation or what?

171
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,970
He was so smooth-tongued.

172
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,610
Hey, did you see...

173
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,515
how Yi Heon kicked your knee
to break free from your grab?

174
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,679
Did he kick me?

175
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,850
No. I slipped back then.

176
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,649
Right. Such a thing can't happen, can it?

177
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,179
That's not important.

178
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,189
Hey, once he wakes up,

179
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,418
he'll know what to do and who he is.

180
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,720
He'll come to his senses.

181
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,740
For goodness' sake.

182
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,740
What's with him?

183
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,950
Your seat is that empty one on
the 2nd row of the 2nd section.

184
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,319
Jae Min has already left the school.

185
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
His backpack is gone.

186
00:11:58,789 --> 00:11:59,889
I didn't ask you.

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,509
Okay.

188

(Goal: Get Grade 3 for
Korean, English, and Math!)

191
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,029
I used up my pen again.

192
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,398
I need to go to a
stationery store after school.

193
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,659
Me too.

194
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,700
I only have 2 days left
on my 100-day planner.

195
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,620
- Do you want to come with us?
- Sure.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Deskmate.

197
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,609
Do you get these systematic,
ground-breaking things...

198
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,840
from a supply store?

199
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,610
Well, if you meant the stationery store,

200
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,279
we did get them from there.

201
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,350
Can I join you for a
visit to the supply store?

202
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,590
What's wrong with you?

203
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,129
- What?
- Why?

204
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,830
It's so cold.

205
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,168
- This weather is insane.
- Let's walk arm in arm.

206
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,500
Why is it so windy?

207
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,639
Hey.

208
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,840
- What is that?
- What?

209
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you want us to hop in?

210
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,350
- What?
- Really?

211
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:29,579
- Shall we get in?
- Suddenly?

212
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,548
- Oh, dear!
- Is this true?

213
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:32,579
It's amazing.

214
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,749
- Hello.
- Hello.

215
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,549
- Nice.
- Amazing.

216
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,189
- You guys.
- Is this what I think it is?

217
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,460
You should dine first.

218
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,249
What is your favourite restaurant?

219
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:42,460
- What?
- What?

220
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,730
What?

221
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,330
- I'm starving.
- I'm hungry.

222
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,029
- What should we get?
- I can't choose.

223
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,870
Is it okay if I choose what to eat?

224
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,539
- Sure.
- Yes.

225
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,610
Ma'am.

226
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,769
- I hope he chooses the good ones.
- I know.

227
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,720
From this to this, we'll get them all.

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,749
Hey, why are you ordering only
the toppings except tteokbokki...

229
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,350
at the tteokbokki store?

230
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,809
- Sorry. We'll order in a minute.
- We're sorry.

231
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,690
Well, I wanted to buy you...

232
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,129
expensive and tasty ones.

233
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,268
Okay. Let's get deep-fried seaweed rolls.

234
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,840
- Okay.
- And beef brisket.

235
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,470
Are you good with spicy food?

236
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,809
I'm really good with spicy food.

237
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,109
- Nice.
- I can't eat spicy food these days.

238
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,110
Why not?

239
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,879
- Because I haven't been having it.
- I see.

240
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,620
Yi Heon, why aren't you eating?

241
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,419
I'm full. Help yourselves.

242
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,860
Does he not like how it tastes?

243
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,929
Maybe he doesn't like tteokbokki.

244
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,999
- He should've chosen another place.
- It's so good.

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,398
Hey, where are you going?

246
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,099
To the restroom.

247
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,970
(I crave Red Tteokbokki today.)

248
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,668
Next time, we have to
order the deep-fried squids.

249
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,408
- Sure.
- Did you try them?

250
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,339
I did. They are really good.

251
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,639
Why didn't you take me with you?

252
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,110

253
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
(Life is what you make of it.)

254
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,048
- Nice.
- Amazing.

255
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,888
- There are so many.
- How many are these?

256
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,959
You needed to get a lot of stuff, indeed.

257
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,990
He sure did.

258
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:24,960
What? There are so many pens.

259
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,830
Isn't it ink-redible?

260
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,330
Come on.

261
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,138
Do you know which pen the Avengers use?

262
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,409
- Which pen?
- Which one?

263
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,669
"Black Pen-ther."

264
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,250
Gosh. What's wrong with you, Yi Heon?

265
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,110
- It's hilarious.
- It's crazy.

266
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,950
You've already filled out your planner.

267
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,959
Why didn't you write down
your dream college and major?

268
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,230
Well, I haven't decided on them yet.

269
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,158
I heard our teacher would scold
us if we didn't set up our goals...

270
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,229
for being aimless.

271
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,429
- Is that so?
- Yes.

272
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,290
I have to decide on them quickly, then.

273
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,840
Why didn't you write down the AS Time?

274
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,840
"The AS Time?"

275
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,539
Right. I should write that down.

276
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:15,849
What does the AS Time mean?

277
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,878
Hey, student government president.

278
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,378
That was my junior year.

279
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,490
Stop calling me that
because I'm no longer one.

280
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,048
You were elected as our
class president anyway.

281
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,859
They are basically the same thing.

282
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,919
Come on.

283
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,789
So what does the AS Time mean?

284
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,100
You don't intend to stop, do you?

285
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,210
- It's the A...
- It's the Actual Studying Time.

286
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,079
There's no way he
doesn't know what it means.

287
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,340
- Why are you being so serious?
- Right.

288
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,779
He should know what it is.

289
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,019
But why do I keep feeling
that he wouldn't know?

290
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,419
Hey, how would he not know?
Of course, he knows what it is.

291
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,528
So, what were you
talking about with Yi Heon?

292
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,899
We were looking at what he bought
from the stationery store yesterday.

293
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,559
We hung out with him yesterday.

294
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,669
I see. I didn't know Yi Heon was
capable of hanging out with people.

295
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,470
He bought us dinner too.

296
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,439
When we said we'd grab a cab home...

297
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,740
Girls shouldn't ride a cab late at night.

298
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,980
No, we're really okay.

299
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,990
Hop in. Your parents must be worried.

300
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,420
I thought Yi Heon was a
gloomy person, but I was wrong.

301
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,630
He somehow feels mature and cool.

302
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,029
- I agree.
- Right?

303
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,630
This one is really pretty.

304
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,399
- This one's super soft.
- It comes in different colours too.

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
This one is much softer than the others.

306
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,839
Perfect score.

307
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
- Amazing!
- Gosh,

308
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,839
Song Yi Heon.

309
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,508
I didn't even recognize you
on the first day of school...

310
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,809
because you were so different.

311
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,910
Did you get some special
training during the break?

312
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,880
It looks so nice to see
your hair short and tidy.

313
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,390
Well,

314
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:40,220
good students come under
the guidance of good teachers.

315
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,358
This is all thanks to your
respectable teaching.

316
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,400
My respectable...

317
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:48,000
You're even using difficult words?

318
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,869
- This is all thanks to me?
- Of course, sir.

319
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,670
Gosh, you...

320
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,538
Alright, then.

321
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:56,539
Sit back down.

322
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,539
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

323
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,079
Next up. Hyung Min.

324
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,769
(Teachers' Room)

325
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,470
Let go! Gosh.

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,299
That hurts.

327
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,509
Why are you here?

328
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,539
To get some papers done.

329
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,829
I'm sending you off either
abroad or to a boarding school,

330
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,150
so that's that.

331
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,220
Are you trying to tell me that...

332
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,680
you're in charge of my life?

333
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,650
You know so well.

334
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,450
While we're at it, let me ask something.

335
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,689
Why would a student like you spend so much?

336
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,589
Why? Is that what the chairman said?

337
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,930
How cheap of him.

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,000
- What?
- Don't you think so?

339
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,630
He's enjoying himself with
a secret young mistress,

340
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,769
and now he's kicking up a
fuss over pocket change?

341
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,170
You used to act like you were sorry,

342
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,410
and now you won't even do that?

343
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,650
Have you decided to act out?

344
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,410
You won't be able to handle it...

345
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,920
if I really act out.

346
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,720
How dare you act so
ungrateful when I raised you?

347
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,890
"Raise?" You raised him?

348
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,758
I heard the chairman's
wife is nearing death.

349
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,670
You must be scared that
my mother might take...

350
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,299
her place as his legal wife.

351
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,569
Go ahead, if you're keen
on playing power games.

352
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,349
Now that I'm at it, I'm going
to play "chairman's son."

353
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,778
Should I take a paternity test...

354
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,380
and call the press?

355
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,450
Listen.

356
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,960
I decide where I want to be.

357
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,630
Not you.

358
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,239
If I see you one more time at school,

359
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,799
this is how you will end up.

360
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,839
Keep that in mind.

361
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,900
I can't let him be.

362
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
This is your speciality.

363
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,079
I'll get the boys ready.

364
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,480
(Evening Self-Study)

365
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,690
Why are you sitting next to me?

366
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,229
The teacher told us to sit together,

367
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,630
since there aren't many of us.

368
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,029
Do you have a problem?

369
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,200
- "The teacher?"
- Yes.

370
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,259
Why is the explanation so hard?

371
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,389
You just have to use the absolute value.

372
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,890
I didn't ask for your help.

373
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,359
Don't you hear me?

374
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,229
If alpha and beta represent
the X-coordinates...

375
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,640
where points A and B
intersect the X-axis, respectively,

376
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,969
the distance between these points
on the line can be determined...

377
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,740
by subtracting the smaller
value from the larger one.

378
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,579
Alpha plus B is six.

379
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,980
Alpha-beta is K minus three.

380
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,519
So that is why the real
number K is 10 and not 8.

381
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,490
Got it?

382
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,390
By the way...

383
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,500
What's your real name?

384
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,400
That fox.

385
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,719
So that's why he came
to the evening self-study.

386
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,369
Song Yi Heon.

387
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,508
- You won't fall for it?
- That's not it.

388
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,679
I am Song Yi Heon, so
there's nothing to fall for.

389
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,180
No, wrong.

390
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,950
The real Yi Heon would
never look at me like that.

391
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,890
Song Yi Heon.

392
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,690
You have to go to career counselling.

393
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,160
Ask me whenever you have a hard question.

394
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,630
Good luck with your counselling.

395
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,559
I'll be waiting.

396
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,029
Should I bury him?

397
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,380
No one cares about how
different Song Yi Heon is acting.

398
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,890
But why is Se Kyung so persistent?

399
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,849
You blackmailed me.

400
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,819
You came to my house
and said you would expose...

401
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,189
my true nature to people...

402
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,710
if I didn't do what you told me to do.

403
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,230
I can't even ask him what happened.

404
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,369
Are you listening?

405
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,440
Yes, I'm listening. Please go on.

406
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,779
Your grades in the second year...

407
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,779
weren't bad.

408
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,278
If you keep this up,

409
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,579
you'll get into a college in
Seoul without a problem.

410
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,690
Why didn't you put in your
target college and major?

411
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Well...

412
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,029
What do kids these days want to major in?

413
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,399
You can't just follow other kids.

414
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
You need to have your own goal.

415
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,129
That will motivate you to study...

416
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,039
and give you a sense of accomplishment.

417
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,500
Right.

418
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,910
I'll think about it.

419
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,509
Nothing else seems to be a problem,

420
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,509
but why did both your first and
second year teachers say that...

421
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,018
you exhibit gloominess and
struggle with peer interactions?

422
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,019
It must be because...

423
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm quite shy.

424
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,740
(Exhibits gloominess and
struggles with peer interactions)

425
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,960
I don't think that would
have made them go this far.

426
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,029
Okay.

427
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,539
You may leave. Good luck
on the upcoming mock exams.

428
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,009
And take some more time to think
about your target college and major.

429
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,710
Your future depends on it.

430
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,079
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,548
(Target college? Target
major? Choose within this year.)

432
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,019
No matter how hard I look,

433
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,720
I can't find anything
related to his dreams.

434
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,490
Even if he had a dream,

435
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,420
would my grades even come close?

436
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,930
Even if you try, my life won't change.

437
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,099
It's all pointless.

438
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,799
I keep getting hit
instead of getting revenge,

439
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,970
and all the boys are avoiding me.

440
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,069
And there are Lee Mi
Kyung and Choi Se Kyung.

441
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,369
Why isn't anything working out?

442
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,249
(How many natural numbers can
satisfy the following inequality?)

443
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,289
"How many..."

444
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,419
"natural numbers..."

445
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,630
Ask me whenever you have a hard question.

446
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,259
I'll be waiting.

447
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,140
Gosh...

448
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,659
(How many natural numbers can
satisfy the following inequality?)

449
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,469
(Song Yi Heon: Solve this for me.)

450
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,459
"Solve this for me."

451
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,020
(How many natural numbers can
satisfy the following inequality?)

452
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,709
(Song Yi Heon)

453
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,270
(Converting it to a multimedia message)

454
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,799
(Song Yi Heon: Well done. Goodnight.)

455
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,000
Well done. Goodnight.

456
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,768
If he's trying to pretend
to be Song Yi Heon,

457
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,069
at least do a better job.

458
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,130
Could you help me?

459
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,859
I know you can help me.

460
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,500
- No.
- Then...

461
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,740
I will expose your true
nature to other people.

462
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,268
What are you getting at?

463
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,410
This is all fake.

464
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,009
That day...

465
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,749
(Hot Bath)

466
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,380
This hits the spot.

467
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,920
Gosh, this is nice.

468
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
Oh, my.

469
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,588
Goodness.

470
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,389
Hey, why did you gain so much weight?

471
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,399
Why don't we get some
gukbap with soju later?

472
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,460
Sounds good.

473
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,699
Hey, kids.

474
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,170
(Hot Bath)

475
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,509
Gosh.

476
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,538
Good grief.

477
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,710
Hey, go easy on him.

478
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,749
Listen. If you think we're kids,

479
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,209
what does that make
you? Shouldn't you be...

480
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,848
in your mommy's womb, dividing into cells?

481
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,419
Gosh. Look at this rascal.

482
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,219
I should cut off your
finger, stick it in your anus,

483
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,559
and teach you where
your intestines are located.

484
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,719
- Hey, what's going on?
- Stay out of this!

485
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,759
What is it?

486
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,559
"Dosoo Gang?" Is that a new gang?

487
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,899
How do you know that?

488
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,769
How dare you drop the honorifics with me?

489
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm the number two man
in the Chilsung Gang.

490
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,079
Kim Deuk Pal.

491
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,809
What?

492
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,508
When I was in the scene,

493
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,249
it was just our gang, Sangduk
Gang, and Rotary Gang.

494
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,179
We were the only players in this turf.

495
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,319
Now, there's Dosoo Gang?

496
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,749
Things must be tough
for you guys. You know?

497
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,950
Yes.

498
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,219
We haven't been able to collect
half of our dues these days.

499
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,980
We've been gathering
as much dues as we can.

500
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,828
Darn it. When were you in the scene?

501
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,859
How dare you talk about...

502
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,199
This is how you must
behave in difficult times.

503
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,828
You must have a strong
foundation to find a way forward.

504
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,315
(A strong foundation
leads to a way forward.)

505
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:35,639
If you plan to have a
long career in this field,

506
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,839
you must follow public
etiquette. Understood?

507
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,980
Yes.

508
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,009
What was that? Are you okay?

509
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,479
- Have a good day, sir.
- Have a good day, sir.

510
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,039
Did that seriously happen?

511
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,809
Do you want to be gangsters? Is that it?

512
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,639
Hey, come here. You little...

513
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,449
So you want to be gangsters?

514
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,679
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

515
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,778
Hey. They want to be gangsters.

516
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,778
- Hello.
- Hello.

517
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,548
They are kids from the
neighbourhood. They're good kids.

518
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,549
Take them with you...

519
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,719
- and give them some stuff to do.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,759
By the way,

521
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,989
after Deuk Pal passed away,

522
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,459
is there anyone who would claim...

523
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,689
to be the number two
man in the Chilsung Gang?

524
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,328
- Did Deuk Pal have a son?
- You're right.

525
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,528
If he's Deuk Pal's son,
it sort of makes sense.

526
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:38,868
Hey, there are steps you
must go through to have a kid.

527
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,670
Deuk Pal never got married.

528
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,308
Hello, sir.

529
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,910
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

530
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,308
Sir. A young kid just now came here...

531
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:49,909
and dropped Deuk Pal's
name to act all bossy.

532
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,980
Right.

533
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,318
Should I go and get him?

534
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,349
You idiots. You were fooled by a kid?

535
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,989
I know that the Chilsung
Gang is disbanded now,

536
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,059
but the Chilsung Gang is still our root.

537
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,430
If Deuk Pal were alive,
he would've been our boss.

538
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,660
Anything related to him...

539
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
is to remain as it is.

540
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:08,970
Yes, sir.

541
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,229
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

542
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,399
- Bye, sir.
- Take care of them.

543
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,769
- Keep an eye on them.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,740
Gosh. How old are you?

545
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,209
I'm 19 years old!

546
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,409
- I'm 19.
- Really?

547
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,140
Gosh. I dig the colour of your hair.

548
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,519
Yi Heon. Your friend is here.

549
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,490
How did you know where I lived?

550
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:38,989
I checked the student record.

551
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,129
It's in the teachers' office.

552
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,799
A studious student like me
can just go and take a look.

553
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,140
No one would consider it suspicious.

554
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,309
Why are you here?

555
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,838
To tutor you.

556
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,009
I can study on my own. You can leave now.

557
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,630
The mock test is around the
corner. How will you do that?

558
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,555
Will you get all of the questions wrong?

559
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,920
My gosh. Ma'am.

560
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,288
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

561
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,358
- That again.
- Oh, no.

562
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,759
Go upstairs. The first
room you see is my room.

563
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,660
Wait in there for me.

564
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,430
Gosh.

565
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,240
What are you doing?

566
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,720
Seeing how you came all the
way here to search my room,

567
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,320
you must be thinking I locked
Song Yi Heon up somewhere.

568
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,360
Where's Song Yi Heon?

569
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,650
Have you heard of the myth
about a rat that became human?

570
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:27,329
The real human and the fake
human fought each other in the myth.

571
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,570
The truth is,

572
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:34,239
I'm the rat who ate up
Song Yi Heon's nails.

573
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,420
Hey, what's with you?

574
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,348
Why are you obsessing over the past me?

575
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,349
The past you?

576
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,789
Yes. I have something
to say to the past you.

577
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,000
Not the present you.

578
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,828
You can just tell me.

579
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,530
Are you having fun at school?

580
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,340
Is that why you stole someone else's life?

581
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,969
If you're going to get in my way, go home.

582
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,309
I need to study even
if I have to do it alone.

583
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,590
Prove it to me if you
really are Song Yi Heon.

584
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,820
What did you do with Song Yi Heon?

585
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,860
Did you kill him?

586
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,869
Why are you obsessing over Song Yi Heon?

587
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,309
That day...

588
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,349
Something happened on that
day I couldn't remember, right?

589
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,679
What did you do to him?

590
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:03,829
It's just...

591
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,440
You're stealing what ought to be his,

592
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,599
and you're fooling our classmates.

593
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,638
It's as if you're showing the world...

594
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,940
how no one will look for him
even when he disappears.

595
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,320
I just can't bear to see that.

596
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,289
You should have looked
for him earlier, then.

597
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,450
Before he jumped off
the pedestrian overpass.

598
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,889
"Jumped off?"

599
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,049
He jumped off on that day...

600
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,969
after seeing you.

601
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,840
What happened to him, then?

602
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,570
Let go of me!

603
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,239
Come on, ma'am.

604
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,050
- Let go of me!
- Gosh.

605
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,779
Why do you stop me from
having a drink outside?

606
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,448
Ma'am, please calm down.

607
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,820
You have to calm down.

608
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,590
- Let me go!
- Please.

609
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,218
You ordered her to get
rid of the drinks, didn't you?

610
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,489
Are you belittling me
just like your father?

611
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:08,230
How can she do this every day?

612
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,300
There are many good
things other than alcohol.

613
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,409
This anxiety is driving me crazy.

614
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:20,538
I want to get drunk and
forget about everything.

615
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,010
Why aren't you letting me do so?

616
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,079
Why?

617
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,929
Why are you hindering my life?

618
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,699
If I didn't have you,

619
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:42,599
I wouldn't be living like this.

620
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,499
Without you,

621
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,699
I would have succeeded as an actor.

622
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,839
Without you,

623
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,510
I could have lived happily.

624
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,320
It's not too late.

625
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,659
You can go back.

626
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,090
You can...

627
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,789
be happy again.

628
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,690
Let's go after I get changed.

629
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:37,989
I'll drop you off.

630
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,369
Hey, Se Kyung.

631
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,610
Yes?

632
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,139
Why?

633
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,219
Let's get some fresh air.

634
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,288
To get rid of stress, high
school students usually...

635
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,429
go to karaoke or cinema, play VR games...

636
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,429
or enjoy escape rooms.

637
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,369
Not you, though.

638
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,139
- Well...
- Let's listen to music first,

639
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:05,269
then talk again later.

640
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,079
Why are you trying so hard?

641
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,650
I'm talking about Jae Min
as well as Yi Heon's mother.

642
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,120
You can just leave them
alone and ignore them.

643
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,630
If you don't do anything,

644
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,159
bad guys become more powerful,
and the world becomes a worse place.

645
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,869
That's the way of the world.

646
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,539
Still, it won't make the
world a better place.

647
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,170
Exactly.

648
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,740
I should at least try
something, shouldn't I?

649
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,210
When you get old and become a father,

650
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
don't you want to leave a
good world to your kids?

651
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,750
"Father."

652
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,019
I don't know.

653
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,759
You'll understand when you reach my age.

654
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,230
No matter how persistently you try,

655
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,099
many things go against your will.

656
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,630
Still,

657
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,769
you can't give up first.

658
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,239
So, how exactly old are you?

659
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,750
I'm older than you, for sure.

660
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,539
(Father)

661
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,679
How did you find this place?

662
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,449
- Do you come here often?
- Once in a while when I'm upset.

663
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,389
I didn't know it was this late.

664
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:40,929
I'm at my friend's place.

665
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,969
I'll hurry home before
the curfew. I'm sorry.

666
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,218
It was my father.

667
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:07,019
He would mind if I told him
I came to listen to music.

668
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,190
To your parents, you're still a child...

669
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,049
even though you're physically all grown up.

670
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,000
Let's hurry.

671
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,299
Let's finish what we were talking about.

672
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,610
What happened...

673
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,010
to Yi Heon?

674
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,219
Is he dead?

675
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,360
Did you put the hair
you took in a safe place?

676
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:52,000
You can check...

677
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,739
whether I'm a rat that ate
a fingernail or a human.

678
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,940
I'll give you all the documents you need.

679
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,809
You really should quit it now.

680
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,510
Including Jae Min, family
issues, and studying,

681
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,219
I already have a lot on
my list to take care of.

682
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,449
Don't add yourself to the list.

683
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:12,989
Okay?

684
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,280
Gosh.

685
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,099
Which friend?

686
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,569
Does that friend live downtown...

687
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,639
forty minutes away from school?

688
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,678
I downloaded a tracking
app on your phone...

689
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,780
a long time ago, in case you lie like this.

690
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,849
What were you doing that made you lie?

691
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,489
I just went to a listening
room to listen to music.

692
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:26,559
That's really it.

693
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,099
Which friend?

694
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,139
Song Yi Heon.

695
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,408
He's in my class.

696
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,639
Is he a good kid?

697
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,579
He studies hard.

698
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,349
You're a prosecutor's son.

699
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,420
You're my son.

700
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:55,019
Yes, I know.

701
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,389
Alright.

702
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,530
Don't you ever lie again.

703
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,570
Yes, sir.

704
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,489
Look.

705
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:32,489
Look.

706
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,030
This happened because you were bad.

707
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,679
(Hansong High School)

708
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:34,820
Hey, don't cause a scene this early.

709
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,030
Give me your numbers...

710
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,659
so we can plan ahead before meeting.

711
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,329
Whatever.

712
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,170
Yi Heon,

713
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,198
you're getting out of hand these days,

714
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,899
so I brought some videos
to help you remember...

715
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,400
who you are.

716
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,279
It's fun. Do you want to watch?

717
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,739
I heard he was stalking.

718
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,479
Did you hear that?

719
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,549
Gosh, come on.

720
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,149
- Look at him.
- Gosh, Yi Heon.

721
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,479
Where are you going, Yi Heon?

722
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,488
Look over here.

723
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,349
- Where are you going?
- Come on.

724
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:09,929
Hey, look at him.

725
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,558
That's so funny.

726
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,759
Come on, Yi Heon.

727
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,829
What do you think?

728
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,469
Look at his face.

729
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,280
Isn't it great?

730
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:42,860
Hey!

731
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:44,860
No...

732
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,159
- One who keeps company...
- You wacko!

733
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:48,860
With the wolf...

734
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,730
will learn to howl.

735
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,669
One takes the characteristics
of whom they associate with.

736
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,868
(One who keeps company
with the wolf will learn to howl.)

737
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,940
I'm scared the other kids
might pick up from you.

738
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,150
Why, you...

739
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,079
You...

740
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,889
Hey. That wasn't enough, was it?

741
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,639
Let's see who gets it this time.

742
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:41,119
I mean... Look at him.

743
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,489
It's almost time for class.

744
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,529
Go ahead and hit me first.

745
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,329
I can't let people
think I hit little kids first.

746
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,030
You're bluffing again?

747
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,300
Are you okay?

748
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,639
What happened?

749
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:01,900
I told you...

750
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,909
not to leave your fingerprints on me.

751
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,110
I didn't hit you, by the
way. It was my reflexes.

752
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,409
What are you doing?

753
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:10,949
Ruin him!

754
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:14,179
Don't interfere.

755
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,079
Now that's more like Song Yi Heon.

756
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,010
You got a nice fist, kid.

757
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,638
What happened?

758
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,809
Gosh, you dumb thing.

759
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,379
I told you.

760
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,050
I hurt my head after falling
from a pedestrian overpass.

761
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,459
People change after a major life event.

762
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,460
What in the...

763
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:03,630
- You talk too much.
- Why, you...

764
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,440
Let's finish this, you and me.

765
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,339
That's the only way I'll ever face Yi Heon.

766
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,949
What kind of nonsense is that?

767
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,010
Are you...

768
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,280
a gangster?

769
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:29,679
How did you know?

770
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,159
I'm Kim Deuk Pal, the number
two man in the Chilsung Gang.

771
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,499
Jae Min.

772
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,928
I'll let you smell the dirt...

773
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,729
{\an8}if you get in my sight
again. Do you understand?

774
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,868
{\an8}Yes, sir.

775
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:49,139
{\an8}Could you get the papers
for the DNA test ready?

776
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,609
{\an8}There's always a reason...

777
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,945
{\an8}when someone gives you the
answer without you asking for it.

778
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,009
{\an8}Go ahead and study.

779
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,779
{\an8}I don't expect to get
into Seoul University.

780
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,809
{\an8}That's cool.

781
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:58,309
{\an8}Keep your word.

782
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,719
{\an8}That you'll do whatever I want.

783
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,119
{\an8}He's allergic to pineapple.

784
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,590
{\an8}His throat swells up with even...

785
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,960
{\an8}the smallest piece of
pineapple, so he almost died.

786
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,460
{\an8}Are you able to eat this?

787
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,300
{\an8}Why? Did you want to eat this as well?

788
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,300
{\an8}Hey...
