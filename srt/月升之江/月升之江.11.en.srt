1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,055
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,474
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,330
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,947
This man here is my husband.

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,481
You are no longer my daughter.

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,854
Leave the palace immediately.

7
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,891
They are married. Ga
Jin and Dal got married!

8
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:27,306
You punk! How dare you
tease your blind mother!

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,268
It does not matter if it is real or not.

10
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,968
As long as I can be with you...

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,521
and protect you.

12
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,371
Practice the basic strikes.

13
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,612
Let us not tell Mother
that I am learning to fight.

14
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,841
She will fall ill...

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,721
the moment she hears.

16
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,832
Revive the Sunno Tribe?

17
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,878
You cannot live in Ghost Valley forever.

18
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:51,385
You must gather your men, gain strength,

19
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,751
and regain power.

20
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,686
The Cheonjubang leader,
disguised as a fortune-teller.

21
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,885
I will refrain from any
further foolish games.

22
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,491
It is quite a waste,

23
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,582
but I have no choice.

24
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,652
EPISODE 11

25
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,332
You despicable spy.

26
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:23,051
I will kill you here so
you cannot return to Silla.

27
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,421
Lady Hae. Wake up.

28
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:54,902
Did you...

29
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,941
hear...

30
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,202
what he said?

31
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:05,811
I heard,

32
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,032
and I was surprised.

33
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:13,381
You are truly...

34
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,422
a mysterious woman.

35
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,246
I told you to spy on Hae Ji Weol,

36
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,052
and you saved his daughter.

37
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:29,345
Do not worry about Lord Hae.

38
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:32,486
I did not find anything to
show he is hostile towards you.

39
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:33,852
And his daughter?

40
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,122
Anything suspicious about her?

41
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,426
I heard she controls the Sono
Tribe from behind the scenes.

42
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,996
Do you have something?

43
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:41,852
No.

44
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,995
I did not find anything in particular.

45
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,565
I would like to be excused.

46
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:50,104
Check up on the Princess at all times.

47
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,836
She will not have returned
to the Sunno Tribe...

48
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,109
to play house with On Hyeop's son.

49
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,492
When the time is right,

50
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:00,918
we must nip them in the bud.

51
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,225
I will untangle them.

52
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,896
I will remove anything...

53
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:17,165
that comes between us! So please...

54
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,021
Master Go!

55
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:21,472
I need to leave now.

56
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,122
I am sorry.

57
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,301
Master Go.

58
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,624
I will not go easy on you.

59
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:48,862
I need to check on your progress.

60
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,564
Do not cry after you lose.

61
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:57,592
Here we go.

62
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,342
Lady Sa.

63
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:17,256
Do you know why I am not
teaching Dal swordsmanship?

64
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,742
Once he wields the sword,

65
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,479
he is bound to see blood.
That is the fate of a swordsman.

66
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:30,072
I do not want Dal to follow
in my bloody footsteps.

67
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:52,832
Well done, Dal.

68
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,105
What are you doing right now?

69
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,751
Mother.

70
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,611
My gosh, Mother. Watch
your step. Be careful.

71
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:09,876
Are you all right? Mother.

72
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,562
How did you get here?

73
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,232
What is this?

74
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,172
Is it a sword?

75
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,925
Dal, are you learning how to use a sword?

76
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,286
Lying to me...

77
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,812
and hiding up here?

78
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,866
I am not learning anything.
We are just fooling around.

79
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,296
My eyes do not work,

80
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,235
but my brain works just fine!

81
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,742
Mother. It is all my fault.

82
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,476
Dal did not want to learn,

83
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:41,682
but I made him.

84
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,842
What did you say?

85
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:48,452
What will you do by
teaching him how to fight?

86
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,721
Do you want to turn him
into a human butcher?

87
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:55,486
So he can go out and cut down people?

88
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,056
Mother, that is not what it is for.

89
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,929
All this happened because...

90
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,825
a wicked girl joined the family.

91
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,831
Mother. You speak too harshly.

92
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,482
Dal.

93
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,202
Do not scold Ga Jin.

94
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,782
I said I wished to learn.

95
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,765
I wish to learn swordsmanship...

96
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,971
and become a general like Father.

97
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,382
What? My father...

98
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,418
was the greatest fighter in Goguryeo.

99
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:22,702
But me?

100
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:24,941
What am I?

101
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,892
I just plow fields and gather herbs.

102
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,436
What would Father say if
he were to see me now?

103
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,306
You turned me into an
ignorant country bumpkin.

104
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,782
You fool.

105
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,239
You idiot. You should just die!

106
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:44,662
You fool!

107
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,179
You punk. You immature brat.

108
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:55,622
That was what the general wanted.

109
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,715
He wished you would never hold a sword...

110
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,419
and live like a country bumpkin forever!

111
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,782
Mother.

112
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,802
Mother. You should eat.

113
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,615
She must be very dismayed.

114
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,242
She will not eat.

115
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,872
You should talk to her...

116
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,159
so that she can come around.

117
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,302
What should I say?

118
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,926
That I will never hold a sword again?

119
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,612
That she need not worry?

120
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:20,421
Or...

121
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,338
that I will live quietly
and do as she says?

122
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:28,770
I am not saying you should
lie to smooth things over.

123
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,191
What you truly think.

124
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,720
Tell her what your deepest,
honest thoughts are.

125
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:41,182
My thoughts?

126
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,971
Lady Sa must be in shock.

127
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,882
She tried so hard to prevent
Dal from learning to fight.

128
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,596
Bad news is best heard
as soon as possible.

129
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:56,546
It was for the best. She
was bound to find out.

130
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,435
She cannot coddle...

131
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,535
someone like Dal who is
made to be a great general.

132
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,446
He is a loyal and filial boy,
so he will be confused as well.

133
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:08,292
I am afraid Ga Jin will end up
being treated like a nuisance.

134
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:11,032
Do not worry about that.

135
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,231
She is smart and feisty.

136
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,802
Women like her are rare.

137
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,461
That is true.

138
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:19,628
She is a perfect match for Dal.

139
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,128
Just like you and me, Chief.

140
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,891
What...

141
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,684
Anyway, I do not think
it is for us to interfere.

142
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,476
We should wait and see.

143
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,362
Yes, Chief.

144
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,816
How much steel do you
have to melt into weapons?

145
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,422
We have quite a lot.

146
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,892
Come to the forge.

147
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,102
You are quite...

148
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:00,651
Mother.

149
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,191
I thought about it,

150
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,482
and even if Father were alive,

151
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:10,791
eventually,

152
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,911
I would have learned to fight.

153
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,932
If he disapproved,

154
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:24,297
I would probably learn in
secret am I'm doing now.

155
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,058
It is not because of Ga Jin.

156
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,601
It is what I want.

157
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:33,102
I dream of becoming a great general.

158
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,871
So please give your permission, Mother.

159
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,848
You want to ruin your own life.

160
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,215
What can I do to stop you?

161
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,672
Mother.

162
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:51,932
Get lost. I am sleepy.

163
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:12,962
Oh, General...

164
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:17,821
General On...

165
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,432
You idiot.

166
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,606
You could not deal with one girl?

167
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,812
Kill me, Chief.

168
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,455
How will killing you benefit me?

169
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,018
The wench will try to get back at us.

170
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:02,902
You must get away.

171
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,598
We are after each other's life.

172
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,882
She will not act rashly.

173
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:10,482
Chief.

174
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:14,232
A messenger is here
from Jangbaek herb store.

175
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,992
Wait outside.

176
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,939
You are hiding your identity
from your right-hand man too?

177
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,768
It is not something I want
everyone to know about.

178
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,235
You are harder to kill than I thought.

179
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:47,866
That is rich coming from
the Cheonjubang chief...

180
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:50,236
who is always trying to kill the King.

181
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:52,066
The night is short, so do not waste time.

182
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,432
Get to the point.

183
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:59,446
The woman who asked for
the impregnation ceremony...

184
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,132
is the King's concubine.

185
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:05,802
But...

186
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,824
if I were to let you enter the palace,

187
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:13,254
something dreadful could
happen that I cannot control.

188
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,372
Why do you want the King dead?

189
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,674
You must tell me what grudge you hold.

190
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:27,241
I believe we can cooperate.

191
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,981
There was a young priest...

192
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,511
with great skill.

193
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,212
Also,

194
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,768
there was a woman he loved in secret.

195
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,261
Push harder.

196
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,651
Harder.

197
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,921
A bit more.

198
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:13,201
After them! Yes, sir!

199
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:14,902
The priest broke the law,

200
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,093
and all he wanted was
to save his wife and child.

201
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,352
No. Wife.

202
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,691
After them! Get them!

203
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:37,432
Wife.

204
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:38,732
Wife!

205
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,232
That night,

206
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:25,062
what the King's men killed
were not the man's wife and child.

207
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:26,511
It was...

208
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,821
the priest himself.

209
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,042
King Pyeongwon.

210
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,451
I must avenge...

211
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:47,252
my wife and child who
were killed by the king.

212
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,172
An impregnation ceremony?

213
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,932
Yes. I found a very
skilled fortune-teller.

214
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,239
Please give your permission.

215
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,412
Having an offspring...

216
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,106
means bringing forth a
grave concern into the world.

217
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,711
Plus, if the Queen were to find out,

218
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,878
how will you bear her jealousy?

219
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:20,385
I do not wish for anything else.

220
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:25,652
I just want to hold your child in my arms.

221
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,135
Give your permission. Please?

222
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:55,919
How many times must I say that I get it?

223
00:16:57,622 --> 00:16:59,889
It could take a day or two longer.

224
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,925
I cooked your favorite meat dishes,

225
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,185
so eat all that.

226
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,524
Did you ever come and go as I said?

227
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:09,395
Why are you acting so weird today?

228
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,868
Mother. We brought in extra firewood.

229
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,796
And the water jug is full too.

230
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:16,296
Okay. Stop talking and
nagging and get going.

231
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,982
Mother. Just go already.

232
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,006
Are you angry? Just go.

233
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:21,692
I got it. You can go.

234
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,222
You sigh too much.

235
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,458
Do not worry about your mother.

236
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,516
I am not worried.

237
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,202
It shows when you lie.

238
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,525
From now on, we must do well.

239
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:44,766
Looking after her...

240
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,505
and reviving Ghost Valley.

241
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,235
You must focus on your training.

242
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:52,238
I know. Then stand up straight.

243
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,174
You look extra ugly when you are hunched.

244
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,861
That is a bit better.

245
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,718
But must I learn from another master?

246
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:07,145
I want to go on learning from you.

247
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,418
My skills are not good enough now.

248
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,155
You have strong
muscles, and you are quick.

249
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:14,155
You advance quicker than I thought.

250
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,895
You should learn from a teacher
who is more experienced than me.

251
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,861
Who is that?

252
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,782
I have someone in mind.

253
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,941
We should go.

254
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,492
It is too high.

255
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,042
How far must we go?

256
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,081
Follow me.

257
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:57,991
Wol Gwang.

258
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,506
Swordsmanship?

259
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,745
I thought you were having
an affair with those sticks.

260
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:07,431
You. That crazy monk.

261
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:14,491
Wol Gwang. Have you been well?

262
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,359
It has been a long time, Princess.

263
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:24,695
You could barely mumble last time.

264
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:26,434
Now you can walk at least.

265
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,812
Ga Jin. Who is this man?

266
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,905
I believed you would
come to me in due time,

267
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,871
so I waited.

268
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,492
It was you.

269
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:46,316
When I was poisoned and
fell unconscious in the Capital,

270
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:47,362
you saved me.

271
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,198
And after that, you continued
to watch Dal and me.

272
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,971
You left Yibullansa
with a look of despair.

273
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,506
But seeing you now,
having found your path,

274
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,192
I am infinitely moved.

275
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,517
To tell you truth, I have
come to ask for a difficult favor.

276
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,652
If Dal has a worthy master,

277
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,616
he will become a great man of Goguryeo.

278
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,142
I am not certain...

279
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:27,415
that I am worthy of teaching the
son of the great General On Hyeop.

280
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,002
What nonsense are you talking about?

281
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,425
The person you want
me to take as my master...

282
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,031
was this crazy monk?

283
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:37,142
I will not do it. I cannot.

284
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,222
Be careful what you say.

285
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:43,135
In the South was General On
Hyeop, and in the North, General Son.

286
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,506
He fought with your father
to protect the country...

287
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,645
as one of its greatest warriors.

288
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,071
I beg of you, Wol Gwang.

289
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,155
Are you really leaving
me here, all by myself?

290
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,201
That crazy...

291
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,828
I mean, that monk
seems a bit strange to me.

292
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,066
Do not say such things and train hard.

293
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,905
While you are training,
I will also work hard.

294
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,644
What if I want to see you?

295
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,506
Just bear with it. I will do the same.

296
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,912
There are some things I cannot bear.

297
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:29,612
Gosh.

298
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:38,190
I will wait for you, my
husband. I have faith in you.

299
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,741
Be careful, my wife.

300
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:51,132
Hey.

301
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:55,942
I will get going.

302
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:13,035
What should I learn first?

303
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,066
I have mastered the
basics of swordsmanship.

304
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,596
First, get some firewood
and make some rice.

305
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,566
I ate raw food for a few days
because I was out of wood,

306
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,175
and I have had diarrhea
for several days now.

307
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,836
Right, catch some rabbits
and cook a couple too.

308
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,776
You're a monk, but you eat meat?

309
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,745
Whether it's grass or meat,
everything turns to feces anyway.

310
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,271
What are you doing?

311
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,710
Are you waiting for the
sky to shower you with gifts?

312
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,846
Do not let your emotions
get in the way of our work.

313
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:02,415
I have been waiting for this
chance for over a decade.

314
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:04,554
There is no way I would do that.

315
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,985
I am simply reminding
you of what you promised.

316
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:08,671
Of course I remember.

317
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,061
What you desire is the end of Goguryeo.

318
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:14,212
Until that time comes,

319
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,961
I will allow the King to live.

320
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,685
The qi does not flow
properly in your fertility system.

321
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:39,541
I know.

322
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:43,100
We have used herbs to
improve the flow thus far.

323
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,389
Will I be able to become pregnant?

324
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,181
Wait for a full moon,

325
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,596
and perform a ritual for the dead.

326
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:55,995
You need to absorb energy
from your noble ancestors...

327
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,068
and revive your stagnated flow.

328
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:02,675
If you do so, you will be
able to become pregnant.

329
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,281
Is that really true?

330
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:06,852
Before you perform the ritual,

331
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:10,838
I will tell you what foods
and taboos you should avoid.

332
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,231
If you trust me,

333
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:16,291
I know you will give
birth to a healthy child.

334
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,952
Of course I will.

335
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,471
What happy news.

336
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,501
Thank you, Lady Hae.

337
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,072
It is my honor.

338
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,268
But I have not heard your name.

339
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:34,178
A low fortune-teller like
me does not have a name.

340
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:37,022
Just call me No Name.

341
00:24:39,382 --> 00:24:40,232
No Name?

342
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,071
Lady Hae.

343
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,761
Go ahead without me.

344
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,482
You may go.

345
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,376
Your wound must not yet be healed.

346
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,145
What brings you to the palace?

347
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:14,715
Work is important, but
you must look after yourself.

348
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,816
I have yet to give you my
thanks for saving my life.

349
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,689
How could I repay this debt?

350
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,719
There is no debt between us.

351
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,789
Did you find out who attacked you?

352
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,861
Their sword skills were
definitely beyond ordinary.

353
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,096
Making both large and small deals...

354
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,796
has made me the object of much resentment.

355
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,905
I will be careful, so please
do not worry too much.

356
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,591
Then please be careful.

357
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:45,349
You are important to me, Lady Hae.

358
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,245
If you would like to repay your debt,

359
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,184
just buy me a drink sometime.

360
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:58,861
I will buy you the best there is.

361
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:02,042
I look forward to it.

362
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,061
Here.

363
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,882
How beautiful he is.

364
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,685
I hear you have been going
to the King's quarters often.

365
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:28,024
To hear that the king favors you...

366
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,681
pleases me as well.

367
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,172
I know.

368
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,655
After he sent the princess
away from the palace,

369
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,495
he must have been very lonely.

370
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,181
He tells me many things.

371
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:40,952
He does?

372
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:42,481
Yes, he does.

373
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,181
I simply listen.

374
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:50,975
Have some. This is the
fish jerky that you so favor.

375
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:56,404
Stay away from foods that
are grilled, braised, dried,

376
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:58,202
or fishy.

377
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,394
Today, they smell a bit too fishy for me.

378
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:08,812
I will take my leave now.

379
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:12,064
I'll come again to play, my prince.

380
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:23,709
Did you say the herb store owner
visited Royal Consort Hyeon...

381
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,745
with a strange man in tow?

382
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:26,801
Yes.

383
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,482
That was some great food.

384
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,211
Clear the table.

385
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,651
Are you hard of hearing?

386
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:57,606
I came to learn swordsmanship,

387
00:27:57,612 --> 00:27:59,175
not work as your servant.

388
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:00,541
What did you say?

389
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:05,798
Have you ever heard of a painter
painting on a lumpy canvas?

390
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:07,351
A lumpy painting?

391
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:10,062
What are you talking about?

392
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,281
Follow me.

393
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,302
Is it not spacious?

394
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,846
This is the cave where
I spend my Dongangeo.

395
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,086
WHEN MONKS WITHDRAW
FROM THE WORLD AT YEAR'S END

396
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,740
So what are you telling me
to do while I am stuck in here?

397
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,086
You're going to become
a clean, white canvas.

398
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:46,772
The toxins in your body,

399
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,026
the rotten energy in your mind,

400
00:28:49,032 --> 00:28:50,899
work to cleanse it all away.

401
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,001
Swordsmanship will come after.

402
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:01,544
If you chew on a few of these...

403
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:04,748
when you get hungry,
you will not starve to death.

404
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:12,257
Feel free to run away now if
you do not feel up to the task.

405
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,122
Is he kidding me?

406
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:37,618
He is testing me even though
he is nothing but a crazy monk?

407
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,992
We shall see who wins.

408
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,731
We shall see.

409
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,380
Please make way!

410
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,540
Put it over there.

411
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,674
Why are they causing all this
fuss? What are they making?

412
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,747
Have you not heard of a stable?

413
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,144
The house for horses!

414
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,017
Of course I know what it is.

415
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,383
Why are they making a stable
when we do not have any horses?

416
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:35,522
The Princess went to buy horses.

417
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,287
She left earlier with Pung Gae.

418
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,350
They left me out?

419
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,053
Gosh, I do not like him.

420
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,659
Hey! Do it properly!

421
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,789
It must cost a lot.

422
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:50,333
With what money is she buying horses?

423
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:53,464
There must be a way she thought
of since she said she is capable of it.

424
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,870
That is what I am saying. Of course.

425
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,399
Gosh.

426
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,443
If we head to the East
Gate, there is a horse market.

427
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,644
There must be some horses
that are put out on the market...

428
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,384
after being used as war horses.

429
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,913
Pick out the ones that look
sick and have lost their hairs.

430
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,123
What? The ones that have lost their hairs?

431
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:16,093
They must cost less than
half of what normal horses cost.

432
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:17,779
You get what you pay for.

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,563
Even though they were used as war horses,

434
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,302
it would be a waste to buy sickly horses.

435
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,494
We do not need horses that
were only used for wagons.

436
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,964
Since they were war horses,

437
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,364
they will become useful if we
feed them well and tend to them.

438
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,237
See you later at the tavern.

439
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,510
Your Highness.

440
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,030
Your Highness, let us get inside.

441
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:06,739
Thank you, Nanny.

442
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,339
My goodness.

443
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,570
You have gotten haggard.

444
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,109
I am fine.

445
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,657
Is the Crown Prince doing well?

446
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:22,239
Of course.

447
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,059
He is doing his best to
train with General Go.

448
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,299
Master Go? Yes.

449
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,370
He has recently become
the Head of Bodyguards.

450
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,200
Let us go inside.

451
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,480
The King must be waiting for you.

452
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,574
Your undutiful daughter
is here to greet her father.

453
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,010
Why are you here?

454
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:22,833
I have been working
together with the people...

455
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,089
to rebuild the Sunno Tribe.

456
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,557
I will raise an army
and build their home...

457
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,593
so that they can be your support soon.

458
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,270
It will not take long. Please wait for us.

459
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:42,259
Get up.

460
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:50,059
Do not ask for trouble.

461
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:53,449
It is the task Mother left me.

462
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,124
Also, it is the path I must take
for you and the Crown Prince.

463
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,259
I will pull through.

464
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,730
You take after...

465
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,650
your mother's sturdiness.

466
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,830
By the way, why is General
Go training the Crown Prince?

467
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,343
He got on Gochuga's bad side...

468
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,784
and was about to be kicked
out to the border, so I took him in.

469
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,790
You should not keep him close.

470
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,124
In the end, he is the next
chief of the Gyeru Tribe.

471
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,990
He swore his loyalty to me,

472
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,593
but I do not fully trust him.

473
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,270
I will only use him when I need him.

474
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,160
How is On Hyeop's son?

475
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:55,542
He is giving his all to train himself.

476
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,643
I am sure he will make
a huge contribution...

477
00:34:57,649 --> 00:35:00,721
I am asking if he is nice
to you as your husband.

478
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,440
Yes, he is.

479
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,933
That is all I needed to hear.

480
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,614
Your mother did not have
luck with her husband,

481
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,689
so at least you should.

482
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:45,109
Darn it.

483
00:36:00,149 --> 00:36:03,477
I will wait for you, my
husband. I have faith in you.

484
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:05,459
Wait for me, my wife.

485
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,840
Thank you, Lady Hae.

486
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:29,434
I asked for it in a hurry, but I did
not know it would be done so fast.

487
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,707
I am glad that I could be of help.

488
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,432
Please do not hesitate to
ask me if you need anything.

489
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,787
What happened to your wrist?

490
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,639
It is nothing.

491
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,457
I hurt it while cutting the herbs.

492
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,952
You heard about General Go, have you not?

493
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,623
Are you going to go
back without seeing him?

494
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:55,362
If you want to see him, I can arrange it.

495
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,494
I do not need to, and
I wish not to see him.

496
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,234
Or is there a message you
would like for me to relay?

497
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,090
Lady Hae.

498
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,759
Do you perhaps... Pardon?

499
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,617
Do you perhaps have
feelings for General Go?

500
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,910
Your Highness.

501
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,892
That does not make any sense.

502
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,197
Master Go is impeccable as a husband.

503
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,200
If your feelings are
sincere, do not lose him.

504
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:30,036
Why did you turn down a man like him?

505
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,337
Because I have someone else in my heart.

506
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:42,299
JANGBAEK

507
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:57,623
Did anything suspicious happen?

508
00:37:57,629 --> 00:38:01,213
Her plans are meticulous, so
you need to be on your toes.

509
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:04,149
General Go. What is it?

510
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,283
About an hour ago, the
Princess made her visit.

511
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,040
Should I go after her?

512
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,410
No.

513
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,340
I must see for myself.

514
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,722
My goodness! That is ridiculous.

515
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:58,209
Move! My gosh!

516
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,620
I will never give up.

517
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,713
They were raised as war horses,

518
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,514
so if we feed them well and tend to them,

519
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,613
I am sure they will come around.

520
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,819
They seem to be of good breeding.

521
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:08,489
My goodness! But they are so skinny!

522
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,722
Who would want to raise such poor horses?

523
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,963
Jin and San are the Gokturks.

524
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:16,063
They know everything about horses.

525
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:19,269
But that does not mean I
can make a miracle happen.

526
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,149
Did you pick them?

527
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:24,076
Do not worry. Pung Gae will help too.

528
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,982
Well, we need cavalry if
we are to raise an army.

529
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,100
I got some silver too.

530
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,000
What?

531
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:37,957
We will use that to buy
more horses for cavalry,

532
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,524
and we will get more
steel for our weapons.

533
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,810
Are you serious?

534
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,066
My goodness, Chief. It is like
you gained a thousand troops!

535
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,260
Hey, Ga Jin.

536
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:55,836
Are they decent horses? Of course.

537
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,370
Where did Dal go?

538
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,847
Why do you ask? I am worried...

539
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,830
about your mother-in-law.

540
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,910
Mother.

541
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,740
Mother.

542
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,520
Mother.

543
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,390
Mother...

544
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,640
Mother. Mother.

545
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,860
Hey, you are back.

546
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,600
Mother, are you okay?

547
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,218
The house is a mess, is it
not? I could not clean up.

548
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,760
I got tired.

549
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Are you sure you are not sick?

550
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,799
An old woman such
as myself aches all over.

551
00:41:58,069 --> 00:41:59,429
Gosh, by the way,

552
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,180
where is Dal?

553
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,039
Dal could not come with me.

554
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,590
He had some things to do.

555
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:13,549
Mother... Okay.

556
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:19,369
You can go.

557
00:42:57,229 --> 00:42:58,829
I do not want Dal...

558
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,500
to follow in my bloody footsteps.

559
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,114
My father was the
greatest fighter in Goguryeo.

560
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,020
What am I?

561
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,210
I just plow fields and gather herbs.

562
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,084
What would Father say if
he were to see me now?

563
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,464
You turned me into an
ignorant country bumpkin.

564
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,326
Mother. We brought in extra firewood.

565
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,483
And the water jar is full too.

566
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:31,201
Water, vegetable garden,
laundry, and bush stems. I got it.

567
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:32,429
She is my wife.

568
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,934
It has been long since I had
a drink with my father-in-law,

569
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,873
so please feel free to drink.

570
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:51,982
According to what I heard,

571
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,322
it seems that you are not on good
terms with Gochuga these days.

572
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,240
I knew...

573
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,719
you did not summon me to
have drinks with me at leisure.

574
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:15,569
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

575
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,740
The high-spirited and
loyal vassals and scholars...

576
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,312
are writing up an appeal in secret.

577
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,500
An appeal?

578
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,370
For what?

579
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,713
They are asking to
reinstate the Sunno Tribe...

580
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,047
and recover their position
on the Five Tribe council.

581
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,526
I am putting together the young vassals.

582
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:44,411
It has been eight years since
we lost our honor to Gochuga.

583
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,934
It is time to bring
back the Sunno Tribe...

584
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,363
on the Five Tribe council.

585
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,404
Let us go inside. Yes, my lord.

586
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,610
It is obvious that Gochuga
will dismiss the appeal.

587
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,813
I am sure Lord Hae of the
Sono Tribe will take his side.

588
00:44:57,819 --> 00:44:58,669
Therefore,

589
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,856
we need your help, Lord Jin.

590
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,208
I am not sure if the Gyeru
Tribe will obediently withdraw.

591
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,096
A father-in-law oughts to...

592
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:14,779
side with his son-in-law.

593
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:17,649
Go Won Pyo's world...

594
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,950
will come to an end soon.

595
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,054
If you have too much on your
mind, it is hard to hit the target.

596
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,993
Today must be your lucky day.

597
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:49,769
You are hitting the target,

598
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,870
and you will be tipped off by your son.

599
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,203
Last night, Lord Jin
of the Gwanno Tribe...

600
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,874
was seen leaving the
King's chambers all drunk.

601
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,952
It seems Daedaero Kim
Pyeong Ji was also invited.

602
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:05,919
The time has come.

603
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,883
It is time to use the
blacklist I have been keeping.

604
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:19,659
So who do you think
will make it out alive?

605
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:27,425
An appeal? What kind of
nonsense are you talking about?

606
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:29,749
Keep your voice down!

607
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,743
Only the King and Daedaero know of this.

608
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,882
Then did you promise the King...

609
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,983
that you will turn away from
Gochuga and join hands with him?

610
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:42,856
It is not much of a promise.

611
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,554
I told them I got their intentions.

612
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,524
If you think about it, because
Gochuga behaved audaciously,

613
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,930
our tribe has always been neglected.

614
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,256
On top of that, the King
seemed really firm about this.

615
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,932
This is utterly unreasonable!

616
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,459
Your Highness.

617
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,639
Gochuga is merely
hiding his claws for now.

618
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:09,243
He is going to tear apart
the prey he lays his eyes on.

619
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:12,193
And yet, you are trying
to walk into his claws?

620
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,319
Is he really waiting for the right timing?

621
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,354
Do not act like you heard...

622
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,627
or know anything about the appeal.

623
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:26,154
Do not attend any meetings
Daedaero invites you to.

624
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,840
Not only our family...

625
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,108
but also the prince will
face severe punishment.

626
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,723
I have something I need
to urgently inform you.

627
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,217
His Majesty met with
my father in private...

628
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,238
and told him that the Sunno
Tribe will soon be reinstated.

629
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,892
What a good daughter you are.

630
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:02,579
Pardon?

631
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:06,225
The words you just said to
me saved your father's life.

632
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,302
If you had deliberately kept quiet,

633
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,969
it would have cost you your life.

634
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:30,939
There will be no revenge.

635
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:39,691
My name is On Dal, the
future general of this country.

636
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,937
We need to change the world,

637
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,084
so that the people can live
life to the fullest, without fear.

638
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:57,513
That is the country we must
build, the new Goguryeo.

639
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:01,349
You wicked witch!

640
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:04,983
The royal custom is
to be strictly observed.

641
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,889
How dare you get up
to this immoral mischief?

642
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,993
I can explain, Your Highness.

643
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:10,849
Shut it.

644
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:17,173
You were holding a superstitious
ritual at this sacred palace?

645
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:22,334
Since you obviously
have the nerve, tell me.

646
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,020
What did you pray for?

647
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:26,374
Did you pray that you
would give birth to a child...

648
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,180
and bring down the
Crown Prince and my son?

649
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,473
Absolutely not, Your Highness.

650
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:35,255
I only prayed that I would be
blessed with the King's grace.

651
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,280
The King's grace?

652
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,297
Then you shall be blessed
with my grace as well.

653
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:48,879
It hurts.

654
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,800
Be quiet! Stop!

655
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,080
Please do not hit me.

656
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,473
My Queen, what is going on here?

657
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,213
I was punishing Royal Consort Hyeon...

658
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:07,184
for being blinded by superstition...

659
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,790
and disturbing the order in the palace.

660
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:11,849
It hurts so much.

661
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,340
I gave her my permission.

662
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:19,094
I did because she was
desperate to become pregnant.

663
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,620
So leave her alone.

664
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,797
Still, this matter is in
the hands of women.

665
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,963
I ask you to stay out of it.

666
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:29,329
What did you say?

667
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,624
Do you dare to tell me
what is right and wrong?

668
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,350
Your Majesty, there is a problem.

669
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:50,862
Are you on your way to the meeting?

670
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,040
I advise you not to.

671
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,040
What? What are you talking about?

672
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,838
I assume you are going to
discuss the appeal with the scholars.

673
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,129
How did you know that?

674
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,060
You should not go there.

675
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,847
My father has dispatched soldiers there.

676
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,280
Get them!

677
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,700
No! Take him.

678
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:30,119
Come!

679
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:44,012
What on earth is going on?

680
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:55,826
Seven were arrested and locked up.

681
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,100
Not enough blood has been
shed to quench my thirst.

682
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,597
There are two people left to kill.

683
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,550
The king's daughter...

684
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,190
And On Hyeop's son.

685
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,303
I will take care of it with
the most agile soldiers.

686
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,380
It is best if Geon does not know.

687
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:24,753
Let him hear the news of
the princess's death afterward.

688
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:25,609
Yes.

689
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,176
What are you thinking about?

690
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,207
I did not know you were coming.

691
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,973
You were obviously too busy to invite me,

692
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,579
so I invited myself.

693
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,614
A lot happened both inside
and outside the palace today.

694
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,087
So I am hoping to drink here quietly.

695
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:00,586
What happened at the palace?

696
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:01,639
Well...

697
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:05,809
The queen stopped a ritual
halfway through or something.

698
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:08,019
But enough of that.

699
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:10,364
Bring me food and drinks.

700
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,637
You should come back another time.

701
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,737
I will prepare a feast for you.

702
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:17,242
What are you so busy with?

703
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,503
That is not it.

704
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:22,837
Did you successfully deal
with the princess's matter?

705
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,652
I saw her visit you urgently.

706
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:28,729
Were you spying on me?

707
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,560
You seemed to be hiding
many secrets from me.

708
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,560
Will you have a drink with
me and tell me about it?

709
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,670
Dal.

710
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,170
You look a mess.

711
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,269
Are you okay?

712
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:14,819
When...

713
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:21,989
How did you get here?

714
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:25,042
I am sorry. I put you through so much.

715
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:29,017
I need to get rid of the
poison inside me first.

716
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:33,273
Only then can I start
learning true martial arts.

717
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:34,959
You have done enough.

718
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,013
This is enough. Follow me back home.

719
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,699
Your mother is waiting.

720
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,139
What is it?

721
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,230
The Ga Jin I know...

722
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,833
never tells me to give up.

723
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:50,839
That means...

724
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,410
you are fake.

725
00:55:57,279 --> 00:55:59,946
You are just an illusion that I created.

726
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:16,182
What an extraordinary guy.

727
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:19,884
I thought it would take
you at least a full month.

728
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,250
Look at this guy.

729
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,780
I miss Ga Jin.

730
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:31,969
I will go see her, and
come back to learn from you,

731
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,450
Master.

732
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:44,599
All right.

733
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:49,869
Eat this.

734
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:08,859
Here.

735
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:23,839
Mother.

736
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,010
Mother?

737
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:53,429
By the way, where is Dal?

738
00:58:54,249 --> 00:58:56,049
Dal could not come with me.

739
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,530
He had some things to do.

740
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:04,309
Mother.

741
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,520
Mother.

742
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:49,990
Mother.

743
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,916
Mother, where are you going?

744
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:00,129
Princess.

745
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:06,397
I have fulfilled my duties as
a mother to my young master.

746
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:09,179
Now I must go.

747
01:00:11,459 --> 01:00:13,139
He has an innocent soul.

748
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:16,679
Please look after him.

749
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,590
You cannot do this.

750
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:25,489
If you leave like this,

751
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,060
what will Dal and I do?

752
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,420
I lost my mother when I was very young.

753
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,290
I did not know what a
mother's love felt like.

754
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,510
Only now...

755
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,957
Only now was I happy
to have found a mother.

756
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,830
Why are you abandoning me now?

757
01:00:58,009 --> 01:00:58,859
Princess.

758
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:01,859
No.

759
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,870
I am your daughter.

760
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,500
Please.

761
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,840
Please, do not leave.

762
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,820
Mother? Run away. Hurry.

763
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:36,629
Hurry!

764
01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:41,212
Listen to your mother. Go.

765
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:54,609
My child.

766
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,403
Hurry and run away. Hurry.

767
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,137
If you wish to save the old woman,

768
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,020
do not resist my blade.

769
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,500
Go.

770
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:21,809
My child.

771
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:35,619
My child.

772
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,520
Dal.

773
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,483
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

774
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:58,154
It is not your fault.

775
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,384
They were people sent
by Go Won Pyo to kill us.

776
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,070
You speak like a killer.

777
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,354
Do I not look pathetic to you?

778
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,040
My lady, do you love me?

779
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,036
Do you not want to know
who stole that gravestone?

780
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:13,369
The person you must
risk your life to protect,

781
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,307
that is the reason a
man takes up the sword.

782
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,020
I will protect my woman.

783
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,444
Go and attack. Attack
and seize what is yours.

784
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:25,034
Whether or not you follow,
the traitors will be punished.

785
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,150
Father, Father!

786
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,750
I deceived you.

787
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:31,921
I stole away your heart
and your life to use you.

788
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:33,814
I knew that and went along with
you anyway, so I was not deceived.

789
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,024
I am not worth all this. You
are the fate I have chosen.

790
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,710
My wife, my one and only.
