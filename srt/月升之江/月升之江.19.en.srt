00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,204
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,242
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,344
Starting with Silla, I
will behead Go Geon...

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,550
and then unify the three nations!

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,184
The man just right for the job...

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,057
is your husband, General On.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,620
Go to him and persuade him.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,027
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
I am going to find you.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,250
You will fail...

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,164
because I will make sure no one finds me.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,703
An envoy came from Silla, and he is...

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,470
An envoy from Silla?

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,003
Are you not the traitor Go Geon?

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,807
Are you here to die in your own land?

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,830
EPISODE 19

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,950
I came to see you, Your Highness.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,217
I thought it would be more meaningful...

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,220
to see you one last time...

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,023
than to live a meaningless life in Silla.

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,963
Your plan will never go your way...

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,950
as the King...

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
plans to send back the envoys.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
I want to ask you one more thing.

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,950
That night...

26
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,850
Was it your sword?

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,100
That stabbed my father?

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,050
That is right.

29
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,807
Just like how your father...

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
shot an arrow at my mother.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,144
It should end with that night.

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,222
The resentment and ill
fates should end with us.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,123
Princess, the ill fates...

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,793
could have ended long ago.

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,042
If the two families came
together through a royal wedding,

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,924
you and I would have changed this empire.

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,810
Not at all.

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
It would have become the world...

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,877
of the Gyeru Tribe that
Gochuga dreamed of.

40
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,970
Go back to Silla.

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,850
And forget all of your memories from here.

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,550
There is a woman who only loves you.

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,357
I am here to die. I want to die...

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,460
to end our ill fate.

45
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,590
Please stop.

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,350
Leave.

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
I will not.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
What?
Because...

49
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,740
I followed you to save you.

50
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,190
Return safely, Master Go.

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
I will not see you out.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,527
You asked to see me at such a late hour.

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,740
What is this?

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,697
As the leader of the Five Tribe council,

55
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,850
I came here...

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,732
to tell you that Go Geon
must not be allowed to live.

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,120
What is this arrow for?

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,858
When I went to confiscate
Gyeru Tribe's assets,

59
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,060
I happened to find it.

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,070
Go Won Pyo's servant...

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,260
told me the story behind this arrow.

62
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,170
This is the arrow that was used to kill...

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,520
Queen Yeon, your mother.

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
It is that very arrow.

65
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,020
Go Won Pyo.

66
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,180
He seems to have kept it like a trophy.

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Will you still let that man's son live?

68
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,820
Oh my, Princess.

69
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,550
Gwanno Tribe's Lord
Jin went to see the King.

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,084
What for? At this late hour?

71
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,610
I do not know that,

72
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,860
but the King just summoned his bodyguards.

73
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,763
Master Go, you must get away.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,350
Why?

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,567
Did the King decide to kill me?

76
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,810
Yes, he will.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,420
So you must get away.

78
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,420
If I act as kindling.

79
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,383
Goguryeo will go down in flames.

80
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,944
I came here expecting that.

81
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,883
Bring your own men and fight.

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,153
Do not die a pointless death.

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,484
If you want to avenge
your father, do so properly.

84
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,423
If you return as a commander,

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,540
then I will take you on.

86
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,607
We are going to the library.

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,064
We must find some diplomatic papers.

88
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,604
The envoys cannot leave.

89
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,804
Are you stopping me because
you do not know who I am?

90
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,490
If you do not believe me,

91
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,750
come with us.

92
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,220
Follow me.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,200
The envoys disappeared!

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,830
Search thoroughly!

95
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,840
Find them!

96
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,063
This could put the Princess in danger.

97
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,507
Would you rather turn back now?

98
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,760
No.

99
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,630
She bruised my ego.

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,760
I must return the favor.

101
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,687
What did you two talk about?

102
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,550
Or was it...

103
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,923
a sweet conversation that you had wanted?

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,093
The main roads will be searched.

105
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,963
Horses will do us no good.

106
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,764
We will have to walk to the
border. Can you manage?

107
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,337
We will not be safe even in Silla.

108
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,877
The established authority...

109
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,804
will not look upon us with favor.

110
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,810
We must get out of here first.

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,970
Where is Go Geon?

112
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,770
I asked you where he is.

113
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,090
I helped him escape.

114
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,980
What?

115
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,024
He will have left the palace by now...

116
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,310
and hid himself.

117
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Send soldiers to go after him!

118
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,053
Also, arrest the Princess.

119
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,460
Your Majesty.

120
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,030
You heard me.

121
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,793
Arrest her and throw her in prison!

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes, sire.
Yes, sire.

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,750
Let me go.

124
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,490
I will go myself.

125
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,320
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,484
Your Majesty! Please calm down.

127
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,770
Shut your mouth!

128
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,780
Walk!

129
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,220
Get down!

130
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,280
Let go!

131
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,220
You must hold back.

132
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,020
You fools!

133
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,780
Do you know who you have tied up?

134
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,414
We were ordered to bring in
everyone from the Sunno Tribe.

135
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,287
What? That is just nonsense!

136
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,330
Release them.

137
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,470
Lord Yeon.

138
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
This is nonsense.

139
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,570
Treason?

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,960
Our tribe has been through this before.

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,610
We will not repeat it.

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,767
So tell your men to stand down.

143
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,434
But the Princess and Lord Sa...

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
If we cause a fuss here,

145
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,443
it will only put the Princess at risk.

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,700
Did you catch Go Geon?

147
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,650
We cannot trace him.

148
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,140
You failed to get him?

149
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,227
That news just ruined my appetite.

150
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,380
Your Majesty.

151
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,470
Do you truly believe the
Princess plotted treason?

152
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,428
Is that why you ordered the
Sunno Tribe to be brought in?

153
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,114
You have served since my
father's reign, so you must know.

154
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
My sister...

155
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,454
had never hidden her
ambition to become the ruler.

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,820
That is not true.

157
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,324
She only did what she
could for the royal family...

158
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,330
I do not care what she thinks.

159
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,300
As King, I decide whether
she is a traitor or not.

160
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,062
She helped Go Geon escape
and that made things clear.

161
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,970
Your father also made the same mistake.

162
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,143
He chose to doubt rather than to believe.

163
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,917
I beg you to not repeat that tragedy.

164
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,447
That hangs on the Princess' decision.

165
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,500
Get in there!
Move it.

166
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Lord Sa!
Move!

167
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,440
Stop!

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,720
I apologize.

169
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,493
I lacked judgment and got you in trouble.

170
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,750
Why are you here as well?

171
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
General Sa. Jin.

172
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,660
Princess.

173
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,207
Since you first came to Ghost Valley,

174
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
we became your subjects.

175
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,290
Please do not fear...

176
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
and do not falter.

177
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,930
Move!
Walk ahead.

178
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,084
Move along!
They say that right prevails.

179
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,384
It will all work out.

180
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,070
Do not worry, Ga Jin.

181
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,727
Princess! Do not do this!
Princess.

182
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,570
I must see the King!

183
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,550
Send word!

184
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,550
Go, now!

185
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,348
Release the Sunno Tribe
chief and the warriors.

186
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,930
If I do,

187
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,257
they will side with you and threaten me.

188
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,640
That will not happen.

189
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,870
Then...

190
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,250
prove your loyalty.

191
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,404
Silla took Adan Fortress from
us during our father's reign.

192
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,610
I want to recover that key point.

193
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,647
Get General On to take it back.

194
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,100
I already told you.

195
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,353
General On will not fight again.

196
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,840
Then...

197
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,263
why did you go to see him?

198
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,293
You went to his hiding place.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
What did you talk about?

200
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,380
How do you know that?

201
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,177
Did you ask him to fight with you?

202
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,844
To help you oust the young, lacking King,

203
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,530
so you could take over?

204
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,940
Won.

205
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
If you feel wronged,

206
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,170
show your loyalty.

207
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
I would rather...

208
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,980
you kill me.

209
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,160
Take my life...

210
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,010
as a token of my loyalty.

211
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,420
I understand.

212
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,540
What did I tell you?

213
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,770
She will not listen.

214
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,220
I am tired. Please leave.

215
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,617
What will you do about General On?

216
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,987
He may live as a hermit now,

217
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,714
but if something happens to the Princess,

218
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,653
he will come after you first.

219
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,620
Be careful.

220
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,410
Lord Sa. Are you all right?

221
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,630
I am fine.

222
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,884
I am glad this is the end of it.

223
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,384
The skies have helped us.

224
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,750
That is not true.

225
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
Jin.
What do you mean?

226
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,024
Lord Sa. Were you not all released...

227
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,894
because the misunderstanding
was explained?

228
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,700
The Princess took the fall.

229
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,764
Instead of denying it, she just...

230
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,134
Jin, that is enough.

231
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,820
Keep your mouth shut.

232
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,040
The Princess...

233
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,144
took the blame for
something that did not happen.

234
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,000
What?

235
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,453
To avoid going against the King,

236
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,514
she said she would take the blame.

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,453
Then what will happen to her?

238
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,410
Lord Sa.

239
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,120
The King ordered...

240
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,350
she be beheaded.

241
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,090
SEORABEOL, SILLA

242
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,690
They insulted our name.

243
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,074
Our offer of alliance was refused,

244
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,684
and the officers who
accompanied them were imprisoned.

245
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,823
And yet, to save their own skin,

246
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,414
they fled in disgrace.

247
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,068
This is a grave crime and
they must pay with their lives.

248
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,010
Is any of that untrue?

249
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,470
Lord Kim, you think so
much of Silla's reputation,

250
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,804
and yet your actions
do not follow your words.

251
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,543
What you just said does not sound honest.

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,690
What?

253
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,080
His actions do not follow his words?

254
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,500
Yes.

255
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,060
Lord Kim...

256
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,490
sent this woman as a spy...

257
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,084
and traveled to Goguryeo many times.

258
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,957
Each time, he took
valuable jewels, silver,

259
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,150
and even Goguryeo women.

260
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,580
For his personal gain.

261
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,570
With the excuse of serving Silla,

262
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,970
did you fill your own pockets?

263
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,504
That is not true.

264
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,977
He said the riches were for the King.

265
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,950
As it was to benefit Silla,

266
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,814
I was told not to care
about profits or losses.

267
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,020
Once a thief...

268
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,284
is forever a thief, Your Majesty.

269
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,970
I asked around myself.

270
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,953
I was able to confirm that...

271
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,394
whenever he visited Baekje,
he took riches for his own gain.

272
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,760
Even from Baekje?

273
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,230
I took in you Goguryeo stragglers...

274
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,107
and now you are stabbing me in the back?

275
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,910
Before his nation,

276
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,143
he puts his livelihood first.

277
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,047
You must not keep him close.

278
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,010
Do not believe them.

279
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
This is a trap.

280
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,260
I am bring framed.

281
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,730
We will see about that.

282
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,730
Drag him outside.
Yes, sire!

283
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,350
You cannot do this.

284
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,227
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

285
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,390
I am innocent!

286
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,820
Leave us.

287
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,230
Kim Cha Seung...

288
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,380
will be punished for
whatever crimes he committed.

289
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,120
How will you...

290
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,027
pay for failing to do your duty...

291
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,720
as my envoy?

292
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,650
Give me...

293
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,020
10,000 of your men.

294
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,920
I will attack Goguryeo...

295
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,843
and expand Silla's territory.

296
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,150
How can I...

297
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,550
entrust you with 10,000 of my soldiers?

298
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,580
I saw for myself that...

299
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,314
Goguryeo does not have a
commander to defend their land.

300
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
They only have paper tigers...

301
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,020
who are sick and old.

302
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
I heard that...

303
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,058
Princess Pyeonggang managed
to fight off Baekje's attack.

304
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,017
King Yeongyang is jealous of his sister,

305
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,530
so he has her locked up.

306
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,070
Now is the right time.

307
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,523
If you give me 10,000 men,

308
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,597
I will turn Goguryeo land...

309
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,980
into Silla.

310
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
How about 30,000 men?

311
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,417
To take Pyeongyang Castle as well,

312
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,988
I think you will need
at least 30,000 soldiers.

313
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,630
You cannot.

314
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,610
If you go now,

315
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,853
you will not return alive.

316
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,410
Then on my funeral rite,

317
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,694
light enough incense for me.

318
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,550
General!

319
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,734
I need no signs to show
me the path I must take.

320
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,100
I must follow it.

321
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,404
I do not know about the consequences.

322
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,090
Even if you win, General,

323
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,650
you will not win the Princess.

324
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,420
The Princess...

325
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,600
will soon be executed.

326
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,750
I know.

327
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,090
That is why I must fight.

328
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,013
It is the only path left for me.

329
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,982
I wonder if this is too
small to build a hut, Mother.

330
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,070
You scoundrels.

331
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,634
You must be here to rob a
house when the owner is not home.

332
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,920
Where is On Dal?

333
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,130
On Dal?

334
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,574
Is that the name of the mutt in your yard?

335
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,874
This is my house.

336
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
It is your house?

337
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,613
Then reveal your identity.

338
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,584
How dare some petty
thieves order me around?

339
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,440
Get him.

340
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,120
Wol Gwang?

341
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,920
Master?

342
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,410
Master?

343
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,880
Master!

344
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,610
Master.

345
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,320
Master.

346
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,860
What are you doing?

347
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,220
I am digging a grave.

348
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,337
Whose grave?
Of course, it is for my Master.

349
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,360
You died!

350
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Did you not die?

351
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,087
This must be your grave, not mine.

352
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,910
It hurts.

353
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,980
Are you really alive?

354
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,803
You are not a ghost, are you?

355
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,170
I am not a ghost,

356
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,934
but I do feel like a pig.

357
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,807
You definitely had no pulse,

358
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,944
and you were not breathing.

359
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,074
Once you have trained as much as I,

360
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,984
you can last an entire night...

361
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,544
as if you are dead, even
though you are alive.

362
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,590
Is that true?

363
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,184
Why are you so curious...

364
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,154
when you are the one who left
before learning all I have to teach?

365
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,524
I knew those assassins would
only leave once they had fulfilled...

366
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,210
their duty to the last.

367
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,788
So I simply pretended to
be dead for a little while.

368
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,280
Were those assassins
really sent by the King?

369
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,800
To kill me?

370
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,900
Rest assured.

371
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,154
Now they know you
do not live in this house,

372
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,154
and they believe they have
killed the owner of the house.

373
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,840
They will not return.

374
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,467
If he has sent assassins after me,

375
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,964
that means something has
happened to Ga Jin as well.

376
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,204
What has happened?

377
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,890
You know, do you not?

378
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,213
Why does it matter to you?

379
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,884
You have become a recluse,
cutting yourself off from the world.

380
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,570
Please tell me, Master.

381
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,327
The King has imprisoned Ga Jin.

382
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,950
What?

383
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,900
He has become suspicious...

384
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,164
that Ga Jin is plotting treason.

385
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,894
That makes no sense.
Why would Ga Jin do that?

386
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,420
Power cannot be split, even
between a parent and child.

387
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,852
Furthermore, once a sister
who is both wise and skilled...

388
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,947
began to receive the
respect of the people,

389
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,517
the King must have become anxious.

390
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,740
So...

391
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,420
what will happen to Ga Jin?

392
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,227
If she cannot prove her innocence,

393
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,610
she will be executed.

394
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,230
This is absurd.

395
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,638
How can she prove her innocence
of something she has not done?

396
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,630
Sister.

397
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,672
Do not choose a path that leads
to death, when there is one to life.

398
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
General On is your sword.

399
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,293
As soon as we recover Adan Fortress...

400
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,894
both you and my
brother-in-law will be able to live.

401
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,340
My path to life...

402
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,373
is to die for that person.

403
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,590
Must you be so stubborn?

404
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,900
You can save yourself if
you just persuade the General.

405
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,270
Won.

406
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,084
He is someone who became my sword...

407
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,423
and waded through a river of blood.

408
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,480
To satisfy my ambitions,

409
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
he continued to wound himself.

410
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,110
At last, he has returned...

411
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,890
to the life he desired.

412
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,590
Therefore,

413
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,150
I am ashamed...

414
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,030
and grateful.

415
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,700
Is that truly...

416
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,110
your dying wish?

417
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,020
My life...

418
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,803
is not under your control.

419
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,650
I have already decided...

420
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,790
to dedicate it to him.

421
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,530
That was a great meal.

422
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,510
Master.

423
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,090
You said it was Adan Fortress?

424
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,790
Does the King wish to have it?

425
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,194
Do not think foolish thoughts.

426
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,194
But Ga Jin...

427
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,424
If you find it difficult to let go,

428
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,230
come to the temple with me.

429
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,704
I have no intention of becoming a monk.

430
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,204
My mother's grave is here as well.

431
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,477
That is all anguish and obsession.

432
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,136
You have not even let go of your
mother, much less the Princess.

433
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,317
How must I deal with this fool?

434
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,300
Master.

435
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
I have a request.

436
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,824
You want me to find out what
situation the Princess is in.

437
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,730
I will not do it. It is
too much of a bother.

438
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,330
That is not it.

439
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,933
It is a different request.

440
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,970
Mother.

441
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
Are you going?

442
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,310
Have you decided to go?

443
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,720
Yes.

444
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,373
You sure are the biggest fool...

445
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,690
in the whole wide world.

446
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,947
Whom you took in and raised.

447
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,287
I will see you again when I come back...

448
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,020
after seeing Ga Jin.

449
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,640
This is the last time.

450
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,990
Your Highness.

451
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,120
I am grateful...

452
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,503
that a lowly woman like me...

453
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,432
had the honor of looking
after you for so many years.

454
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,850
Now go back to the Princess...

455
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,250
and live a long happy life with her.

456
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,103
If you will excuse me now, Your Highness.

457
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,680
Do not call me that.

458
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,983
I will always be your son,

459
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,920
and you will always be my mother.

460
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,620
My dear Dal.

461
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,770
My sweet Dal.

462
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,910
Thank you so much.

463
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,090
Thank you.

464
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,990
Mother.

465
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,070
Dal.

466
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,950
I will see you...

467
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,750
in the next life.

468
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,540
My goodness.

469
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,650
Stop.

470
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,750
You are here, Dal.

471
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
I am honored...

472
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,140
to see you again, Princess.

473
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,153
To repay the kindness of Your Majesty,

474
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,540
I, On Dal,

475
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,197
vow to retake Adan Fortress.

476
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,670
Lord Sa.

477
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,770
Lord Sa.

478
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Was the execution carried out?

479
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,490
It was stopped.

480
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,924
What are you talking about?

481
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,610
General On Dal is back.

482
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,060
Dal is back?

483
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,070
What happened to the Princess?

484
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,504
What happened to her?

485
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,310
She was put back in prison.

486
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,544
Let us enter the palace.

487
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,230
Sure. We must. Let us go.

488
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,250
I am so relieved.

489
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,380
Poor Ga Jin.

490
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,010
Therefore,

491
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,730
I humbly ask you to allow me 5,000 troops.

492
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,864
Did you say 5,000?

493
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,064
If I do, are you sure you
can retake Adan Fortress?

494
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

495
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,230
In addition,

496
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,730
I will retake Gaeripyeong as well
as the land west of Jungryeong.

497
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,077
You should not make an empty promise.

498
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,520
I can guess why you returned here...

499
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,400
all of a sudden.

500
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,454
It is out of your desperation
to save the Princess,

501
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,310
is it not?

502
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

503
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,660
As a man trying to save his wife,

504
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,637
I do not make an empty promise.

505
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,250
It is not acceptable...

506
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,918
to make a promise that
cannot be carried out...

507
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,543
just to win His Majesty's favor.

508
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,004
The troops are still exhausted...

509
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,410
from fighting off the Baekje troops.

510
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,120
Daedaero is right.

511
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,014
It will take a while for
them to fully recover.

512
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,614
I am sure General On can take care of it.

513
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,220
Silence, all of you.

514
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,010
Given the situation, I can
only allow you 3,000 troops.

515
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,563
Can you still retake Adan Fortress?

516
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,610
If you can believe the Princess'
innocence and set her free,

517
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
I am ready...

518
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,750
to go out and fight.

519
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,540
Dal.

520
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,124
His Majesty has given his permission.

521
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,170
You are free.

522
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,864
Let me take you to Magnolia Hall.

523
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,534
What did you promise him?

524
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,207
Did you promise to retake Adan Fortress?

525
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,334
Is that why His Majesty set me free?

526
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,407
No, it is not like that.
On Dal.

527
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,500
You did.

528
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
You promised that.

529
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,770
Ga Jin.

530
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,224
I am excited to be back in
the palace after many years.

531
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,130
I want to eat good food
and see some people.

532
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Why did you do that?

533
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,510
You should not have come.

534
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,920
You fool.

535
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,403
Why do you never think about yourself?

536
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,140
Yes, I am...

537
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,560
a fool.

538
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,750
But let us get out of here first.

539
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,013
I hate seeing you locked up like this.

540
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,614
You promised me to
go hide in the mountains.

541
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,887
I could not find anywhere to hide.

542
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,197
I had no choice but to come back to you.

543
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,264
Please send General On back.

544
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,137
I will retake Adan Fortress.

545
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,460
Princess.

546
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,007
I would have been executed anyway.

547
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,604
I will give up my life
to get the fortress back.

548
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,290
Who says you may step in?

549
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,514
I am the one who received
His Majesty's order.

550
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
It is not your choice to make.

551
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,020
I will go. Please give the order.

552
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,984
It has already been decided.
Please do not take your order back.

553
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,840
Dal.

554
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,250
I said I will go.

555
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,294
Seeing the two of
you fight out of loyalty,

556
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,200
I cannot believe what
a fortunate king I am.

557
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,947
What could they be
talking about in secret?

558
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,443
There is nothing to worry about.

559
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,720
He is back here after many years.

560
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,314
I am sure there is much to talk about.

561
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,840
Did you not see it?

562
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,324
He confidently announced that he
came to receive His Majesty's order.

563
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,130
All he has is 3,000 troops.

564
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,633
General On may be a brilliant warrior,

565
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,700
but it will be an impossible task...

566
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,034
to recover Adan Fortress.

567
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,773
How can you be so relaxed?

568
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,790
If he happens to win,

569
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,474
he will get in Geon Mu's
way. Do you not know that?

570
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,160
What do you mean by that?

571
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,492
The Princess has strong
support from the people.

572
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,957
Now that General On joined her,

573
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,590
who will be able to stop them?

574
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,693
We still have His Majesty.

575
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,793
His Majesty will not sit back...

576
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,680
and let them gain power.

577
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,864
General On should not have
been given such an important task.

578
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,003
There is nothing to worry about.

579
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,743
He will not be victorious.

580
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,177
He is only going to face death.

581
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,930
But we cannot take...

582
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,110
any chances.

583
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,340
Then...

584
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,426
how about the both of
you go off to war together?

585
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,367
That cannot be done.
No, it cannot.

586
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,910
It cannot be done?

587
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,720
No.

588
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,300
I do not wish General On...

589
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,874
to fight in a war ever again.

590
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,813
Do you know why I told you...

591
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,017
to call General On to the Capital?

592
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,522
It is for the crucial task
that the late King has left me.

593
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,317
The unification of the three empires.

594
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,260
We need General On to accomplish the task.

595
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,994
Adan Fortress is only
the first step of our task.

596
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,564
It has not been long since we
defended our empire from Baekje.

597
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,303
We cannot make our people ravaged by war.

598
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,074
It is the unification
of the three empires.

599
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,930
Not a war.

600
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,684
I clearly told you three days ago...

601
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,370
to renew the weapons...

602
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,570
that have become rusty.

603
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
And to change all the grips...

604
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,860
that have rotted.

605
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,580
Can you not see the rust?

606
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,604
We tried as hard as we could,

607
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,004
but three days were just not enough.

608
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,010
We are about to go off to war,

609
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,644
and you want my soldiers to
fight with these rusty swords?

610
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,917
I will take care of the weapons...

611
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,572
since you must not know
how things are done in Silla.

612
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,120
Did you see that?

613
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,333
The swords are too dull...

614
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,063
for me to kill him with one strike.

615
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,090
General.

616
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
I will kill you with my sword.

617
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,640
Those who disobey a royal command...

618
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,213
shall be ruled by death...

619
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,600
regardless of rank.

620
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,214
Make full preparations for war.

621
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,953
Yes, General.
Yes, General.

622
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,127
I hear you killed an
officer in the armory.

623
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,324
That is true, Your Majesty.

624
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,694
I told him to repair
all the weapons, but...

625
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,500
That was an irrational act.

626
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,037
The soldiers are about to go off to war.

627
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,370
You are to raise their morale,

628
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,360
not kill one of them.

629
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,174
It is essential to establish
discipline to raise their morale.

630
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,380
You can get up.

631
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,654
Silla's soldiers are different
from Goguryeo's soldiers.

632
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,554
As a general, you must
figure out the difference...

633
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,840
to command them.

634
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,197
You are right, Your Majesty.

635
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,663
From what I have observed,

636
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,803
the soldiers of Silla are too lazy.

637
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,130
What did you say?

638
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,940
The soldiers of Goguryeo...

639
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,774
defend their empire from
Northern Zhou in the north,

640
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,380
and from Baekje and Silla in the south.

641
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,474
All of their borders
are practically at war.

642
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,744
That is why their soldiers in all ranks...

643
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,883
are ready to fight at all times.

644
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,044
But the soldiers of Silla...
Shut it.

645
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,714
Are you insulting my soldiers...

646
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,920
in my presence?

647
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,438
As you have granted me the
authority to control the army,

648
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,533
I will fight with soldiers...

649
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,527
that are capable of winning.

650
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,970
If my resolution seemed reckless,

651
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,973
you may take away my authority instantly.

652
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,883
If you only said words of flattery,

653
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,783
I would have dismissed you right away.

654
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,470
General,

655
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,453
make my soldiers stronger.

656
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,188
I will pour my heart and
soul into it, Your Majesty.

657
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,040
General On Dal is back
in Pyeongyang Castle.

658
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,604
He will head to Adan
Fortress in a few days...

659
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,974
to attack the soldiers of Silla
and uphold the royal command.

660
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,988
Princess Pyeonggang
may go off to war with him.

661
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,154
I am concerned that they may
win the hearts of the people again...

662
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,840
and command the empire.

663
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,740
Deal with this quickly.

664
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,960
Princess Pyeonggang.

665
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,134
I will write her a
letter. Take it with you.

666
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,180
Yes, My Lady.

667
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,052
I hear you are almost
done with the preparation.

668
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,130
I just saw...

669
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,420
your messenger...

670
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,293
who frequently goes to Pyeongyang Castle.

671
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,970
Do you still send spies to Goguryeo?

672
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,190
To whom?

673
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,060
For what?

674
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,240
It is just one of those regular spying.

675
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,080
You just burned away the message,
and you call it regular spying?

676
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,524
You are secretly exchanging
messages with Queen Jin, are you not?

677
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,810
I must be right.

678
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,730
I wondered why Queen Jin...

679
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,440
took my side.

680
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,507
She was conspiring with you.

681
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,604
Did you promise her that you will...

682
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,066
give them Silla's confidential
information to save me?

683
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,504
You do not need to be
concerned about this.

684
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,902
Then what was the message
that you burned away about?

685
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,300
Lady Hae.

686
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,300
The King...

687
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,046
ordered to strengthen the
security around the Capital.

688
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,724
I feel bad that it was
not about the Princess...

689
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,410
you wanted to hear about.

690
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,356
I, On Dal, honorably
accept the King's command...

691
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,917
to go and retake Adan Fortress.

692
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,614
We will regain Goguryeo's territory...

693
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,887
and offer it to you, Your Majesty.

694
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,124
I hope you will govern our empire...

695
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,997
and regain Goguryeo's glory.

696
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,400
I will look forward to your victory.

697
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,350
At your command.

698
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,533
At your command.
At your command.

699
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,713
At your command.
At your command.

700
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,013
At your command.
At your command.

701
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,610
I have received your message safely.

702
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,374
The soldiers of Silla are soon
leaving to fight against Goguryeo.

703
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,984
Adan Fortress will be
ready for them as well.

704
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,510
The Princess and General
On will not make it out alive,

705
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,770
so do not worry.

706
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,150
Mother.

707
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:47,530
Prince Geon Mu.

708
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,090
What happened?

709
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,074
I fell while running on the stairs.

710
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,040
My goodness.

711
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,940
It is nothing. It is just a scratch.

712
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,343
What do you mean? You are bleeding.

713
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,944
Bring a towel and an ointment.
Yes, Your Highness.

714
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:03,800
Come here.

715
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:13,980
Geon Mu.

716
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,463
Your body is not yours alone.

717
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,558
Your health is what
determines the fate of Goguryeo.

718
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,834
So make sure not to be hurt carelessly.

719
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,520
I will keep that in mind.

720
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,073
Mother, His Majesty is waiting for me.

721
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,717
All right. You can go ahead.

722
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,654
The stairs in front of
the Hall of Convenience...

723
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,214
is fun to run up and down.

724
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,484
I also often had fun running
up and down those stairs.

725
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,690
I got hurt too.

726
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,510
You did too?
Of course.

727
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,694
Pyeonggang jumped from several stairs...

728
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,380
although she was a girl.

729
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,822
Since our brave sister and
her husband went to fight,

730
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,607
we will soon regain Adan Fortress.

731
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,080
It will not be easy.

732
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,144
We must pray the
skies will look after them.

733
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,414
Even without its help, I
am sure they will make it.

734
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,884
Because they will fight for
Goguryeo with their loyalty to you.

735
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,740
Loyalty?

736
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,063
Where did you put the book that was here?

737
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,563
Prince Geon Mu took it with him.

738
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,320
What?

739
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,818
All right. Let us start
from where we left off.

740
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,450
What is that letter?

741
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,240
Give it to me.

742
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,610
What are you waiting for?

743
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,027
Make her kneel.
Your Majesty.

744
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,597
Your Majesty, you cannot do this to her!

745
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,990
Mother!

746
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,890
Geon Mu.

747
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,210
Step aside, Prince Geon Mu.

748
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,160
Now!

749
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,490
You are the Queen of Goguryeo,

750
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,794
and yet you sold our empire
to Silla by conspiring with them?

751
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,780
Are you not ashamed to
stand in front of the late King?

752
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,980
It was foolish of me,

753
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,710
but I only did that for you, Your Majesty.

754
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,560
What did you just say?

755
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,304
You did that for me?

756
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,784
What will happen if the Princess
and General On win the war?

757
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,790
They will covet your throne...

758
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,420
with the support from the people.

759
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,510
Did you not also...

760
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,354
worry about the
Princess's traitorous mind?

761
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,640
Shut your mouth!

762
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,294
She must have conspired with
them even when Go Geon was here.

763
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,756
That must be why she asked
you to send him back alive!

764
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,850
That is...

765
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,343
She has committed an unpardonable sin.

766
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,240
She deserves to be executed, Your Majesty.

767
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,974
But she is the Queen of the late King...

768
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,674
and the mother of Prince Geon Mu.

769
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,013
That is why her sin is even graver.

770
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,790
Your Majesty!

771
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,310
I will pay for the sin...

772
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,540
the Queen has committed!

773
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,663
Please execute me instead!

774
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,280
Father...
Let go of me!

775
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,270
I was never enough as a father...

776
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,634
to have a blessed daughter like her.

777
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,320
She is my daughter...

778
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,490
before she is the Queen.

779
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,417
I will pay for her sin as her father!

780
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,953
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

781
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,570
Mother...

782
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,600
Your Majesty!

783
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,434
We will be able to reach Adan Fortress...

784
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,434
when the day breaks if
we keep moving at night.

785
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,544
We cannot fight against
them without getting any sleep.

786
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,304
We should move as fast as we can...

787
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,210
so that the soldiers
can take a nap at least.

788
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,184
How is the security around Adan Fortress?

789
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,884
The security at the north and
the west gate are the heaviest.

790
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,184
Then the advance party...

791
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,624
should infiltrate through the
waterway underneath the east gate.

792
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,554
As soon as we take down the gate,

793
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,124
we will force our way
into its headquarters.

794
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,090
General Woo,

795
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,194
Jin, and General Sa.
Please take care of the rest.

796
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,733
Yes, Your Highness.
Yes, Your Highness.

797
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,183
The soldiers are watching.

798
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,883
That is why I am leaning on you.

799
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,454
I want them to think that
we are very much in love,

800
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,890
so that they will be
full of fighting spirit.

801
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,150
Ga Jin.

802
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,663
You are smart and good at what you do,

803
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,307
but you can be silly sometimes.

804
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,660
I have been thinking.

805
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,620
About what?

806
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,274
I think our first child should be a
girl to help me with house chores.

807
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,114
And then we could have boys.

808
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,084
Since the youngest is the cutest,

809
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,184
let us have a daughter.

810
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,054
You are too ahead of yourself.

811
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,260
We are already very much in love.

812
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,793
We just need to take the next step.

813
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,313
Oh, look. Look over there!

814
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,610
Hurry! Come!

815
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,040
It is wild ginseng!

816
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,620
Come over here!

817
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,624
A wild ginseng that
tastes like bellflower root?

818
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,470
Quiet. If I say it is wild
ginseng, then it is wild ginseng.

819
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,280
Wow, look at this.

820
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,990
Here.

821
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,740
Have some wild ginseng and cheer up.

822
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,700
Do not be afraid, Dal.

823
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,214
I am not afraid of anything
because I am with you.

824
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,753
Once we retake Adan Fortress tomorrow,

825
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,293
let us leave right away...

826
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,764
after putting Jin and Pung Gae in charge.

827
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,620
I know.

828
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,480
I know that tomorrow...

829
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,348
will be the last time to
use my father's sword.

830
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,750
Are you well-prepared for war?

831
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,668
Yes, Your Majesty. We have
enough weapons and war horses.

832
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,130
And the soldiers are in high morale.

833
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:04,102
Once you give us your command,
we can set off immediately.

834
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,897
It is different from what I heard.

835
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,700
I heard that...

836
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,037
you cornered them without mercy...

837
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,050
and made them resent you.

838
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,124
You have also killed
an officer at the armory.

839
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,650
I must sacrifice the lesser...

840
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,630
for the greater good.

841
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,020
You put great importance
on the greater good,

842
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,664
but you are wavered
by your personal feelings.

843
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,260
I do not understand.

844
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,280
General Go is deeply...

845
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,040
in love with Princess Pyeonggang.

846
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,730
In love?

847
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,144
General Go is strongly determined...

848
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,830
to destroy Goguryeo...

849
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,987
so that he can have Princess Pyeonggang.

850
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,170
That is his only reason.

851
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,090
You have blessed us with your grace,

852
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,660
and now we are living a decent life.

853
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,910
To repay your kindness,

854
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,694
I am telling you this
out of my loyalty to you...

855
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,033
when war is just around the corner.

856
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,390
This is outrageous!

857
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,773
I do not know who told you that,

858
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,910
but I am sure it is a trick to slander me.

859
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,460
Then are you saying...

860
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,652
you have no feelings
left for Pyeonggang at all?

861
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,510
When we were young,

862
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,733
I taught her martial arts.

863
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,280
But...

864
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,624
the royal household and my
family were deeply ill-fated.

865
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,643
We ended up becoming enemies.

866
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,248
What about the royal
wedding that got canceled?

867
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,814
You were a strong candidate
as the king's son-in-law,

868
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,720
but Princess Pyeonggang
chose On Dal instead.

869
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,190
As a man, you must hold
a deep grudge against her.

870
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,094
But you insist that you
have no feelings left for her,

871
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,033
so I will believe your words.

872
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,214
But you will not have the
authority to command the army.

873
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,994
Your Majesty, that means...

874
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,584
I will entrust you with a
more important duty next time.

875
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,807
Then who will command the army?

876
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,850
I will go myself.

877
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,054
It is too dangerous, Your Majesty.

878
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,580
There is someone...

879
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,063
I wish to fight on the battlefield.

880
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,727
That is why I am going to Adan Fortress.

881
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,764
You are going to Adan Fortress?

882
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:59,610
The soldiers of Goguryeo are
coming to attack Adan Fortress.

883
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,490
On Dal...

884
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,340
and Princess Pyeonggang
are coming together.

885
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,214
Do you understand it now?

886
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,274
If you want to prove that you
have no feelings for the Princess,

887
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,480
you must stay out of this battle.

888
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,110
Why? Are you here...

889
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,230
to see how ruined I am?

890
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,547
You will get another chance.

891
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,900
There is no such thing!

892
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,800
There is no next time.

893
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:53,640
Do not...

894
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,980
talk to me about chances.

895
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,220
You can yell at me...

896
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:09,930
and get angry.

897
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,650
I will tolerate everything.

898
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,280
ADAN FORTRESS

899
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,080
General On!

900
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:11,634
General, the advance
party tore down the east gate.

901
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,634
Before their main force blocks the gate,

902
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,640
we need to enter the fortress.

903
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,560
Are you here to live?

904
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,814
We are here to win!
We are here to win!

905
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,820
Are you going to lose and die?

906
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,450
We will win and live!
We will win and live!

907
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,340
Warriors of Goguryeo.

908
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,910
Let us march forward!

909
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,814
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

910
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,814
As a man of Goguryeo,

911
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,384
I cannot abandon the land of Goguryeo.

912
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,984
I am going to fight until
the last man standing.

913
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:10,554
The King of Silla is
here to fight himself.

914
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,324
It is meaningless to
go on with this fight.

915
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,524
Whether we win or lose,

916
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,854
I must fight until the end.
That is my fate as a general.

917
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,740
I know you.

918
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:20,094
A princess of an empire hid a dagger...

919
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,034
and infiltrated deep
into the enemy's camp?

920
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,294
The Princess was
captured by the Silla soldiers.

921
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,308
You only think of the
Princess even in the end.

922
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,050
Have you loved me at all?

923
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,410
I loved you.

924
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,030
Dal!
No!

925
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,730
Dal!
