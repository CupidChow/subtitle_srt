1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,942
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:09,372
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:11,845
She only knows her name. Yeom Ga Jin.

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:14,618
Can you please let her stay here?

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,658
The day Mother died.

6
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:20,290
I must know what happened that day.

7
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,460
Whose memorial service is it?

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,727
Dal is his son. General On Hyeop.

9
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,688
"General On Hyeop"?

10
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,501
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.

11
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:33,440
They were framed for treason.

12
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:37,542
I have no time for a country bumpkin.

13
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,281
I am here to find someone.

14
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:42,012
The Jangbaek herb store!

15
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,281
You left that place
along with the princess!

16
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:47,679
She is the daughter of the
king. Princess Pyeonggang.

17
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:52,408
Listen to me carefully.

18
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:55,091
Your life is not yours alone.

19
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:59,932
The people of the Sunno Tribe
sacrificed their lives to save you.

20
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:03,970
If you want to kill yourself,
you need to get their permission.

21
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,832
Are you going to stay in this village?

22
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,518
The princess is dead.

23
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:16,727
EPISODE 5

24
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:24,567
"Pyeonggang".

25
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,091
It is a strong and blessed name.

26
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,172
That is your name,
Pyeonggang. Do you like it?

27
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,761
There seemed to be
circumstances she could not explain.

28
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,502
I could not bring her with me.

29
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:43,841
But I can tell you this on my life.

30
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:46,978
It is definitely the Princess.

31
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:48,938
Does she resent me?

32
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:52,454
No. She did not say anything as such.

33
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:55,738
She will have grudges.

34
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,151
She will hate her heartless father.

35
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:01,616
Right now, bringing her
back safely is our priority.

36
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:04,491
If the rebels hear of this...

37
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:05,807
The rebels...

38
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,670
would include Gochuga, right?

39
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:17,775
My father does not yet know.

40
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,358
How far...

41
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:23,327
can I trust you?

42
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,217
You must trust me...

43
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,290
to see the Princess again.

44
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:33,995
I will find a way to
bring her back safely.

45
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,068
When we are ready,

46
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,795
you just have to give the command.

47
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,877
I am a filial and thoughtful son,

48
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:01,181
I do not wish to cause my father concern.

49
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:03,018
By that, you mean...

50
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:06,095
I was never in to see the King,

51
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,078
and you...

52
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:10,638
never saw me.

53
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,994
I do not know what is going on,

54
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:17,605
but how will you suffer the
wrath if Gochuga were to find out?

55
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,667
Head Eunuch.

56
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,411
That depends on your sly tongue.

57
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,187
Speak less...

58
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,857
and extend your lifespan.

59
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,972
The King went to Magnolia Hall?

60
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:58,242
I heard he came by suddenly
and took a look around.

61
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:03,078
But that is not the only strange thing.

62
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,954
He was usually drunk on
alcohol or high on drugs.

63
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,125
Today, he touched neither...

64
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,528
and stayed in his chambers.

65
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,264
When one acts out of the ordinary,

66
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:22,030
they say their time here has ended.

67
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,971
You might get your way much easier.

68
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:32,380
Great things do not happen by luck.

69
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:38,121
The King is obsessed
with the Princess' ghost.

70
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,688
We must turn that fear into reality.

71
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:52,938
The Princess?

72
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,709
The young girl who went missing
when the Queen was killed?

73
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:00,231
Yes. After that, she lost her memory...

74
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,917
and lived in Cheonjubang.

75
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,371
How could this be?

76
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:10,601
We should throw her out
immediately for the safety of the village.

77
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,818
She said she wished to leave out of guilt.

78
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:16,997
I am not sure, Chief.

79
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,254
What would my father have done?

80
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,148
The general...

81
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,831
would have followed the flow.

82
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:27,847
The flow?

83
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,962
Sometimes one must stay
even if we want them gone,

84
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,868
and one must go even
if we ask them to stay.

85
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,101
Do not try to work against nature.

86
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:40,435
But what happened that
day tore our tribe to pieces.

87
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,348
My father died framed and shamed.

88
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,912
That was not the Princess' fault.

89
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,438
I know that, but...

90
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,690
I cannot even look at her face now.

91
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:00,097
It is just too hard.

92
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:09,217
Are you home?

93
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,080
Where is she? Did she really leave?

94
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:19,707
My goodness.

95
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,585
I thought you had just left.

96
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,498
What is this?

97
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:29,997
On Dal's mother made it
for me. Do I look strange?

98
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:32,494
No, no. It suits you perfectly.

99
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,095
Dressed like that,
you look like one of us.

100
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,551
Will you stay with us
and not go anywhere now?

101
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,398
If only I can.

102
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:46,098
If you want to, it is done.
What are you worried about?

103
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,114
I must throw something away.

104
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,018
Oh? There she comes.

105
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:56,865
The young lady brightened
up the whole village.

106
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,924
That pretty thing was a killer?

107
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,357
That is so dreadful.

108
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,491
She said she quit. Do not bring it up.

109
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,162
Can a meat-eater...

110
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,701
survive on vegetables and herbs alone?

111
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:13,337
I am sure Dal has a lot on his mind.

112
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,158
Will you really not eat?

113
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,207
Where is he?

114
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,698
You stayed up all night,

115
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:26,917
will not eat all day, or move a finger!

116
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,188
Will you shrivel and die where you lie?

117
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:31,378
You fool!

118
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,407
You fool!

119
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:36,958
You got your way!

120
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,230
You brought the girl back,

121
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,431
the King's army did not
get what they came for.

122
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,957
What else is there?

123
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:45,532
The villagers said they accept
her knowing she was a killer!

124
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,405
What are you so upset about?

125
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,572
You broke your word with
me to leave the mountain,

126
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:55,472
and you even went to Pyeongyang Castle?

127
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:57,611
I would love to break your legs,

128
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,028
but I am holding back.

129
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,837
I am sorry, Mother.

130
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,425
If you know that, come in and eat.

131
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,361
I should be punished for doing wrong.

132
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,047
Just like we promised.

133
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:21,188
Dal.

134
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:22,928
Dal.

135
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:31,427
He is truly captivated.

136
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:33,838
My gosh.

137
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:37,702
The well was almost
dry, and so is the stream.

138
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:42,757
We might all wither away
if the drought continues.

139
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,458
Let us go higher up.

140
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:47,787
Oh? Dal!

141
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:49,817
What?

142
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,941
Why is he suddenly keeping a distance?

143
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,017
Did you and Dal fight?

144
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,098
No.

145
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,311
As if I have the right to fight him.

146
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:05,117
I wronged him in many ways.

147
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,248
Dal may speak like an uncultured swine,

148
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,098
but he is really sweet.

149
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,367
He will get over it soon.

150
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,098
Do not worry at all.

151
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:19,157
You just saw him.

152
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,865
He is taking his hoe to get punished.

153
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:25,487
To get punished?

154
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,758
Did you promise your mother...

155
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,390
you would work if you ever...

156
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,137
left the mountain again?

157
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:51,461
You are doing this because of me.

158
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,867
I should be the one to get punished.

159
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:06,244
I came to say something upsetting.

160
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:09,115
I will stay in Ghost Valley.

161
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,018
I know I am guilty and being shameless,

162
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:17,107
but I want to live.

163
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:22,992
I do not want to go to the palace
where Father acts like I am a ghost.

164
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,518
I will no longer...

165
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,134
do anything that gets blood on my hands.

166
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,980
I will work in the fields, fell
trees, and gather herbs...

167
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,274
and live a good life, like you.

168
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,708
If you do not like it and say no,

169
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,587
I will leave.

170
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,261
The stars are not aligned.

171
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:00,618
What?

172
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,201
The drought will go on for a while.

173
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:08,132
That is why I am digging a
well. It is not because of you.

174
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:11,338
Then are you okay with
me staying at Ghost Valley?

175
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,877
The villagers accepted you.

176
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:16,198
You. What do you think?

177
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:18,608
My thoughts?

178
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,907
My thoughts?

179
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:26,058
I should start thinking
how I feel about it.

180
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,201
Are there any leftover iron pieces?

181
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:42,170
Could you add this and melt it all?

182
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,621
Yes. She brought them here herself.

183
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:03,003
She told me to make sickles
or whatever the villagers need.

184
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,885
If a killer throws away their blade,
it must mean serious business.

185
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:20,872
How could it be you?

186
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:21,998
Your father...

187
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,067
killed my father...

188
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,127
and annihilated my tribe.

189
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,097
Dal. Do not ask.

190
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,127
You can go...

191
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,790
and find a way to live on your own.

192
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,352
You returned from the
mountain empty-handed.

193
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,038
Why are you here now?

194
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,367
If I am empty-handed,

195
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,554
I can carry whatever I find.

196
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,625
The King is up to something.

197
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:15,691
If you do not do something
about the Princess,

198
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,497
I will get involved myself.

199
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,544
You must be busy with politics.

200
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,657
Leave it to me, Father.

201
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:58,071
What brings you here late at night?

202
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,281
I heard you are trading illegal herbs.

203
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,367
I came to investigate.

204
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,887
This cannot be found in Goguryeo.

205
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,392
Did you buy it from Baekje or Silla?

206
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:15,992
You defend our Capital,

207
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:18,561
and you care about
what a herb store sells?

208
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,959
If you are smuggling items,
which is against the law,

209
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,931
you deserve to be punished.

210
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:27,009
Even the Five Tribe
council overlooks our trade.

211
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:29,488
Listen.

212
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,181
I am Head of Capital Defense.

213
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,677
Not a puppet of the Five Tribe council.

214
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,337
Burn everything.

215
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,077
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

216
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,057
Come inside.

217
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:04,745
To save over 180kg of herbs,

218
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:07,058
what must a woman do?

219
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:13,854
The information you gave me last time...

220
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:15,547
was useless.

221
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:19,979
I did not catch a wild
animal, let alone an assassin.

222
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,358
Did you not?

223
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,134
My father pressures me every single day,

224
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,964
and I do not know where the assassin is.

225
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:34,088
So...

226
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,470
I need you to help me in secret.

227
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:41,977
What help could the
owner of a herb store be?

228
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:45,097
General Go.

229
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,668
Through the Head Eunuch,

230
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:51,025
you are smuggling drugs into the palace.

231
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:53,068
To cloud the King's mind.

232
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,031
You are gradually increasing the dose.

233
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,488
That is not true.

234
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:03,287
I knew it.

235
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:05,957
You are lying,

236
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,707
and your pulse is still level.

237
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,841
Your jokes are too extreme. It is a joke?

238
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:26,558
I need your cunningness and courage.

239
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,257
Your ability to make one...

240
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,488
believe a lie.

241
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,688
I carved it myself.

242
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,269
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

243
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:31,917
How are you?

244
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,520
What brings you here before breakfast?

245
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:39,295
I wish to return something to On Dal.

246
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,068
Put it over there.

247
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,604
He left at the crack of dawn...

248
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,788
without eating anything.

249
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,572
Did he go to dig the well?

250
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:52,738
How would I know where he went
when I do not know what he thinks?

251
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,715
What is it that you brought?

252
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,518
It is not much.

253
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,055
I just do not think I should have it.

254
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,324
I will return it to him myself.

255
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,700
Wait, stay where you
are. Can you take this too?

256
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,894
He asks for food the moment he wakes,

257
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,435
and he hasn't eaten in a while.

258
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:24,978
Does he not eat now?

259
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:26,728
Since...

260
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,711
you have decided to
stay here in Ghost Valley,

261
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,450
let me say just one thing.

262
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,348
I am listening.

263
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,098
Please do not cause...

264
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,617
any strife or bloodshed in this valley.

265
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:41,858
I am sure you went through a lot,

266
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,728
but there is none as pitiful as Dal.

267
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,528
If you ever think something
bad might happen,

268
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:52,804
then please leave then in silence.

269
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,874
Do you get what I am saying?

270
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,788
I know why you say this,

271
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,758
but I will not leave.

272
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:10,258
I owe Dal very much.

273
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,228
I must make it up to the villagers too.

274
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,860
I decided to turn a new leaf,

275
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,607
and I will show Dal...

276
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,468
how determined I am.

277
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:26,068
The world...

278
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,008
does not always give you what you want.

279
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:39,278
My goodness.

280
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,885
I wonder why you are ignoring Ga Jin.

281
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:48,592
I thought long and hard
and still could not get it,

282
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,797
but then I suddenly got it.

283
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,368
It is jealousy.

284
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,804
The soldier who came to catch her.

285
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:00,218
My gosh.

286
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,978
The handsome man with the lovely voice.

287
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,580
I thought he was here to catch her,

288
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:10,781
but I got this tickling feeling.

289
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:13,807
So what? So...

290
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,955
those two have some
sort of a relationship.

291
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:21,166
What relationship?
Some sort of a relationship.

292
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,165
You noticed that and got upset.

293
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:26,578
Out of jealousy.

294
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,119
Silly. If it were that, I
would actually feel better.

295
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,947
Then what is the problem?

296
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,970
There are lots of instances in the world.

297
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:41,860
Stupid instances between
people that people cannot change.

298
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:49,751
You get into a mess when
you are caught in a noose.

299
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,437
Is Ga Jin a noose, then?

300
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:28,067
You are here.

301
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,062
It is such slow going with a hoe.

302
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,801
Get out. Give me the pick.

303
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,967
I will dig out a rock for you.

304
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,298
I said get out.

305
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,882
I should make myself
useful if I am to stay here.

306
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:57,488
Leave the well to me and eat something.

307
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:03,686
Your mother is worried you
have been skipping meals.

308
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:12,947
Do not waste food.

309
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,258
I get that you hate me,

310
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,018
but the food is harmless.

311
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,098
I was young then too.

312
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:33,657
I did not know what was going on.

313
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:38,495
It was utter confusion and I was scared.

314
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,117
So...

315
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:44,864
why should I be treated like a criminal?

316
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:49,137
I am angry too. It is
unfair and I am angry.

317
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:52,357
Still...

318
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:56,721
I hoped that at least you
would understand me.

319
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,814
Then I could forget my past.

320
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,021
I could live happily
in Ghost Valley and...

321
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,827
Did I say it is your fault?

322
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,538
It is hard on me too.

323
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,961
I worry about you and
want to look out for you,

324
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,007
but I cannot.

325
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:20,005
Whenever I see you, I
am reminded of my father.

326
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:21,627
I saw him die.

327
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,588
I feel guilty...

328
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,778
towards my father and the villagers.

329
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:32,150
"She is the King's daughter."

330
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:34,498
"But I still like her."

331
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:37,488
That would make me a shameless fool.

332
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:46,130
We did not do anything wrong.

333
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:49,571
Yet we are being punished.

334
00:23:54,707 --> 00:23:56,387
Thank you for telling me.

335
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,368
I will return this.

336
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,418
I hope you find water soon.

337
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:49,152
I will work in the fields, fell
trees, and gather herbs...

338
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:51,225
and live a good life, like you.

339
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,835
Why should I be treated like a criminal?

340
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,400
We did not do anything wrong.

341
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:03,541
Yet we are being punished.

342
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,347
Ga Jin!

343
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:42,498
Do not go.

344
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,268
Stay here as Yeom Ga Jin.

345
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:50,421
Work in the fields and gather herbs...

346
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,621
and live simply like that.

347
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,617
Do whatever you want.

348
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,040
You are not a princess or a killer.

349
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:15,258
You are just Yeom Ga Jin.

350
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:23,268
Okay?

351
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,817
Will you do that?

352
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,208
Do you...

353
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:33,907
forgive me?

354
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:37,935
Why forgive you when
you did nothing wrong?

355
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:46,297
Thank you.

356
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:10,132
I gave a chief of a meager
tribe an important task,

357
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,838
and you have done a terrible job.

358
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:20,033
I gave you time and you still
have not sent the assassin's head.

359
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,780
You are bringing upon your own demise.

360
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:27,048
The moment I run out of patience,

361
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,887
your dwelling will be
burned down and your life...

362
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:35,291
will be ended, so remember that.

363
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,387
Before we kill the King,

364
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:50,277
we must get rid of Go Won Pyo.

365
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:06,387
Who are you?

366
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:10,122
Jangbaek herb store's
owner is here to see Gochuga.

367
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:12,978
Report it.

368
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:17,027
What? They brought the assassin's body?

369
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:21,082
Yes. The herb store
owner came here in person.

370
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:24,737
That cannot be.

371
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,480
Gochuga wishes to see you.

372
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:43,027
The pickers found it washed up downstream.

373
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,594
It has swollen grossly,
but the features...

374
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:49,767
looked similar to the face on the posters.

375
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,217
This is unrecognizable.

376
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,708
You asked to see me?

377
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:00,137
You fought her closely,
so you must recognize her.

378
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,011
See if this is the assassin.

379
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:02,867
I will.

380
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:11,037
It is her.

381
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:14,727
Are you sure? Yes.

382
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:18,594
This is the assassin I
saw at the ceremony.

383
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:23,598
Come inside.

384
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:46,013
You have sharp eyes.

385
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:48,777
I see why your father
always boasts about you.

386
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:51,050
That is too grand of a compliment.

387
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,313
I must decline the offer.

388
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:00,214
That is not necessary.

389
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:02,197
We promised a reward in
return for the assassin's head,

390
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,936
so you are only getting what you deserve.

391
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,650
I did not do it to get paid.

392
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:18,220
You are always kind and
caring toward our family,

393
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,416
so I wanted to do something in return.

394
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:23,234
How praiseworthy of you.

395
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:25,317
I have always wanted
to meet you in person...

396
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,123
after having heard great things about you.

397
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:31,723
Thanks to her, we were
able to avoid trouble.

398
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:37,535
Feel free to visit me
whenever you need my help.

399
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:39,274
I am honored.

400
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:57,360
The herb store owner has
made a big contribution.

401
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,533
I trust people's greed.

402
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:02,514
Pardon?

403
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,734
An act of kindness to
repay one's gratitude.

404
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,636
I do not trust those who say things...

405
00:31:12,843 --> 00:31:14,938
that are not visible to the eye.

406
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,744
Does that mean something is bothering you?

407
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,321
You found a dead body
faster than expected.

408
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:29,847
There are tons of dead bodies...

409
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:33,457
piled up outside the city walls
due to illnesses and starvation.

410
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:35,287
I had to pick a girl who
was of a similar age...

411
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:39,325
and had to bloat it underwater,
which is what caused the delay.

412
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,184
You purposely threw a dead
body underwater to bloat it?

413
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,106
You really are relentless.

414
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:53,277
Are you not the one who asked
me to do something so relentless?

415
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,578
I am talking about the man
who made me do the dirty work...

416
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:58,177
because he did not want
anyone to be suspicious of him.

417
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,316
I will repay you for what I owe.

418
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:04,426
You should brace yourself.

419
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,357
I will add a lot of interest.

420
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:22,583
We did great. Nice job.

421
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:28,247
He yelled and called me a ghost.

422
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:31,987
But then again, he thought I was dead.

423
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,018
I would have been startled as well.

424
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:37,291
But even so, you are his daughter.

425
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:40,153
I would be happy rather than scared.

426
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,243
So did you just run away?

427
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,226
I may be alive, but I am good as dead.

428
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:49,728
What about your little brother?

429
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,268
Even if we meet again,

430
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,674
he will not be able to recognize me.

431
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,807
My life in the palace feels like a dream.

432
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,716
My real father and friends...

433
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,604
are at Cheonjubang.

434
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,074
But that is also useless.

435
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:16,943
Let us go.

436
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,814
Where? Just follow me.

437
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:40,378
What are you doing?

438
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:41,744
Can you not tell?

439
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:43,124
I am measuring.

440
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:44,033
To do what?

441
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,223
My gosh. We need to make one more room.

442
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:53,364
This place is too small for two people.

443
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,814
You are unbelievable.

444
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,738
Why would you move here
when you have your own place?

445
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:02,277
And who says I will let you live here?

446
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:03,967
Do not come near me.

447
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:06,638
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

448
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,438
I told you not to come near me.

449
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:10,244
I think you are mistaken...

450
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:21,354
Wood? Why do you need
wood to dig up a well?

451
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,536
Find me one that is long and
sturdy, not one that is bent.

452
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:28,027
And as for you, make her a straw mattress.

453
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,998
I know you cannot afford
to make her a silk mattress,

454
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,297
but a straw mattress is not good enough.

455
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,836
What? Trust me when it comes to women.

456
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:38,310
I know you are doing this for Ga Jin.

457
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:43,772
Yes, that is right. You
all told her she could stay.

458
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,547
So we should keep our
word and help her settle.

459
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,073
This is a big step.

460
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,486
Did you get your mother's approval?

461
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,857
Why do I need her approval...

462
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:55,388
to bring Ga Jin's father?

463
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,274
What? What?

464
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:58,457
I thought you were moving in with her.

465
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,058
I thought you were going to marry her.

466
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:00,914
"Marry"?

467
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,403
Who? Me? Yes.

468
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:03,863
With Ga Jin?

469
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,397
That is what you want,
right? You cheeky punk.

470
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:11,667
My gosh, I am already
angry that I got a nosebleed.

471
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:13,508
I will not take this!

472
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:15,537
So that is not it? Were we wrong?

473
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:16,907
You are not going to marry her?

474
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:20,497
You are not marrying her?
What kind of nonsense is that?

475
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,297
You become so violent
every time you get angry.

476
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,170
You really need to fix that.

477
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:39,698
You should have been more clear.

478
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,738
You were the one who
made it sound strange.

479
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,868
I cannot believe you are angry at
me when you are the one who hit me.

480
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,674
I am the one with the nosebleed, you know.

481
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:50,713
Are you laughing?

482
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:52,893
Sorry. I will not laugh.

483
00:35:56,194 --> 00:35:57,474
Hey... What now?

484
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,424
About bringing my father...

485
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,897
Do you not want him
here? No, it is not that.

486
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:07,628
I am grateful for the gesture.

487
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,727
But I feel bad toward
you and the villagers.

488
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,667
You do not need to feel that way.

489
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:14,167
Let us go get him once
we finish digging up the well.

490
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,373
Until then, we can fix the house.

491
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:19,094
Dal.

492
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,508
You are doing everything for me.

493
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,748
Is there anything I can do for you?

494
00:36:25,754 --> 00:36:26,977
Just tell me anything you want.

495
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,663
I will do anything I can.

496
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,091
It is something very difficult.

497
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:38,343
Will you be okay with it?

498
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:40,884
What is it?

499
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:49,304
Live a normal life, Ga Jin.

500
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:53,141
That is what you wished for.

501
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,164
How lame.

502
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,147
I already promised you that.

503
00:36:58,153 --> 00:36:59,833
A promise holds no power.

504
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,988
Sticking to your word
is the difficult part.

505
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:06,938
Are you sure you will
never kill anyone again?

506
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,501
I threw away all my weapons.

507
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,236
Even if your life is at risk?

508
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:20,586
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.

509
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,808
Then what about this? Gosh.

510
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:24,494
I already apologized.

511
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:29,864
Ga Jin.

512
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,660
You deserve to be happy now.

513
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:43,464
Do not worry about anything else.

514
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:46,296
Just do what is best for you.

515
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:16,084
He is waiting.

516
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:17,958
Hurry up and check.

517
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:18,814
Yes.

518
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:54,754
It is not her.

519
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,083
Are you sure?

520
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,533
It is not her.

521
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:13,034
She is of a similar age.

522
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:16,487
But she is a completely different person.

523
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,804
She is not the Princess?

524
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,054
I am sure...

525
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:26,754
it is not her.

526
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:32,213
Take her out.

527
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,477
I am sure she is mistaken.

528
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,546
She is the assassin... No.

529
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,954
She is the Princess.

530
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:54,165
She swore to stay loyal to
me to protect the Crown Prince.

531
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,327
There is no reason for her to lie.

532
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,183
Then...

533
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,863
are you saying I am lying to you?

534
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:07,140
You are my son, and you seem certain.

535
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,768
So I will have to believe you. Father.

536
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,174
Learn how to keep away from trouble.

537
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,750
Otherwise, you will shed blood.

538
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:53,394
The well is all dried up.

539
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,762
I may not be able to
see, but it hears like it.

540
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,018
I have water at my
house. I will give you some.

541
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,968
No, it is okay. I will
ask Dal to bring water.

542
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,830
He went to check the traps he set.

543
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,666
He never tells me where he goes.

544
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:40,873
What is this vegetable?

545
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:44,664
I bet they will taste nice with seasoning.

546
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:48,738
I may be blind, but I can hear
well and have a healthy body.

547
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:50,468
So do not pity me so much.

548
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,154
No, I do not pity you.

549
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:54,864
Then what?

550
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:58,784
Are you trying to repay
Dal for his kindness?

551
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,443
There is no need.

552
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:06,623
You are not the only person he is kind to.

553
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,763
Gosh, look at you.

554
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:10,858
You should be with your mother.

555
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:13,131
What are you doing here all alone?

556
00:42:18,974 --> 00:42:19,824
Go on.

557
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,474
He was born with a kind heart.

558
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,176
Whether it is humans or animals,

559
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,113
he is not able to ignore...

560
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:32,246
those who have nowhere to go.

561
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:34,746
He has a heart like no other.

562
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:39,674
But how is that possible?

563
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:42,224
What do you mean?

564
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:46,967
I heard his family and villagers...

565
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:49,304
ended up dying a miserable death.

566
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:53,741
I am sure he felt resentful.

567
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:58,211
How could he not feel
the urge to take revenge?

568
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,264
Has he forgotten...

569
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:04,277
about what happened that day?

570
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:13,144
Life would be easier if we could
forget what we wanted to forget.

571
00:43:14,063 --> 00:43:16,728
He is merely trying his
best to put it past him.

572
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:18,934
Every time he thinks of that day,

573
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:22,467
he becomes heartbroken and furious.

574
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,905
But he suppresses that
and puts it behind him...

575
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:31,573
because he wants to
be a decent human being.

576
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:43,503
"A decent human being".

577
00:43:56,374 --> 00:43:58,641
Are you here to keep an eye on me?

578
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:04,768
I know I promised to share
rabbit meat, but I take it back.

579
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:06,454
I am not lying. Look.

580
00:44:06,984 --> 00:44:08,378
I could not catch any.

581
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:10,277
I can see that. I am disappointed.

582
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:12,016
Gosh, just eat vegetables.

583
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:15,317
That is healthier for you.

584
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:18,518
I grew up eating dried
radish greens and dried radish.

585
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:20,358
And look at how energetic I am.

586
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:22,697
You and your excuses. I am serious.

587
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:26,797
We will never get to eat
meat if we continue to trust you.

588
00:44:26,803 --> 00:44:28,998
From now on, leave the hunting to me.

589
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:31,397
We should also get rid of the
stones from the green farm.

590
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:32,827
The ladies seem to be having a hard time.

591
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,697
And when we dry herbs,
we should all do it together.

592
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:37,303
That will save time.

593
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:40,223
What? is there a problem?

594
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,534
No, it is not that.

595
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:48,990
Were you always this talkative?

596
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:53,727
You are even beating people now?

597
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:58,124
Let us take time with fixing the house.

598
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,327
The well is more urgent,
so we should dig it up.

599
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,066
I will help with that too.

600
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,203
Gosh, you talk like you are one of us now.

601
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:12,641
Or are you a fox
pretending to be Ga Jin...

602
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,016
so that you can eat my liver?

603
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,104
Goodness.

604
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,171
Ga Jin really hid herself well.

605
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:42,074
I cannot even guess where she might be.

606
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,644
I wonder where I can find her.

607
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:48,655
Therefore, you must take her
place and do her job instead.

608
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:51,834
Chief.

609
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:54,978
If we keep delaying it,
Go Won Pyo will kill us all.

610
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,388
Leave it to me. I will take care of it.

611
00:45:57,394 --> 00:46:00,261
What makes you think
I am going to ask you?

612
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:09,897
This is a very important task.

613
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,103
You must hurry.

614
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:12,994
We will. We will.

615
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:24,294
We should go.

616
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:36,958
Once we arrive at Pyeongyang Castle,

617
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,888
we do not know how things will unfold.

618
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:42,158
We will not be able to
take care of you any longer.

619
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,466
Do you have a dangerous mission?

620
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:45,827
That is not it.

621
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,500
Gosh. It is better to check all corners.

622
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:52,552
You have nothing to worry
about. Go and stay with Ga Jin.

623
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:00,483
I also consider you
guys as my own children.

624
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:05,732
Whatever it is, please
take care of yourselves.

625
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:09,977
There is a village named
Ghost Valley at Mount Daeseong.

626
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,493
"Ghost Valley"?

627
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,701
I have a gate, so people
do not jump over the walls.

628
00:48:06,214 --> 00:48:09,926
Why do you need to talk to
me without letting people know?

629
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:13,634
Depending on your answer,

630
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:17,287
I might have to take your life.

631
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:20,941
I heard that Gochuga is
suspecting the corpse to be fake.

632
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,500
It was very difficult to earn his trust.

633
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:27,477
But I may be seen as a
schemer and get blamed.

634
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,768
You already knew the identity
of the assassin, did you not?

635
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:33,137
You would not return after
making the trip to Mount Daeseong...

636
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,076
without finding out anything.

637
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,644
As long as the assassin
is not the Princess,

638
00:48:42,024 --> 00:48:43,748
the identity of the
corpse does not matter.

639
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,274
I cannot trust you.

640
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,826
You served those awful drugs to the King.

641
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,530
But you helped his daughter get away.

642
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:00,253
Whose side are you on?

643
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:08,114
I fear Gochuga.

644
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:14,020
I understand that there are Five Tribes.

645
00:49:14,724 --> 00:49:17,796
But we, the Sono Tribe,
cannot go against him...

646
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:22,488
because if we do, it will not
end with a few drops of blood.

647
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:26,078
Is that why you are trying
to get on every tribe's side,

648
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:29,658
so you can come up with a way to survive?

649
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:30,944
You are correct.

650
00:49:33,234 --> 00:49:37,067
He has already slain innocent
people of our tribe in the past.

651
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,067
And the Queen died from
a false accusation as well.

652
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:40,353
Shut your mouth!

653
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,483
My father was ordered by the King...

654
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,847
and only subdued the plot of treason.

655
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:53,720
Even the King fears Gochuga.

656
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,493
Now, he is trying to murder a princess.

657
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:04,733
You will be forced to make
a decision soon enough.

658
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:11,567
Will you follow in your father's
footsteps onto a blood-stained path?

659
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,973
Or will you embark on your own path?

660
00:50:43,414 --> 00:50:45,968
Are you fighting with the
rock? You are so foolish.

661
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:47,238
I am okay. I can do it.

662
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,204
Do not move.

663
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:51,871
If you damage your nails,
it will inconvenience you.

664
00:50:51,984 --> 00:50:53,664
Hey, I said I was fine.

665
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,390
I think you got the wrong spot.

666
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:02,712
We have been digging for a while,
and we only see rocks, not water.

667
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:07,056
Do you not know the saying,
"Sincerity is the way to paradise"?

668
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,567
There is a saying that goes,
"Pour water into a cracked pot."

669
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,973
Let us see which one of us is right.

670
00:51:14,343 --> 00:51:17,337
Hey, you will hurt your
hands. That is enough. Stop it.

671
00:51:17,343 --> 00:51:18,193
Hey!

672
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:19,463
Stop it.

673
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:23,043
Hey! What is it? Are you okay?

674
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,748
Where did you get hurt? Let me see.

675
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:26,604
Hey.

676
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:27,874
Come on.

677
00:51:35,994 --> 00:51:37,927
Well, I did not hurt my hand.

678
00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:40,034
But it feels better.

679
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,027
You teased me about it.

680
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:46,933
But you were the one
fighting with the rock.

681
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:47,923
Look.

682
00:51:57,654 --> 00:51:58,504
I won.

683
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:01,534
That is amazing.

684
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:14,333
This is nice.

685
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,168
Everything I am seeing and hearing here...

686
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:20,768
makes me think I am dreaming.

687
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:21,624
Dream?

688
00:52:23,613 --> 00:52:25,293
Yes. If I were dreaming,

689
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:27,474
I would never want to wake up.

690
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:32,344
"I want to keep dreaming
to the end of time."

691
00:52:32,754 --> 00:52:34,434
Then, sleep all you want.

692
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:36,533
I will not wake you up.

693
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:39,387
I will really go to sleep here.

694
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:40,913
Knock yourself out.

695
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:17,212
Do you remember a long time
ago, you and I sat on a rock like this?

696
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,488
You bragged about your
carved wooden horse.

697
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:21,228
Do you remember what
you insisted that day?

698
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:25,394
That you would become the ruler
and reign over the entire empire.

699
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:28,441
And you said you would become a general.

700
00:53:32,014 --> 00:53:33,214
Do you still...

701
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:35,723
want to become the ruler?

702
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:37,664
I was young back then.

703
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:40,614
Now, everything seems so far-off.

704
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,257
Right. That is what you need to do.

705
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:49,258
Get rid of bad memories little by little.

706
00:53:49,264 --> 00:53:51,458
And fill your life with something good.

707
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:52,664
What about you?

708
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:56,401
Did you get rid of all the bad memories?

709
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:58,894
Far from it.

710
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:02,054
Not yet.

711
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,173
This is so nice!

712
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:46,589
What is the point of wielding
your sword into the thin air?

713
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:52,448
You should have taken the
assassin's life when you had the chance.

714
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:54,793
No matter how hard I push myself,

715
00:54:55,323 --> 00:54:58,843
I do not have the guts to
kill a princess of an empire.

716
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:03,065
But I know that you had done
the deed yourself a long time ago.

717
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:22,923
Let me teach you something.

718
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,174
A sword attracts blood.

719
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:37,327
If that scares you, I advise
you to hold onto a sickle.

720
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,233
Where the sword points
at is also important.

721
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,637
Did you really point the
sword at the Queen...

722
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:46,176
when it should have slain our enemies?

723
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:57,354
My decision was solely
for our family's sake.

724
00:55:58,924 --> 00:56:00,924
It was back then and still is.

725
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:03,044
But you...

726
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:07,327
lied to your own father,
blinded by your affection.

727
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:12,554
Yes.

728
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:14,524
I am...

729
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,733
your foolish son.

730
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:24,198
Starting tomorrow, you will resign
as the Head of Capital Defense.

731
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:40,064
Who is there?

732
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,103
Are you all right? Catch them!

733
00:57:57,514 --> 00:57:58,364
Assassins!

734
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:12,013
Go now. Hurry!

735
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,923
You are the hunting dogs from Cheonjubang.

736
00:58:55,734 --> 00:58:58,934
Mother, I am on my way
to carry out my punishment.

737
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:02,168
If you have to carry out
your punishment again,

738
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:03,597
you might end up with a bride.

739
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:07,507
Gosh. Do not ruin my great
morning with such an absurd claim.

740
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:08,963
Here.

741
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:13,004
Why is it so heavy?

742
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:17,038
If you share your meal
with her, it will not be filling.

743
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:26,934
When my dear husband is returning

744
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,764
There was He is ridiculous.

745
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,413
Ga Jin. What?

746
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:41,708
Once we get the well going,
you should go home first.

747
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:43,277
We can fix the house in due time,

748
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:45,008
but you should bring your father first.

749
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,414
What if we never get the well going?

750
00:59:47,553 --> 00:59:49,753
My father might die from waiting.

751
00:59:50,283 --> 00:59:51,483
Do not jinx it.

752
00:59:54,994 --> 00:59:55,844
Move.

753
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:05,883
Hey!

754
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:07,554
You...

755
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:15,933
What?

756
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:17,893
Hey!

757
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:19,233
Hey. Gosh.

758
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,403
This is... It is...

759
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:24,074
Hey!

760
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:25,703
Water!

761
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:27,834
We have water! Water!

762
01:00:28,563 --> 01:00:29,443
Water! Yes!

763
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:31,844
Hey, what did I tell you?

764
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,557
I said we would find
water here. Take a look.

765
01:00:34,563 --> 01:00:36,097
Okay. Stop bragging.

766
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:37,783
Water! We have water!

767
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:58,250
Well, I will go and bring the people.

768
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,304
Wait here.

769
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:01,044
Okay.

770
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,954
Did you find water?

771
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,708
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

772
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:58,748
The people in our village
are happy to have you.

773
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:01,077
Perhaps, the Princess ended up here...

774
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,518
to tell us to forget about our
past and live our lives in peace.

775
01:02:04,524 --> 01:02:06,847
Do not be rash and think of revenge.

776
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,586
Locate the Princess first.

777
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:12,613
We must be more cautious
of the Princess than the King.

778
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:15,928
If her nature resembles her late mother's,

779
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:18,267
her claws will hurt us pretty soon.

780
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:21,498
How dare you lay your hand on me?

781
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,738
I am the eldest daughter of the King...

782
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,908
and carry on the
bloodline of the late Queen.

783
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:27,594
I am Princess Pyeonggang.
