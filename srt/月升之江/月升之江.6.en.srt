1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:07,098
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:10,037
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,723
Stop where you are. Hey!

4
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:12,794
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:14,663
Darn you.

6
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:30,191
Well, I will go and bring the people.

7
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,184
Wait here.

8
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:32,943
Okay.

9
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,933
Did you find water?

10
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:11,534
It is true! There is water!

11
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:16,277
There is water? That is amazing!

12
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:18,236
When did Dal ever tell a lie?

13
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,714
Never. Right.

14
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,448
I did not believe it. How did
you manage on your own?

15
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:25,054
I had Ga Jin's help.

16
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:29,356
Let us not waste time.
We should widen the hole.

17
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,554
We finally have more water.

18
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:34,220
Why are there so many rocks?

19
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,764
Why are you coming from that way?

20
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,761
Should I pee in the open, then?

21
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:45,407
Hey, Ga Jin! You did so well!

22
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,503
We should get more buckets. Sure.

23
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,784
You met Ga Jin?

24
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:05,291
You can take a horse
or cattle to a stream,

25
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,560
but you cannot make them drink.

26
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:11,874
I need Ga Jin to thirst,

27
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,714
so I sprinkled some salt.

28
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,313
Chief. Kill me instead...

29
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,406
and please, let Ga Jin go.

30
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,784
Who will die?

31
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,644
I am trying to save everyone's life.

32
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,523
To save the twins,

33
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,520
Ga Jin will have to kill again.

34
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,513
Stop.

35
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,597
Your chief sent you, did he not?

36
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,571
I know nothing about any chief.

37
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,876
That is right. We are just small thieves.

38
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,778
Where did you hide the
assassin during the ceremony?

39
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,464
Assassin? What assassin?

40
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:10,676
You keep asking things we
do not know the answers to.

41
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,704
Stop! I will kill you!

42
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:17,204
I will kill you! Please.

43
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,444
Stop!

44
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:22,863
We will see how long you last.

45
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,966
I have more than enough clubs and sticks.

46
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,593
You must go to sleep.

47
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,153
I will when I feel like it.

48
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,003
If you are not at ease,

49
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,126
that will cause our nation concern.

50
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:49,643
Queen.

51
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,397
Do you remember the Princess?

52
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,574
The Princess?

53
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,574
Who do you speak of?

54
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:03,884
Pyeonggang.

55
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:07,607
My most favorite daughter.

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,943
The child I lost.

57
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,603
Why would you suddenly...

58
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,474
speak of the Princess?

59
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:20,063
I miss her...

60
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,803
even more today.

61
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,928
Since you hallucinated in the library,

62
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,001
you are not in your right mind.

63
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:31,364
You must sleep deeply tonight.

64
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,901
I will bring some medicine. Leave it.

65
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,194
More than medicine,

66
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,514
I hoped for a warm word from you.

67
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:48,803
Forget about it.

68
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,253
The Princess is alive.

69
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:12,411
I will find a way to
bring her back safely.

70
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,023
When we are ready,

71
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:18,780
you just have to give the command.

72
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:28,498
We have more water
now. The water is so clear.

73
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,004
Dal, have a drink.

74
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,428
This is so precious. We have water again.

75
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:39,167
Do not waste a drop. This is so valuable.

76
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:42,844
It has been so long since we had water.

77
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,047
Here you go. Drink all you want.

78
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,746
There is so much now. Yes.

79
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,224
You worked hard. Refresh yourself. Thanks.

80
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,296
They brought more. This is so nice.

81
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,928
It is good to have water.

82
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,734
On Hyeop's son took you in.

83
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,070
Karma works in strange ways.

84
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,854
How long have you known?

85
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,480
Did you send me to the ceremony...

86
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,124
knowing who I was?

87
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,150
If the daughter killed her father,

88
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:32,363
Goguryeo would have fallen
into turmoil and never recovered.

89
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,317
It is a pity it did not happen.

90
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,923
How could you... It is easy to kill me,

91
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,266
but then Yeom Deuk will die too.

92
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,464
Even now, he shaves salt...

93
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,404
as he waits for you.

94
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,744
You rested for long enough.

95
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,506
Return to Cheonjubang now.

96
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,650
I said I will never kill again.

97
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,349
Then do you want to
return to the foolish King...

98
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,118
to play being a princess?

99
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,324
I have given up both
killing and being a princess.

100
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,331
I will live quietly on this mountain.

101
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,500
This is where cowards who do not have...

102
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,840
the courage to die live in hiding.

103
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,707
And Ga Jin you wish to live like that?

104
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,664
Do not fight your fate.

105
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:31,177
Even before I took you in,

106
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:34,487
you were destined to bring down Goguryeo.

107
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:41,704
Please leave.

108
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,866
I will get into trouble
if the villagers see us.

109
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,833
You are afraid.

110
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,368
You are afraid to face...

111
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,041
the King's crimes and the corrupt world.

112
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,306
I will not miss this time.

113
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:02,423
You found water,

114
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,047
but not yet a way to survive.

115
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,453
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.

116
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:15,758
They were looking for you
and then took your place.

117
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,794
The decision is yours to make.

118
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:21,327
Will you remain here and play house...

119
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,344
or return to Cheonjubang?

120
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,207
"The rules of a king are like a rock."

121
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,513
"They are weighty and never change."

122
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:12,516
"Also, the rules of a
king are like a blue sky."

123
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:16,491
"The depth cannot be fathomed."

124
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:21,382
Is the writing hard to read
or are you afraid of me?

125
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,374
No.

126
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,594
I am just...

127
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:28,213
Just what?

128
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,924
I am not used to...

129
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,593
seeing you sober.

130
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,554
Crown Prince.

131
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,374
Yes, Father.

132
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,151
Do you remember your sister?

133
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,203
My sister?

134
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,924
I do not remember much of her.

135
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:59,207
Only that she gave me a
candy before she left to patrol.

136
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,183
A candy?

137
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:09,053
I see.

138
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:17,464
These are so beautiful.

139
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:22,447
To see that you are this
pleased, Your Highness,

140
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,133
I am even more grateful.

141
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:25,934
Not at all.

142
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:29,217
I received an unexpected but great gift.

143
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,583
What should I do?

144
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,726
I like this and I like that too.

145
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:37,184
Pick what you want.

146
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,344
Can I really?

147
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,253
Your name is Mo Yong?

148
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:45,764
Yes.

149
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:49,486
The gifts you brought
show you have great taste,

150
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,383
but I am pleased that you care for my son.

151
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:53,594
I am honored.

152
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,817
I heard your daughter is good with money.

153
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,623
You must rely on her a lot.

154
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,757
She also has great knowledge
of herbs and medicine.

155
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:06,387
Keep her close and she
will be of great use to you.

156
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:15,671
We spent way too much money.

157
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:21,707
She would have been pleased with
something that cost half that much.

158
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:24,577
Small branches create
more smoke than flames.

159
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,183
To light a fire, you must use firewood.

160
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,221
Will that fire melt Gochuga's heart too?

161
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,421
He does not easily give his trust.

162
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,594
Even he who conquers the world...

163
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:40,388
is powerless against
talk shared in the bed.

164
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,194
Then are the rumors that...

165
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,640
the two are having an affair true?

166
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,285
I thought the King was the
only one oblivious to the fact.

167
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:54,138
Are you ignorant as well, Father?

168
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,104
My goodness.

169
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:13,323
What are they all flocking
over to plot this time?

170
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,270
We must gain Gochuga's
trust as soon as possible.

171
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,167
Only then can we join in the plotting.

172
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:26,793
The Princess is alive?

173
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,014
Is that really true?

174
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,034
Yes.

175
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,603
I am positive.

176
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:39,504
Gochuga.

177
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:42,964
What do you think?

178
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,264
If the Princess we held
the ceremony for is alive,

179
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,801
then we should be
thankful for the miracle.

180
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,741
Who brought you the great news?

181
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,053
That is not important.

182
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:06,386
The fact that the Princess is alive...

183
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:08,763
could perhaps...

184
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,861
become a problem down the line.

185
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,500
We must decide on preventative measures,

186
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,800
and that is why I summoned you.

187
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,300
The nation would rejoice at the news.

188
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,537
Why would it be a problem?

189
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,941
Yes. That is utterly unreasonable.

190
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:34,873
When the Princess disappeared,

191
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,217
many people died or got hurt.

192
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,320
If word of that were to spread again,

193
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:45,773
it could cause trouble.

194
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,660
I will prevent groundless talk.

195
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,784
You need not worry.

196
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:54,884
Then...

197
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,683
find the Princess first.

198
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:01,784
General Go.

199
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,943
Yes, Your Majesty?

200
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,413
I trust in you.

201
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:11,904
Thank you.

202
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:30,297
You have the King's trust.

203
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,668
He called you to discuss
an important matter.

204
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,474
I am still a bit flustered.

205
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:37,624
I just cannot believe it.

206
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:40,494
The Princess is alive?

207
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:45,299
The King has shown his
intention. That is good enough.

208
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,063
Pardon?

209
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,986
He is afraid the Princess will return.

210
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:54,357
A daughter who remembers
her father's ugly actions.

211
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,463
She is no longer an offspring.

212
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,297
She is a bringer of death.

213
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,633
I heard that Dal...

214
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,654
told only you who I am, Chief.

215
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:30,331
I would like to ask you about something.

216
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,744
Come inside. That day...

217
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,362
Did you remain in the village
with General On Hyeop?

218
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,734
Yes, I did. Then did you...

219
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,283
see the last of...

220
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:50,794
my mother?

221
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,454
After Dal and I left for Yibullansa,

222
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,343
what happened?

223
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,960
That is what I wish to know.

224
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,344
It is all in the past.

225
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,567
What would you do with that knowledge?

226
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,741
Was Gyeru Tribe's Go Won Pyo...

227
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:17,943
there that day?

228
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,103
He was, right?

229
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:47,654
Go Won Pyo.

230
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:51,070
Withdraw your troops right now.

231
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,508
Do you think you will be able to
get away with killing the queen?

232
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,247
His Majesty was the person who told me...

233
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:00,943
to kill you.

234
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,454
Your Majesty.

235
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:37,950
I will not forgive you even after I die.

236
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,693
You will never be able
to take over Goguryeo.

237
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:46,554
Goguryeo is...

238
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,874
already mine.

239
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,313
Your Majesty!

240
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,273
The Queen...

241
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:05,183
remained with the
Sunno Tribe until the end.

242
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:09,581
She did not give in to the treachery.

243
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,383
Thank you.

244
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,800
Something had been plaguing me.

245
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,054
You just cleared my head.

246
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:31,893
Princess.

247
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:35,007
Do not think of getting revenge.

248
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,848
You might be here now
because the late Queen...

249
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:41,754
wishes you forget the
past and live quietly.

250
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,894
Dal said something similar.

251
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:52,704
Do not worry.

252
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,570
Now that we have a new well,

253
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,938
to welcome Ga Jin to the village,

254
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,638
we should kill a few chickens.

255
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,544
How far do you think
a few chickens will go?

256
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,884
A pig. We should slaughter a pig.

257
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,477
That is worth a feast.

258
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,283
If you eat too much meat during a drought,

259
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:18,787
you could get sick.

260
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,473
That is so disgusting.

261
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,504
Buy her a sewing kit.

262
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:26,056
Would she like something like that?

263
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,263
I had a look around her house.

264
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,303
She does not have a mirror.

265
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:32,363
A mirror? A woman...

266
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,600
needs a mirror in the house.

267
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:37,003
Ga Jin does not care for that.

268
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:40,073
How can you know so little about women?

269
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,507
No woman dislikes putting on makeup...

270
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,193
or wearing accessories...

271
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:48,047
Right. Where is the necklace?

272
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:50,317
I did not see her wearing it.

273
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,186
I think she threw it away.

274
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,318
Why would she throw away
something that valuable?

275
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,124
She had her knives and daggers melted too.

276
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,601
She wanted to get rid of her old things.

277
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,234
She must have a lot on her mind too.

278
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:22,414
The decision is yours to make.

279
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:24,986
Will you remain here and play house...

280
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,233
or return to Cheonjubang?

281
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,396
Do not think of getting revenge.

282
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,628
You might be here now
because the late Queen...

283
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,534
wishes you forget the
past and live quietly.

284
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:52,180
It is dark. Are you looking at the moon?

285
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,684
Why are you here?

286
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,956
Tell me if you need anything.

287
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:00,643
What?

288
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:03,957
I am going into the city to
sell animal hides and herbs.

289
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,696
Do you need any tools or household items?

290
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:08,954
No. Are you sure?

291
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,913
Do not complain later on.

292
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,893
Have a safe trip.

293
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:17,794
Okay.

294
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:28,754
You have been acting
strange since yesterday.

295
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,153
How so? You will not speak to me.

296
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:34,694
You are always on your own.

297
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:36,784
Why is that?

298
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,128
Do not blame the
innocent. I never did that.

299
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,414
Then what is it?

300
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,997
Did I do something to upset you?

301
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:49,543
You must be bored. Go home.

302
00:21:50,904 --> 00:21:51,754
Go.

303
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,044
I remember this feeling.

304
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:33,163
Ga Jin.

305
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,134
The villagers...

306
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,133
are pleased you are here.

307
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,364
Not to mention me.

308
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:46,074
So do not get any ideas.

309
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:51,896
I wish you enjoy your life here.

310
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,724
An unidentified killer
attacked Go Won Pyo...

311
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:17,673
but failed.

312
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:20,828
Things in Goguryeo...

313
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,967
Mo Yong. Why are you still here?

314
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:27,633
Did you not say you
would trade with someone?

315
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:30,236
I was just about to leave.

316
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,068
Right now, while you are about to leave,

317
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:35,974
some others will have
already made bargains.

318
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,214
Riches are fleeting.

319
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,420
They only stay with those who move fast.

320
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:46,524
Would I forget something you
said until my ears would bleed?

321
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,658
The negotiations are done. I
just have to check the items.

322
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:53,088
Even if you find even one
flaw, haggle the price down.

323
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:55,994
No. I will haggle even
if there are no flaws.

324
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:00,353
Yes.

325
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:47,133
I do not need anything.

326
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,213
Do herb shop owners...

327
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:04,943
frequent bars as well?

328
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:09,095
I heard this place makes
good money and might buy it.

329
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:17,417
If it will make you money,

330
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:21,564
you will do anything.

331
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,633
I am truly impressed.

332
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,358
I did not know you were
bored enough to drink alone.

333
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:35,884
It is the opposite.

334
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:40,564
I have so much to do,
my head might explode.

335
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,711
Shall I share my meager wisdom?

336
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:45,924
Why?

337
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,813
Do you want to know why I met the King?

338
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,164
Once I tell you,

339
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:57,209
you will weigh things out
to decide whom to side with.

340
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,484
No, thank you.

341
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,296
Are you concerned for the Princess?

342
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,670
Gochuga wants to kill her...

343
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,971
and you wish to protect her.

344
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:16,884
You are torn.

345
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,568
It is none of your business.

346
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:22,307
I do not wish to care, but it bothers me.

347
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:26,587
Because you are suffering.

348
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:39,457
I hope the Princess decides to return.

349
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:44,103
She is the King's daughter.

350
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,204
Pyeongyang Castle is where she belongs.

351
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:49,584
I will make it so.

352
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,293
You are determined.

353
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,163
Is that out of love...

354
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,824
or out of loyalty?

355
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:03,464
It is both.

356
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,533
You said I must make a choice.

357
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,101
Whether I will follow my father...

358
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,067
and take a path drenched in blood or not.

359
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:25,106
You are clever, so make a guess.

360
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:26,724
Do you...

361
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:32,354
smell blood on me?

362
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,903
General.

363
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:57,971
I was demoted from
Head of Capital Defense.

364
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,813
I was upset, so I had a drink.

365
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:03,194
Oh, right.

366
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,317
I have not yet told the King.

367
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:10,683
That I am no longer
Head of Capital Defense.

368
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:12,974
Thanks to you,

369
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,204
I am alive.

370
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:23,301
I will behead the assassins
in public tomorrow.

371
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:32,373
I will give you 300
mounted men with armor...

372
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:34,734
and 300 soldiers.

373
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:37,934
Pardon?

374
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:41,084
That is a bigger force
than the place guards.

375
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,153
Can you handle them?

376
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:53,094
Whom do you want me to attack?

377
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:16,603
I am sorry.

378
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:19,684
Just this once, forgive me.

379
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,163
I will return once my friends are safe.

380
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:01,944
Salute!

381
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:05,231
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!

382
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,870
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!

383
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,570
Salute! Salute! Salute! Salute!

384
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,412
I heard the Gyeru Tribe have
gathered a bunch of soldiers.

385
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
Yes, I heard it too.

386
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,203
I heard the troops are
led by General Go Geon.

387
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,142
Do you know what is going on?

388
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:40,669
No.

389
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,627
How would I know what
the Gyeru Tribe is up to?

390
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:48,583
Gochuga has always
been a very suspicious man.

391
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,439
Father.

392
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,094
Something serious is happening
in and outside the palace.

393
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,780
How can you be so calm?

394
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,363
When the world is going through chaos,

395
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:01,903
the best thing to do is to sit
back and watch what happens.

396
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:05,493
What if you get involved
only to get yourself in a mess?

397
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
You are so frustrating.

398
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,083
Until Geon Mu becomes the crown prince...

399
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:18,969
No.

400
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,557
Until he finally takes the throne,

401
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,126
you and I must always be on our toes.

402
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,180
Do you understand?

403
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,420
Yes.

404
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,360
Of course.

405
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,297
I filled the pot with water,

406
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:04,064
so use as much as you
want. You can wash too.

407
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,970
What kind of a fool
washes during a drought?

408
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,620
But must you leave?

409
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,310
I will be back as soon
as I sell the herbs...

410
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,943
and buy the things I need.

411
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:16,682
I had an unpleasant dream.

412
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,544
What did you dream of?

413
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,283
You know that new girl, Yeom something...

414
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,670
Mother, she has a name.

415
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:28,689
Yeom Ga Jin. Anyway,

416
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,654
she was wearing
something really expensive...

417
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,460
that looked like the wings of a dragonfly.

418
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,570
She was sitting somewhere very high up.

419
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,307
And you were sobbing in front of her.

420
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,889
You seemed heartbroken.

421
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,030
What a silly dream.

422
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,374
I will be off now.

423
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,820
Please be careful.

424
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,282
My goodness, what a nasty dream.

425
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,383
Why not take me with you
so I can help you carry all that?

426
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:00,054
What good will she do?

427
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,084
I am sure you do not have
the eyes to pick out a mirror.

428
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,090
You are going to buy a mirror?

429
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,230
I need one too.

430
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,564
Goodness, I will not take long.

431
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,263
I heard people in the city are
also suffering due to the drought.

432
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:13,633
It is okay if you fail to sell everything.

433
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:15,464
Just come back quickly. He is right.

434
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,670
But where is Ga Jin? I
have not seen her anywhere.

435
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,159
I am sure she is fine.

436
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,274
Come on. We are spending
way too long saying goodbye.

437
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,960
We will be back. Goodbye.

438
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,529
Bye. See you.

439
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,200
Bye. Bye.

440
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,087
Do not take too long.
Wol seems so excited.

441
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,170
I will go save Jin and San.

442
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,150
This is the last thing I can
do to repay you for raising me.

443
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:54,559
And?

444
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,149
Then I will leave with my father.

445
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,573
Do not ever look for me again.

446
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,971
Your fate will come looking
for you even if I do not.

447
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,249
I will not be there.

448
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:10,024
Do you think you will be
able to escape forever?

449
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,166
If a moment comes where
I can no longer avoid it,

450
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,940
I will have to fight.

451
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,059
Yes.

452
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,362
You will soon end up facing
a fight you cannot avoid.

453
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,570
Father.

454
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:34,959
Are you okay?

455
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,652
Ga Jin, what are you doing here?

456
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,619
I told you not to come near this place.

457
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:43,999
Do not worry.

458
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,153
Once I bring back San and Jin,

459
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,839
we can leave together.

460
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,994
I found a place for the both of us.

461
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,533
Will you be okay on your own?

462
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,064
There will be a lot of soldiers.

463
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,670
Take him to the hut.

464
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,604
Do not do anything to harm him.

465
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,460
Ga Jin.

466
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,179
Do not worry.

467
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,710
This will really be my last time.

468
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,927
I have a message for
my people of Goguryeo.

469
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,036
Due to the cruelty of the
skies, the lands have turned dry.

470
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,422
And migrant thieves have started
to bring more chaos to the country.

471
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:06,275
Think of all the castles
they have burned down...

472
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,780
and the countless people they have killed.

473
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:14,157
They dared to be hostile to our country...

474
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:16,630
and threaten the safety of your King,

475
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,957
which makes them the root of all evil.

476
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:22,763
Therefore, I will execute those thieves...

477
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:27,471
in front of thousands of people...

478
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,931
to teach everyone the power
and dignity of Goguryeo.

479
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:37,383
There are so many people gathered here.

480
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:40,918
Let us sell our stuff here.
We can see the criminals too.

481
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:41,774
Sure.

482
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,026
Do you think it is a show?

483
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,657
That kind of stuff is
not something to watch.

484
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,023
Let us get going.

485
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,594
Are they assassins?

486
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,258
Are you sure you will
never kill anyone again?

487
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:23,976
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.

488
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:53,804
What are you doing here?

489
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:57,948
You should be in Ghost Valley.
Why are you here instead?

490
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:00,097
And what are you wearing?

491
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:02,236
The criminals that got caught...

492
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:03,874
are my friends.

493
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:07,144
They got caught...

494
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:09,543
while doing my job instead of me.

495
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:13,777
Do not tell me...

496
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:15,463
They are like my family.

497
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:18,033
I cannot let them die.

498
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:21,359
So what? Are you saying
you are going to fight...

499
00:38:22,494 --> 00:38:23,948
with all those soldiers?

500
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,858
I just need to save my friends.

501
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:27,544
I will not hurt anyone.

502
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,660
Dal, this will be my last time.

503
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:35,984
Please let me do this.

504
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:40,024
Dal!

505
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:43,224
Ga Jin.

506
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:45,854
What brings you here?

507
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:48,393
Pung Gae.

508
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:53,004
We need to help Ga Jin.

509
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:54,534
What? Dal.

510
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:56,487
You cannot do this alone.

511
00:38:56,493 --> 00:38:57,648
This is not something
you should get involved in.

512
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:59,334
No, this is our problem.

513
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:03,364
You are a member of Ghost Valley.

514
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:13,407
The criminals are outside.

515
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:18,938
He is going to behead them...

516
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,908
to hide who was behind
the incident of the ceremony.

517
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:25,882
And thus, he wishes to suppress
the people by instilling fear.

518
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:28,357
Gochuga is a very greedy man.

519
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:33,086
He is trying to catch many
birds with just one stone.

520
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,558
Is General Go in charge of the scene?

521
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,244
The guards are there,

522
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:43,434
but the person in charge
was not General Go.

523
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:06,558
We found the entrance.

524
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:09,700
Did you check the
surroundings? There was no one.

525
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,200
There is not a single rat here.

526
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:54,254
Where are they hiding?

527
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:05,178
Search the entire place.

528
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:06,448
Search the place!

529
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:08,134
Yes, master. Yes, master.

530
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:13,705
You dogs of Goguryeo have
traveled a long way for nothing.

531
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:17,100
Cheonjubangs are everywhere,

532
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,866
but at the same time, we do not exist.

533
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,370
You will never be able to find us.

534
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,367
I wish you dogs a peaceful death...

535
00:41:28,674 --> 00:41:30,114
inside your grave.

536
00:41:32,684 --> 00:41:34,364
Do not touch anything!

537
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,763
Run! Get out of here!

538
00:41:57,204 --> 00:41:59,137
Let us go back to the palace.

539
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,318
As soon as we save your friends,

540
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:21,396
we will be returning to
Ghost Valley right away.

541
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,544
Be careful.

542
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:45,694
What is that?

543
00:42:47,654 --> 00:42:49,418
My goodness, look. Look at that.

544
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:50,747
Goodness! It is a fire!

545
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:52,433
Oh, dear! What happened?

546
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:55,257
There is fire! What are we going to do?

547
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:56,943
My goodness! Oh, my gosh!

548
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:04,034
Pung Gae, is this really okay?

549
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:06,867
The fire is too big.

550
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:09,207
It will be fine. The stable
was all rotten anyway.

551
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:10,967
People will come and
put it out. Let us go.

552
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:11,823
Okay.

553
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:19,053
Look. Goodness.

554
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:21,744
My goodness.

555
00:43:22,794 --> 00:43:23,644
Now.

556
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,633
My goodness. What is going on?

557
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:31,884
Ga Jin.

558
00:43:39,274 --> 00:43:40,124
Ga Jin.

559
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:42,124
Ga Jin.

560
00:43:43,174 --> 00:43:44,294
We need to go!

561
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:54,503
Hurry! Hurry up!

562
00:44:00,664 --> 00:44:01,514
Get going!

563
00:44:24,284 --> 00:44:25,964
Hurry up and leave! Go!

564
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:29,034
Dal!

565
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:30,144
Go! Hurry.

566
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:31,834
Hurry up and go!

567
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:33,973
Just go!

568
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:57,207
What are you going to do now?

569
00:44:57,213 --> 00:45:00,925
They will not be able to
leave the city looking like that.

570
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,343
Will Dal be okay?

571
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:05,587
How am I supposed to know? Darn it.

572
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:07,726
Why are you taking it out on me?

573
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:17,114
Where are you going? Hey.

574
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:23,333
Who are you?

575
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,993
Do you remember me?

576
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:30,477
You must pay what you
owe. You cannot just leave.

577
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:32,350
I promise to pay what I owe.

578
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,577
Oh, it is you.

579
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:37,316
Please help me with a few injured people.

580
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,158
I want you guys to hide at the herb store.

581
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,697
What about you? I need to go find Dal.

582
00:45:57,814 --> 00:45:59,614
Are you also a Cheonjubang?

583
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,123
What is that?

584
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:04,533
Where are the criminals?

585
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:06,843
"Criminals"?

586
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,390
You guys are the ones who do bad things.

587
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,800
Tell me right now, or I will behead you.

588
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:29,294
Father...

589
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:38,703
Stop!

590
00:46:58,003 --> 00:47:00,603
How dare a petty killer come back here?

591
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:05,844
How dare you...

592
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:08,063
lay your hands on me?

593
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:21,667
I am the eldest daughter
of Goguryeo's King...

594
00:47:21,694 --> 00:47:23,374
and the late Queen Yeon,

595
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,233
Princess Pyeonggang.

596
00:47:29,073 --> 00:47:32,401
How dare you claim the
title of the royal household?

597
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:34,936
You must want to be beheaded.

598
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:36,393
Go Sang Cheol.

599
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:38,473
I remember you.

600
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:42,355
I also remember how you
mercilessly massacred...

601
00:47:42,684 --> 00:47:44,684
the people of the Sunno Tribe.

602
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,194
Shut your mouth!

603
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:49,188
What are you waiting for?
Behead these two right now!

604
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:51,927
If you dare touch the body of a princess,

605
00:47:52,424 --> 00:47:54,658
your entire family and
relatives will be annihilated.

606
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,704
She is lying!

607
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,957
The Princess has long been dead!

608
00:47:57,963 --> 00:47:58,813
Kill them!

609
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:00,113
Step back!

610
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:19,053
She is Princess Pyeonggang!

611
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,294
Make your curtsy to Her Highness.

612
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:48,324
I am Head of Special Forces Go
Geon, paying respects to Your Highness.

613
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:03,184
Dal.

614
00:49:17,073 --> 00:49:18,593
Where is my friend?

615
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:21,511
Tell me where my friend went! Come here!

616
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:28,403
Hey! Hey!

617
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,623
Can you not hear me?

618
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:33,513
Where is my friend?

619
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:35,544
Tell me where she is!

620
00:49:35,993 --> 00:49:36,843
Hey!

621
00:49:47,303 --> 00:49:48,153
Oh, my.

622
00:49:49,374 --> 00:49:50,334
My goodness.

623
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,146
My gosh. Princess Pyeonggang?

624
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:14,584
I, Princess Pyeonggang,

625
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,767
have made it back to the palace.

626
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:22,612
Please forgive your
undutiful daughter, Father.

627
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,764
So it was not a dream.

628
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:33,594
You were not a ghost.

629
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:37,054
You were actually alive,
Princess Pyeonggang.

630
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,714
I lost my memory...

631
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:44,688
and have been living
without knowing who I was.

632
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:46,894
I apologize for making you worry.

633
00:50:56,773 --> 00:50:57,653
Not at all.

634
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:01,777
It is all good since
you made it back alive.

635
00:51:01,783 --> 00:51:05,623
Thank you for coming back to
your father who has failed you.

636
00:52:03,114 --> 00:52:03,964
Princess?

637
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,034
What happened?

638
00:52:11,184 --> 00:52:14,576
I guess your friends will
live longer than I thought.

639
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,873
Dal...

640
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,614
You do not have to worry.

641
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:32,120
Nothing will change just
because the Princess is back.

642
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:36,168
I am sure the King is not
that glad to have her back...

643
00:52:36,174 --> 00:52:38,777
as he is guilty about what
he did to Queen Yeon.

644
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,737
Regardless of what happened in the past,

645
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:42,743
she is his daughter after all.

646
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:46,913
We cannot feel relieved
as we do not know...

647
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:50,448
how the King will change
because of the Princess.

648
00:52:50,454 --> 00:52:53,974
You must pay close attention
to both of them, Daedaero.

649
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:59,427
Why are you not saying anything, Gochuga?

650
00:53:03,104 --> 00:53:06,112
A princess who lost her
memory became a killer?

651
00:53:09,674 --> 00:53:13,002
She survived and managed
to come back to the palace.

652
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:20,686
The one we have to keep in
check is the Princess, not the King.

653
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:24,188
Why should we keep an
eye on that mere chit of a girl?

654
00:53:24,194 --> 00:53:25,234
She is a cub.

655
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:32,598
If she takes after her
late mother's nature,

656
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:34,044
soon, her claws...

657
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:37,114
will be directed at us.

658
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:45,423
Mother.

659
00:53:46,914 --> 00:53:49,247
Your unfilial daughter, Pyeonggang,

660
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:52,963
has finally come back.

661
00:53:54,624 --> 00:53:56,304
I can finally tell you...

662
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,561
the long patrol is now over.

663
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,483
Her funeral was grand.

664
00:54:13,803 --> 00:54:16,747
People of all ages and
gender mourned for her.

665
00:54:19,944 --> 00:54:22,211
She adored the people of Goguryeo.

666
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:28,233
Even at her last moment,

667
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:31,854
she protected the
people of the Sunno Tribe.

668
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:37,623
You must be tired. You
should get some rest.

669
00:54:38,364 --> 00:54:40,497
Tell me all those stories later.

670
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:43,344
They put my friend...

671
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:44,784
in jail.

672
00:54:47,273 --> 00:54:48,953
He was trying to help me.

673
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:51,944
I think you should let him go.

674
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:56,687
The Five Tribe council is in
charge of prisoner dispositions.

675
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,350
If you give an order as a king,

676
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:02,284
the Five Tribe council
should follow it too.

677
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:05,293
Did you say he is your friend?

678
00:55:06,263 --> 00:55:07,113
Yes.

679
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,943
He is also my savior...

680
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:12,467
who saved my life several times.

681
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:18,434
Commander Go said...

682
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:22,567
he could have gotten
rid of the Princess...

683
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,573
if you did not get in the way.

684
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:26,624
Is that true?

685
00:55:29,414 --> 00:55:32,448
How could he kill the Princess
at the heart of the Capital?

686
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,047
How will you deal with the consequences?

687
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:37,953
I only stopped him for
the sake of my family.

688
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:43,160
Was it not because
you admire the Princess?

689
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:50,762
Laying aside your family
because of your feelings...

690
00:55:51,073 --> 00:55:54,657
is not appropriate for the
next head of the Gyeru Tribe.

691
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,944
You should be more careful.

692
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:59,981
It is not something I
should be careful of.

693
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:04,608
What did you say?

694
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:05,574
The woman...

695
00:56:06,854 --> 00:56:11,078
whom I have buried in my heart
for a long time has returned alive.

696
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:13,717
Earning her heart is as important as...

697
00:56:13,723 --> 00:56:15,083
ruling the world.

698
00:56:44,293 --> 00:56:46,026
Hey! Bring back my friend!

699
00:56:49,793 --> 00:56:52,393
Can you not pretend to listen at least?

700
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:53,984
Hey!

701
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:56,337
Quiet down. How dare you act up?

702
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,234
Do you wish to die in here?

703
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,223
My goodness. Good sir.

704
00:57:04,043 --> 00:57:07,563
I have something to tell
my friend, so please call her.

705
00:57:08,084 --> 00:57:09,044
Please? Hey!

706
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:12,120
Look at this guy. How dare you?

707
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:13,833
Move.

708
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:15,817
Let me teach you a lesson.

709
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:17,954
Sit still, you jerk! Oh, gosh!

710
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:26,014
Is Tae Mo not back yet?

711
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,514
He will be here soon.

712
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:31,533
Chief, everyone is anxious.

713
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:35,477
Perhaps this plan is too dangerous.

714
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:43,234
Chief.

715
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:46,481
Ga Jin went into the palace.

716
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:50,948
I hear she is the Princess of
Goguryeo who died a long time ago,

717
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:53,487
and the whole Capital is in chaos now.

718
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:54,613
So she...

719
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,527
returned to the palace?

720
00:57:58,533 --> 00:57:59,893
Does that mean...

721
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:02,114
you knew who Ga Jin was?

722
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:25,247
The people of Cheonjubang were
born in a field and raised in a mountain.

723
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:29,157
Only the ones with a strong
mind and soul to kill the King...

724
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:31,313
can follow my path.

725
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:35,163
If you are afraid, stay.
Those who are brave,

726
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:37,874
come with me.

727
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:37,546
The heads of the Five Tribes would
like to greet you, Your Highness.

728
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:49,943
I am Gochuga of the
Gyeru Tribe, Go Won Pyo.

729
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:53,237
I would like to congratulate
you on your return to the palace.

730
00:59:53,243 --> 00:59:57,275
Congratulations, Your Highness.
Congratulations, Your Highness.

731
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:08,333
What is this?

732
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:12,363
A talisman that will make you queen.

733
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,567
You must see but not look,

734
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:19,023
and hear but not listen for
your family to be at peace.

735
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:23,794
Goguryeo is...

736
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:26,353
already mine.

737
01:00:30,483 --> 01:00:31,843
It has been long.

738
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:39,284
I am delighted to see that you
are in good health, Your Highness.

739
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:44,494
I have been well,

740
01:00:45,263 --> 01:00:46,383
thanks to you.

741
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,867
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

742
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:00,899
You should come with me.

743
01:02:00,905 --> 01:02:01,755
I cannot.

744
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:05,298
I am back as a princess,
so I should live at the palace.

745
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,598
I hear you could have
gotten rid of the Princess.

746
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:09,239
I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.

747
01:02:09,245 --> 01:02:12,145
Father and the Prince
find me uncomfortable.

748
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,325
I will be on your side.

749
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:16,909
You? The next head of the Gyeru Tribe?

750
01:02:16,915 --> 01:02:19,782
If you disobey my
order, I will disown you.

751
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:21,884
Something dangerous?

752
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:24,288
What is it that you want me to do?

753
01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:26,627
Everything related to the Princess.
