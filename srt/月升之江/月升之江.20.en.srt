1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,924
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,898
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,824
I stripped General Go
Geon of his military rights.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,680
Therefore,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,120
I need you to...

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,434
assist me and ride into battle.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,120
I must do as you command.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,504
Did you manage to rest in comfort?

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,577
It was not exactly comfortable.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,617
To think that you doubted me...

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,817
because of a Goguryeo fool's ruse.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,200
You are of noble blood...

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,314
and a core member of my court.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,653
Would I truly doubt and desert you?

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,740
While you got some rest,

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
I used Go Geon's madness...

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,963
to speed up the preparations for the war.

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,750
You must get rid of...

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,933
Lord Hae and his daughter.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,660
Not just those two.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,380
The stubborn Goguryeo maverick...

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,883
who is not as useful as I expected.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,000
He must go as well.

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,460
You managed to clip General Go's wings,

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,093
but what will you do next?

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,180
General Go.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,767
Even if he becomes a nobody,

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,837
will your love for him not change?

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,290
It will not change.

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,860
My gosh.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,243
This is why issues that...

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,180
cannot be solved with
money are a headache.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,784
You are blinded with love,

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,790
and so you do not see the end.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,170
Mo Yong.

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,610
Your father's eyes...

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,760
see the end.

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,174
Men of the Central Army's
Five Bu are ready for battle.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,444
Soldiers from the Five
Tribes have also joined them.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,444
Daedaero. Watch over the Capital for me.

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,906
I will do my best so the
people do not become restless.

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,727
Your Majesty. I pray that...

43
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,470
you return victorious.

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,324
Silla's army plans to attack
the Princess and General On.

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,613
We will rush to save them,

46
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,583
and recover Adan Fortress!

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
Salute!
Salute!

48
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,570
Salute!
Salute!

49
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,090
Stop crying.

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,727
You are King Pyeongwon's son...

51
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,710
and a prince of Goguryeo.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,970
Over the years,

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,950
I did many bad things.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,280
I should pay for it with my life,

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
but instead, I am only leaving the palace.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,257
The King has shown me grace.

57
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,657
Will I never get to see you again?

58
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,080
Until now,

59
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,114
I dreamed only of the day
when you would take the throne.

60
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,020
One day,

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
when my dream comes true,

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,300
we will meet again.

63
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,800
Mother.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,780
You must be strong.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
Until that day comes.

66
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,310
ADAN FORTRESS

67
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,080
General.

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,216
General. The advance party
broke through the east wall.

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,934
We must enter before the main army...

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,620
blocks the East Gate.

71
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,913
Did you come here to live?

72
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,010
We came to win!
We came to win!

73
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,990
If we lose,

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
will you die?

75
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,944
We will win! We will live!
We will win! We will live!

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,630
Brave men of Goguryeo!

77
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,030
We head to battle!

78
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,823
General. Where are you going?

79
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,597
If I tell you, will you follow?

80
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,493
The Silla army left at daybreak.

81
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,050
Then I can relax...

82
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,880
and chase their tail.

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,164
Even if you go to the fortress,

84
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,770
do you think you can meet the Princess?

85
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,360
So...

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,200
that was what was written
in the letter that was burned.

87
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,217
The one who told the King...

88
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,260
was Lord Hae...

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,280
or you. Am I right?

90
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,540
Yes.

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,340
I did it.
Why?

92
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,194
For fear that you would go
to your death for the Princess.

93
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,528
In case you jumped into a
pit you cannot escape from.

94
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
So I made you stay back.

95
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,004
That was foolish of you!

96
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,677
No. I did many foolish things until now.

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
Now I will act wisely...

98
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,390
to save your life.

99
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,690
Lady Hae. Even if you save me,

100
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,130
I cannot be saved.

101
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,970
Why do you not see that?

102
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,340
Do not forgive me.

103
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,150
A hundred times a day,

104
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,380
until the day you die of old age,

105
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,700
curse me,

106
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,800
hate me,

107
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,110
and resent me.

108
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
You have...

109
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,210
no right to be resented.

110
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,460
I know that.

111
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,710
That is what I am.

112
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,830
Your Majesty. We got
word from Adan Fortress.

113
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,250
It is good news.

114
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,043
The 3,000 men took back Adan Fortress.

115
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,374
What about the Princess and General On?

116
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,500
Are they safe?

117
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,760
Yes.

118
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,953
So is General Sa Pung Gae.

119
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,784
Things will worsen when
Silla's main army arrives.

120
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,910
We must hurry.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,990
Are we too late?

122
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,687
It seems the governor did not last long.

123
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,210
Spread out our men.

124
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,687
Will you not attack right away?

125
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,157
We must give them a chance to surrender.

126
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,410
Spread out!

127
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,404
It is the Silla army!

128
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,090
The Silla army is here!

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,253
That is the King's banner.

130
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,230
The King came in person.

131
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,860
A messenger!

132
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,720
Halt.

133
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
What does it say?

134
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,504
That we should surrender?

135
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,190
By daybreak tomorrow,

136
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,244
we are to put down our
arms and open the gates.

137
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,644
They will kill every
one of us if we fight.

138
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,717
How dare the lunatics say that?

139
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,053
What will you do, General?

140
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,940
The Goguryeo people...

141
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,730
cannot leave Goguryeo land.

142
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,670
I will fight until the last man goes down.

143
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,664
I will fight with you.

144
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,190
As will I, General.

145
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,460
Princess.

146
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
This is where...

147
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,550
your duty ends.

148
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
I do not want to go.

149
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,824
I will stay and fight.

150
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,830
No. You must obey the General.

151
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,870
Take the wounded
safely back to the Capital

152
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
But...
I too...

153
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,610
want you to be safe.

154
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,430
Honey.

155
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,450
Do not be stupid.

156
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,430
I cannot go without you.

157
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,670
I will not.

158
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,257
You did what you came to do.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,294
You fought with me,

160
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,900
and we got back your father's heritage.

161
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,370
That is enough.

162
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,103
I will protect it, Ga Jin.

163
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,860
No.

164
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,450
I will stay with you.

165
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,130
Do not be stubborn.

166
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,740
That is an order,

167
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,442
not from your husband but
from the leader of the army.

168
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,750
Return with Jin and the wounded men.

169
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,600
We got the fortress back,

170
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,610
but we lost many men.

171
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,723
You do not have many left.

172
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,633
This fight is meaningless.

173
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,120
So Dal...

174
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,650
Whether we win or lose,

175
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,300
it is a warrior's fate to
never put down his sword.

176
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,410
If any soldiers wish to leave,

177
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,647
I will send them with the wounded.

178
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,660
I said my piece.

179
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Okay. I will prepare to leave.

180
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,730
The wounded...

181
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,004
return to Pyeongyang
Castle with the Princess!

182
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,450
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

183
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,890
Jin. We should go.

184
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,300
Stop.

185
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,000
What is it, Princess?

186
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,790
Jin. I cannot leave like this.

187
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
What do you mean?

188
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,024
Do you think General On
will be pleased if you go back?

189
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,897
He will not even let you in.

190
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,650
No.

191
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
I am not returning to General On.

192
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,920
What?

193
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,070
Did the King send you?

194
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,280
Princess.

195
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,540
Do not do it.

196
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,210
Who goes there?

197
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,880
Who are you?

198
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,357
Your Majesty. It is Goguryeo's princess,

199
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,290
Princess Pyeonggang.

200
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,233
I have heard of your prowess.

201
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,520
Seeing you in person...

202
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,740
is quite remarkable.

203
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,374
If it had not been for General Go Geon,

204
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,780
she could have killed me as I slept.

205
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,330
Thank you.

206
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,023
If you infiltrated us without command,

207
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,914
you will be punished.

208
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,787
You smuggled Goguryeo women.

209
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
That is rich, coming from you.

210
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,320
You are very brave.

211
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,064
A princess sneaks deep
into the enemy camp...

212
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,670
hiding a weapon too?

213
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,843
Were you sent by your king...

214
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
or by your husband?

215
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,660
I came on my own accord.

216
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,530
If I were to kill you,

217
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,683
I can save my men's lives.

218
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,900
Oh, dear.

219
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,620
I gave you a chance to surrender.

220
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,740
Not at all.

221
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,370
General On...

222
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,667
and the men at Adan Fortress...

223
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,293
will fight until the last man dies.

224
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,437
I think highly of your bravery,

225
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,767
but you must also see the whole picture.

226
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,034
You are disadvantaged,
even before the fight.

227
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,174
Why do you not see that?

228
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,460
Even if we lose,

229
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,080
we will not give up
the fortress that easily.

230
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,764
The corpses of your men will
stack as high as a mountain.

231
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,620
General Go.
Yes?

232
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,084
The Princess who is my prisoner...

233
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,530
is threatening me.

234
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,263
I should have her dragged out and killed.

235
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,180
What do you say?

236
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,290
Kill her.

237
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,104
If you let her live,

238
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,377
she will become a threat to Silla.

239
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,710
Do you mean that?

240
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,260
To fight Goguryeo,

241
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,150
I came here without your command.

242
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,230
Why would I lie to you?

243
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,640
Too bad.

244
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,767
Even your old subordinate
has abandoned you.

245
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
There is an old proverb
that stuck with me.

246
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,710
"Jade, even when smashed,
does not lose its color,"

247
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,477
"and bamboo, even when burned,"

248
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,117
"does not curve at the joints."

249
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,790
You can kill me...

250
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,000
or attack Adan Fortress.

251
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,327
The result will be the same.

252
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,547
I thought they would attack at daybreak.

253
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,060
This is strange.

254
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,380
He is right. They are not moving.

255
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,124
General, you have a letter
from the Silla army camp.

256
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,353
Is that not the Princess' bracelet?

257
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,920
Your lady, Pyeonggang, is held at my camp.

258
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,096
She became captured by
me while trying to harm me.

259
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,794
I heard that you would even
risk your life to win this battle,

260
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,194
but that would be a meaningless sacrifice.

261
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,834
Surrender immediately...

262
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,848
to save the lives of the
Princess and my troops.

263
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,230
Pung Gae.

264
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,480
The Princess...

265
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,250
has been captured by the Silla army.

266
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,350
Unless I surrender,

267
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,110
Ga Jin will be killed.

268
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,910
Are you all right?

269
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,670
I only told him to kill you...

270
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,040
because I knew the
Silla king would not do so.

271
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,360
I understand that much.

272
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,050
I will find a way.
What are you trying to do?

273
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,784
What is the matter?
That is none of your business.

274
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,640
Take her.

275
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,740
Yes.
Yes.

276
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,634
Tell me what this is about.

277
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,774
Where are you taking her?

278
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,104
His Majesty ordered the
Princess be taken to Seorabeol.

279
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,230
He promised...

280
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,744
that she would be sent
home if Goguryeo surrendered.

281
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,580
You may be lucky,

282
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,754
but you are apparently not clever.

283
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,224
A precious prisoner like her
could not be sent back so easily.

284
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,754
Whether On Dal opens
the castle gate or not,

285
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,560
they will all be
slaughtered before sunset.

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,850
Follow me!

287
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes.
Yes.

288
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,114
Things started getting
more and more complicated...

289
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,240
at some point.

290
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,160
I no longer even
remember what I fight for.

291
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,024
We will fight together...

292
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,124
to recover the legacy of General On,

293
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,250
Adan Fortress.

294
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,010
After that,

295
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,833
we will leave everything behind.

296
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,830
The two of us.

297
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,390
Do not be afraid, Dal.

298
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,216
I am not afraid of anything
because I am with you.

299
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,620
Lady Hae.

300
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,350
What are you doing here?

301
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,980
I came to get you.

302
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,677
We have already discussed...
My father...

303
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,070
passed away.

304
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,780
What?
He was slain...

305
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,787
by soldiers under the king's command.

306
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
"The king's command"?

307
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,970
But why?

308
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,393
You may be in danger as well.

309
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,860
I am sure the King gave his command.

310
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,260
You may be lucky,

311
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,667
but you are apparently not clever.

312
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,950
I have nowhere to go now.

313
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,320
Will you say no...

314
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,510
if I ask you to take me in?

315
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,250
The Princess...

316
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,884
is being held by the Silla army.

317
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,184
Kim Cha Seung is taking her to Seorabeol.

318
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,990
I was following the escort.

319
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,880
All you care about...

320
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
until the end is the Princess.

321
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,320
Lady Hae.

322
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,700
Please. I will get in touch with you...

323
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,473
and come to you by all means.

324
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,330
General.

325
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,460
Let me help you.

326
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,844
It would be better than fighting alone.

327
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,650
What are you talking about?

328
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,384
You should stay out of this.

329
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,790
I can take care of a soldier or two.

330
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,557
You should worry about yourself instead.

331
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,660
Do you expect me to let you get killed?

332
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,664
Should I give a shout
when you ambush them?

333
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,550
Have you...

334
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,530
lost your mind?

335
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,520
Probably.

336
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,973
Your obsession with the Princess...

337
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,307
must have caused me
to lose my mind as well.

338
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,473
Make up your mind quickly.

339
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,077
The Princess is getting farther away.

340
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,850
Halt.

341
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,174
The Princess is not going to Seorabeol.

342
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Her home is Pyeongyang Castle.

343
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,044
My apologies. I know that
you would rather not see me.

344
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,170
Your Highness.

345
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,560
You despicable rats.

346
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,580
Get them!

347
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,950
Lady Hae.

348
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,300
Lady Hae.

349
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Are you okay?

350
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,700
Yes.

351
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,540
Do not worry about me.

352
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,254
If we go back the way we came,

353
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,927
we will run into the rest of the troops.

354
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,080
We must take a detour.

355
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,360
Thank you both.

356
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,870
We should go.

357
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,720
Lady Hae, can you get up?

358
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,890
General.

359
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,920
What should we do?

360
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,930
The soldiers are waiting.

361
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,157
Should we open the castle gate?

362
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,984
The great cause of
protecting the empire...

363
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,024
or the justification
of saving the people...

364
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,990
These are...

365
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,000
all nonsense.

366
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,500
The only person you
must risk your life to protect.

367
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,540
And the only reason a
man must wield a sword.

368
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,890
She is your only reason.

369
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,870
Pung Gae.

370
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,450
The only person you
must risk your life to protect.

371
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,260
That person is the only reason...

372
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,240
a man must wield a sword.

373
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,070
Both you and I...

374
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,343
have someone we must protect.

375
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,130
Dal.

376
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,820
General On...

377
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,030
would have been proud...

378
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,020
to see you now.

379
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,760
Thank you, Pung Gae.

380
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,593
For being by my side until the end.

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
It has been my great honor, General.

382
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,630
General!

383
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,587
A message has arrived at the north gate.

384
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,136
His Majesty is leading his
troops here to the fortress.

385
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,740
What did you say?

386
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,104
Go Geon took the Princess away?

387
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,790
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

388
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,244
I sent agile constables
and archers to chase them.

389
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,450
They will be captured in no time.

390
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,890
Your Majesty.

391
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,514
The King of Goguryeo and his
troops are marching on Adan Fortress.

392
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,040
Our spy says the number of
soldiers well exceeds 30,000.

393
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,950
After all,

394
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,963
he wishes to save his sister.

395
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,690
However,

396
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,350
you let my precious prisoner escape.

397
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,500
Fine.

398
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,580
I can handle the immature king
of Goguryeo with no trouble at all.

399
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
We are going to war.

400
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,933
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

401
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,784
General On, the King plans
to attack Silla from the side.

402
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,894
Should we leave the fortress
to surround them from the side?

403
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,800
Believe in the King
and protect the fortress.

404
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,648
The King will bring us
a victory all on his own.

405
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,864
Your Highness, the
battle will take place soon.

406
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,870
We must hurry. Lady Hae.

407
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,370
She cannot walk anymore.

408
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,024
I will carry her on my back.

409
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,763
It will open up her wound.

410
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,994
If she bleeds more than this,
her life would be in danger.

411
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,064
The Silla soldiers will
be coming after us soon.

412
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,070
We should move Lady Hae first.

413
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,190
Lady Hae. Please get up.

414
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,004
Your Highness, what do you plan to do?

415
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,474
I must let General On know.

416
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,114
That will alert the
soldiers coming after us.

417
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,720
I do not have time to argue about this.

418
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,940
Dal, I am right here.

419
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,134
It is a signal pouch with colored powder.

420
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,340
If you are in danger, tie
it to an arrow and shoot.

421
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,460
Just go.

422
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,047
I do not want to burden you.

423
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,200
Burden me?

424
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,894
You are the first friend I made
after returning to the palace.

425
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,400
Pung Gae, keep the fortress safe.

426
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,380
What will you do now?

427
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,307
You cannot return to Silla now.

428
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,560
But...

429
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,143
I cannot return to Goguryeo either.

430
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,353
I lost my family and country.

431
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,390
I even failed to keep my promise.

432
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,580
Letting you...

433
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,523
take my life would be better.

434
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,400
Master Go. You did not lose everything.

435
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,294
You have someone who is willing
to join you even if it means death.

436
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,630
Princess.

437
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,360
I have always...

438
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,160
made the same decision.

439
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,040
It was you.

440
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,620
That way!

441
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,140
Over there!
Princess.

442
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,360
Mo Yong.

443
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,730
Go.

444
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,190
General Go.

445
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,890
Princess!

446
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
General Go!

447
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,960
What were you doing
here? This was foolish.

448
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,640
Princess.

449
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,150
These two...

450
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,540
saved me.

451
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,560
It has been a while.

452
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,397
You too, Lady Hae.
Country bumpkin.

453
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
You are still calling me that.

454
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,170
Take the Princess...

455
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,120
and Lady Hae.

456
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,730
Hurry.

457
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,640
No, Master Go.

458
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,320
I cannot leave.

459
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,770
These women...

460
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,540
never listen to me.

461
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,540
I know that too well.

462
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,550
Have you forgotten?

463
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,330
Even if it kills me,

464
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,773
I will be buried next to you.

465
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,460
Princess.

466
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,647
I must postpone our match...

467
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,540
until next time.

468
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,190
I will wait for you.

469
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,280
Okay.

470
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,897
If you want to fight Ga Jin,

471
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,450
you must beat me first.

472
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,033
Take the Princess with you...

473
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,820
and go.

474
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,130
Please go now.

475
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,830
On a day like this,

476
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,550
I wish I could sit in a boat on a river...

477
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,060
and drink for hours.

478
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,760
Do not say anything.

479
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,550
Lady Hae.

480
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,284
I know I have no alcohol
to serve as a penalty,

481
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,150
but shall we make a bet?

482
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,780
It will be very interesting and fun.

483
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,970
Lady Hae,

484
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,190
do you hate me?

485
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes.

486
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,440
I hate,

487
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,210
resent, and curse you.

488
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,650
Gosh.

489
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,980
I do not...

490
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,230
believe you.

491
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,220
General Go.

492
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,060
It is your turn,

493
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,070
Lady Hae.

494
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,810
Hurry.

495
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,870
Have you...

496
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,610
loved me...

497
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,870
even if it was just for a moment?

498
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,870
Mo Yong.

499
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,470
Yes, General Go.

500
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,650
You were me...

501
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,280
in the most...

502
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
complete sense.

503
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
You tried to win over a man...

504
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,090
you could never have.

505
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,183
You tried to reach a destination...

506
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,730
you could never reach.

507
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,430
I saw myself in you.

508
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,680
Mo Yong.

509
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,590
Please...

510
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,460
do not...

511
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,590
stop...

512
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,210
and live on.

513
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,900
I...

514
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,110
loved you.

515
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,450
That is a lie.

516
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,650
General Go.

517
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,760
General Go.

518
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,930
General Go.

519
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,223
That is Goguryeo's trumpet of victory.

520
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,270
The King won the battle.

521
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,184
His Majesty came running
to us with reinforcements...

522
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,457
to push out the soldiers of Silla.

523
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,650
Ga Jin.

524
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,210
You did it.

525
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,400
You delayed the Silla army.

526
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,234
Otherwise, they would have
taken over the fortress at daybreak...

527
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,840
even before the reinforcements arrived.

528
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,877
What about Master Go and Lady Hae?

529
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,214
That is all the more reason
we need to live happily.

530
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,320
Because they...

531
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,827
gave up their lives for you.

532
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,860
Happiness...

533
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,850
Do I deserve to be happy?

534
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,940
Of course. You promised me.

535
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,510
You just need to put down everything...

536
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,380
and leave with me.

537
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,570
I have been thinking too.

538
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,124
And I think we need more than five kids.

539
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,980
What?

540
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,680
Let us have seven kids.

541
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,596
The eldest, the middle,
and the youngest will be girls.

542
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,504
And we will have four sons in between.

543
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,190
Gosh, I was only kidding.

544
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,470
Dal!

545
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,480
Dal! Dal...

546
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,610
No!

547
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,040
Dal, no! Dal! Dal!

548
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,640
Dal. Dal...

549
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:24,780
I...

550
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,090
am okay.

551
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,830
Dal, hang in there.

552
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,600
But...

553
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,910
I cannot see you.

554
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,210
Ga Jin.

555
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,670
I can hear your voice,

556
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,800
but I cannot see your face.

557
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,130
I cannot see you.

558
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,334
You are here, right?

559
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,473
I am right here. I am here, Dal.

560
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,620
Everything is over now.

561
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,343
Our lives will just begin.

562
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,710
You promised to be with me.

563
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,520
Stay with me.

564
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,220
You are my woman.

565
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,670
You are my love.

566
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,650
I love you.

567
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,760
Dal.

568
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,780
Dal, I love you too.

569
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,860
Dal... I love you too.

570
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,050
Dal, open your eyes.

571
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,460
Open your eyes, Dal.

572
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,910
No...

573
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,010
No! Dal!

574
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,300
Dal! Dal! No...

575
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,790
No! Dal!

576
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Why is this not moving at all?

577
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,850
My gosh!

578
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,430
General On!

579
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,857
You need to get going now!
General!

580
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,500
General!
General!

581
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,940
General!
General!

582
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,880
General!
General!

583
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,550
Princess!

584
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,500
Dal must not want to leave.

585
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,110
General!

586
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,927
Why are you being like this?

587
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,107
You need to go now, General.

588
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,810
You were born in the lands of Goguryeo.

589
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,394
Now you need to leave
to the skies of Goguryeo.

590
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,880
Our fates have already been decided,

591
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,723
so do not linger and move on.

592
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,923
I will send you off, General.

593
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,903
Why are you not listening to me?

594
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,506
Did you not say you
will go if I tell you to go...

595
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,707
and stay if I tell you to stay?

596
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,817
If you are worried about me,

597
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,253
you need not worry at all.

598
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,860
We may be apart...

599
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,480
by death,

600
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,830
but my heart...

601
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,750
lies with you, General.

602
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:03,700
So...

603
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,800
you can leave in peace.

604
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,490
Make way for General On!

605
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,590
General!
General!

606
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,400
General...

607
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,290
General!
General...

608
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,530
General...
General!

609
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,240
General...

610
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,048
When you are done mourning
for his death after many years,

611
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,740
you can always return to the palace.

612
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,500
I am sorry.

613
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:53,550
I doubted...

614
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,850
and resented you.

615
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,393
I was not a good brother to you.

616
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,150
I wish...

617
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,174
you will become a King that
can take good care of your people.

618
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,570
I trust you as your sister.

619
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,564
I wanted to have this with you...

620
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,930
before you leave.

621
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,550
Is that okay?

622
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,700
It is sweet. It is good.

623
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,440
Yes, Pyeonggang.

624
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,463
It is delicious. Come try it.

625
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,803
Come have a look.
Of course it is good.

626
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,340
You can try it.

627
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,140
Here you go.

628
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,597
You can go and take care of the rest.

629
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,594
I borrowed some money from my
close acquaintance from Baekje...

630
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,000
to buy a house and start a business.

631
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,810
So you have become one of their people?

632
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,540
You are the one who accomplished
the unification of three empires.

633
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,494
I see that you are leaving
the palace for good.

634
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,210
What about General Go?

635
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,027
I buried him at a sunny gravesite.

636
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,300
I will not be the one to
be at a loss anymore.

637
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,937
I am sure you will manage well.

638
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,507
I know that you will.
Of course.

639
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,860
Since we are friends.

640
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,210
Deer... Where are we going?

641
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,560
Do not worry.

642
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,650
I am not going to kill you.

643
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,180
I found it!

644
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,120
Why are the leaves so...

645
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,864
It is a bellflower root.

646
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,003
But I am sure I saw five leaves.

647
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,500
Who are you?

648
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,100
Who are you...

649
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,813
to be standing in my front yard?

650
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,370
Oh, I see.

651
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,713
Are you here to see the monk?

652
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,050
You are here, Princess.

653
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,520
Wol Gwang.

654
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,750
That man...

655
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,540
He is going to get some firewood.

656
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:20,258
Why do we not have a chat
while waiting for him to return?

657
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,570
Before he left the house,

658
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,440
he asked me a big favor.

659
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,290
I have a request.

660
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,134
You want me to find out what
situation the Princess is in.

661
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,734
I will not do it. It is
too much of a bother.

662
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,940
That is not it.

663
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,973
It is a different request.

664
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,114
He wanted to learn
how to feigning death...

665
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,920
to make his body seem dead.

666
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,590
So when his life was at stake,

667
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,440
he used that method...

668
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,730
to feign death.

669
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,483
But it is a dangerous method.

670
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,954
It is stopping your body
and spirit from living,

671
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,416
so it could go wrong if you
are not experienced enough.

672
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,250
What is this?

673
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,940
Are you a fox or a raccoon?

674
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,460
Why are you still here?

675
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,127
What are you doing? Go away.

676
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,450
I know you.

677
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:26,350
I know you.

678
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,490
How would you know me?

679
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,830
Follow me.

680
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,953
Why are you doing this to me?

681
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,740
Let us go.

682
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:26,803
Your parents gave in to their cruel fate,

683
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,740
but you two overcame it
with unwavering dedication.

684
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,134
I wish you will be
forgotten by the world...

685
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,407
and live in peace for a long time.

686
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,263
I cannot even remember my own name.

687
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,837
And I do not know where I am from.

688
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,574
But that weird monk keeps telling
me that my memories will come back.

689
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,260
I am not sure either.

690
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,683
My mind is all jumbled up.

691
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,130
The monk is right.

692
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,497
You will get them back eventually.

693
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,650
Then...

694
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,670
do you know my name?

695
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,180
Look over there.

696
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,390
Over there.

697
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,420
It is just a moon.

698
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,277
That is right. It is a moon.

699
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,400
Think carefully.

700
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:06,420
On Dal?

701
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:10,930
That is right!

702
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,690
That is my name?

703
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,430
That is right, Dal!

704
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,980
And this scent...

705
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,070
I think I remember it.

706
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:41,037
There are so many
things I need to tell you.

707
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,990
I will need...

708
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,224
more than a few days
to finish the whole story.

709
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,980
Then why do you not tell me...

710
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,790
who you are first?

711
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,340
Do you...

712
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,100
remember me now?

713
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,346
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES.
