1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,284
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,604
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,460
Is this...

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,640
Gochuga's will?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,880
What does it matter?

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,943
It is for the Gyeru Tribe.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,270
I, Yang Chaek,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,174
will gladly disobey the King's order!

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,860
If you pull this off,

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,217
I will place you on the throne.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,540
My Goguryeo...

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,654
will become a great nation
that has never existed before.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,193
I must live a healthy and long life...

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,180
to see your Goguryeo.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,734
Your Majesty, Governor
Yang of Hwangju Fortress...

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,007
raised a revolt with his soldiers.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,220
I will go, Your Majesty.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,348
The King's son-in-law is leading
the troop to Hwangju Fortress.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,960
EPISODE 16

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,600
Commander.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,070
Yes?

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,523
This mission is of the utmost importance.

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,510
We must go.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
What are you doing?

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,547
Once we are done at Hwangju Fortress,

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,890
kill Go Sang Cheol quietly.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,260
Why would you... Why...

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,348
"A tongue that lost control
is the root of all evil."

29
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,783
That is General Go's message.

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,834
What do you mean Commander Go is dead?

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,707
I apologize. It is my fault.

32
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,014
I realized the Princess had bribed him...

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,700
and was looking into it.

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,070
- He was bribed? - Yes.

35
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,353
He would not do such a thing.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,784
Did you corner him with just a suspicion?

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,124
I meant to question him on our return.

38
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,054
He caught on and tried to run away.

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,860
He even fought our own men.

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,310
I apologize, Father.

41
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,514
If the Princess bribed
Commander Go as well,

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,253
that will affect our plan.

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Rest assured.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,160
I checked on the King and the Princess,

45
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,630
and fortunately, nothing got out.

46
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,730
One wrong step and we
will fall from a steep cliff.

47
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,864
There cannot be a single mistake.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,550
I will remember that.

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,374
I took care of Commander
Go to avoid the worst.

50
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,580
But for a while, we must lie low.

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,540
For our mission and...

52
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,850
to keep you safe,

53
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,230
I must hold back even if I miss you.

54
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,430
If one prospers, the other will too,

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,500
and if crushed, we
will be buried together.

56
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,437
That is our future, General Go.

57
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,030
If it is by your side,

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,236
I would not even mind if it
is in a hole in the ground.

59
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,393
This came from Jangbaek herb store.

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,920
Nanny.

61
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,120
Yes?

62
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,070
Do not be so uneasy.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
This is Magnolia Hall.

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,473
It is where you raised me.

65
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,990
I will...

66
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,770
do as you say.

67
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,330
I know you do not trust me,

68
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,596
but for one last time, I
will show you my loyalty.

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
I have located Du Jung Seo.

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
Princess, I will come in.

71
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,450
Do you have news from Hwangju Fortress?

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,300
It is not about that.

73
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,394
I got a report from a soldier
who is watching the Gyeru Tribe.

74
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,556
Commander Go Sang Cheol
was brought back lifeless.

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
Go Sang Cheol is dead?

76
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,664
He left a few days ago on urgent business.

77
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,137
His destination was Hwangju Fortress.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
I apologize for the past.

79
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
My lord's command comes first.

80
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,024
All her loyal subjects left for battle.

81
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,754
The Princess will come alone.

82
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,224
I will cut her down as soon as she does.

83
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,590
You will do what?

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,504
You will lose your lives before
you can even draw your swords.

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Lie in wait,

86
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,408
then attack at once when I
spray the sleeping powder.

87
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
You have only one opportunity.

88
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,340
Lady Sa.

89
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,780
Lady Sa!

90
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,420
What did you dream of...

91
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,150
that you moaned so much?

92
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,770
It was nothing.

93
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,970
Go back to sleep.

94
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,240
Go to sleep.

95
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
What is wrong with you?

96
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,730
I will get some water.

97
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,470
Oh, dear.

98
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,710
Lady Sa.

99
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,230
Lady Sa. Drink this.

100
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,930
Do you feel better?

101
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,540
Show yourself.

102
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,324
Do you think she caught on?

103
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,197
The Princess is not
destined to die tonight.

104
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,820
You can leave.

105
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,260
General.

106
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,790
The Princess is here.

107
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,197
I know Go Won Pyo is behind this revolt.

108
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,810
Or was it Go Geon?

109
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,373
I know already, so answer me.

110
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
The Gyeru Tribe was behind it.

111
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,430
Confess.

112
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,984
We will reduce the
sentence as best we can.

113
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,723
Do you call a beheading...

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,554
instead of a quartering
a reduced sentence?

115
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
I will die anyway.

116
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,310
My remaining family...

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,524
has a better chance of survival
with Gochuga than the King.

118
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,050
- You fool. - Stop.

119
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,764
I will sort this out.

120
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,637
Return to Pyeongyang Castle.

121
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,004
Sort what out?

122
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,677
Bring the governor's family immediately.

123
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,674
I will see how many lives
it takes to make you talk.

124
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,310
Dal. Were you hurt?

126
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,997
You mean to just scare him, right?

127
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,650
You said that...

128
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,850
to make him talk, right?

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,490
No.

130
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
If he refuses to speak,

131
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,860
I might draw blood.

132
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,280
How can you do that?

133
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,640
Do not speak so innocently.

134
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,514
Go Won Pyo and his son
are prancing about like mad.

135
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,528
They could bring down
the whole royal household.

136
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,984
Whatever it takes, I must
prove their wrongdoing.

137
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,857
They are a traitor's family.

138
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,254
Even if they are lucky
to avoid a beheading,

139
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,940
they will become slaves.

140
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,294
You can stop that, as the princess.

141
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,100
I cannot do that because
I am the princess.

142
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,533
The laws are set in stone,

143
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,904
and what is right and wrong is clear.

144
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,590
How can I let them off?

145
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,944
I do not know about laws,

146
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,214
but I want to save the
innocent family members.

147
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Making the governor confess...

148
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,747
and punishing Go Won Pyo and his son.

149
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,787
That is our only option right now.

150
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,733
I fought the traitors like crazy...

151
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,870
and was reminded of my childhood.

152
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,410
The Gyeru Tribe that slaughtered my tribe.

153
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,710
Go Won Pyo's men.

154
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,310
But...

155
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,823
last night, I was Go Won Pyo.

156
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,706
I slashed, stabbed, and
cut down people to no end.

157
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,970
Do not do that.

158
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,973
I will do all the killing.

159
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,894
You keep your distance.
A princess can do that.

160
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,530
Before I was a princess,

161
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,520
I was a killer.

162
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,090
I went to unfamiliar places...

163
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,530
and killed people I did not know.

164
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,840
When I got home,

165
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,163
I had bad dreams every night.

166
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,500
Those dreadful memories are in here.

167
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,420
They plague me even now.

168
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,313
All this was brought on...

169
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,400
by Go Won Pyo.

170
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,330
The lives you took here,

171
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,310
and you and me too.

172
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,653
We are like this because of his greed.

173
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,440
So what?

174
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,024
You have no choice yet again?

175
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,150
That is right.

176
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,600
If it is to take down Go Won Pyo,

177
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,720
I will become like him.

178
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,000
My wife,

179
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,500
my woman...

180
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,693
wants to become evil, like Go Won Pyo.

181
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,620
I cannot let that happen.

182
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,890
Dal.

183
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,000
Dal!

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,600
- General! - General!

185
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
- General! - General!

186
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,410
- General! - General!

187
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,110
- General! - General!

188
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,150
General!

189
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
- General! - General! No!

190
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,150
- General! - General!

191
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,190
- General! - General!

192
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,630
Giddy-up!

193
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,870
A revolt?

194
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,470
Juam Fortress rose up?

195
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,696
Muwon Fortress nearby
is also acting suspiciously.

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,227
I guess Yang Chaek is not...

197
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,274
the only governor who
participated in the plot.

198
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,180
Your Majesty.

199
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,500
A signal fire was lit at
Jangryeong Fortress.

200
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
What? Jangryeong Fortress too?

201
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,104
Hwangju Fortress was suppressed...

202
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,643
- and Yang Chaek... - He lit the fire.

203
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,940
He did his duty.

204
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,384
I did not expect the Princess
would send On Dal to suppress them.

205
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,154
If things all went to plan,

206
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,360
it would be an ordinary
revolt and not a grand one.

207
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,100
By now, Juam, Muwon,

208
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,270
and Jangryeong Fortress too...

209
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,290
will have risen up.

210
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,403
Now, it is all about time.

211
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,443
I will arm our men in secret.

212
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,543
The Sono and Gwanno Tribes will join you.

213
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,544
Nothing must go wrong.

214
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,417
Yes, Father. I was
waiting for your command.

215
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,950
Not yet?

216
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,810
It is taking a while.

217
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,850
Ga Jin would be angry.

218
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,534
Why did he kill the
governor without permission?

219
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,220
Dal messed up this time.

220
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
Dal is in charge.

221
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,317
Is he higher than the Princess?

222
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,244
Who do you think got him the title?

223
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,814
Did Dal join the fight to get promoted?

224
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,620
He fought against
his will for his country.

225
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,314
He volunteered because
he is the only person...

226
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
the Princess can trust.

227
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,770
Good for you.

228
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
What is wrong with her lately?

229
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,400
The King sent me here
with full military authority.

230
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,707
I am not here as the
Princess and your wife.

231
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
I am here in the King's place.

232
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,273
Poachers use something called...

233
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,820
a toothed noose.

234
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,250
Pins are set into a rope like teeth.

235
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,787
Deer cannot break free
once they are caught.

236
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,970
The more they struggle,

237
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,860
the deeper the pins dig in.

238
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,830
If you find a deer caught
in one, you must kill it.

239
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,310
Even if you cut it loose,

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,634
it can only limp until it
becomes a wolf or wildcat's prey.

241
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Yang Chaek is not a deer.

242
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,674
He is a traitor who was
bought by Go Won Pyo.

243
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,530
And you...

244
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,947
disobeyed the King to kill him.

245
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,174
Just so you do not have to kill...

246
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,780
You became my sword?

247
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,630
You say it is for me,

248
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,784
but you go against me in public?

249
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,523
I did not do it with glee.

250
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,620
I feel disgusted.

251
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,327
I can still smell the blood.

252
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,440
Face reality!

253
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,894
Do you even know how
precarious Pyeongyang Castle is?

254
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,767
Stop talking about politics!

255
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,450
This is between us two.

256
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,030
What shall I do?

257
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,700
Tell me.

258
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
What must I do to appease you?

259
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,230
Please tell me, Ga Jin.

260
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,510
Dal.

261
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,184
You cannot do anything like this.

262
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,870
Return to the capital.

263
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,940
Leave things here to me.

264
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,740
We have a messenger
from Pyeongyang Castle.

265
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,110
Juam and Muwon Fortresses too?

266
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,144
Yes. He commanded you
to quell those revolts too.

267
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,950
Regroup and arm the men. We leave tonight.

268
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,944
Before the traitors can join forces.

269
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,384
We must crush them separately.

270
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,190
Right. We will be prepared.

271
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,310
Come along.

272
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,410
What about General On?

273
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,694
He will return to the capital.

274
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,550
I agree.

275
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,430
He needs to rest.

276
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,400
He is very tired.

277
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,473
I will continue to lead our troops.

278
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,674
You hurry back to Pyeongyang Castle.

279
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,444
We are already finished discussing that.

280
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,970
I know I was wrong.

281
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,030
I am sorry.

282
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,964
I messed everything up
by killing the governor.

283
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,827
So you should hurry back to the capital.

284
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,250
We do not know what Go Won
Pyo and his son may be up to.

285
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,200
And you are the only
person who can stop them.

286
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,570
I am not asking you as your husband.

287
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,537
It is a suggestion I make...

288
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,468
as a general of Goguryeo
to protect the royal family.

289
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,530
It is not about us...

290
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,060
but the entire empire.

291
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,350
I, General Go Geon, am ready
to receive a royal command.

292
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,830
You may stand up.

293
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,264
Since the invasion of the Northern Zhou,

294
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,534
it has become even more
important to protect the borders.

295
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,390
Therefore,

296
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,612
I would like to appoint
you to an important post.

297
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,344
Are you sending me to the border?

298
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,950
A group of rebels...

299
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,000
is disturbing the empire.

300
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,940
In situations like this,

301
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,352
it becomes crucial to prepare
against foreign enemies.

302
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,550
Who will be...

303
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,760
in charge of guarding the palace?

304
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
Princess Pyeonggang at your service.

305
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,714
I am honored to be appointed
the Head of Bodyguards.

306
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,112
Head Of Bodyguards: COMMANDER
OF THE KING'S BODYGUARDS

307
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,410
Welcome.

308
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,527
Put your status as a
princess aside for now.

309
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,403
As the Head of Bodyguards,

310
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,330
keep the palace and the royal family safe.

311
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,773
As you wish, Your Majesty.

312
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,170
What are you afraid of?

313
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,563
I am not afraid. I am surprised.

314
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,610
Throughout the empire,

315
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,394
there is no place that Go Won
Pyo's evil influence has not reached.

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,064
General On Dal will successfully
suppress the rebellion.

317
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,270
Do not worry, Your Majesty. Also,

318
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,904
I will keep the palace under close guard.

319
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,144
Once the bodyguards are reorganized,

320
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,114
the level of surveillance on the
Gyeru Tribe will be increased.

321
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,453
Surveillance: KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH

322
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
I need rest.

323
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,684
Is there anything else that
you would like me to do?

324
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,370
No. You may leave now.

325
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,130
Is anyone there?

327
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,360
Your Majesty.

328
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,770
Look who it is.

329
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,280
What is that?

330
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,800
General Go.

331
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,584
Some say that a second
feels like three years.

332
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,523
But for me, it felt like ten.

333
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,040
I missed you.

334
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,150
You need not tell me...

335
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,770
what I already know.

336
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,590
Head Eunuch told me that...

337
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,097
the King asked for medicine.

338
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,850
Yes.

339
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,580
He kept away for a while,

340
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,073
but he suddenly asked for it today.

341
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,237
He must be terribly anxious.

342
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,690
Of course.

343
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,104
The royal family is in dire danger.

344
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,174
I prepared the medicine
much stronger than usual.

345
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,860
For the next few days,

346
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,414
he will not be able to think straight.

347
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,284
I heard that you are being
sent to a fortress up north.

348
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,250
Before that,

349
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,897
I will put my plan into action.

350
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,504
As the Head of Bodyguards,
the Princess will fight back.

351
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,410
But with On Dal away
and the King intoxicated,

352
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,213
she will not be able to do much.

353
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,700
Still,

354
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,413
never let your guard down.

355
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,370
In a few days,

356
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,823
Goguryeo will see a new king.

357
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,067
He will rise up in revolt soon.

358
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,030
You cannot hide a nail in a sack.

359
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,770
When he feels that he
cannot wait any longer,

360
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,664
he will take action
without waiting for a cause.

361
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,104
The Gyeru Tribe's private
armies alone are extremely strong.

362
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,118
With the Gwanno Tribe
and the Sono Tribe's help,

363
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,043
they will be hard to beat.

364
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,776
Uncle, have you sent a
message to the Jeollo Tribe yet?

365
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,670
I have.

366
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,623
But they are too far away.

367
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,554
Even if they rush here as
soon as they get the message,

368
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
it will take at least 10 days.

369
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,520
Ten days.

370
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,033
Until the Jeollo Tribe's armies arrive...

371
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,904
and General On comes back
after suppressing the rebellion,

372
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,704
we will have to stall for time.

373
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,910
Do you think the rebellion
will be suppressed soon?

374
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,274
We have no choice but to believe so.

375
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,080
We must trust General On...

376
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,240
and wait.

377
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,070
- Charge! - Charge!

378
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,610
Get them!

379
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,510
Get them!

380
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,310
Lady Sa.

381
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,810
Lady Sa.

382
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,863
Lady Sa! You are coughing up blood.

383
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,137
Stop making a fuss. Bring me some water.

384
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,574
Should I go down to Ghost Valley
and get some medicinal herbs?

385
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,260
I do not need medicine.

386
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
- Weol. - Yes?

387
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,353
As soon as you wake up tomorrow,

388
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,040
pack up.

389
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,590
"Pack"? Where are we going?

390
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,048
If you know where we are
going, you will not come with me?

391
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
I will be okay.

392
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,024
Vicious rumors have reached
even the people at remote temples.

393
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,290
They were worried that
our empire might be divided.

394
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,490
Do not worry about the imperial palace.

395
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,040
Go back to the temple.

396
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,780
How could I not worry?

397
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,894
If there is a bloodbath at the palace,

398
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
no one will protect my son.

399
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,780
Please promise me...

400
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,266
that you will do whatever it
takes to keep my son safe.

401
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,753
Before you give me your word,

402
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,090
I will not return.

403
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,100
When you were kicked out of the palace,

404
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,542
do you know why I did
not challenge the Princess?

405
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,610
It is because the King's
days are numbered.

406
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,987
When the new world has come,

407
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,326
you can take your time to
come back to the palace.

408
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,160
Then, my son will be safe. Right?

409
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,420
Are you not ill anymore?

410
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,686
Our empire is in confusion.
I had to do something.

411
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,147
Go Won Pyo will not
let Prince Geon Mu live.

412
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,654
That will be the case for Go Geon as well.

413
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,384
They must know that the
Prince will be a problem later.

414
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,057
Why would they show mercy on the Prince?

415
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,830
I do not follow you.

416
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,774
They are stepbrothers,
but they are very close.

417
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,182
Crown Prince Won can pass
down the crown to Prince Geon Mu.

418
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,677
If you want to save the Prince... No.

419
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,747
If you want to see him
ascend to the throne,

420
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,730
choose the winning side.

421
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,550
The winning side?

422
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,410
Then,

423
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,864
are you saying the Gyeru
Tribe is fighting a losing battle?

424
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,470
Yes. They will lose.

425
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,440
Lord Hae of the Sono Tribe
has already sided with our family.

426
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,160
I am sure you know...

427
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,814
he is the best person to
calculate gains and losses.

428
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,317
Your petty trick will not work on me.

429
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,057
My trick may be petty or grand.

430
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,740
Think carefully about it.

431
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,990
General On.

432
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,030
Dal.

433
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,810
It is dead.

434
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,010
What?

435
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,100
I did not kill it, but this guy just...

436
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
No. Did I kill it?

437
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,020
Pung Gae. Did I kill it?

438
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,017
What are you talking
about? No, you did not.

439
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,978
It is chilly at night. I am
afraid you might catch a cold.

440
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,420
Nanny.

441
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,620
I cannot see the moon.

442
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
The moon is always in the sky.

443
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,683
It is just hiding behind the cloud.

444
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,470
Will it come back out?

445
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,820
It will, right?

446
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,430
A silver mine?

447
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,714
Let me get this straight. You
have found a silver mine...

448
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,387
from the territory you have gotten back?

449
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,240
Yes, that is right.

450
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,957
Given how widely it spreads,

451
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,570
the scale of the mine...

452
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,797
What did the Princess say about that?

453
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,464
Upon the discovery of silver
mines, it is required by law...

454
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,937
that they are returned to the empire.

455
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,990
I have not told her yet.

456
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,704
Our empire is on the edge of a precipice.

457
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,214
I cannot tell who will come
out as victors of this fight.

458
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,874
A SITUATION THAT COULD
BRING A DISASTER AT ANY MINUTE

459
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,920
To be honest,

460
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,984
keeping our tribe
safe is our first priority.

461
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,030
That is true.

462
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,910
That is why...

463
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,957
I asked to meet you quietly.

464
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,492
You are the most experienced
in matters such as these.

465
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,764
If you want to dig silver out of the mine,

466
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,464
you must think about mining,
transportation, and refinery.

467
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,337
It will cost a fortune
to take care of this.

468
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,630
That is why...

469
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,943
What do you think about...

470
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,928
keeping this between us and
proceeding with this business?

471
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,840
Lord Hae!

472
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,663
You are here too, Lord Sa.

473
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,294
Excuse me. I have things to take care of.

474
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,420
- Bye. - Wait.

475
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,950
Goodness.

476
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,334
It looks like you and Lord
Sa of the Sunno Tribe were...

477
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,674
having an important conversation
this early in the morning.

478
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,072
Important? No. We were
just talking about the weather.

479
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,920
Is this something...

480
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,827
Gochuga and I should not be aware of?

481
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,493
How could you ask me something like that?

482
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,324
I am not some subordinate
of the Gyeru Tribe.

483
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,064
Must I tell him everything when
I am exchanging pleasantries?

484
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,070
I have my pride! Unbelievable.

485
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,760
"Pride"?

486
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,790
My Queen!

487
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,850
What did you find out, Father?

488
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
You were right.

489
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,687
Seeing how flustered Lord Hae was,

490
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,357
I am sure he is siding with the King.

491
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,680
We are in a predicament.

492
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,070
If we support the Gyeru Tribe,

493
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,704
our entire family might
face a deadly disaster.

494
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,404
A DISASTER THAT COULD
WIPE OUT AN ENTIRE FAMILY

495
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,850
What should we do?

496
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,158
You said the uprising
will happen soon, correct?

497
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,516
Whether it is the royal
family or the Gyeru Tribe,

498
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,810
we must choose one.

499
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,057
I hear the King wanted to see you.

500
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,894
I bet he is not in his right mind
as he must be high on drugs.

501
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,160
Why did he want to see you?

502
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,404
I guess he wants to die
faster than we thought.

503
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,043
We will carry it out tonight.

504
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,122
I will enter the palace
as a subject in daylight,

505
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,283
but I will become its owner by nightfall.

506
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,350
Yes, Father.

507
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,972
Gochuga of the Gyeru
Tribe is here, Your Majesty.

508
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Really? Is that what happened?

509
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,930
Oh, look. It is Gochuga.

510
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,844
Did you call for him?

511
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,114
Did you want to show
him the state I am in?

512
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,554
You told him to come
see you, Your Majesty.

513
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,410
I did?

514
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,270
That is strange.

515
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,274
Anyway, since you are
here, please take a seat.

516
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,503
Why did I tell Gochuga to come see me?

517
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,840
There must be a reason I called him.

518
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,604
If it is not something urgent,
you can take your time to tell me.

519
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,774
Why do you not take a rest, Your Majesty?

520
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,300
Oh, I remember now!

521
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,153
There is a rat roaming around the palace,

522
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,520
and I want you to catch it.

523
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,370
I caught the rat who told Gochuga...

524
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,107
that you were looking for some medicine.

525
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,110
You have been living off the money
Gochuga has been paying, right?

526
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,846
I am falsely accused. That
is not true, Your Majesty...

527
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,034
You must go back to your
chambers, Royal Consort Hyeon.

528
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,688
From now, I am going to
punish the traitor for his crimes.

529
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,150
What do you mean?

530
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,624
Are you saying Father is
in custody at the palace?

531
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,830
Yes, General. Head Eunuch
was beheaded on the spot.

532
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,273
General Go, what shall we do?

533
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,680
Inform the Gwanno and
Sono Tribes immediately.

534
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,900
Tell them to be armed...

535
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
and go straight to the palace.

536
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,400
Yes, General!

537
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,550
Mo Yong!

538
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,664
Did the soldiers of our
tribe depart already?

539
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,470
I dispatched them just now.

540
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,290
But it seems Gochuga...

541
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,070
fell into a trap.

542
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,053
It is okay as long as General Go is safe.

543
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,683
He will lead the revolt to success.

544
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,240
Wait.

545
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,894
- Are you from the Sono Tribe?
- Yes, General.

546
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,548
- What about the Gwanno Tribe?
- I have not seen them yet.

547
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,280
- Let us go. - Let us go!

548
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,526
You led armed soldiers
to the palace at this hour.

549
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,194
You could be punished for revolt.

550
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,880
This is not a revolt.

551
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,663
You are being harsh, Your Highness.

552
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,837
How can a son just sit back and watch...

553
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,974
when his father is being
detained within the palace?

554
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,910
He is having a conversation with the King.

555
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,510
He will return home when it is over,

556
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,050
so take your soldiers away.

557
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,640
Since we are here anyway,

558
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,540
we will escort him home.

559
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,910
I told you to go away.

560
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,330
I will wait.

561
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,082
So General Go must be
here with his private army.

562
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,787
He is a filial son, you see.

563
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,250
You will only need to say a word.

564
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,824
If you tell them to give up their arms,

565
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,297
you will be able to spare many lives.

566
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,640
You should...

567
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,070
spare their lives yourself.

568
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,937
Do you covet the throne that much?

569
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,990
Enough to shed blood?

570
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,330
You have been...

571
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,680
on the throne for too long.

572
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,923
If you give up the throne,

573
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,990
the internal strife will subside.

574
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,326
A DISPUTE OR CONFLICT AMONG
THE MEMBERS OF A GROUP

575
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,340
I feel sorry for you.

576
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,480
Whose side...

577
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,607
do you think the Gwanno Tribe will take?

578
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,914
- Are you from the Gwanno Tribe?
- Yes, General.

579
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,184
- I see that you made it. - Yes, General.

580
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,070
Get moving!

581
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,594
Royal Consort Jin is
from the Gwanno Tribe.

582
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,904
Did you think they would stand
against the royal household...

583
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,918
just because they are
afraid of the Gyeru Tribe?

584
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,240
Your Majesty, the
Gwanno Tribe has joined us.

585
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,800
Lord Sa.

586
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,020
The Gyeru Tribe is in terminal decline,

587
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,870
but I guess Gochuga is the
only one who cannot see that.

588
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,470
Go Won Pyo.

589
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,864
Either you and your son will die alone,

590
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,470
or your entire tribe will be massacred.

591
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You should make your decision.

592
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,044
Dismiss your private army
and surrender immediately.

593
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,730
That was Gochuga's order!

594
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
He is lying! Do not be shaken!

595
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,703
- It is over, Master Go. - No, it is not.

596
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,270
Only my father's plan is over.

597
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,270
My plan has not even begun.

598
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,450
Take up arms!

599
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,470
Give up, Master Go.

600
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,084
You will have to kill
me for this to be over.

601
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,770
I do not wish to do that.

602
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,060
Fine. Then I will finish this.

603
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,740
Come at me if you want to die!

604
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,020
I will slice...

605
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,360
even the last piece of your flesh...

606
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,563
and the last piece of your bone.

607
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,814
You should leave with Father.

608
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,020
What do you mean? What about you?

609
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,384
There is someone I need to save.

610
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,324
Are you talking about General Go Geon?

611
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,010
He is as good as dead.

612
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,467
What are you planning to do?

613
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,224
Please leave with him.

614
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,794
I do not even know
where we are fleeing to.

615
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,064
How can I just follow him?

616
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,206
I am only trying to pay
you back for taking me in.

617
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,990
Please trust me.

618
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,030
Hurry!

619
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,630
Mo Yong!

620
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,530
Let us go.

621
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,410
JANGBAEK

622
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,450
Find him!

623
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,837
- Find Hae Ji Weol! - Find him!

624
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,873
- Find Hae Ji Weol! - Look everywhere!

625
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,640
Find Hae Ji Weol!

626
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,230
Find him!

627
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,183
- Keep quiet! - Get me out of here!

628
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,253
- Quiet down! - Get me out of here!

629
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,200
- Shut it! - Let me go!

630
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,597
- Let me go! - Get me out of here!

631
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,450
Let me go!

632
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,050
Quiet down! Be quiet!

633
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,800
Is this...

634
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,320
Is this mess...

635
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,040
what you really wanted?

636
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,350
You should have told us to
fight even if it meant death!

637
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,333
Even if the two of us die,

638
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,907
the Gyeru Tribe has to live on.

639
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,240
Father. You are the Gyeru Tribe itself.

640
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,350
Do you not get it?

641
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,133
I will not fail like you did.

642
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,377
You brought me into this world,

643
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,180
but I will decide...

644
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,100
how I die.

645
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,844
If you do not wish to
die by vomiting blood,

646
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,583
you will have to get an antidote from me.

647
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,640
SILLA, SEORABEOL

648
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,294
The internal disturbance in
Goguryeo is getting more interesting.

649
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,094
When things are chaotic on the inside,

650
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,000
it gives us a good
opportunity to attack them.

651
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,534
This is a golden opportunity
to take back Adan Fortress.

652
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,804
Yes, Your Majesty.

653
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,074
The troops are already waiting
for your command, Your Majesty.

654
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,174
Dispatch the troops to
Adan Fortress immediately...

655
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,114
and drive out the Goguryeo people.

656
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,584
I will convey your order, Your Majesty.

657
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,270
Is he waiting outside?

658
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:43,930
Bring him in!

659
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,220
That is not necessary.

660
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,144
Are you Hae Ji Weol of the
Sono Tribe from Goguryeo?

661
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,147
That is right, Your Majesty.

662
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,160
Welcome to Silla.

663
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,094
I hear you are good at
calculating gains and losses.

664
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,000
You should use your
ability for Silla's gain.

665
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,937
You are too kind, Your Majesty.

666
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,310
I promise...

667
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,684
that you will be able to
come to Silla in glory...

668
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,290
when Goguryeo falls.

669
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,183
I am here to meet your chief.

670
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,954
A breach of prison?

671
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,524
You usually have good
judgment, but you are being foolish.

672
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,330
As I promised with Go Geon,

673
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,803
I only need to kill the King.

674
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,704
It is not my duty to get him
and his father out of prison.

675
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,230
When things change,

676
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,803
the promises can be altered too.

677
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,374
I need killers to bring to the prison.

678
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,344
Do you dare to give me an order?

679
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:48,744
It is not an order. It is a solution.

680
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,758
It is the only solution
that can save your life.

681
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,854
You need to take the antidote in two days.

682
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,710
Otherwise,

683
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,830
you will die...

684
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,194
by bleeding from every
orifice in your body.

685
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,400
I can torture you until
you hand over the antidote.

686
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,467
I would love to see you try.

687
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,303
Let us see if I confess first...

688
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,603
or if you die before that.

689
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,750
Do not do that.

690
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,470
I reek of blood.

691
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,150
Ga Jin.

692
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,450
Am I...

693
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,650
a complete fool?

694
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,980
Who told you that?

695
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,000
I did.

696
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,183
Saying that makes you a complete fool.

697
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,523
It is okay as long as you do not think...

698
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,020
I am a fool.

699
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,060
The water was...

700
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,600
so sweet and refreshing.

701
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,257
The water from the well we dug together.

702
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,337
It was as clear as morning dew.

703
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,620
Do you think it still is?

704
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,300
Of course.

705
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,572
This does not taste like
the water from the well.

706
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,510
Because it is stained with blood.

707
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,770
I am sorry, Dal.

708
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,293
I am sorry for everything.

709
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,320
Do not be sorry.

710
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,580
I will go if you tell me to go...

711
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,653
and stop if you want me to stop.

712
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,593
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

713
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,080
Why did you...

714
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,350
Why?

715
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,524
Why did you betray me?

716
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,364
She said she is completely sick of us.

717
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,864
She is sick of all of
us, including Ga Jin.

718
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,404
I have chosen you as the
next chief of Cheonjubang.

719
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,574
Are you going to betray my kindness?

720
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,974
I know that you are a spy from Silla.

721
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,660
As soon as this is over,

722
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,944
I will behead you and send
your head to the King of Silla.

723
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,384
I hear you killed more than 100 traitors.

724
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,670
How did it feel?

725
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,614
You want to know what
it is like to kill a man?

726
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,284
Have you decided on what to
do with Go Won Pyo and his son?

727
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,194
I have decided to execute them...

728
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,880
first thing tomorrow.

729
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,000
My goodness. My son.

730
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,380
Please allow my son, Dal,

731
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,407
to go back to our village with me.

732
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,484
I do not wish to go
back to the village at all,

733
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,290
so do not be ridiculous.

734
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,604
I am only trying to help you breathe...

735
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,290
because I am your mother.

736
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,280
Son, is that you?

737
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,090
Your Majesty!

738
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,057
I see that you are still alive.
