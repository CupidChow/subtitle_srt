EPISODE 2

4
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:33,226
No need to thank me.

5
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:36,597
Hey.

6
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,567
You cannot just walk off.

7
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:03,417
What are you doing?

8
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:17,697
I know you.

9
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:21,936
I know you.

10
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:25,436
How would you know me?

11
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,376
The killer.

12
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:29,477
What?

13
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:32,046
"The devil who kills."

14
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,617
We never met. Do not talk nonsense.

15
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:40,087
Men are dying and you did not bat
an eyelid. That makes you a killer.

16
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,557
What are you?

17
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,397
I work at the palace.

18
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,367
I visited my family and
got lost on the way back.

19
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,507
That is a relief, then.

20
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,477
If a pretty girl like
you were really a killer,

21
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:06,376
I would have been very sad.

22
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:10,286
If you just walk off, you are a killer.

23
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,156
You are no maid.

24
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:19,156
You should treat them at least.

25
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,897
They will really die if
you leave them like that.

26
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:28,467
These are some precious herbs
I picked from the mountainside.

27
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:31,337
Grind it up and put it on their wounds.

28
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:47,686
You made such a fuss,

29
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,827
I thought you would bury the deer.

30
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:52,327
I meant we should not torment it to death.

31
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:54,166
Hunting is a necessity.

32
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:57,997
It is survival and the way of nature.

33
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:12,147
Oh, dear. I think I am dying.

34
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,487
Stay still.

35
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:24,297
Stay still.

36
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,166
Go.

37
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,807
I said go. Okay. Thank you.

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,446
I almost died. Wait up.

39
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:47,647
Happy now?

40
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,017
Hey.

41
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,057
What are you doing?

42
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,897
You got hurt too.

43
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,136
Here.

44
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,737
From now on, do not hurt others...

45
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:13,946
and look after yourself as well.

46
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:18,147
Your life is precious.

47
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,426
You startled me.

48
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,697
You fool! Where have you been?

49
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,467
I brought your favorite, Mom. Meat.

50
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:50,137
Come here! Come closer!

51
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,887
I smell human blood.

52
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,786
Did you meet someone?

53
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,856
What human blood?

54
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,257
It is deer blood.

55
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,286
I heard it cry out...

56
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,996
and decided to rescue
it from a painful death.

57
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,967
And then I...

58
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,536
You fool. You will be the death of me.

59
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:22,366
But... It is true, Mother.

60
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,217
We could be raided at any time.

61
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,916
We must move.

62
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,856
I did not meet anyone.

63
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,616
Poachers are people too.

64
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,856
What if they were to report us?

65
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:42,986
There are many Goguryeo farmers...

66
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,897
who lost their land and wander.

67
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,327
The first day of the coming month
is your father's death anniversary.

68
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:51,837
I know that.

69
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:55,507
You vowed to not see, hear, or
get involved in worldly matters.

70
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,406
You cannot forget that.

71
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,806
For your father's sake,

72
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:06,887
for the rest of your life,
you must live as a fool.

73
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:09,746
I said I get it.

74
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,036
No, the deer meat. Are
you going to let me starve?

75
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,577
Just wait here.

76
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,676
I will cook it up nicely.

77
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:43,087
I heard you caught some poachers.

78
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,587
Word travels fast.

79
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,687
We rushed over, but we were too late.

80
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:49,856
Did you get them on your own?

81
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,697
You are too curious.

82
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,496
Did you come just to ask me that?

83
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,697
My dad sent me.

84
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,606
We have an empty house.

85
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,536
You and Lady Sa can move to Ghost Valley.

86
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,277
Do not refuse this time.

87
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,217
We all live in hiding in some mountain.

88
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:13,887
This place is just as
good as Ghost Valley.

89
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,947
Both Mother and I feel
more comfortable here.

90
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,087
I knew you would say that.

91
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,356
Hey. Is this all you picked?

92
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:25,496
It is getting harder to find
wild animals and good herbs.

93
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,767
Oh. Pil Gu said that...

94
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,837
Mount Songhak is the place to go.

95
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,467
There are herbs everywhere.

96
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,467
Mount Songhak?

97
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,476
You will not find anything like this.

98
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,476
Come and take a look.

99
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,126
For what reason do they want more taxes?

100
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,187
They are building Jangan Castle.

101
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,526
Every commoner must
hand in a roll of cloth.

102
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:03,327
My goodness. The king is so ruthless.

103
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,197
A roll of cloth?

104
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,937
He might as well ask
for a roll of human skin.

105
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,136
Why will not the spirits take him?

106
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:13,807
These days, he spends
time drinking with women.

107
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,476
He does not even run the country.

108
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:18,417
That works for the nobles
on the Five Tribe council.

109
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,776
Darn my life.

110
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,567
Of all the Goguryeo lords,

111
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,907
now none are loyal to the king.

112
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:46,207
Did you say they are Cheonjubang?

113
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:49,746
Thanks to the migrants, we
got rid of the king's family...

114
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:52,016
without getting blood on our hands.

115
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,846
Are those in the palace
the only ones left?

116
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,356
Preparations for that have already begun.

117
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,687
What do you mean by that?

118
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,327
Are you really going to
attack during the ceremony?

119
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,596
The Daedaero disapproved,

120
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,927
so we planned it ourselves.

121
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:11,067
But... Let us not mention it anymore.

122
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,577
GO WON PYO, GYERU TRIBE'S GOCHUGA

123
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:55,907
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

124
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,846
The King of Goguryeo was
always the suspicious type.

125
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:02,246
It got much worse since his queen died.

126
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,817
The problem is, he has many bedrooms,

127
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,287
and he sleeps in a
different one each night.

128
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,447
We cannot tell where he
will sleep on any given night.

129
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:13,697
His bodyguards are also on high alert.

130
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:16,396
Our only opportunity...

131
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,337
is when he climbs Mount
Songhak's Cheonjedan.

132
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,506
I will contact the head shaman
until right before the ceremony.

133
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:26,376
Disguise as a servant girl
and right after the ceremony,

134
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,677
disguise yourself as a shaman.

135
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:39,256
The place marked there is the shrine.

136
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,596
SHRINE

137
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:03,376
Stop.

138
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:12,957
Where are you going?

139
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:15,827
To Magnolia Hall with the prince.

140
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,957
I have a present for our
sister to offer at the ceremony.

141
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,226
You do not have a sister.

142
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,167
Princess Pyeonggang
is not your true sister.

143
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,697
The late Queen Yeon had an affair,

144
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,307
and she was the dirty result.

145
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,307
So you need not care about a ceremony...

146
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,376
for that dead brat.

147
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:37,776
Let us go.

148
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:54,366
Take this to Magnolia Hall.

149
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,846
MAGNOLIA HALL, PRINCESS
PYEONGGANG'S CHAMBERS

150
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:11,707
Who are you?

151
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,837
I apologize, Madam.

152
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,417
The Crown Prince told
me to bring this here.

153
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,146
Put it on that small table.

154
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,947
Your Highness?

155
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:44,136
Did you see where the
maid who just left went?

156
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:47,197
A maid? What maid?

157
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,236
Did you see anyone?

158
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,207
You must be seeing things.

159
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:00,646
This garden has such beautiful flowers.

160
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,846
How about I move into Magnolia Hall?

161
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:09,287
Please. I was just kidding.

162
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:11,496
Your Highness. Princess.

163
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,996
"Princess"?

164
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:47,996
Is my sister truly dead?

165
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,766
Tomorrow is the ceremony to send her off.

166
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,006
Her farewell ceremony.

167
00:16:55,766 --> 00:17:00,136
Would we ever host such
a ceremony for the living?

168
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,917
The nobles forced me
to sit through the rites.

169
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,357
Tomorrow will be the last one.

170
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:14,986
But no one found her body.

171
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,427
She could be alive.

172
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:32,476
Princess Pyeonggang is dead.

173
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,177
Father. Do not...

174
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,677
mention her again.

175
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:23,947
MOUNT SONGHAK

176
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:43,637
My goodness. Did you drink yet again?

177
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,407
No ceremony is complete without a drink.

178
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:52,246
Let us finish this in a hurry
and return to the palace.

179
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:54,177
We should all get drunk.

180
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:02,556
Go Geon, Lord of Songhak
Fortress greets His Majesty the King.

181
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:04,996
We have not met in a long time.

182
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:08,266
You must be proud of your eldest son.

183
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:11,437
I instructed him to
be on high alert today.

184
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:13,697
Can I trust that you did?

185
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,167
I fear that...

186
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,336
I am only in charge due
to my fortunate birth rite.

187
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:23,546
You should put more trust in
your bodyguards than my soldiers.

188
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:26,076
Are they not the elite
that can take on 100 men?

189
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,647
You even speak in jest.

190
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:34,217
Your son is better than you.

191
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,687
A SHAMAN WILL ATTACK THE KING.

192
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,306
We must cancel the ceremony.

193
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,536
Why?

194
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:34,947
One of the shamans is an impostor.

195
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:37,347
She has to be an assassin.

196
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:40,877
Are you sure of that? Yes.

197
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:43,546
She changed into their costume...

198
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:45,457
and mixed in with the group.

199
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:47,157
Wait.

200
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:48,786
Father.

201
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:52,457
Ruining the ceremony could cause
more trouble than we can handle.

202
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,326
The king is in danger.

203
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,167
That is why you must watch carefully.

204
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:25,796
Speak. Where is Wol Gwang?

205
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:30,026
He... He went to Mount
Geumgang to meditate.

206
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:33,197
He will return in a month's time.

207
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:36,207
Do you mean that Wol Gwang...

208
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,907
is not here?

209
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:05,266
I am sorry.

210
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,806
I am so sorry.

211
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:40,367
Wol Gwang!

212
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,236
Stop.

213
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:46,637
Stop.

214
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:50,677
Stop, stop! I said stop!

215
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:54,217
Stop! Stop! Your Majesty!

216
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,397
You...

217
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,536
You...

218
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,536
How come you...

219
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:04,776
Keep climbing!

220
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,417
Hold on tight!

221
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:43,647
Come on, climb up quick!

222
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:56,566
What on earth happened?

223
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,387
Darn it.

224
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:32,066
Ga Jin failed?

225
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,167
Find her quickly.

226
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:40,506
We must find her before
anyone from Goguryeo does.

227
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,447
Yes, Chief. Yes, Chief.

228
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:21,917
You should recover on your
own if I have done this much.

229
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,286
Please save me.

230
00:29:32,697 --> 00:29:34,556
Save me.

231
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,867
She would not have
taken the mountain pass.

232
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:18,536
Search the forest thoroughly.

233
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:19,867
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

234
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:58,476
Deer...

235
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,616
Where are we going?

236
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:05,476
Do not worry.

237
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:07,846
I am not going to kill you.

238
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:49,226
My goodness.

239
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,797
I told you not to sneak
up on me like that.

240
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,167
What did you catch this time?

241
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,297
Did you catch a deer or an elk?

242
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,866
My goodness...

243
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,676
You brought someone?

244
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,537
It is not just anyone.

245
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:06,947
She is injured.

246
00:32:07,246 --> 00:32:10,047
My gosh. My goodness.

247
00:32:10,317 --> 00:32:11,847
If she got hurt,

248
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,017
you should have taken her to
the village, not bring her here.

249
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,116
Things were chaotic down the mountain.

250
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:18,556
Do not worry.

251
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:20,186
Once she is all better,
I will send her away.

252
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,186
My goodness.

253
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,327
Mother.

254
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,067
Mother.

255
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:37,637
I ran into some soldiers...

256
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,746
while I was outside picking herbs.

257
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:42,547
And she saved me.

258
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,146
Did you get hurt?

259
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,216
No, I am fine.

260
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:55,556
She tried to save my life.

261
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:59,366
How could I just leave her there?

262
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:01,097
She got hit by an arrow because of me.

263
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,137
Let her stay for a few days.

264
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,936
There is nothing I can
do anyway. I am blind.

265
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:08,706
Mother.

266
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:10,836
Okay, do whatever you want.

267
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:14,047
Now that we have one more person here,

268
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:15,746
your old mother will stay up all night...

269
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,947
to sew her clothes and cook for her.

270
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,847
Goodness, my entire body aches.

271
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,646
Goodness, my body.

272
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,086
And once...

273
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:25,116
the soldiers come to find her here,

274
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:27,486
I will accept my fate and die.

275
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,556
Goodness, my darn life.

276
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:32,097
I have such an unfortunate life.

277
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:46,947
Mother...

278
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,417
Father...

279
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,026
Mother...

280
00:34:18,877 --> 00:34:22,077
Fight properly!

281
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:24,177
Goodness.

282
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,086
You need to learn how to fight...

283
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:29,046
in order to protect me!

284
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:53,146
You witch!

285
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:58,716
Who do you think you are?

286
00:34:58,716 --> 00:35:02,757
How dare you look at me that way!

287
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:05,117
Get lost! Go!

288
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,987
Get away! Get lost!

289
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:18,396
The time has come.

290
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:21,767
She is here to take me away.

291
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,976
She is here to take me with her.

292
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:33,617
Fine. Take me with you.

293
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:38,387
Take me with you, Pyeonggang.

294
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:42,257
Goodness, what are we going to do?

295
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:45,726
He will not be able to
go to war in that state.

296
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:50,796
Should I take care of him tonight?

297
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,807
Go ahead.

298
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:00,577
If you get lucky and get
pregnant with a prince,

299
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:02,546
it will be even better.

300
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,546
That is not what I meant.

301
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,437
What a way to wake up.

302
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,307
Deer?

303
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:08,976
From now on, do not hurt others...

304
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:11,216
and look after yourself as well.

305
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,187
Your life is precious.

306
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,586
What am I doing here?

307
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:21,327
You begged me to save you.

308
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,497
I did? Yes, you did.

309
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:26,827
"Please save me." That is what you said.

310
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:28,997
I said that?

311
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,536
Yes. My gosh.

312
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,906
Are you not eating the
porridge because you want rice?

313
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,336
I am not hungry.

314
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:57,327
Mother, stop staring at her.
She will not be able to eat.

315
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,296
I am not staring. I cannot
see anything anyway.

316
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:04,937
What is your name?

317
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,406
Yeom Ga Jin.

318
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:09,976
My goodness, what a pretty name.

319
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,536
What do you do for a living?

320
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:15,307
She is a maid.

321
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:18,077
She works at the palace.

322
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:19,716
I did not ask you.

323
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:24,916
Does that mean you work for the king?

324
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:27,127
Yes. I see.

325
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:29,326
That explains your gentle voice...

326
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,257
and pretty face.

327
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,497
You cannot even see her.

328
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:34,467
I do not need to see to know.

329
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:37,367
By the way,

330
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:41,337
how did you get to know Dal?

331
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,436
Oh, that is my name.

332
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:46,707
On Dal.

333
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,247
You did not even tell her your name?

334
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:50,816
We had no time for that.

335
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:53,247
Then...

336
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:55,546
Ga Jin...

337
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:56,987
Thank you for the food.

338
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:59,257
You are done already? You should eat more.

339
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:00,526
Eat a bit more.

340
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,887
I need to go to the bathroom.

341
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:03,696
Sure.

342
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,737
She barely even ate anything.

343
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:14,867
You were angry at me
for bringing her home.

344
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:16,676
Why are you asking her so many questions?

345
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:19,347
I can tell by touching her hands
that she is not a kitchen maid.

346
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:21,076
She is a maid who works at the palace.

347
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:23,316
But her hands are too rough to be a maid.

348
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,946
I wonder what she does.

349
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,867
Get over here!

350
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,296
Stop!

351
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,936
Come here! Come here!

352
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,176
You...

353
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:56,877
You are dead.

354
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,887
I caught you!

355
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:07,727
Mother, you were supposed
to catch the chicken, not her.

356
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:10,627
If she saw me, she should have avoided me.

357
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,467
I am the one who is blind.

358
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:18,296
My goodness. My gosh.

359
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:21,566
Mother, now that you are lying here,

360
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:23,007
take a look at the sky.

361
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:25,176
The sky is beautiful.

362
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:26,747
It is so blue.

363
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:28,607
You are right.

364
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,377
It is very blue.

365
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,887
How nice.

366
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,387
Get changed.

367
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:11,286
My mother stayed up all
night sewing that for you.

368
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:13,926
It may not be fancy, but it will do.

369
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:16,087
What did you just say?

370
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:18,826
I made that even though I am
blind. You should give me more credit.

371
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:19,946
What is the matter with you?

372
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:48,627
Just get out here already.

373
00:41:50,026 --> 00:41:51,796
Ga Jin! Be quiet.

374
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:58,837
Ga Jin, you are alive.

375
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:01,666
We searched all over Mount
Songhak, Mount Samjeong,

376
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:03,737
and Mount Daeseong to find you.

377
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:06,137
What about the chief?

378
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:08,646
He told us to find you and bring you back.

379
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:10,146
What happened?

380
00:42:10,977 --> 00:42:12,217
I do not know.

381
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:16,816
Why did I do that?

382
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,257
Is that supposed to be
a question or an answer?

383
00:42:40,076 --> 00:42:43,446
Mother, why are you
going through her stuff?

384
00:42:43,946 --> 00:42:45,617
You told me she is a maid on the run.

385
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:48,847
Why does a maid have all these weapons?

386
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,686
Well, let me explain.

387
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:51,686
Is she a killer?

388
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:54,656
Is she the reason why
there were soldiers last night?

389
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:56,727
Answer me.

390
00:42:58,296 --> 00:42:59,296
Yes.

391
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:01,497
I want her gone right now.

392
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:03,997
Mother, she has not even recovered yet.

393
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:05,066
And then what?

394
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:07,837
Do you think we will be safe here?

395
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,406
Do you think a killer will let us live...

396
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:11,977
even after having seen her face?

397
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:15,007
Is anyone home?

398
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:17,646
Weol Yi?

399
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:19,146
Yes.

400
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:23,857
The village ladies told me
to give you some vegetables.

401
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:26,186
You did not have to come
all the way here to do that.

402
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,627
My goodness, that is just how
much we all care about you.

403
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:34,196
By the way, Dal, the traps
you set up are a mess.

404
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:35,926
By any chance,

405
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:38,637
do you think the lady you saved...

406
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:40,436
cut them open and ran away?

407
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:49,406
Dal!

408
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:16,477
By the way, who is the guy who lives here?

409
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:17,977
Why?

410
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:21,207
He set up tons of traps.

411
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:25,017
We were able to avoid
getting caught thanks to me.

412
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:27,117
If not... Ga Jin!

413
00:44:30,316 --> 00:44:31,316
Wait.

414
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,457
Yeom Ga Jin!

415
00:44:37,957 --> 00:44:39,457
Why are you not killing him?

416
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:40,696
He saw your face.

417
00:44:40,696 --> 00:44:42,926
Then you should kill him That is our rule.

418
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:44,467
Yeom Ga Jin!

419
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,237
His life is precious.

420
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,676
What?

421
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:53,276
What did you just say?

422
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:55,107
She said his life is precious.

423
00:44:55,507 --> 00:44:58,217
So what? You are going to break the rules?

424
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,017
If you let him live, the
chief will punish you.

425
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:04,056
I want you guys to go back.

426
00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:05,796
Do not tell anyone that you found me.

427
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,487
If you cannot kill him,

428
00:45:07,826 --> 00:45:09,227
we will do it for you.

429
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:12,627
If we must kill him, I will do it myself.

430
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,826
Well...

431
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:18,267
There is a way not to kill him.

432
00:45:18,737 --> 00:45:19,737
What is that?

433
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:21,467
Seduce him and get married.

434
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:23,406
Then he will become one of us,

435
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:24,436
so you will not have to kill him.

436
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:27,576
That is how Deuk Jae
got himself a wife last year.

437
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:29,477
Cut the nonsense.

438
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,517
What? Ga Jin does not want to kill him.

439
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,416
Ga Jin, what is it that you want?

440
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:44,257
Yeom Ga Jin!

441
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:00,046
Should I kill him...

442
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:02,306
or seduce him?

443
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:05,646
Yeom Ga Jin!

444
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:28,337
What are you doing in there?

445
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,847
Gosh, I looked everywhere for you.

446
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,416
Here. Hold onto this.

447
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:44,587
Get lost.

448
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:11,177
What are you staring at?

449
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:18,457
Did you catch a cold?

450
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:19,927
Do you have a fever?

451
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:22,056
No, I do not.

452
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:23,556
I think you do.

453
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:30,036
Oh, dear. Your wound might get infected.

454
00:47:30,136 --> 00:47:32,536
I have my appetite back, so I am all good.

455
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:40,007
It is not cooked yet.

456
00:47:49,717 --> 00:47:51,356
Tell me if you are going to leave.

457
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,927
Do not just go about and mess up my traps.

458
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:58,096
Your traps are covered in many layers.

459
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:00,397
Why did you set up so many?

460
00:48:01,026 --> 00:48:02,826
Are you that scared of wild animals?

461
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,566
I am not afraid of animals.

462
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,737
I am afraid of humans.

463
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:16,046
Here.

464
00:48:27,626 --> 00:48:30,497
I was worried because I thought
you went down the mountain.

465
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:32,126
You were worried...

466
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:34,167
about me?

467
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:36,066
My mother told me...

468
00:48:36,636 --> 00:48:38,636
to make you pay for the herbs,

469
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:39,697
at least.

470
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,556
You have a quick eye for a profit
for people living in the mountain.

471
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:47,306
Why do you not make a living
by selling things in the village?

472
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:48,876
Why do you live in hiding?

473
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,276
I do not know.

474
00:48:54,386 --> 00:48:57,086
How did your mother hurt her eyes?

475
00:49:03,326 --> 00:49:04,826
It just happened.

476
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:08,066
It is okay. You do not have to tell me.

477
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:13,366
Father.

478
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:15,237
Father!

479
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,977
Father, Father!

480
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:19,737
Father...

481
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:23,417
Father. Father...

482
00:49:31,086 --> 00:49:32,717
Did you come with Un Am?

483
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:33,727
Yes.

484
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:37,856
The princess made it to Yibullansa.

485
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:39,757
Well done.

486
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:41,897
I am proud of you.

487
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:43,126
Father.

488
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:45,796
I wanted to tell you...

489
00:49:46,806 --> 00:49:48,136
I am sorry...

490
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:52,806
for making you break your sword.

491
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:55,876
I know.

492
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:59,376
Father, let us escape from here.

493
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:02,116
Come with me, Father.

494
00:50:02,386 --> 00:50:04,086
Come with me.

495
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:05,217
Dal.

496
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:11,026
A general cannot disobey the king's order.

497
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:14,427
Father... What about me?

498
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:17,737
How should I live without you?

499
00:50:18,096 --> 00:50:20,636
What about the villagers?

500
00:50:21,336 --> 00:50:24,276
I am here to save those lives.

501
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:27,046
Father...

502
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:31,346
Dal.

503
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:34,517
There will be...

504
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:37,687
no revenge.

505
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:43,086
There should be no resentment...

506
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:46,427
in your life.

507
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:52,667
Live an ordinary life... No.

508
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,036
Live like a fool...

509
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,276
and live peacefully...

510
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:05,747
and quietly.

511
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:07,687
A fool?

512
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:13,556
Father.

513
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:16,727
Father.

514
00:51:19,397 --> 00:51:20,397
Father...

515
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:23,167
Father...

516
00:51:24,636 --> 00:51:25,836
Father.

517
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,437
Father... Father...

518
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:33,447
Father...

519
00:51:34,747 --> 00:51:36,076
Father...

520
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:42,616
How could they do this? My goodness.

521
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:44,586
My gosh. I cannot believe this.

522
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:46,316
This cannot be happening.

523
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:47,356
Poor him. Be quiet!

524
00:52:02,806 --> 00:52:07,046
General, I will take
good care of the tribe.

525
00:52:07,747 --> 00:52:09,806
Do not worry about your son.

526
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:12,517
I will protect him.

527
00:52:25,757 --> 00:52:28,126
Father! No!

528
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:45,447
Dal! Do not be like this.

529
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:47,116
Dal! Let go of me!

530
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,687
I have to go see my father.

531
00:52:48,886 --> 00:52:50,086
I have to take his body!

532
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:52,116
No! I cannot lose you too.

533
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,556
I am not afraid of death.

534
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:54,757
Let go of me!

535
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:56,356
You cannot go!

536
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:04,697
Please...

537
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:07,646
What do you think you are doing?

538
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:22,386
Lady Sa.

539
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:30,427
Lady Sa!

540
00:53:31,296 --> 00:53:32,296
Lady Sa!

541
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:34,826
Lady Sa...

542
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:36,197
Lady Sa!

543
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:38,697
Lady Sa! Lady Sa!

544
00:53:41,737 --> 00:53:42,737
Lady Sa.

545
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:47,947
Lady Sa...

546
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:49,947
From today,

547
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:53,417
you will be...

548
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:58,757
my son!

549
00:54:01,826 --> 00:54:03,727
Are you going to...

550
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:06,326
leave your blind mother? Lady Sa...

551
00:54:07,897 --> 00:54:09,397
Lady Sa...

552
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:12,937
Lady Sa...

553
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:16,267
Lady Sa...

554
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,786
These are from a wild-walnut tree.

555
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:36,187
They kill the worms in your body.

556
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:38,856
And these are spicebush leaves.

557
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:41,427
They help relieve an upset
stomach or clogged arteries.

558
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:44,296
Starworts help get
rid of a cold or phlegm.

559
00:54:44,897 --> 00:54:46,267
And...

560
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:49,636
this is what you need the most.

561
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:50,836
Fo-ti root.

562
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:53,036
If you put its leaf on a wound,

563
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,306
it gets rid of all the pus.

564
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,876
What do you think? Do they interest you?

565
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:01,917
What? What?

566
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,356
What are you doing?

567
00:55:07,257 --> 00:55:10,526
People pay good money for these.

568
00:55:11,026 --> 00:55:12,326
You need to make a living too.

569
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,326
Did you not say that you
ran away from the palace?

570
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:17,596
This may be wilder than working as a maid,

571
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:19,096
but it is not that bad.

572
00:55:19,897 --> 00:55:21,907
And you will not have nightmares.

573
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:43,957
Is that you, Dal?

574
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:46,657
Yes.

575
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:48,826
You should go to bed.

576
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:49,997
Come here.

577
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:01,407
What about the girl?

578
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:03,677
I brought her back.

579
00:56:05,276 --> 00:56:08,187
She went out for a walk and got lost.

580
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:10,187
Is she pretty?

581
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:13,687
What? Is she so beautiful...

582
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:15,386
that you are crazy for her?

583
00:56:16,157 --> 00:56:18,957
Mother, have you lost your mind?

584
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:21,366
Do not make me repeat myself.

585
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:25,197
As soon as the day
breaks, get her out of here.

586
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:29,237
Otherwise, I will kick her out myself.

587
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:12,076
A SHAMAN WILL ATTACK THE KING.

588
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:14,217
Are you in there?

589
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:19,116
Yes, Father.

590
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:30,336
You will start working at
the palace from tomorrow.

591
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:32,296
You will need to guard the palace.

592
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:35,336
Me?

593
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:38,836
Until the assassin is caught,
the responsibility rests with you.

594
00:57:39,237 --> 00:57:41,917
You asked me to guard the king
during the ceremony out of the blue,

595
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:44,517
and now you want me to catch the assassin?

596
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,846
Do you want me to do
the job halfheartedly...

597
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:48,417
and lose the assassin?

598
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:52,217
That is a wild speculation.

599
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:54,657
Then can I really...

600
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:57,326
catch the assassin?

601
00:57:58,497 --> 00:58:00,337
I will catch her and
offer her to His Majesty.

602
00:58:04,536 --> 00:58:06,437
He will be proud of you.

603
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:09,366
And he will appoint you
to a more important post.

604
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:10,707
I am not interested...

605
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,136
in politics.

606
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,447
But I will make sure
to catch the assassin.

607
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,397
The king is in danger.

608
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:37,126
That is why you must watch carefully.

609
00:58:38,937 --> 00:58:39,937
People...

610
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:43,806
cannot find out the
shameful secret of our family.

611
00:59:07,897 --> 00:59:08,897
Yeom Deuk...

612
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:14,437
Yeom Deuk!

613
00:59:14,866 --> 00:59:15,937
Yeom Deuk!

614
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,207
Yeom Deuk.

615
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,437
Yeom Deuk!

616
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:23,806
Tae Mo, that jerk!

617
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:26,276
He must have drugged Yeom
Deuk to find where Ga Jin is.

618
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:28,546
Yeom Deuk, pull yourself together.

619
00:59:28,546 --> 00:59:30,447
It is me, Tara Jin.

620
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:34,556
Do not come back. Do not ever come back!

621
00:59:35,257 --> 00:59:36,257
Guys.

622
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:38,026
Jin!

623
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:40,967
Do not forget what I have just said.

624
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:40,586
Hey.

625
01:00:41,457 --> 01:00:42,457
Ga Jin.

626
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:46,497
Why are you here? I
was going to see Chief.

627
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:50,197
What is wrong?

628
01:00:50,866 --> 01:00:54,136
Ma Tae Mo turned your house upside down.

629
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,576
What about my father?

630
01:00:58,007 --> 01:00:59,336
He is fine.

631
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:01,477
San is taking care of him.

632
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:03,677
Let us go. Wait.

633
01:01:05,816 --> 01:01:08,316
Yeom Deuk said you should never come back.

634
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:09,846
What?

635
01:01:10,886 --> 01:01:12,417
He told you to never come back...

636
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:15,586
and find your real parents first.

637
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:20,056
My real parents?

638
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,066
What does he mean by that?

639
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,427
Well, he meant...

640
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:29,467
Chief said you are an orphan.

641
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:31,707
What did you say?

642
01:01:31,937 --> 01:01:36,276
Gosh, I will just tell you. Yeom
Deuk does not have a family.

643
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,947
That is why Chief told him
to raise you as his daughter.

644
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:46,687
Stop joking. It is not funny.

645
01:01:46,687 --> 01:01:48,657
He said there is this necklace...

646
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:50,257
that belongs to you.

647
01:01:50,897 --> 01:01:53,856
He said that will be a token to
help you find your real parents.

648
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,897
A necklace?

649
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:06,007
But Ma Tae Mo must have taken that.

650
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:10,507
So...

651
01:02:12,576 --> 01:02:16,187
you are saying I am an orphan, right?

652
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:18,116
Yes.

653
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:25,157
Hey!

654
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:30,096
You have not killed him?

655
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:32,237
You told me to seduce him instead.

656
01:02:32,897 --> 01:02:34,907
You? As if.

657
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:41,907
Hi.

658
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:44,376
Your friend came to pick you up?

659
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,317
Yes, she is my childhood...
We met each other in the palace.

660
01:02:51,157 --> 01:02:53,157
She is my hometown friend.

661
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:54,886
And we worked at the palace together.

662
01:02:55,056 --> 01:02:56,257
I see.

663
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:59,497
How did you come all the way here?

664
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:01,126
I followed the footsteps.

665
01:03:05,397 --> 01:03:06,397
What is with you?

666
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,267
Why are you interrogating us?

667
01:03:08,366 --> 01:03:09,366
I am just checking...

668
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:11,507
if it is okay...

669
01:03:11,937 --> 01:03:13,677
to just send you away like this...

670
01:03:13,876 --> 01:03:15,576
and if the place you are going to is safe.

671
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:23,647
Oh, I do not have any money
to give you, but take this.

672
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:28,126
I carved it myself.

673
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:35,796
The Sunno Tribe... I mean...

674
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:40,737
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

675
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,237
Same side?

676
01:03:42,306 --> 01:03:43,566
Yes, we are on the same side.

677
01:03:44,677 --> 01:03:46,477
But I have nothing to give you.

678
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:47,576
Gosh.

679
01:03:48,106 --> 01:03:49,346
Yes, you do.

680
01:04:02,326 --> 01:04:03,326
Darn you!

681
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:12,997
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

682
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,966
That sneaky girl...

683
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:18,277
managed to seduce Dal.

684
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,676
Even if I am scared...

685
01:04:19,676 --> 01:04:20,777
and cannot find out...

686
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:22,877
who I am and what happened to my family,

687
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,047
then I will not be able to do anything.

688
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:25,747
We must save her.
