00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,884
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,920
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,300
Do you know what happens...

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,310
when you drink poison hemlock?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
Your body turns to stone,

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,000
but your mind remains clear.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,980
In other words,

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,180
I am telling you to watch...

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,890
as I carve up your son, alive,

10
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,330
piece by piece.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,320
EPISODE 14

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,710
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,540
I was told to leave the
shrine for fear of bringing evil.

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,430
Step aside.

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,780
He commanded that no one be allowed in.

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,640
Move!

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,610
Princess!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
Do you remember me?

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,690
Over ten years ago,

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,600
for you and for Goguryeo, right here,

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,370
I used to help serve the rites.

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,310
One word from you and
I lost my wife and child,

23
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,220
and I became a spirit
that wanders the world.

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,460
Each time I inhale and exhale,

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,120
I suffer from a gut-wrenching pain.

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,360
You have no idea that
my life is endless torture.

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,560
To make you feel just one-hundredth
of the pain I went through,

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,530
I took in your daughter...

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,070
and raised her to be an assassin.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,550
She failed to kill you at the ceremony,

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,920
but I will show you today.

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,950
The pain of...

33
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,830
losing a family member
in front of your eyes.

34
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,890
Ga Jin. You have changed
beyond recognition in the meantime.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,400
You are a monster.

36
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,290
Have you forgotten already?

37
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,830
I am your chief. Shut your mouth!

38
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,630
Escort the King out!

39
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,400
Bring death to that man, Pyeongwon.

40
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,200
Ga Jin.

41
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,890
Everyone is safe.

42
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,470
It is all over.

43
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
Is the King safe?

44
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,640
His physician gave him
an antidote for the poison.

45
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,160
And the Crown Prince?

46
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,240
Fortunately, he is well.

47
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,150
The Princess and her
husband went to see him.

48
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,550
How did this happen?

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
I deserve death for this.

50
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,770
He lived with the goal of getting revenge.

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
He created Cheonjubang...

52
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,370
and manipulated my memory...

53
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,980
to make me a killer.

54
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,610
It was all to get to my father.

55
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,950
I almost lost my brother too.

56
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,120
I never imagined he would
enter the palace as a fortune-teller.

57
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,370
He is a good trickster.

58
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,890
Calm down.

59
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,100
Everyone is safe.

60
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,660
It is not over yet.

61
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,840
What do you mean it is not over?

62
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,460
I am sorry, Dal.

63
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,180
Go to Ghost Valley on your own.

64
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,680
Ga Jin. Who is behind Du Jung Seo,

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,860
and who threatened
my father. I must find out.

66
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,710
Okay. Do that with me.

67
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,960
You have a lot to do with the chief.

68
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,790
The sooner your tribe
settles in Pyeongyang Castle,

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
the more you can help me.

70
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,670
Please, Dal.

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,770
My wife has no time for rest.

72
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,240
Enemies abound in your vicinity.

73
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,570
If you give a woman that look,

74
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,440
you are bound to give
the wrong impression.

75
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,620
You can misunderstand all you want.

76
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,790
I will willingly put up with any ridicule.

77
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,270
The sun is rising already.

78
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,090
Does love wither away
because the sun shines brighter?

79
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,580
I do not want to let you go.

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,430
I have something to tell you.

81
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,910
What is it?

82
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,650
What happened last night.

83
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,890
Do not think of it.

84
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,340
If I can help you in any way, just ask.

85
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,050
I will ask for help if I need it.

86
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,050
Are you talking about work?

87
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,110
Love shared over one night...

88
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,380
will be forgotten in time.

89
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,670
Helping each other...

90
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,860
is more important than our feelings.

91
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,460
As it was until now.

92
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,650
I cannot do that now.

93
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,600
That might have been so until now.

94
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,280
But Lady Hae, from now on,

95
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,400
you are closer to me...

96
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
than any woman.

97
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,110
I need to go.

98
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,500
Okay.

99
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,970
General.

100
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
What is it?

101
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,780
Gochuga hurriedly went to the palace.

102
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,700
At this hour?

103
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,780
What happened?

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,060
There was an unfortunate incident.

105
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,950
An unfortunate incident?

106
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,900
As soon as the King woke,

107
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,050
he summoned me and Royal Consort Hyeon.

108
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,190
He will question me about
admitting the fortune-teller.

109
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,560
What should I do?

110
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,860
If he punishes you, accept the punishment.

111
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,550
How could you say that?

112
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,040
If I am thrown out of the palace,

113
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,170
what will happen to Geon Mu?

114
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,300
Geon Mu.

115
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes.

116
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,450
I cannot let my son live without a mother.

117
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,680
So...

118
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,790
tell me what to do to survive.

119
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,130
If word were to get out,

120
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
it will damage our reputation. So...

121
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,660
I summoned you in secret.

122
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
I know nothing.

123
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,540
I heard of a skilled fortune-teller...

124
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,010
and requested an impregnation ceremony.

125
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,750
I did not know who he was.

126
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,050
He saved you when you
were bedridden from sickness.

127
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,810
Why would I suspect him?

128
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,130
I was deceived also.

129
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,230
Do not deny your involvement.

130
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,170
The Crown Prince almost died.

131
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,380
Please excuse us.

132
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
Your Majesty...

133
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,220
Sit down.

134
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,310
You saved Goguryeo from Northern Zhou,

135
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,870
and this time you saved
me and the Crown Prince.

136
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,080
You flatter me.

137
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,480
Your husband. Did he not come with you?

138
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,260
He left with the Sunno Tribe
people to take care of things.

139
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,090
She invited a fortune-teller in
for an impregnation ceremony.

140
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,060
The Royal Consort had no ill will,

141
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,730
so you can show her mercy on this issue.

142
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,050
However,

143
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,230
it is different for you, Your Highness.

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Are you saying I had ill will?

145
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,630
He asked to see the King
and Crown Prince in private.

146
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,850
Did you not suspect anything at all?

147
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,680
He said any other company
would jinx the ceremony.

148
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
"I did not know. I was deceived."

149
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,960
Do you try to avoid
punishment with excuses?

150
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,410
As Queen,

151
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,230
you cannot avoid
responsibility for what happened.

152
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,710
I understand.

153
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,940
If I must be penalized for not knowing,

154
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,610
you should punish the Princess also.

155
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,830
Leave us.

156
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
You brandished a sword
to take your father's life.

157
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,290
At the bid of the very same man,

158
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,870
did you not try to go
against all earthy morals?

159
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,480
Who are you?

160
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,360
Just because you had no memory...

161
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,390
does not excuse you for...

162
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,330
what you did at the ceremony.

163
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,220
If you wish to punish me,

164
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,020
punish the Princess also.

165
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,820
I had no choice.

166
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,730
As did I.

167
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,910
I was duped, just like you.

168
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,210
Then we should inform the subjects
and have them decide who is worse.

169
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,820
That is a good idea.

170
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,320
Shut your mouths.

171
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,450
If word of the past ceremony...

172
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,590
or this incident were to get out,

173
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,280
it would do us no good.

174
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,620
Father. Queen.

175
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,180
And Princess.

176
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,930
Do not bring up the past again.

177
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,110
How did you find out?

178
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,540
About what?

179
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,670
What happened at the ceremony.

180
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,810
Who told you about it?

181
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,400
In the palace,

182
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,090
even the walls have ears.

183
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,810
If you live here,

184
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,100
you will get used to it.

185
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,730
By the way,

186
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,010
your husband does not
know proper palace etiquette.

187
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,720
Instead of getting involved
in what does not concern you,

188
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,860
you should teach him that first.

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
Who are you?

190
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,120
Tell me who you are.

191
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,720
They knocked out the guards...

192
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,060
and took him before anyone noticed.

193
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,740
How could someone
escape within the Capital?

194
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,500
Did you find out who they were?

195
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,950
Is it not obvious?

196
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
The killers got involved...

197
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,080
to save their chief.

198
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,380
Arrest them quickly.

199
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,470
Yes, sir.

200
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,020
I have men searching the Capital.

201
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,240
Do not...

202
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,420
try to bring him in alive.

203
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,940
As soon as he is found,

204
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,800
have him beheaded.

205
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,380
I will do as you command.

206
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,050
Your Majesty. About who
brought him into the Palace...

207
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,910
As of this day,

208
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,270
no one is to speak
of him or that incident.

209
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,680
Whoever says so much as a word...

210
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,340
will be punished severely.

211
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,410
Dal...

212
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,750
What is it?

213
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,420
It is nothing.

214
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,110
Who is there?

215
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
I said it is nothing.

216
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,030
You got me!

217
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,890
You startled me.

218
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,620
How have you been?

219
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,650
You are as light as a feather.

220
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,490
Why are you home without notice?

221
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,620
I came because I missed you.

222
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,240
I am here to see you.

223
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,260
This is a welcome surprise.

224
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,460
It has been a long time.

225
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,510
I heard you came to Pyeongsa Plain...

226
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
but turned back with your men.

227
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,450
The battle was already ending.

228
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,140
I had no business there.

229
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,460
You and your husband gained victory.

230
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,170
That is enough for me.

231
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,730
Right. I will soon arrest
the man that got away.

232
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,880
Goodbye.

233
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,550
Master Go.

234
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,970
I heard that my father trusts you.

235
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,280
I do my duty.

236
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,070
You also trained the Crown Prince.

237
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,900
Thank you.

238
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,150
You flatter me.

239
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,640
Why are you so stubborn?

240
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,780
Ga Jin and I are leaving,

241
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,060
and so are the chief and most
of the Ghost Valley people.

242
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,070
How can you remain here alone?

243
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,370
I will not be alone.
I will live with Weol.

244
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,750
She is saying she will
stay only because of you.

245
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,640
We will not live in a thatched hut.

246
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,940
We will live in a huge tiled house...

247
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,410
I will not listen to any more.

248
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,710
Just the thought of the
clustered city suffocates me.

249
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,180
I do not wish for riches
or honor at my age.

250
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,080
If you insist on staying here,

251
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,150
would Ga Jin and I be able to rest?

252
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,260
Do I have to suffer just so
that you two do not feel bad?

253
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,120
Forget it.

254
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,890
I am not interested in
feasts and silk sheets.

255
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,500
I am better off with simple
meals and cotton sheets.

256
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,550
Mother. What?

257
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,440
General Dal.

258
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,480
Do as she says.

259
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,780
I will think of her as my own
mother and take good care of her.

260
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,170
Goodness.

261
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,810
Goodness.

262
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,930
Gosh, be careful.

263
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,130
Should we load that chest
over there onto the cart too?

264
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,270
That is for those moving
to Pyeongyang to decide.

265
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,630
Be careful.

266
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,960
Yes.

267
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,040
Why are you not helping out?

268
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,810
We are leaving first thing in the morning.

269
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,340
I sprained my back.

270
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,450
That is too bad. Is it serious?

271
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,930
I will be fine after
sleeping on a heated floor.

272
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,360
You are in a rush. Do not mind me.

273
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,430
This is not good.

274
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,560
There will be much housework to
do once we arrive in Pyeongyang.

275
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,900
What shall we do if
you sprained your back?

276
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,760
Housework?

277
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
The entire Sunno Tribe
will be living together.

278
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Who else will be up to
the task if not for you?

279
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,540
Do you mean...

280
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,000
I am coming with you?

281
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,250
Do not make me repeat myself.

282
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,780
My goodness. Chief!

283
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,120
My dear. Come on.

284
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,570
Pack up your things.

285
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,470
Why are you not packing up?

286
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,520
Chief.

287
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,300
I am not sure if I should
follow you to Pyeongyang.

288
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,810
What are you talking about?

289
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,110
The Princess's stepfather
should, of course, come.

290
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,700
I am destined to shave salt
in Ghost Valley all my life.

291
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,680
None of us belong in Pyeongyang.

292
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,600
But without Dal,

293
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,754
we would have continued
to wander around aimlessly.

294
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,620
We are only coming with him to repay him.

295
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,790
We are almost done loading the carts.

296
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,480
Good work. Thank you.

297
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,170
The Princess will need you there.

298
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,400
Deuk, we all are just as worried as you.

299
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,674
But it does not matter whether you
are in Ghost Valley or Pyeongyang.

300
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,300
After some getting used to,

301
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,940
you will feel at home.

302
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,680
I know that. I do understand all of that.

303
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,050
But it just does not feel right.

304
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,540
Why are you taking it out on me?

305
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,150
I am sorry. Stop it.

306
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,540
Let it go.

307
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,780
Shall we get going?

308
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,080
Fine, let us go.

309
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,280
Are you coming? I am.

310
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,020
Are you sure? Yes, let us go!

311
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,470
So you are coming!

312
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,890
Do not be like that.

313
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,180
I am not coming.

314
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,820
I mean it.

315
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,500
Why are you two fighting?

316
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,030
Should you not be busy packing up?

317
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,600
I am telling her to come
with us, but she will not listen.

318
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,800
Where would I be going
with San buried in the field?

319
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,090
Fine, stay then.

320
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,670
I do not care.

321
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,160
If you are going to say the same thing,

322
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,850
I do not want to hear it.

323
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,930
I do not want to move
to Pyeongyang either.

324
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,730
It is unfamiliar...

325
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,220
and somehow suffocating.

326
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,440
Still, I could not leave
Ga Jin there alone.

327
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,550
She is surrounded by
evil people everywhere.

328
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,120
Your chief got caught recently.

329
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,630
While trying to harm the King.

330
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,890
And the man he was with...

331
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,690
died by my sword.

332
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,620
It is not your fault.

333
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,320
He would have...

334
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,200
even covered himself in
oil and jumped into the fire...

335
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,550
if the chief had told him to.

336
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,760
That is exactly what Ga Jin said.

337
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,150
With San gone and you far away,

338
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,000
Ga Jin will have no one to turn to.

339
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,870
You will be there for her.

340
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,950
That is different.

341
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,010
She needs her friend
as well as her husband.

342
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,990
So?

343
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,200
So?

344
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,640
You must see but not look,

345
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,970
and hear but not listen...

346
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,040
for your family to be at peace.

347
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,610
What happened at the
ceremony. Who told you about it?

348
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,620
In the palace, even the walls have ears.

349
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,210
I assume that he has not been found yet.

350
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,710
He must either have run far away...

351
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,110
or hidden himself somewhere.

352
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,000
Or maybe...

353
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,900
someone is harboring him.

354
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,160
Either way, I will find
him as soon as I can.

355
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,340
Of course.

356
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,640
By the way,

357
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,560
have you heard?

358
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,130
General Yeon of the Jeollo Tribe...

359
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,560
is returning to the Five Tribe Council.

360
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,070
It is said to have been the
Princess's desperate request.

361
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,800
Dealing with barbarians all her life,

362
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,610
she must have gotten bored.

363
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,480
He is a close relative of the late Queen.

364
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,750
He is a relative to the Princess.

365
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,720
What are you trying to say?

366
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,160
The Sunno Tribe and Jeollo Tribe.

367
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,950
The two vacancies...

368
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,820
at the Five Tribe
Council have been filled.

369
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,980
It is obvious...

370
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,390
that they will side with His
Majesty and obey the Princess.

371
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,960
They are nothing to be afraid of.

372
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,770
At the center of all this is the Princess.

373
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,380
Are you lecturing me on politics?

374
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,310
I am just concerned.

375
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,650
Before they settle in and gain a foothold,

376
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,180
we must nip them in the bud.

377
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,710
I have told you this before.
Did you already forget?

378
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,020
Violence without a cause
is a house built on sand.

379
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,850
It is that lax attitude of yours...

380
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,964
HOUSE ON SAND: SOMETHING WITHOUT
A STRONG BASE AND LIKELY TO FAIL

381
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,690
that got you in this situation.

382
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,060
Watch your mouth.

383
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,450
I must say this.

384
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,760
Do not underestimate the Princess.

385
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,220
The son of General On Hyeop
may cause trouble as well.

386
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,540
Leave. Let me take care of it.

387
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,770
I will take charge.

388
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,900
I said, leave!

389
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,880
Sure.

390
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,050
This medicine will boost your energy.

391
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,660
Take it twice a day.

392
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,430
What you wish for is my wish as well.

393
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,170
Everything will go as planned.

394
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,550
Do not worry too much.

395
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,650
Do not get too close to Go Geon.

396
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,820
Father, what are you talking about?

397
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,650
I have eyes to see...

398
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,060
and ears to hear.

399
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,400
Did you think I did not know...

400
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
you were getting close to him?

401
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,930
The Princess and the Gyeru
Tribe are in fierce conflict.

402
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,070
If you get involved with
General Go at times like this,

403
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,680
you may get hurt...

404
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,960
or put the entire Sono Tribe in danger.

405
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
If that is the reason,

406
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,290
I will not keep a distance from him.

407
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,150
Mo Yong.

408
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,300
He cares for me sincerely.

409
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,900
I also accepted him without calculating.

410
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,740
I will never cause trouble for our family.

411
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,910
Please do not say anything more.

412
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,570
Father.

413
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,320
You are forbidden to
go out for the time being.

414
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,770
Gosh.

415
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,860
Chief!

416
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,940
The Princess is here! Gosh.

417
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,680
What? The Princess? She is here.

418
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,270
Goodness.

419
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
You are here.

420
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,050
The journey here must have been tough.

421
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,910
Tough? No.

422
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,220
My son-in-law took good care of
me. I was comfortable on a wagon.

423
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,990
Thank you for taking care
of him. What about Mother?

424
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,680
Her stubbornness has won.

425
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,160
I will go see her later and
make sure I bring her here.

426
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,300
She is a stubborn old lady
who loves crossing people.

427
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,570
Why would you want to
bring such a lady? Forget it.

428
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,340
Do not just stand here.
Everyone, let us go back to work.

429
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,230
Okay. Okay.

430
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,650
Thank you for your hard work, Lord Sa.

431
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,510
Thank you.

432
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,720
The exclusive rights to sell salt?

433
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,340
Right now, the Five
Tribes have exclusivity.

434
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,690
Originally, it belonged
to the royal family.

435
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,550
Of course.

436
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,160
That jerk, Go Won Pyo, stole everything.

437
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,140
We must take it back
even if it has been too long.

438
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,610
Moreover, it was a wish of my late mother.

439
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,910
Chief, Ga Jin has been
planning this for a long time.

440
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,050
I mean, please help us, Lord Sa.

441
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
There will be a huge backlash.

442
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,900
Even so, what could they do?

443
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,660
The King has given his order.
And the Sunno Tribe will agree to it.

444
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,470
The Jeollo Tribe will join our cause soon.

445
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,010
The first thing we must do is...

446
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,714
to check the size of the salt ponds
and the yield of salt accurately.

447
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,400
Can you guys find that out?
Father, I would like your help too.

448
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,370
Say no more.

449
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,484
It is not just a task for the empire...

450
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,350
but a favor for my daughter.

451
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,150
Do not worry, My Princess.

452
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,990
Please do not worry.

453
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,560
When I used to work as a peddler,

454
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,090
I visited every nook
and corner of this empire.

455
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,330
She does not need to hear
that. You should talk less.

456
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,190
Thank you.

457
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,830
You have a visitor from the palace.

458
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,670
Our attendance is required at the palace.

459
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,340
We have to go to the palace? The palace?

460
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,110
Obey the King and
accept your official position.

461
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,860
General On Dal, the King has
assigned you with Eighth Rank.

462
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,890
Moreover, the King has appointed
you the Head of Capital Defense.

463
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,680
Do your best to achieve
peace within the capital.

464
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,540
I will.

465
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,750
Accept your duties wholeheartedly
as General On Hyeop had done.

466
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I will do my best, unto death.

467
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Next. Generals from the
Sunno Tribe, come forward.

468
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,550
So tell me. How tall was
the general of our enemy?

469
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,600
Here.

470
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,160
He was about the same
height as me. Oh, right.

471
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,680
But his ax was something else.

472
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,140
Whenever he swung it, I
could feel the breeze from it.

473
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,050
Do not kid with me.

474
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,790
My son-in-law turns out to be a jokester.

475
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,860
Gosh. I am not joking, Sire.

476
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,070
All right. Pour me a drink. Okay.

477
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,910
He shows no class.

478
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,690
All right.

479
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,950
Take it back.

480
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,930
That is way too greasy for my father.

481
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,790
Right.

482
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,510
All right. Let us drink. Okay.

483
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,800
Their get-together must be running long.

484
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,860
It is his first time having
drinks with his son-in-law.

485
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,340
The evening is too early for
it to end. Do you not agree?

486
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,440
General On has a low tolerance
for alcohol. So it will end soon.

487
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,050
What good will come from getting drunk?

488
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,440
Gosh, men.

489
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,400
Escort the Prince to his chambers.

490
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,930
Yes, Your Highness.

491
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,640
Is he going to sleep now?

492
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,240
Once you are done with the
refreshments, you may leave.

493
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,570
She is such a snob. She must
think she is better than everyone.

494
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,440
She is the one who brought such
a dangerous man to the shrine!

495
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,710
Please do not speak of that again.

496
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,440
See? The King has let it slide again.

497
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,350
This is why I must give birth to a prince.

498
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,520
Or I must write him
love letters diligently.

499
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
Love letters?

500
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,710
Gosh. How beautiful.

501
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,590
You did not even knock first.

502
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,340
Is that for the King?

503
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,850
Do not ask me such a question.

504
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,670
Gosh, this is beautiful.

505
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,350
You put this beautiful
flower on the love letter, right?

506
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,340
Should I write one too?

507
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,440
I tried to write one as well.

508
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,710
But I am not good with words.

509
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,880
So she wrote a love letter?

510
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,050
Yes. Why do you ask?

511
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,740
Gosh, the robe was suffocating.

512
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,340
It really was.

513
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,310
Dal, drink this.

514
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,990
That hits the spot.

515
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,970
Leave us be.

516
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,610
Come here, my wife.

517
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,530
You must be drunk.

518
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,710
Where are you going?

519
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,020
Go to sleep first. I need
time to think about something.

520
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,160
About what? Go to sleep already.

521
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,570
By myself?

522
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,120
You are acting like a
baby. Just go to sleep.

523
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,060
Ga Jin. Yes?

524
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,070
It is nothing.

525
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,960
I am going to sleep now.

526
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,740
What are you doing?

527
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,770
You have greatly angered...

528
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,720
Lord Kim Cha Seung.

529
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,080
Tie her up. Yes.

530
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,300
JANGBAEK

531
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,790
Are you serious?

532
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,600
She just disappeared without a trace!

533
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,870
What do you mean you
know nothing about this?

534
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,820
We are searching inside
and outside the store,

535
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,920
but we have not found
her yet. Did she say...

536
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,380
she was going somewhere?

537
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,960
No, I have not heard anything.

538
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,330
Oh, no. Lord Hae.

539
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,790
Send a message to General Go.

540
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,630
What are you doing?
Do it now! Yes, my lord.

541
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,370
What on earth happened?

542
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,240
What do you mean she disappeared?

543
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,890
If this incident was caused
by affection between you two,

544
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,500
this is enough.

545
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,380
I will not tell your father about this.

546
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,190
What are you talking about?

547
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,170
Do not tell me you
did not know about this.

548
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,040
I am sure someone has kidnapped her.

549
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,760
We must find her first.

550
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,230
Oh, no. She...

551
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
What did you do with Lady Hae?

552
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,580
I am sure your
subordinates are behind this.

553
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,440
Never.

554
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,130
However, she does have
enemies all around her.

555
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
She only has herself to blame.

556
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,680
I kept you alive to give you
one last chance to survive.

557
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,260
If I find out that you
were involved in this,

558
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,000
I will tear you to pieces.

559
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,770
Keep him locked up. As you wish.

560
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,660
One last chance?

561
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,700
What do you mean, Your Highness?

562
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,330
You think Gochuga and the
Queen are having an affair?

563
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,410
I still remember clearly
how I ran into him.

564
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,790
I remember the face Go Won
Pyo put on when he threatened me.

565
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,480
If they kept their inappropriate
relationship until now...

566
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,170
Please do not say that.

567
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,530
What if someone hears us?

568
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,380
Why are you so startled?

569
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,530
I only asked if you knew something.

570
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,680
I do not know anything, and
I have not heard anything.

571
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,100
Nanny, how do I look?

572
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,730
Today is my first day of work.

573
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,590
I see.

574
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,660
What happened?

575
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,020
It is nothing.

576
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,510
You are not telling me again.

577
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,140
Ever since we came here, you
have been keeping things from me.

578
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,030
When we were in Ghost Valley,
we told each other everything.

579
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,700
Dal.

580
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,570
Anyway, I wonder how Weol
is doing with Mother's nagging.

581
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,690
Weol. Yes?

582
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,000
What on earth are you doing?

583
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,970
I am only blind. It is not
like I do not have hands.

584
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,940
My goodness.

585
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,210
Just get used to being
comfortable, and have your meal.

586
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
If I wanted to be comfortable,

587
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,550
I would have gone to
Pyeongyang with my son.

588
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,420
I would not have made you serve me.

589
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,560
You must be sad now that
Dal is not here anymore.

590
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,630
No matter how cozy the nest
is, if their wings get too big,

591
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,960
they should find
another tree and fly away.

592
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,900
That is the way of the world.

593
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,090
And you, Weol.

594
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,504
Do not behave like this, as if you
are walking on eggshells around me.

595
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,410
I did not take you in to
make you my servant.

596
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,840
I am not going to live as your servant.

597
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,910
I will run away if you make me.

598
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,650
My goodness. Where would you go?

599
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,330
Are you going to fly away
to Baekje or something?

600
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,360
Wait. I did not mean that.

601
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,200
I am fine. Let us have our meal.

602
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,840
Put it on my spoon one last time. Sure.

603
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,910
This will be the last time, okay?

604
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,180
Go ahead and have your meal. Okay.

605
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,100
What is this?

606
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,560
Get on. It is the horse for
the Head of Capital Defense.

607
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,960
I prepared it for you.

608
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,170
Forget it. I do not need a horse.

609
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,170
It is better for me to walk to
look around the capital carefully.

610
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,300
Get rid of it.

611
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,340
Troops, march.

612
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,880
Just let me go in. I cannot do that.

613
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,890
Why do you not understand
me? You cannot go in.

614
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,350
Pil Gu. You are here right on time.

615
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,880
What is happening, Father?

616
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,420
We lost the pass to enter the capital.

617
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,120
We have an important
message for the Princess,

618
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,390
but they are just treating
us like a bunch of beggars.

619
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,130
Maybe we smell like salt
because we have been...

620
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,820
checking the salt ponds.

621
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,910
He is the Princess' step-father,
and they belong to the Sunno Tribe.

622
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,734
We cannot let a man
without a pass in the capital...

623
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,730
just with a few words.

624
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,640
How dare you. What
did you say? He is right.

625
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,750
You are doing well by following the rules.

626
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,560
I will tell them to be careful,
so please let them in for now.

627
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:56,610
Yes, My Lord.

628
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,210
There you go.

629
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,190
Dal is indeed amazing.

630
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,380
Our flag needs to be fluttering
even when seen from far away.

631
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,180
That is one of the rules too.

632
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,240
Yes, My Lord!

633
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,100
Let us go in. Sure. You
are practically flying.

634
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,330
He is my son-in-law! You heard me?

635
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,630
Dal is the best. He is my son-in-law!

636
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,730
What is this nonsense?

637
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,660
You want us to give you
the exclusive rights to salt?

638
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,130
The exclusive rights to salt...

639
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,140
belong to the royal household.

640
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,850
You are not giving them to us.

641
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,870
You are only returning them.

642
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,500
Lord Hae! Why are you not saying anything?

643
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,650
It is not a matter worth
our time to discuss.

644
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,960
The King has given us
the rights a long time ago.

645
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,830
Anyway, we are looking into
the status of the salt ponds,

646
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,460
so as soon as General Yeon
from the Jeollo Tribe arrives,

647
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,150
let us all take a vote.

648
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,080
A vote? It is 2 against 3.

649
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,120
Is it not useless to take a vote?

650
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,810
The Five Tribe council is a
coalition among five tribes...

651
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,620
where they come together to lead Goguryeo.

652
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,850
It took your tribe a long time to return.

653
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,210
Do you really want to spend your
time cleaning up after the Princess?

654
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,270
I will bear your advice in mind.

655
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,400
How dare he!

656
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,530
We must get back the
exclusive rights to salt.

657
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,144
Since Lord Sa has told the
other lords of the Five Tribes,

658
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,650
you two must keep an eye
on the Five Tribe council.

659
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,260
Do you think they will back off easily?

660
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,900
We need to find a way to make them.

661
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,440
I know you have a lot on your plate,

662
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,940
but do not be too inattentive to Dal.

663
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,930
What do you mean?

664
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,670
It is okay for us since we live together,

665
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,080
but Dal is all alone in the palace.

666
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,690
If you do not look after him,
he will remain an outcast.

667
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,720
You are worrying too much.

668
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,280
He is not a child. I do not
need to follow him around...

669
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,340
and take care of him.

670
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,290
Do not forget for whom
he fought in the war...

671
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,660
and for whom he is living in the palace.

672
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,390
Dal. I am sorry.

673
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,400
For what?

674
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,600
I could not pay attention to you
because I was immersed in my work.

675
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,140
We are married. You do
not need to worry about that.

676
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,000
I am okay.

677
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,180
This is what has been keeping me busy.

678
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,570
What is this?

679
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,490
It looks like a letter.

680
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,200
It is a love letter that the
Queen sent to Go Won Pyo.

681
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,570
The Queen...

682
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,390
sent this to Go Won Pyo?

683
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,160
It is the evidence that proves
they are having an affair.

684
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,260
I will clean this up right away.

685
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,780
What did you say?

686
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,230
How did the Princess lay her hands on it?

687
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,410
I am not sure about that.

688
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,970
I am...

689
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,060
not telling you this for
you and the Queen's sake.

690
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,230
If that love letter causes trouble,

691
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,770
the Crown Prince and Prince Geon Mu...

692
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,380
will be deeply scarred.

693
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,530
I understand.

694
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Then you must know
what you should do about it.

695
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,650
That is impossible.

696
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,560
The letters have never
fallen into anyone's hands.

697
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,740
Are you smiling right now?

698
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,910
Maybe the Princess
is playing tricks on us.

699
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,410
Pardon? Maybe she is trying to...

700
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,020
set us up using a fake letter.

701
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,250
Just like how her mother was tricked.

702
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:28,150
Hide this in the queen's
chambers after she leaves on patrol.

703
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,200
What is this?

704
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,360
A talisman that will make you queen.

705
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,490
But what if she really has our letter?

706
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,360
We have no time for this.
We need to find the letter first.

707
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,220
Ja Gyeong.

708
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,530
What...

709
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,210
did you just call me?

710
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,810
Jin Ja Gyeong.

711
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,830
I am calling my longtime lover's name.

712
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,810
Also, I already know...

713
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,780
that Geon Mu is not my son.

714
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,060
You...

715
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,630
already knew?

716
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,200
If you could make your
son the king of this empire,

717
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,280
you would have done anything.

718
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,180
I loved your avarice,

719
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,890
which is why I
willingly fell for your lie.

720
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,020
Please...

721
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,250
forgive me.

722
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,600
Forgive?

723
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,310
I admired you for you resembled me.

724
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,010
So how would I forgive you?

725
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,240
We only need to get rid
of the letter if there is one.

726
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,130
Do not be afraid.

727
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,660
Are you deeply moved...

728
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,110
to be back on Silla land again?

729
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,890
You must have had no idea
that you would return this way.

730
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,140
My Lord.

731
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,950
I did not punish you
when Silla was destructed.

732
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,970
But you...

733
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,850
made a false report on
Goguryeo and the Northern Zhou.

734
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,060
Have you forgotten who you are...

735
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,580
and what your duty is?

736
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,720
That is not true.

737
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,270
Please give me another chance. Shut it!

738
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,050
Since I am the one who
saved you, I will kill you myself.

739
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,910
My Lord!

740
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,440
What is it?

741
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,510
SILLA, SEORABEOL

742
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,620
KING JINHEUNG, 24TH KING OF SILLA

743
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,430
I, Kim Cha Seung, am here as I was
granted an audience to Your Majesty.

744
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:30,720
Get up.

745
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,020
Lift your head.

746
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,240
Are you Hae Mo Yong?

747
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

748
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,370
King Wideok of Baekje...

749
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,300
is a dishonorable man, so I
do not need to worry about him.

750
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,624
DISHONORABLE: A PERSON WHO BRINGS
SHAME OR DISGRACE ON THEMSELVES

751
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,560
King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo...

752
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,450
has been busy looking after himself.

753
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,990
So...

754
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,120
do you know what gets in the way...

755
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,050
of my great cause to
unite the three empires?

756
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,130
How dare I assume anything?

757
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,510
It is Princess Pyeonggang,
the daughter of King Pyeongwon.

758
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,340
Whose son is the man...

759
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,800
Princess Pyeonggang got married to?

760
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:43,260
The former chief of the Sunno
Tribe, General On Hyeop.

761
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,970
He defended the border against us.

762
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,110
That is right.

763
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,760
She took in the son of a tiger
and made him into a general.

764
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,480
And she helped her powerless father...

765
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,560
to defend her country
against the Northern Zhou.

766
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,600
I am concerned about...

767
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,210
what she will do next.

768
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,080
That means...

769
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,400
For the great cause of the three empires,

770
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,200
I want you to return to Goguryeo.

771
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,060
And...

772
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,380
kill...

773
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,430
Princess Pyeonggang.

774
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,840
It is nice to be gathered together.

775
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,230
Princess, you are here.

776
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,610
Hi, you are here.

777
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,420
I thought it was an urgent call.

778
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,820
We wanted you to get some fresh air...

779
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,170
outside Magnolia Hall.

780
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,040
The Queen suggested
that we gather for tea.

781
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,650
All of us have gathered after a long time.

782
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,320
Do not think much of it and have a seat.

783
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,970
The Crown Prince has been
remarkable with his studies.

784
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,270
You are too kind.

785
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,140
Please continue to
teach your brother well.

786
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,290
Yes.

787
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,120
Pyeonggang, do you want to see my book?

788
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:31,170
Show it to me too. I want
to see it, Your Highness.

789
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,210
What else have you learned?

790
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,100
Wow, that is amazing.

791
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,070
I checked the ferry Lady Hae uses...

792
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,940
and all the big herb
stores in the capital,

793
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,730
but no one has seen her.

794
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,490
Did she soar up to the sky...

795
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,250
or did she sink into the ground?

796
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,300
Lord Hae.

797
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,650
I will go farther outside the
capital to look for her tomorrow.

798
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,660
Lord Hae. Yes?

799
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,450
Lady Hae is back.

800
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,900
What? She is back?

801
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,200
Lady Hae!

802
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,260
Mo Yong!

803
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,320
General Go. What happened?

804
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,280
Mo Yong! Mo Yong...

805
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,270
Get up.

806
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,850
You found it?

807
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,760
I told you not to be afraid.

808
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,100
It is the grace of the skies.
The skies must have helped.

809
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,010
No, they did not do anything.

810
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,480
It is because you called the
Princess out of Magnolia Hall.

811
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,850
That is not true.

812
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,970
You and I did this together.

813
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,820
Wait. This is not my handwriting.

814
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,190
Are you here to exchange love letters?

815
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,020
That looks like my letter though.

816
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:55,150
What do you think you are doing, Princess?

817
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,620
What about you two?

818
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,990
What is this discreet
meeting at this time of night?

819
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,460
What do you mean? Watch what you say.

820
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,650
The Princess must have gotten us wrong.

821
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,590
Stop right there, Go Won Pyo.

822
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,780
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

823
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,470
Are you going to keep deceiving me?

824
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,930
You can stop pretending
to be a loyal subject.

825
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,600
I will go against your will...

826
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,210
and get rid of everyone who is corrupt.

827
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,700
You need to give it up.

828
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,170
Do not try so hard. Just do one at a time.

829
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,020
Do one at a time, enough for you to bear.

830
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,750
So why do you not take a break?

831
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,560
I cannot afford to be idle.

832
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:05,650
The general of Hwangju Castle
raised hundreds of soldiers.

833
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,510
I will go.

834
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,970
That is the only way the
Princess will be at ease.

835
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,890
Trust me.
