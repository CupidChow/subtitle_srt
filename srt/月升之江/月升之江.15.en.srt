00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,864
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,838
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,720
EPISODE 15

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,550
You found it?

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,337
I told you not to be afraid.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,674
It is the grace of the skies.
The skies must have helped.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,613
No, they did not do anything.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,144
It is because you called the
Princess out of Magnolia Hall.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,510
That is not true.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,577
You and I did this together.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,070
Wait.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,890
This is not my handwriting.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,833
Are you here to exchange love letters?

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,610
That looks like my letter though.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,750
What do you think you are doing, Princess?

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,240
What about you two?

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,584
What is this discreet
meeting at this time of night?

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,057
What do you mean? Watch what you say.

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,154
The Princess must have gotten us wrong.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,093
Stop right there, Go Won Pyo.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,943
Princess, are you out of your mind?

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,713
You cannot speak down to him.

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,860
Why?

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,217
Are you upset that I called out...

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,690
your lover's name?

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,030
We met when you were
selecting the Princess' groom.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,000
This is the first time we meet in private.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,573
Your father was a legendary swordsman.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,564
He did not hide behind a woman...

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,634
to draw his sword whenever he pleased.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,804
Do not dare mention my
father with your corrupt lips.

32
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,330
Do not fall for it.

33
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,730
He is taunting you.

34
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,390
You cannot prove
anything with a fake letter.

35
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,890
At times, something
fake reveals the truth.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,324
Someone was given the
order to steal the letter.

37
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,210
Your nanny?

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,420
If it were your command,

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
she would willingly jump into
a fire with a handful of straw.

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,190
Who would believe her?

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,890
There is another witness.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Eight years ago,

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,753
someone witnessed your discreet meetings.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,933
You must see but not look,

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,224
and hear but not listen...

46
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,297
for your family to be at peace.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,600
I regretted keeping
silent ever since then.

48
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,677
If I had told my mother a day sooner,

49
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,904
I could have prevented the disaster
that befell us and the Sunno Tribe.

50
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,843
I do not know what you saw...

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,330
Shut your mouth.

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,783
You are Queen, the mother of a prince.

53
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,118
But with your corrupt deeds,
you brought shame on us.

54
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,223
I cannot even bear to speak of it myself.

55
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,810
Curse me all you want.

56
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,538
Or do you want me to bite my
tongue and take my life right now?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,900
You do not know the
sorrow of a woman scorned.

58
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,937
If the King had just
looked at me even once,

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,974
if he cared for me
just one-hundredth of...

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,580
the time he pined for your dead mother,

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,844
then I would have lived differently.

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,700
But...

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,500
you two killed my mother.

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,084
Including the innocent Sunno people.

65
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,854
You should save your breath.

66
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,993
Instead of bringing up the past,

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,667
tell us what it is you want.

68
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,100
Leave the palace.

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,450
As soon as possible.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,100
Make up whatever excuse,

71
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,750
but you must leave the palace.

72
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,110
Silently.

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,927
So no one suspects anything.

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,990
I am the Queen.

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,394
I will not be chased out like this.

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,467
You brought this upon yourself.

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,933
For the sake of your son, Prince Geon Mu,

78
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,254
I am giving you a chance
to leave with dignity.

79
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,490
Do not cause a scene.

80
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,184
If you wish me gone as well,

81
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,470
do not dare ask.

82
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,130
I have no intention of leaving quietly.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,467
You must hand over something else.

84
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,200
Princess.

85
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,450
I am a foolish woman,
and I did something terrible.

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,000
I know why you did it.

87
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,824
You wanted to protect the royal household.

88
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,680
Perhaps...

89
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,727
Go Won Pyo threatened you...

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,960
by naming me or the Crown Prince.

91
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,750
So I will not blame you.

92
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,820
Princess.

93
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,450
Just remember two things.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,180
Father can never find
out what the Queen did.

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,130
And...

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
if you deceive me again,

97
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,050
I will not be forgiving,
even if it is you.

98
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,690
I will see you in the morning.

99
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,740
Do you regret it?

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,840
Regret?

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,844
Using Lady Gongson...

102
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,783
to set a trap for Go Won Pyo.

103
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,040
No.

104
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,224
If I think about the
corruption they perpetrated,

105
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,424
I could have them quartered
and still feel no better.

106
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,110
I do not have regrets.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,907
You told me that the letter was real.

108
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,890
That was...

109
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,590
because you cannot lie.

110
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I do not mind.

111
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,650
Use me as much as you need to.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,487
But do not do that to anyone else.

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
Do not hurt them...

114
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,790
or yourself.

115
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,430
Everywhere I step is thin ice.

116
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,630
I do not know who is a friend,

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,320
or who is a foe.

118
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,423
I was taken, and when I woke up,

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,333
Lord Kim Cha Seung was there.

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,650
Lord Kim?

121
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,537
Did he question you
about the missing girls?

122
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,120
Yes.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,804
He was furious because of his great loss.

124
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,770
How dare he?

125
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,874
For something that trivial,

126
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,213
he abducted the Sono Tribe heiress?

127
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,753
I will not let him get away with this!

128
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,400
You must.

129
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,014
He let me go because I
promised to cover his losses.

130
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,754
- But this is...
- The mind of a merchant...

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,720
is the same.

132
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,363
I will sort this out. Do not worry.

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I am glad you are back safely.

134
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,690
Get some rest.

135
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,040
General.

136
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,750
Do not...

137
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,033
leave my sight ever again.

138
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,270
Even if you come to hate my guts,

139
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,350
do not ever leave.

140
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
I will not leave.

141
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,540
Also, do not try to deceive me...

142
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,660
with a lie like that.

143
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,687
You were taken because
of your fake reports.

144
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,290
If it were for that,

145
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,860
how could I have come back alive?

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,540
It was not that.

147
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,520
Okay.

148
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,270
Look after yourself.

149
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,670
To convalesce?

150
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,380
Why must you convalesce
and pray to Buddha?

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,952
I did not inform you for
fear of causing concern.

152
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,790
I have been feeling unwell for a while.

153
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,594
I had been suffering morning and evening.

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,450
Oh, dear.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,333
Then you must consult my physician.

156
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,637
Medicines do nothing but the same.

157
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,404
I heard that mineral water from
a spring near Hobeob Temple...

158
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,090
cures internal illnesses.

159
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,743
I would also like to pray.

160
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,314
So I would like to leave the
palace to convalesce for a while.

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,414
Please grant your permission.

162
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,320
I would allow it if it
is to cure an illness.

163
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,184
The prince is young.

164
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,524
Would he be able to handle the trip?

165
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,130
The prince should remain in the palace.

166
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,374
We do not know how long
the Queen will be gone.

167
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,297
We cannot let the prince leave with her.

168
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,007
I will take just a few maids...

169
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,460
and travel quietly.

170
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,950
I am sorry, Queen.

171
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,710
I have not been to your chambers lately...

172
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,913
and had no idea you were ailing.

173
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,810
This is my fault.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,954
I thank you for your concern.

175
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,480
Since you have decided to
leave, you should leave today.

176
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,380
This very day?

177
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,310
The sooner you leave,

178
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,530
the sooner you can recuperate.

179
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,200
Father.

180
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,753
Why did you ask to see me so early?

181
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,884
Do you rarely come home...

182
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,824
because I have fallen from grace?

183
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,630
A friend was in trouble
so I went to check.

184
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,964
Is it a friend I know?

185
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,820
No.

186
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,830
You need not know of this friend.

187
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,277
- This is...
- The Gyeru Tribe's military...

188
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,574
THE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE THE TROOPS

189
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,874
is yours to control.

190
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,074
THE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE THE TROOPS

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
Before I give it to you,

192
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,520
I need to hear what your plan is.

193
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
What on earth is happening?

194
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,063
You look fine on the outside.

195
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,760
Why are you sick?

196
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,690
Please...

197
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,904
look after the prince for me.

198
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,110
Do not worry about anything else,

199
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,780
and focus on healing your body and spirit.

200
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,647
As your father, all I
have to say is that...

201
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,357
you must return stronger than before.

202
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,170
Mother!

203
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,380
Mother!

204
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,037
Where are you going, Mother?

205
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,233
I am going to a large temple far away.

206
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,933
I will pray for you to be strong...

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,980
at all times.

208
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,330
I wish to pray too.

209
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,510
For Father and your health.

210
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,914
I will be away only for a few nights.

211
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Be a man and guard the palace.

212
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
Can you promise?

213
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,210
No! I will go with you!

214
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,970
Do not be so weak.

215
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,750
Until my return,

216
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,137
you must study and
train. Do you understand?

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,850
Mother.

218
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,634
I will take good care of the prince.

219
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
Do not worry.

220
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,060
Mother!

221
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,520
Do not go, Mother!

222
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,800
Mother!

223
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,640
Mother.

224
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,423
Mother! Do not go, Mother.

225
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,140
Mother.

226
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,780
Mother.

227
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,660
Did you see this?

228
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Sunno Tribe's Sa Un Am...

229
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,030
seems to want to challenge
the exclusive rights to salt.

230
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,666
He should know that he is
challenging the wrong people.

231
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,370
Is there...

232
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,190
another issue on your mind?

233
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,690
We should deal with them one by one.

234
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
Oh, Lord Hae!

235
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,520
Gochuga.

236
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,190
It has been a long time.

237
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,250
I managed to stay alive,

238
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,340
hence we meet again.

239
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
You made a long, arduous trip.

240
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,843
It was incredibly and stupidly far.

241
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,887
But only Lord Sa came out to welcome me.

242
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,936
The Five Tribe council seems
to care less about manners now.

243
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,324
Take a seat, General Yeon.

244
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,010
Yes, let us all sit down.

245
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,250
Goodness.

246
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,803
I noticed on the way in...

247
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,340
that the palace seems to be busy.

248
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,444
The Queen left to a temple to convalesce.

249
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,300
Oh, dear.

250
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,313
She seems to be void of care and emotion,

251
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,870
how did she get sick?

252
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,230
The Capital Defense Army is very grand.

253
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,696
Are you returning from
escorting the Queen to the gate?

254
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,334
Those who did not receive
a title from the King...

255
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,104
cannot be armed in the Capital.

256
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,886
The Gyeru Tribe is an exception,
so do not concern yourself.

257
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,900
Put down your weapons.

258
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,820
You are a mere assassin
who was granted a position.

259
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,100
Do not cross the line.

260
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,154
I told you to put down your weapons.

261
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
You are nothing but a Gokturk.

262
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,510
Right.

263
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Your brother who scaled walls with you.

264
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,167
I heard he was slaughtered in battle.

265
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,810
How dare you?

266
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,000
Stop!

267
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,950
Sheathe your sword.

268
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,570
Do as I say.

269
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,810
Take him away.

270
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,803
Are you out of your minds?

271
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,304
In the middle of town,
the Capital Defense Army...

272
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,990
fought like ruffians?

273
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,444
Not at a time like this.

274
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,450
The Gyeru fools broke the law.

275
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,214
So you drew your swords?

276
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,684
Pung Gae defended me...

277
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,650
I apologize!

278
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,950
I will be very, very careful so that...

279
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,670
this never happens again.

280
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,560
Your Highness, the
King has called a meeting.

281
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,550
Okay.

282
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,990
You may raise your head.

283
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,110
Even if I sound harsh,
it cannot be helped.

284
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,204
We are now in the Capital,

285
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,282
so we cannot act like
how we did in Ghost Valley.

286
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,230
They are fast learners.

287
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,920
I am the slowest and worst.

288
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,210
Princess.

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,933
Ga Jin has a lot on her mind.

290
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,634
You know that, right?

291
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,507
With that tiny head of hers,

292
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,150
she worries about everything and anything.

293
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,560
It must be...

294
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,700
hard on you too.

295
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,100
What?

296
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,953
I will try to comfort her,

297
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,527
but I am not that good with words.

298
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,104
Next, a letter from the Sunno
Tribe that the exclusive rights to salt...

299
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,177
should be returned to the King.

300
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,783
Is that truly what you think, Lord Sa?

301
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,244
All members of the Five Tribe council...

302
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,250
have accumulated great wealth.

303
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,584
I believe there will be no
harm in your taking back...

304
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,154
the exclusive rights.

305
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,184
I think highly of your thoughts,

306
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,262
but that is for the Five
Tribe council to decide.

307
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,110
That is correct.

308
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,693
It should not take much discussion.

309
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,570
We could reach a decision right now.

310
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,790
Lord Jin.

311
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,060
Lord Jin.

312
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,690
Yes?

313
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,620
It is a good idea.

314
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,513
Of the five members of the council,

315
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,414
those who agree that the King
should have the exclusive rights to salt,

316
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,460
step forward.

317
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,700
Gochuga.

318
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,847
You are standing with those in favor.

319
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,440
I too...

320
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,060
am in favor of returning the
exclusive rights to sell salt...

321
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,670
to the crown.

322
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,090
I, Pyeonggang,

323
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,190
have something to tell the
King on behalf of the people.

324
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,350
The fees levied...

325
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,087
are but a small sum to those here.

326
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,114
But to the people, they are the
products of blood, sweat, and tears.

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,354
In order to build Jangan
Castle, it is unavoidable...

328
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,624
Why is it the people who
must bear the cost of that?

329
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,594
The nobles of the capital and
the leaders in the countryside.

330
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,994
If we levy the taxes on them,
we can certainly cover the cost.

331
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,160
The duty of building our country
does not lie on the people alone.

332
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,677
Enjoying all of the benefits...

333
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,543
and yet avoiding all responsibilities.

334
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,952
You should know that is
a shameful way to behave.

335
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,440
Princess.

336
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,130
I will be the first to pay.

337
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,124
I will pay in jewels and silver...

338
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,264
to support the construction
of Jangan Castle... No.

339
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,170
I am willing to give
everything for Goguryeo.

340
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,403
I support you a hundred times over.

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,347
If the Queen Mother had been alive...

342
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,944
I am sure she would
have said the same thing.

343
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,017
I too will follow the Princess.

344
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,057
Deciding the taxation in this country...

345
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,274
is not something that can
be easily done in a day or two.

346
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,263
- It is very... - Gochuga.

347
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,970
What do you think?

348
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,774
This new taxation policy
the Princess has provided...

349
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,784
is very solid and well thought out.

350
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,214
We should implement it quickly...

351
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,620
to ease the suffering of the people.

352
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,970
An ill wind will blow.

353
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,193
He is not someone to fold that easily.

354
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,067
Go Won Pyo will be sharpening his blade.

355
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,510
You are overly concerned.

356
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,764
The Princess is here,

357
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,494
and you have a heroic
son-in-law to protect you.

358
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,033
He could never point his blade at you.

359
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,507
I shall pick them off, one by one.

360
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,490
Those who defy you...

361
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,058
and those who leech off
Goguryeo as its leaders.

362
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,753
I will pick each one off turn by turn.

363
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Were you at the king's palace?

364
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,690
Yes.

365
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,504
I heard you got rid of
the taxes on the people...

366
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,043
for the construction of Jangan Castle.

367
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,174
Yes, I went to confer with
my father about that issue.

368
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,314
I bet the people will be
really happy about that,

369
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,264
though I am sure the
nobles will be displeased.

370
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,484
I am saying you did well,
though it was a difficult task.

371
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,340
Thank you.

372
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,580
Ga Jin.

373
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,294
I heard of a skilled fortune-teller...

374
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,204
and requested an impregnation ceremony.

375
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,074
I heard a talented fortune-teller
has set up shop in the city.

376
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,680
Shall I ask for you?

377
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,370
She knew all along.

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,370
Knew what?

379
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,140
Who did?

380
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,220
Jangbaek herb store.

381
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,370
What?

382
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,150
What a fool.

383
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,560
How could I have forgotten?

384
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,634
What is it? You can
leave the hard tasks to me.

385
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,397
It is all right. I can ask Jin.

386
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,390
Earlier...

387
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,973
I think he was a little hurt.

388
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,274
We overcame numerous
near-death experiences together.

389
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,960
What about Lady Gongson?

390
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,874
What is it you want to say?

391
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
Do not try so hard.

392
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,420
Do not worry too much
and do not work so hard.

393
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,593
Just do things one at a time.

394
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,593
Just do what you can take, one at a time.

395
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,593
Do you think I am having fun?

396
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,680
It is hard for me too.

397
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,034
It is all painful and
chaotic, but I cannot help it.

398
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,720
"It was unavoidable."

399
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,830
"I had to do so."

400
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,450
People always say that...

401
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,636
but there is nothing in this
world that is unavoidable.

402
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,183
I will go get some fresh air.

403
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,710
Dal.

404
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,300
I do see the stars faintly,

405
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,488
but the moon is so large that
a dragon could come from it.

406
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,900
A dragon?

407
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,053
So, is the moon white or red?

408
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,110
I do not know.

409
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,840
It does look whitish.

410
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,070
I must be the insane one.

411
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,764
I am here trying to read the
moon with a child the size of a twig.

412
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,837
What is wrong with being small?

413
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,167
All right, I will serve you properly.

414
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,548
Come over here. Pluck
out some of my gray hairs.

415
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,300
My goodness.

416
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,660
Do not worry about Dal.

417
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,050
He has been made a general,

418
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,490
and he has the most
beautiful Princess as his wife.

419
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,453
What is it that concerns you?

420
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,810
When you get old...

421
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,108
you start to get many worries
as much as you get wrinkles.

422
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,367
What is it that worries you?

423
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,637
Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.

424
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,280
What is it that they are fighting over?

425
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,630
What?

426
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,014
We are all of the same
blood, living on the same land.

427
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,784
The three kings could
just get together and say...

428
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,584
"Let us stop fighting and
be one country from now on."

429
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,457
That is all they have to do.

430
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,690
My goodness.

431
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,830
Everyone in the world, listen.

432
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,797
Zhuge Liang has been reincarnated.

433
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,133
Everyone, come watch and listen.

434
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,203
Otherwise, I will never...

435
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,040
be able to return to my hometown.

436
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,970
Weol...

437
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,990
Do you wish to return to your hometown?

438
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,510
Yes.

439
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,040
I see.

440
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,693
I am sure that day will come.

441
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,080
Dal and the Princess...

442
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,732
will work hard to make a
world where that is possible.

443
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,004
You must be catching a cold.

444
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,610
Let us hurry inside.

445
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,790
All right.

446
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,466
Shall I brew a warm cup of
scorched rice water for you?

447
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
That sounds nice.

448
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,100
The city is filled with praise for you
and your husband, Your Highness.

449
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,220
That is nonsense.

450
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,276
Whenever I faced an obstacle,
you were always of great help.

451
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,534
I should be the one
who is grateful to you...

452
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,864
since you trusted me,
despite my insignificance.

453
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,070
I called you here to
express my gratitude to you...

454
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,574
and because I have something
urgent to discuss with you.

455
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,940
Something urgent?

456
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,180
Do you remember?

457
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,234
When you were brought here
to the Hall of Convenience,

458
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,764
you confidently gulped
down a bowl of medicine...

459
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,570
to prove it was not poison.

460
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,604
While thinking about the favors
you have done for me so far,

461
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,970
I became curious.

462
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,484
Back then, you obeyed Go Won Pyo's orders.

463
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,757
At other times, you did me favors.

464
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,460
Whose side...

465
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,000
are you really on?

466
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,427
Why do you even have to ask?

467
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I am, of course, on your side.

468
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,164
Back then, I gave in to Gochuga's threat.

469
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,903
You had no choice. Is that what you mean?

470
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
I do know that. But what about this?

471
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,110
You knew who Du Jung Seo was all along.

472
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,570
Your Highness.

473
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,447
- If I had other intentions, why...
- Quiet.

474
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,610
You are the one who brought
Du Jung Seo into the palace.

475
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,268
You did not arrange it
because you did not know.

476
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,123
You brought him in knowing who he was.

477
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,297
- Your Highness. - Hae Mo Yong.

478
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,770
You cannot deceive me forever.

479
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,810
Tell me who you really are.

480
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,114
For the great cause of the three empires,

481
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,074
I want you to return to Goguryeo.

482
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,930
And...

483
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,140
kill...

484
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,290
Princess Pyeonggang.

485
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,820
I told her to.

486
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,020
What happened is simple.

487
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,704
I wanted her to win your trust.

488
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,654
So I found her weakness
and forced her into it.

489
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,990
It must have been a
tall order. You did well.

490
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,552
But neither of us knew about
the chief of Cheonjubang.

491
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,780
Master Go.

492
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,964
What else would you like to
know? I can tell you anything.

493
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,106
Do you believe you know
everything about Lady Hae?

494
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,177
I know more about her than you do.

495
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,220
She is the woman I love, and
there are no secrets between us.

496
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,770
Hey.

497
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,493
What do you think you are doing?

498
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,994
I rushed over because someone
heard voices coming from here.

499
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,880
It was you.

500
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,463
My Princess, what shall I do?

501
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
What do you mean?

502
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,406
These two displayed affections
in the sacred Hall of Convenience.

503
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,452
As the Head of Capital Defense,
shall I slash both of them?

504
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
You are out of line.

505
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,314
Do you dare to slay the
Head of Bodyguards?

506
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,920
Then let us fight with our ranks aside.

507
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,087
We will see who is the better swordsman.

508
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,650
Wait, Dal.

509
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,880
Lady Hae.

510
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,150
I do admire your talent,

511
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,542
but I should have known
better than to trust you.

512
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,677
This will be the last time I summon you.

513
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,490
My apologies.

514
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,024
Master Go, you may also
stop serving my father.

515
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,686
You do not have to pretend
to be loyal any longer.

516
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,794
His Majesty would not have
trusted me if I had only pretended.

517
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,690
I did have a sense of loyalty to him...

518
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,910
for a short while.

519
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,180
As I did to you.

520
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,430
Leave.

521
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,260
Enough of your rudeness.

522
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,020
I will be looking forward to our fight.

523
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,970
Sure.

524
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,310
Just you wait.

525
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,470
Let us go.

526
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,950
Something is going on.

527
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,577
- What? - Not only Master Go...

528
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,050
but also Go Won Pyo
may be involved in a plot.

529
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,600
I am sure of it.

530
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,670
Ga Jin.

531
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
Something does not feel right.

532
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,270
What is it?

533
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,490
Yeom Ga Jin.

534
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,724
Even if you do not
agonize day and night...

535
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,164
Goguryeo will not fall.

536
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,903
How can you be so relaxed?

537
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,420
You do not...

538
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,800
covet the throne, do you?

539
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,594
When you were little, you told me...

540
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,494
that even a woman could become the king.

541
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,350
No.

542
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
Never say such an impertinent thing again.

543
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,770
That is a relief.

544
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,744
Is something wrong?

545
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,744
You should have stayed out of it.

546
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,283
- Should I have remained quiet? - Yes.

547
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,314
Now that you have shown your hand
to the Princess, what shall you do?

548
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,854
You will lose His Majesty's
trust that you worked so hard for.

549
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,710
Still...

550
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,302
I think I won your heart.
So it was all worth it.

551
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,667
This is not the time for jokes.

552
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,770
I am the one...

553
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,437
who got Du Jung Seo out of prison.

554
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,360
How...

555
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,680
There is no turning back...

556
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,230
or hiding any longer.

557
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,930
Soon...

558
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,304
This palace will belong
to the great Family Go.

559
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,750
See this.

560
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,970
Is this...

561
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,310
what you want?

562
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,163
Or is it General Go's scheme?

563
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,010
What is the difference?

564
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,234
It is for the Gyeru Tribe all the same.

565
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,090
Still...

566
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,630
Commander.

567
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,030
Yes?

568
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,380
You would even risk
your life for our family.

569
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
I am well aware of it.

570
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,960
Much obliged.

571
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,012
Soon when the Gyeru Tribe
takes control of Goguryeo...

572
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,397
you will be taking even
more responsibility.

573
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,633
You can trust me, my lord.

574
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,690
General Go.

575
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,460
What is it?

576
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,344
Have you been getting close to
Lady Hae from the herb store lately?

577
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,550
Why do you ask?

578
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,684
I have an informant who tells me...

579
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,924
small things that happen in the capital.

580
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,322
According to him, Lady Hae
disappeared for a few days.

581
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,480
She did?

582
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,124
Rumor has it that...

583
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,650
she was taken to Silla and
barely escaped with her life.

584
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,234
I am doing a little
digging to make sure...

585
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,773
she does not become a nuisance to you.

586
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,607
I will have to ask around as well.

587
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,580
- I appreciate it. - My pleasure.

588
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,110
- Commander. - Yes.

589
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,893
This mission is of the utmost importance.

590
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,703
The Gyeru Tribe is being closely watched.

591
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,002
With their exclusive rights to
salt taken away and taxes raised,

592
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,144
they must be very unhappy.

593
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,050
They may even put
their grievance into action.

594
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,653
Watching Go Won Pyo's home is not enough.

595
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,193
Watch his private soldiers as well.

596
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,850
Are you saying...

597
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,210
he may rise in revolt?

598
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,100
Even if he does not, his son may.

599
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,700
Keep a close eye.

600
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,960
Yes.

601
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,700
HWANGJU FORTRESS

602
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,054
Look who it is. Is it not the Commander.

603
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,624
It has been a long time, my lord.

604
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,702
It must have been a long
journey. Please come in.

605
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,470
That was close.

606
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,500
This time, you try.

607
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,850
Stop being so sad.

608
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,114
You should keep your chin up,
especially in situations like this.

609
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,080
Stop crying!

610
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,770
I did not know there was a
nice archery field like this here.

611
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,493
Archery is fun. Why are you sniffling?

612
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,664
Your Highness, would you
like to make a bet with me?

613
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,790
A bet?

614
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,770
If I manage to split your
arrow within three tries,

615
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,574
you will never cry again.

616
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,480
You are going to hit my
arrow using your own?

617
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,084
How is that even possible?

618
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,098
If I lose, I will stand on
my head all day long.

619
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,200
- Fine! - That is absurd.

620
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,840
What was that? You are so bad at it.

621
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,590
That was a practice shot.

622
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,580
What?

623
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,780
Wow! That is amazing.

624
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,190
How did he do this?

625
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,204
How did you train in archery?

626
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,874
I did not train at all.

627
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,804
I only learned by watching
over other's shoulders.

628
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,660
Really?

629
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,900
Won! Hurry over!

630
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,870
Okay.

631
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,714
Thanks to you, Geon
Mu is feeling much better.

632
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
Thank you, Dal.

633
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,140
"Dal"?

634
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,263
That is no problem! We are all family,

635
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,820
Won!

636
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,534
He is not the type to give in so easily.

637
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,140
Go Won Pyo must be waiting for revenge.

638
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,860
I am here, but you did not even notice.

639
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,757
- Did you just get here? - Yes.

640
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,720
What is wrong?

641
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,970
I went to the residence
of the Sunno Tribe.

642
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,373
I wanted to make up with Jin,

643
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,334
but I could not even see her.

644
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,020
Do not be so impatient.

645
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,247
You told me that she
is your special friend.

646
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,070
Okay.

647
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,690
It must be heavy.

648
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,867
I should quit my post
if I feel it is heavy.

649
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,850
What is it?

650
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,874
Instead of being the head
of capital defense today,

651
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,544
let us just hang out.

652
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,150
- What? - Follow me.

653
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,130
What? Wait!

654
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,200
Hey.

655
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,154
Lady Gongson will be worried
if she finds Magnolia Hall empty.

656
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,893
Come on! Do not be scared.

657
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,524
I want to have snacks
and buy some accessories.

658
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,554
But the ones in the
marketplace are of low quality.

659
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,424
You must own something
much better than them.

660
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,364
There is not one you bought for me.

661
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,834
Why are you yelling?

662
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,690
Follow me.

663
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,530
Come take a look!

664
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,650
Please come take a look!

665
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,590
Welcome.

666
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,200
Come by some arrowroot!

667
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,093
- Wow, is this arrowroot? - Yes.

668
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,484
Where did you get this? It is so big.

669
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,484
From deep in the mountain.

670
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,498
- Look, this is arrowroot!
- It is a bellflower!

671
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,367
- It is? - Hurry and follow me!

672
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,340
Wait a minute.

673
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,850
It is a rare herb, so it is rather pricey.

674
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,570
Thank Lady Hae for me.

675
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,670
Sure.

676
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,938
Please make sure to keep
us updated on the King.

677
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,267
- How is this one? - It is pretty.

678
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,494
- How about this one?
- That one is pretty too.

679
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,564
What was that? Do you
find everything pretty?

680
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,934
You should pick one for me.

681
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,007
Let me see. What will suit you?

682
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,730
How about this one?

683
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,780
Ga Jin.

684
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,600
Sorry.

685
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,670
Let us just pick one.

686
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,070
You have survived.

687
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,580
Now I get it.

688
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,796
You are on the same side as
Go Geon of the Gyeru Tribe.

689
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,104
You two are forming a scheme, I see.

690
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,644
You are the one who
went back on your promise.

691
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,384
You attacked the King
without discussing with me.

692
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,257
And you even tried to
harm Crown Prince Won.

693
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,210
So what?

694
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,027
There must be a reason why you saved me.

695
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,170
I will let you go.

696
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,456
And I will also give you a
chance to take your revenge.

697
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,550
Gather your followers...

698
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,820
and assassinate the King.

699
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,304
You want me to plot conspiracy?

700
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,350
Do not worry.

701
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,734
The Gyeru Tribe will
take care of the rest...

702
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,504
once you assassinate the King.

703
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,190
I will punish the King,

704
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,256
and you will justify your conduct
of dominating the kingdom?

705
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,784
I will support you with all the
weapons and funds you need.

706
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,470
What about afterward?

707
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,730
If I become useless,

708
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,780
you are bound to kill me.

709
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
I am sure there is
nothing for you to lose.

710
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,210
Hey. If it were not for me,

711
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,190
you would have died...

712
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,147
without ever getting your revenge.

713
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,450
So what will you do?

714
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,124
This will spread all over your body.

715
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,074
10 days later, it will
mess up your blood flow.

716
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,434
If you do not wish to
die by vomiting blood,

717
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,504
you will have to get an antidote from me.

718
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,190
Without your petty game,

719
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,560
I will not run anyway.

720
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,220
Then show me.

721
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,260
I do not wish...

722
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,450
to fight with you.

723
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:52,474
Tara Jin, did you think you
will live after betraying us?

724
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,650
Stop it.

725
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,153
What does this mean again?

726
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,640
Did you forget already?

727
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,200
- What does this mean?
- I know what it means.

728
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,264
It is a token that says that
we are on the same side.

729
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,390
You are smart.

730
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,420
We are on the same side,

731
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
and we are married.

732
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,443
The Goguryeo you dream of,

733
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,643
the empire you want to build,

734
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,400
I will live there too.

735
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,283
So make your dream come true.

736
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,710
I...

737
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,620
only came here to become your sword.

738
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,583
Ga Jin is the King's daughter, after all.

739
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,194
What matters to her is
her father and Goguryeo.

740
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,623
But you are not even from Goguryeo,

741
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,987
and you lost your only brother.

742
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,584
That is all because of Ga Jin.

743
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,723
I fought with her as her friend.

744
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,780
You are only being used.

745
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,160
That is not true.

746
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,800
I am the one...

747
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,673
who raised and taught the pair of you.

748
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,686
Are you saying you value your
friendship more than my grace?

749
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,250
You and I do not belong to Goguryeo.

750
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,823
Remember the spirit of Cheonjubang.

751
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,310
HWANGJU FORTRESS

752
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,510
I am already very angry.

753
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,064
How could he make the governors...

754
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,670
pay more tax to win the people's favor?

755
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,567
The Princess and the King...

756
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,270
are both fools!

757
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,182
That is why Gochuga put
you on an important task.

758
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,044
Starting with Hwangju Fortress,

759
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,614
if governors of each
region oppose the proposal,

760
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,044
the Gyeru Tribe will
take care of the rest.

761
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,250
Go back and tell this to Gochuga.

762
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:37,254
I, Yang Chaek, will gladly
disobey the King's order!

763
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,263
Gochuga will highly praise...

764
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,010
your bravery.

765
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,450
I hope so.

766
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,150
HWANGJU FORTRESS

767
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,104
If Hwangju Fortress rises in revolt,

768
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,643
the nearby governors will join in too.

769
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,330
As soon as he does,

770
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,024
the soldiers of the
capital will be dispatched.

771
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,684
How will you take care of that?

772
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,054
I talked with General Nam,

773
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,784
and he already discussed it with
the officers under his command.

774
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,640
Well done.

775
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,340
If you pull this off,

776
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,867
I will place you on the throne.

777
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,860
Father.

778
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,180
I will step back and
support you from behind.

779
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,170
My Goguryeo...

780
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,854
will become a great nation
that has never existed before.

781
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,384
I will bring Silla and
Baekje to their knees,

782
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,070
and I will rule over...

783
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,794
the areas which Gwanggaeto
the Great governed and beyond...

784
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,600
under the flag of Goguryeo.

785
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,303
I must live a healthy and long life...

786
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,320
to see your Goguryeo.

787
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,320
What did you just say?

788
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,573
You and your brother wanted to go back...

789
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,244
to your country when you
were done being assassins.

790
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,717
To the plains where the Gokturks are.

791
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,600
So...

792
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,117
are you telling me I can go?

793
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,150
It is not for me to decide.

794
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,790
You should have done
however you wanted to,

795
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,124
but I naturally thought
you would stay by my side...

796
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,220
and help me.

797
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,997
I only thought about myself.

798
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,720
Ga Jin.

799
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,394
You must have had a
hard time after San left.

800
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,267
I have been too
inattentive, and I am sorry.

801
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,290
About the chief though...

802
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,544
Are you not worried about him
at all when he ran away like that?

803
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,817
I am sure he will show up one day.

804
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,560
I am waiting.

805
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,340
You are?

806
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,690
I should have killed him then.

807
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,330
I will make sure not
to lose him next time.

808
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,404
Why did she want to see
you so early in the morning?

809
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:39,610
Was it about the fight we
had with the Gyeru Tribe?

810
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,010
Why are you looking at me like that?

811
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,300
Pung Gae.

812
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,868
You are a great shot. Who
did you learn archery from?

813
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:19,500
Master Go.

814
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,284
I know my sister has
past affairs with him,

815
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,957
but please do not hate him so much, Dal.

816
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,676
We should have a match
among the three of us next time.

817
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,480
Why do you not try again?

818
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,670
Master Go deceived both you and Won.

819
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,637
Are you saying he was
abetted by Go Won Pyo?

820
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:48,534
He could have been, but he
could have acted on his own.

821
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,900
Those evil jerks.

822
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,847
I presume the Gyeru Tribe...

823
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,060
is scheming something.

824
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,140
Scheming something?

825
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,650
There is a spy...

826
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,784
planted by Gochuga who
is living in your chambers.

827
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,054
Are you talking about Head
Eunuch? I know about him.

828
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,210
Father.

829
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,694
I was in a fuddled state when I
was drunk on alcohol and drugs,

830
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,433
but now I can see clearly.

831
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,697
I know he is Go Won Pyo's servant.

832
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,737
But why are you keeping him next to you?

833
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,434
I am guessing he will
be useful to use as bait...

834
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,040
to catch Go Won Pyo.

835
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,024
Your Majesty, Governor
Yang of Hwangju Fortress...

836
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,297
raised a revolt with his soldiers.

837
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,330
What did you say?

838
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,677
YANG CHAEK, THE GOVERNOR
OF HWANGJU FORTRESS

839
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,760
- I will go, Your Majesty. - Dal.

840
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,954
It is not a matter for you to meddle in.

841
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,224
We have a separate
troop to subdue the traitors.

842
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,910
That is the only way...

843
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,163
the Princess will be at ease.

844
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,403
Dal, it does not have to be you.

845
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,040
Then who would else come forward?

846
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,890
I will go.

847
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,730
Trust me.

848
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,380
Please let me go.

849
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,227
Gochuga, are you out of your mind?

850
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,924
How could you plan a conspiracy?

851
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,530
It is not a conspiracy but a corollary.

852
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,564
I am only straightening out the things...

853
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,004
the King and the Princess did wrong.

854
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,910
Hwangju Fortress has
less than 2,000 soldiers.

855
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,554
The most they can come
up with is a mere 3,000.

856
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,444
By the time the King's troop reaches...

857
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,514
The King's troop is on our side.

858
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,284
- What?
- The commander who is in charge...

859
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,090
of suppressing the revolts is General Nam.

860
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,624
He promised that he will
not fight against them...

861
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,963
even if the King gave him an order.

862
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,180
Including General Nam,

863
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,284
the commanders under his
lead decided to follow my order.

864
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,047
Well done! Then I will be at ease.

865
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,377
Then what is your next plan?

866
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,787
If the other regions start to revolt,

867
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,487
I will honor their wishes
and raise an army.

868
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,654
I will invade the King's
chamber and bring him down.

869
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,634
- Lord Gochuga.
- We are in the middle of something.

870
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,680
Stay outside.

871
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,968
The King's son-in-law is leading
the troop to Hwangju Fortress.

872
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,260
What?

873
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,007
On Dal is leading the troop?

874
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,510
This is karma.

875
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,570
This is ill-fated karma.

876
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,584
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

877
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,854
I, Princess Pyeonggang,

878
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,484
will be so bold as to accept
the role of Head of Bodyguards.

879
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,623
I will become like Go Won Pyo...

880
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,794
if I can only take him down.

881
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,794
I am fighting for you, so you can...

882
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,024
Are you saying you became my sword?

883
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,294
You said you did all that for
me, but you went against my will.

884
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,500
- Face the reality! - He is dead.

885
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:54,304
If you want to save the Prince,
then be on the winning side.

886
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,434
The winning side?

887
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,896
I cannot just stand by and
watch my lady become evil...

888
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,360
like Go Won Pyo.

889
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,820
Your Majesty.

890
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,884
I will enter the palace
as his subject in daylight,

891
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,557
but I will become the King by nightfall.

892
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,370
I am sorry, Dal.
