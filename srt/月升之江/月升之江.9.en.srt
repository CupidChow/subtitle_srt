1
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:07,032
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,421
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,107
I would like to speak.

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,131
It is about the Princess' marriage.

5
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:17,130
You will never get your own way.

6
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:19,018
I am offering a chance.

7
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,854
A chance for you and your
offspring to save your lives.

8
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:25,602
They are looking for
the King's son-in-law.

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,288
The Princess will marry.

10
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,377
I will always be on
your side no matter what.

11
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:32,678
I cannot accept your feelings.

12
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,288
I must have her...

13
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,488
even if that means I have to use force.

14
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:47,248
EPISODE 9

15
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:50,418
What is that sound?

16
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:53,001
They are officially
announcing the royal wedding.

17
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:56,015
They are calling the
candidates into the palace.

18
00:00:58,937 --> 00:00:59,787
Princess.

19
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:02,858
Come here quick.

20
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,647
Look at this.
Are they not pretty?

21
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,808
What is all this?

22
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:10,748
What do you think they are?

23
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:12,752
We need to make a dress for your wedding.

24
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:13,951
Not just a wedding dress.

25
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,791
From head to toe, you will
need so many ornaments.

26
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:19,391
They have not yet
selected her husband-to-be.

27
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:22,597
Why would you already...
How dare you to interrupt?

28
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:27,698
I will not marry.

29
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,048
Stop being so childish.

30
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:33,272
The King gave the command,

31
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:35,602
and the Five Tribe council decided on it.

32
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:39,341
Do you not know this is a joy for
the palace as well as the people?

33
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:42,147
The wedding where the bride is bartered...

34
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,098
is not a joyous occasion.

35
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,208
Princess.

36
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:49,697
How dare she?

37
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,631
She has such an odd temperament.

38
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,518
What now?

39
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:02,045
Where could she go other
than to see her father?

40
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:04,958
Princess.

41
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,921
Many young men of noble birth...

42
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:22,060
have applied to be your husband.

43
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,394
The King is greatly blessed.

44
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:28,257
That means your influence is even greater.

45
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,102
The influence that made
this preposterous marriage...

46
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,228
a possibility.

47
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,877
You have everything in the world.

48
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,118
What more do you want?

49
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,918
Tying me down with marriage...

50
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,144
will not benefit you at all.

51
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,838
This is not for me.

52
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,055
The marriage is for you, Princess.

53
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:04,028
If you keep lashing out
with stupidity and bravado,

54
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:05,628
you might...

55
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:10,880
follow in your mother's
footsteps, and we cannot have that.

56
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,240
If your mother had acted
appropriately for her status,

57
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:21,611
she would not have died the way she did.

58
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:22,897
Shut your mouth.

59
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:26,054
How dare you mention my mother?

60
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,660
We do not need any more...

61
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:32,064
misfortune in the royal family.

62
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,101
The King saw my intentions...

63
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,730
and allowed your marriage.

64
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,331
A man crazed by jealousy...

65
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,404
killed his own wife and people.

66
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:20,544
Does he deserve to sit up here?

67
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:31,007
Father.

68
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,657
Did Go Won Pyo threaten you...

69
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,960
into agreeing to my marriage?

70
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,565
Do you fear his weapons that much?

71
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:44,718
Why?

72
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:46,778
You are King.

73
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:51,911
I had a dream every night.

74
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,681
A dream in which you and your mother die.

75
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:03,932
A nightmare in which my
people are slaughtered.

76
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,495
I committed those dreadful deeds myself.

77
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,858
How can I avoid punishment?

78
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,001
When you returned to the palace,

79
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,348
I was afraid.

80
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:31,028
It felt as if my past wrongdoings
had come back to life.

81
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,597
And I was also pleased.

82
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:36,837
Your mother...

83
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,755
had given me a chance to atone.

84
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,174
If they had known how you felt,

85
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,115
the Sunno Tribe migrants
would also rejoice.

86
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,337
However...

87
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,808
Before being the King,

88
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,325
I am but a powerless father.

89
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:03,518
I wanted to...

90
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,987
do whatever I could to protect
you and the Crown Prince.

91
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,017
So...

92
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,287
is that what happened?

93
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,298
Did Go Won Pyo...

94
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,544
threaten you with our lives?

95
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,167
I am sorry.

96
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,737
I did all that I could,

97
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:39,568
and yet I could not prevent your marriage.

98
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:46,717
Princess.

99
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,837
Will you forgive me?

100
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:56,428
Father.

101
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,572
The herb gatherer is gone,

102
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:57,311
and a young noble is here.

103
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,208
Your clothes...

104
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:02,074
did more than just change your looks.

105
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,660
Mok Tae Seon, a silk
merchant from Jami Province.

106
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,461
I just have to say I am his son?

107
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,997
Creating a fake identity is not all.

108
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:21,492
You will be questioned to see
if you studied all the classics.

109
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,992
When given a theme,

110
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,798
you must also write a poem.

111
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,332
I do not need to do that.

112
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,738
Do you truly think that is possible?

113
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,308
Even if you apply as a candidate,

114
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,648
General Go will end up
marrying the Princess.

115
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,097
That will not happen.

116
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:48,687
I cannot let Ga Jin be
forced into a marriage.

117
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,417
We feel the same.

118
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,778
You are in love?

119
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,358
Fate.

120
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:05,311
She and I are destined to be together.

121
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:08,751
So I cannot let her marry.

122
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,184
I will do whatever it takes.

123
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:28,531
They turned us into traitors
so they could get rid of us.

124
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:29,577
I was a fool.

125
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,574
I underestimated Go Won Pyo.

126
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:37,187
For Father.

127
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,948
And for Ga Jin.

128
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:47,128
Go Won Pyo.

129
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,224
I will kill you and die myself.

130
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,684
Read the theme for the
poem in the envelope.

131
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:41,401
I heard that General Go did not apply.

132
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,541
Does that mean we have a chance?

133
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:46,502
You are such a fool.
Do you think your father or mine...

134
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:49,452
sent us with hopes to
become the King's in-law?

135
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:52,311
It is what the Five Tribe
council commanded.

136
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,997
What do you mean by that?

137
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:58,181
They will fail all of us and when
they think there is no one worthy,

138
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,921
they will recommend General
Go as if there is no substitute.

139
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,992
If his eldest son were to
enter the selection process,

140
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,722
how would Gochuga manage to judge fairly?

141
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:08,992
Darn it. I am here to stand
in the background, then.

142
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:13,338
Let us go and get drunk
with some girls after this.

143
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,358
Next.

144
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:31,547
Here she is.

145
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,290
I am here at your command.

146
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:37,507
Welcome.

147
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,291
I called her because...

148
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,632
she deals in herbs and
also rare accessories.

149
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,705
Hey.
It was my idea to call her.

150
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,697
Do you feel better?

151
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,321
Both the Princess and
Crown Prince act as they wish.

152
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:07,127
No one knows how stressful that is for me.

153
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,495
I just hope my son has
an uneventful future.

154
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:14,661
I heard a talented fortune-teller
has set up shop in the city.

155
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,267
Shall I ask for you?

156
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:20,138
Fortune-telling?
I have so many questions too.

157
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,037
Where is he?

158
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,457
I brought some
accessories that will suit you.

159
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:44,264
Pick a few later.
No, thank you.

160
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:49,525
I will say this because I
agreed to not keep secrets.

161
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,501
I was unable to do as you asked.

162
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,188
That young man.
On Dal.

163
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:04,230
The more I get to know him,
the more intriguing he becomes.

164
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:05,848
What about Dal?

165
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:08,280
He will be in the palace about now.

166
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,208
Next.

167
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:22,488
Oh!

168
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,034
You look handsome and manly.

169
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,958
Take a seat.
Thank you.

170
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:31,988
Let me see.

171
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:35,748
Your family does not
live within the Capital.

172
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,048
You are from Jami Province.

173
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:41,248
That is so.
Your father is Mok Tae Seon.

174
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,817
Mok Tae Seon?
I have heard that name.

175
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,761
Is he not a merchant who sells silk...

176
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:51,317
and cotton goods?

177
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,517
What?

178
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:57,197
We are here to select
the King's son-in-law...

179
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,401
and a merchant's son applied?

180
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,407
Do not say more than you need.

181
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:05,793
A theme for a poem is in the envelope.
Write something.

182
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:08,418
I will do that.

183
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:15,215
Lord Hae, it is such a pity.

184
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,387
Do you not think so?

185
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:23,901
A merchant's son applied.
That looks bad on us.

186
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:42,828
Stop.

187
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,527
What is it?
He hid his identity...

188
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,418
to sneak into the palace.

189
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,838
He hid his identity?

190
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,474
Then is he not Mok Tae Seon's son?

191
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,347
That is true.

192
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:16,598
Oh, dear...

193
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,978
Then who are you?

194
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:29,448
Dal.

195
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,858
"Dal"?
"Dal"?

196
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,262
I heard something disgraceful happened...

197
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,201
during the selection process.

198
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,057
What was that?

199
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,108
Tell me immediately.

200
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,884
I wished to protect my husband.

201
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,387
What?
"Husband"?

202
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,765
What did you say? "Husband"?

203
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,934
This man here is my husband.

204
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,628
What?
Her husband?

205
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:50,210
They are married?
This is unbelievable.

206
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:51,948
How could this be?

207
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,568
The Princess is married?

208
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,325
It is too early to be dreaming.

209
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,338
I am not making this up.

210
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,098
A eunuch rushing from the hall told me.

211
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:13,462
The Princess appeared
with a young man at her side...

212
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:16,068
and announced they are already married.

213
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,402
That is nonsense.

214
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,341
Then go to the hall yourself.

215
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,340
It was turned upside-down.

216
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:23,858
What...

217
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,168
This is not your fortune.

218
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,850
Whose fate is it you wish to learn of?

219
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:41,721
You really are as good as rumours say.

220
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,761
You have such great skill,

221
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:47,192
so what did you do before
you came to the Capital?

222
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,192
She is leaving.

223
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,654
I would like to hear my
fortune before I am thrown out.

224
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,468
Did you see that person's future?

225
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:59,540
Corpses are stacked as high as mountains,

226
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,080
and blood flows like a river.

227
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,320
Starved wild dogs gather from all around,

228
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,320
and there is nowhere to flee.

229
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,658
This karma can only
be atoned for with death.

230
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,188
What a pity.

231
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,897
A fate that is unavoidable.

232
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:21,307
A fate that is cursed.

233
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,904
When I had lost my
memory and was wandering,

234
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,747
he showed me the way...

235
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:30,178
and allowed me to rely on him.

236
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:33,628
His unchanging heart...

237
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:35,838
is what moved me.

238
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,696
You asked me to release
a young man from prison.

239
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,988
You said he had saved
your life many times.

240
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,227
Was that this man?

241
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:50,348
Yes.

242
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,297
At the time, you clearly
said he was a friend.

243
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:58,038
And yet now you say he is your husband.

244
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,487
Are you insulting me?

245
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,478
Father.
It is not like that.

246
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,488
Shut your mouth.

247
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:08,977
Please calm down.

248
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:12,762
I believe the Princess is
scheming to avoid her marriage.

249
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,237
Yes.

250
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,797
You are already married?

251
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:21,055
That is very hard to
believe, Your Highness.

252
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:28,961
How else do we say what has been done?

253
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,108
What?
How dare you?

254
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:32,818
I am...

255
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,287
the Princess' husband.

256
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,412
You are out of your mind!

257
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,371
How dare you raise your voice here?

258
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:46,769
You sneaked into the palace
under an assumed identity!

259
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,727
That is very true.

260
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,722
We cannot accept a
man of unclear identity...

261
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:54,061
and status as the Princess' spouse.

262
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,167
Your Majesty.

263
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,231
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

264
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:03,878
What is your name?

265
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:17,257
My father was Daemodal...

266
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:19,768
and a Widudehyeong.

267
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,051
WIDUDEHYEONG: A 5TH GRADE RANK

268
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:25,345
I am the son of General On Hyeop,
the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

269
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:27,767
My name is On Dal.

270
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,358
On Hyeop's son?

271
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:31,177
What?

272
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,118
Long time no see, Hyeop.

273
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,737
If you admit that you are a traitor,

274
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,244
I will spare the lives of everyone else.

275
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,787
My goodness.

276
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:09,395
You are actually the son of On Hyeop?

277
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,278
That is true.

278
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:14,788
Yes.

279
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:17,557
I remember that gaze.

280
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,778
You take after your father.

281
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,527
On Hyeop...

282
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,348
was beheaded for committing treason.

283
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,537
The reason his family...

284
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,952
and the remaining people of the tribe...

285
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,858
were allowed to live
was by the King's grace.

286
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:36,697
He forgot about all that...

287
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:39,798
and entered the palace, causing this fuss.

288
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,861
He must be severely punished!

289
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,677
That is correct.

290
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,738
Please punish him severely.

291
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,588
Punish him?

292
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,571
They may have married in secret,

293
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,710
but he is the Princess' husband.

294
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,175
Must he be dealt a severe penalty?

295
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:59,182
Your Majesty. You must not do
anything to harm your authority.

296
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:02,388
Having a royal marry
someone from that bloodline...

297
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:05,318
already harms the royal
household's authority!

298
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:06,468
Your Majesty.

299
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,891
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

300
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,147
Silence!

301
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:31,988
Your Majesty.

302
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:33,528
Your Majesty.

303
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:35,647
My goodness.
What is happening?

304
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:39,922
You did nothing but cause
trouble since you returned,

305
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,522
and you ended up bringing
disgrace on your father.

306
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,208
Father.
Shut your mouth!

307
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,897
You are no longer my daughter.

308
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:49,570
Leave the palace immediately.

309
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:56,801
I will accept any punishment.
The Princess...

310
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,407
Did you not hear me?

311
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:02,214
I no longer have a daughter.

312
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:07,067
The next time I see you,

313
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:11,491
I will behead you both on the spot.

314
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:06,348
Are you all right?

315
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:49,407
My lady.

316
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,658
The Princess was
ordered to leave the palace.

317
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:55,928
She must leave?

318
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,358
I am sorry, Nanny.

319
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,517
I am leaving after
causing you much distress.

320
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,687
You are not married.

321
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:28,261
Tell the King that you lied.
Please?

322
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,391
Do you not believe it either?

323
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:36,467
I cared for you even
before you could murmur.

324
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,170
Do you think I do not see through you?

325
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:45,671
I would rather leave the palace with you.

326
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:48,742
I will look after you and...

327
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:51,081
No.
You must protect my brother Won.

328
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,754
You are the only person I can entrust...

329
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,237
his safety.

330
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:02,908
Oh, dear...

331
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:29,515
Are you the man my sister married?

332
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:31,237
Oh, the Crown Prince?

333
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:40,968
Crown Prince.

334
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:43,878
Are you really leaving?

335
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,678
Leaving me on my own?

336
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,547
Father is so furious.

337
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,937
I have no choice.

338
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,347
You must beg.

339
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,858
Ask him to forgive you.

340
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,678
Beg to let him allow you to stay.

341
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,298
If you leave again,

342
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:00,367
what do I do alone?

343
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,984
You might never be
able to return this time.

344
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,247
I will return.

345
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,761
For you and  Father, I will come back.

346
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,104
You and Father both.
I hate you.

347
00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:24,237
I hate you all.

348
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,258
Do not say that.

349
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,478
Father is trying to save my life.

350
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:35,747
This is the only way I can
avoid the royal wedding.

351
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:40,217
Father gave the order
but he is crying inside.

352
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:46,557
The Princess came to say goodbye.

353
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,777
Are you out of your mind?

354
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,868
There is no princess in this family.

355
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:02,308
You must leave without seeing your father.

356
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:04,997
Father.

357
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,817
Do you hear me?

358
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,967
I am leaving the palace.

359
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:19,233
I wish more than anything
to remain here with you,

360
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:23,233
but accepting your
command is also my filial duty.

361
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,598
So I shall leave.

362
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,457
Until now,

363
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:34,148
I did nothing but cause you concern.

364
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,987
Please forgive me.

365
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,097
Do not worry!

366
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:47,654
I will protect the Princess.

367
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,167
You have made a very difficult decision.

368
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,207
Since the Princess has left,

369
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,602
the palace will finally find peace.

370
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,789
Are you happy about that?

371
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,139
Of course not.

372
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,494
I only wish for peace
and safety in the palace.

373
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,609
If you have any regrets,

374
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,130
you can always tell the
Princess to come back.

375
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:09,725
How could he kick you out like
this when you are a princess?

376
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,249
He is so mean.
He did not even see you out.

377
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,400
Dal.

378
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,926
I need to stop by somewhere.

379
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:20,679
Where?

380
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,693
I will be right back, so you should
go ahead first and wait there.

381
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,094
Let us meet at the entrance
of Mungyeongsaejae.

382
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,323
You are going alone?
Let me tag along.

383
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,369
Do not worry.

384
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:31,306
From now on, we will always be together.

385
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,847
Make sure to come back fast!

386
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,653
I was surprised when I heard
that you are already married.

387
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,553
And you had to be kicked out
of the palace all of a sudden.

388
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,759
I do not know how to console you.

389
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,663
You need not say anything.

390
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,497
I am here to ask for your help.

391
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,433
It is a waste to take you as my enemy,

392
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,903
but I cannot fully trust
you to have you on my side.

393
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,242
But you came to see me nonetheless.

394
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,704
That must mean that
you want to put trust in me.

395
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,377
I also wanted to know why you helped me.

396
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,814
I know you are good at figures, and
you have nothing to gain from this.

397
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,287
Do you remember what I have told you?

398
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,039
I...

399
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,690
abhor Go Won Pyo.

400
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:33,599
I may not resent him as much as you do,

401
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:36,779
but I want to protect...

402
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:40,104
the tribe my father has
been keeping, the Sono Tribe,

403
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,273
even though I am his step-daughter.

404
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,959
Then you should help me.

405
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,408
Let us stop the Gyeru Tribe
from abusing their power,

406
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:54,489
and together we will
bring Go Won Pyo down.

407
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:57,722
I thought you would be grief stricken,

408
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,696
but I guess I do not know you enough.

409
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,040
Will you be on my side?

410
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,100
There is something I want to ask.

411
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,333
If you wish to proceed with your plan,

412
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,979
what will you do with General Go?

413
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,680
What if the two families of the Go's...

414
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,800
shed blood?

415
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,530
I trust Master Go.

416
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,753
He is different from his father.

417
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,373
I thought I would catch up
with you at the hill if I hurried.

418
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,579
But what are you doing here?
Where is the Princess?

419
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:00,982
She left first.
Is that so?

420
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,623
Then you must have been waiting for me.

421
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,553
There is nothing I want
to talk about with you.

422
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,839
That is a shame.

423
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,366
But my sword has a lot to ask you.

424
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,273
I will keep you updated regarding
the King and the Crown Prince.

425
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,679
I will secretly help with your plan,

426
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,529
so entrust it with me.

427
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,069
I appreciate it.

428
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,003
I feel like I have finally
found a friend in the Capital.

429
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,599
I am flattered, Your Highness.

430
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:56,673
If you go back to the
King and tell him the truth,

431
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,359
I will spare your life.

432
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,206
But if you keep pretending
to be the Princess' husband,

433
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,512
I will end your life here.

434
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,499
I pity you.

435
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,653
You do not want to
admit that you lost Ga Jin.

436
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,624
That must be why you want to behead me.

437
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,910
Shut your mouth.

438
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,010
Go ahead and kill me.

439
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,049
Even if I die,

440
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,633
I will never give Ga Jin to you.

441
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,169
All right then.

442
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,840
I cannot waste my sword to
kill someone as lowly as you.

443
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:51,029
I will end your life
with my trick instead.

444
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,432
I think I have started to like you.

445
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,569
Get up.

446
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,169
How dare you...

447
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:03,102
come at a general of Goguryeo...

448
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,240
with the skills you gained from
collecting herbs and hunting?

449
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,712
Do not act up and come at me.

450
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:18,152
All right then.
I will end your life here.

451
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,760
Get this!
Stop it!

452
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,219
Stop it, Dal.

453
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,875
There is something I need
to talk about with Master Go.

454
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,310
Do not dare to run away!

455
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:08,909
It is over, Master Go.

456
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,694
The royal wedding and
the arranged marriage...

457
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,740
are all over.

458
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,103
Let us go.
What do you mean it is over?

459
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,177
What do you mean it is over?

460
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,219
Did you ever give me a chance to start?

461
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
It has been eight years.

462
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,160
No, it has been longer than that.

463
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,073
I have been longing and...

464
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,819
waiting for you.

465
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,390
I have missed you a lot.

466
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,689
But why did you...

467
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:00,379
tell me to give up before
I even had a chance?

468
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,029
Why?
Why did you?

469
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,556
It is not something we started.

470
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:11,059
Our fates have been twisted for so long...

471
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,037
that neither of us can untangle them.

472
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,934
I will untangle them.

473
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,840
I will remove anything
that comes between us!

474
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,059
So please...
Master Go!

475
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:28,169
It is all over now.

476
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,249
I need to leave now.

477
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,010
I am sorry, Master Go.

478
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:22,694
The Princess of Goguryeo,
Princess Pyeonggang,

479
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,233
was kicked out because she
incited the wrath of the King.

480
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,834
Since the arranged
marriage came to a fail,

481
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,616
I will write to you again once
I find out what Go Won Pyo...

482
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,590
cooks up for a scheme.

483
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,210
General Go!

484
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,250
General Go!
What happened?

485
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,480
Bring me some medicines.

486
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,810
I cannot go back to
the palace in this state.

487
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,290
General Go!

488
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,600
What will you tell the
people of Ghost Valley?

489
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:26,769
Do not worry.

490
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,263
I will tell them that this all happened...

491
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:34,301
because of the royal wedding,
and that our marriage is not true.

492
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,520
What if they find out?

493
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,790
What?

494
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,760
People from the Castle...

495
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:42,713
might come and spy on us to
see if we are a married couple.

496
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,383
What will you do if they find
out we are not a real couple?

497
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,056
Hey, then we can pretend to be living...

498
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,299
Should we live together?

499
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,827
This is about us, not anyone else.

500
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,010
I know.

501
00:40:58,629 --> 00:41:01,229
I am your husband, and you are my wife.

502
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,039
What is he saying?

503
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,300
Ga Jin.
What?

504
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,240
Let us do that.

505
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,210
We can tell the villagers
that we got married.

506
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,423
That way, people from the
Castle will not be able to find out.

507
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,554
But this does not
count as a real marriage.

508
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,460
Why not?
Am I not good enough as your husband?

509
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,940
Darn you!

510
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,237
It does not matter if it is real or not.

511
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,007
As long as I can be with you...

512
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,590
and protect you.

513
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:24,559
My father was Daemodal...

514
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,039
and a Widudehyeong.

515
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,954
I am the son of General On Hyeop,
the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

516
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,400
My name is On Dal.

517
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,280
On Hyeop,

518
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,667
you are tormenting me
even after your death?

519
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,439
I knew this would happen!

520
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,454
So the rumour about the Princess
being kicked out of the palace...

521
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,500
must be true!

522
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,664
I guess so.
You just found that out?

523
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,934
Did she really get married
to the son of a merchant?

524
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,540
Are you kidding me?
I hear he is a fool.

525
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,569
I hear he is a total idiot.

526
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,783
I have never heard of that.
My gosh.

527
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:32,112
That must be why the King was infuriated.

528
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,414
It is certain that the royal
wedding has been cancelled.

529
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,883
I think she was kicked
out of the palace last night,

530
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:40,924
but I have not found out her whereabouts.

531
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,386
She must have gone to the
village of the herb gatherer.

532
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,794
Then the guy she got married to...

533
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,480
Ga Jin is helping me.

534
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:51,989
Sorry?

535
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,804
We would have
definitely run into Ga Jin...

536
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,610
if we went into the palace.

537
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,409
She left at the right time.

538
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:01,529
Should I still tail her?

539
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,620
Leave her be.

540
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,319
When we see full moons several times...

541
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,419
and when the stars
shine in different places,

542
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,720
she will come back herself.

543
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,090
General Go, are you up?

544
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:41,082
How did you bring me here?

545
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,029
You came to me yourself.

546
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:46,239
I did?

547
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:54,069
Take the medicine.

548
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,100
It will soothe your nausea.

549
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,810
Do not be worried.
There is no poison inside.

550
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,013
Do you not think you
need to pour me a glass...

551
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,686
since I have kicked out my own daughter?

552
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,699
Here.
Let us get drunk.

553
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:24,959
The Princess must have gone to...

554
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,367
the village of the Sunno Tribe.

555
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,769
Well, I do not wish to know...

556
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,220
where she is staying.

557
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,430
Why not?

558
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,880
Were you not planning to...

559
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:43,973
bring back the Sunno Tribe
into the Five Tribe council...

560
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,419
up until recently?

561
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,654
You did not eliminate
the source of trouble.

562
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,260
That is why you are facing trouble now.

563
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,564
Who knew the spouse of the Princess...

564
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,250
was the son of On Hyeop?

565
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:09,097
You need to put out the
ember even if it is too late.

566
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,300
I remember it.

567
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:18,477
You and General On studied under
the same teacher as young men.

568
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,244
Although you were older than him,

569
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,514
I heard General On was
more skilled in martial arts.

570
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,614
On top of that, he was beloved
and trusted by the people.

571
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,599
He must have upset you in many ways.

572
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:34,219
However,

573
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,600
he was beheaded for committing treason.

574
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,042
You were the one who ordered it.

575
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,749
My sins in this world
run deep and are heavy.

576
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,179
That is why I called you
here today to ask for a favour.

577
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,639
I have disowned my only daughter.

578
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,650
And I only have two sons.

579
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,373
And if you try to use my sons...

580
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:22,889
to threaten me again,

581
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,620
you must kill me with this arrow first.

582
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,032
I will pay for my sins in death.

583
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,880
However, you and your family
will also be in a pool of blood.

584
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,349
All right. Okay. Let us drink.

585
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:57,969
Here.

586
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,730
You can stay a bit
longer to gather yourself.

587
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:13,964
Vicious rumours will spread if
I, the eldest of the Gyeru Tribe,

588
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,464
was found in the room of
the daughter of the Sono Tribe.

589
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,414
I was not aware that
rumours had sway over you.

590
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:22,403
I will send someone
to pay for the medicine.

591
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:23,289
General Go.

592
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:28,942
You must take care of your mind and body.

593
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:32,683
How could you bring back the
fate that had already been lost?

594
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:33,969
Know your place.

595
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,353
The Princess lied about her marriage.

596
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,492
There may be a piece of truth...

597
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,720
in that lie.

598
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,049
I can carve it out...

599
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,837
whether it is the truth or not.

600
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,907
Mother, you will hurt yourself.

601
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,100
You ungrateful son.

602
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,909
You little brat.
Do you wish to see me die?

603
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,629
My goodness.
You brat!

604
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:42,913
Because of you, I could
neither sleep nor eat.

605
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:45,383
I could have died, worrying about you!

606
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:46,829
Did you know that?

607
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,653
My gosh.
This hurts!

608
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,659
You may kill me at this point.

609
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,410
Come here.

610
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,910
Are you all right?

611
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:02,376
Gosh, do not worry.
I am all right.

612
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,912
Goodness.
You troublemaker.

613
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,617
Who is there?
Who did you bring?

614
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:18,209
Have you been well?

615
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,039
I came back with Ga Jin.

616
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,130
Ridiculous.
How can that be?

617
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,637
You said she was a princess.

618
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:32,569
She should be in the palace.
Why is she here?

619
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,103
It just happened.

620
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:36,642
So tell me how on earth that happened.

621
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:39,860
Well...

622
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:41,389
Let me tell her.

623
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,298
I hope this will not come
as a big shock to you.

624
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,470
Actually, Dal and I...

625
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,520
are married.

626
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,940
What?
You are what?

627
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:02,599
We are married.

628
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:06,903
I cannot understand what you just told me.

629
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:08,642
So who is married to whom?

630
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,877
So Ga Jin and I are married.

631
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
I am her husband.
She, my wife.

632
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,930
What...
What on earth...

633
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:27,403
You punk!
How dare you tease your blind mother!

634
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,379
Mother, it is true.

635
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,410
I do not want to hear it.

636
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:34,019
Gosh.

637
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,650
He is back!

638
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:43,319
He is back!

639
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:46,769
He came back!
Hey!

640
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,029
He is back!

641
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,830
Dal is back now.

642
00:51:55,189 --> 00:51:56,789
My gosh, he is back?

643
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,020
But why are you out of breath?

644
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,626
But he did not come back alone.
He brought Ga Jin.

645
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:06,966
No.
He came back with the Princess!

646
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,064
What? The Princess? What?

647
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,470
Hey. My Ga Jin is back?
Are you sure?

648
00:52:14,169 --> 00:52:16,236
She is back.
But the thing is...

649
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,813
Come on, tell us.
You are making me dizzy.

650
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,880
They are married.
Ga Jin and Dal got married!

651
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,970
Married?
They are married.

652
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:29,849
Married?
Really?

653
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:34,359
What is going on?
Dal got married?

654
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,580
Ga Jin.

655
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,009
Ga Jin.

656
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:45,077
My gosh. I thought I would
never be able to see her again.

657
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,449
Mother, open up.

658
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,274
I get that you are furious.

659
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,443
But at least hear our side of the story.

660
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:59,777
Mother! You are not going
to see your son ever again?

661
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,370
Dal.

662
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,282
We should give her some time.

663
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,920
She must be shocked.

664
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,449
Gosh.

665
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:35,751
They must be scared
because you are the Princess.

666
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:41,526
Thank you for taking
good care of my father.

667
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:49,666
But I am not here as the Princess.

668
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,820
Then, what are you?

669
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,473
Are you really Dal's wife?

670
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,259
Yes.

671
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:06,599
I am Ga Jin's husband.

672
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,590
That is true!
They got married!

673
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:18,692
Gosh.
What a way to shock all of us.

674
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,927
Did you spend your first night together?

675
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:23,690
Gosh.
Goodness!

676
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,670
What did I tell you?

677
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:29,813
I told you these two
were fated to be together!

678
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:34,129
Congratulations.

679
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:47,509
Father.

680
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,430
It is your son.

681
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,820
I came with Ga Jin.

682
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,450
You remember her, right?

683
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,395
General On, I am indebted
to Dal and the Sunno Tribe...

684
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:02,819
once again.

685
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,807
Please be generous and watch over us.

686
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,387
She is your daughter-in-law.

687
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,800
That is true.

688
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,920
Come on.

689
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,970
The Chief is here.
Do not make him stand here.

690
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:35,860
Come on.

691
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,804
No matter how it happened,
this is a happy occasion.

692
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:44,316
Please accept them
with your generous heart.

693
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,014
Please think about the kids
who must have been through a lot.

694
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,700
You do not know anything.

695
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,254
They are facing a long
road of trouble and pain now.

696
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,600
Why did they...
Gosh.

697
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,046
Are you telling me that you
lied to avoid the royal wedding?

698
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,764
What choice did we have?

699
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,842
Ga Jin was about to get
married without this lie.

700
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,443
The three of us knew something was up.

701
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:15,103
When we saw you at Pyeongyang Castle,

702
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:16,714
you did not seem to be engaged.

703
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,400
We cannot lie to you.

704
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,812
But you must keep this a secret.

705
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:25,026
If this gets out, it will put
Ghost Valley and us in danger.

706
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:29,153
I heard you spend your first
night at the bride's house.

707
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,554
Yeom Deuk was preparing
the blankets for you.

708
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,410
What?

709
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,380
Gosh.
Hey!

710
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:43,869
Gosh.
Oh, my.

711
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:46,909
Look at them!
What are they doing?

712
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,454
My gosh. What are you doing?
That is so vulgar!

713
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,000
Get out of here!
Go!

714
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:55,189
Look at them!
Leave already!

715
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,559
Hey.
Let me crash at your place tonight.

716
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,853
Of course.
Let me sleep over there.

717
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:05,539
Dal, do a good job!
Gosh.

718
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:08,862
Bride. Groom.
Sweet dreams!

719
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,235
They have no time to
sleep! Gosh. Get out of here.

720
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:17,139
Leave, you punk.
Go! Look at them!

721
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,383
Gosh.
I did not think about this.

722
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:28,299
Right.

723
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,590
Do you want to go to sleep?

724
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,380
I should.

725
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:37,689
Go ahead, then.
What about you?

726
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:41,832
This is comfortable for me.
I am good too.

727
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,080
Go to sleep already.
You must be sleepy.

728
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,913
No, I am not.
You even yawned.

729
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,754
You are the sleepy one.

730
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,040
I am not sleepy!

731
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:11,539
Why are you getting mad?

732
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,824
I am not sleepy, but you
keep telling me to go to sleep.

733
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,363
You are getting mad at me for nothing.

734
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,079
Hey.
Where are you going?

735
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,640
I need to use the bathroom!

736
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,160
Why did you touch me?

737
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,040
My goodness.

738
00:58:33,649 --> 00:58:34,849
Gosh.
Seriously.

739
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:44,680
Gosh.

740
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,430
Moon.

741
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,770
Tell me what to do!

742
00:59:05,149 --> 00:59:06,829
Do you have an answer?

743
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,690
I should not have gotten married!

744
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,187
It is making my heart do somersaults!

745
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:17,756
Gosh. It feels weird.
Seriously.

746
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:22,549
Gosh.

747
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,780
What is taking him so long?

748
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,129
What is it?
Gosh.

749
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,514
If you went out to use the
bathroom again, you might pass out.

750
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,800
Why do you care?

751
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:48,024
What about you? Why are you playing
the pipe in the middle of the night?

752
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,554
You cannot even play it.

753
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,960
Why do you care if I play it or not?

754
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:55,693
I never had the chance to learn it.

755
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:56,659
Cheonjubang?

756
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,639
I am good at playing the pipe.

757
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,460
Hey.
That...

758
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,600
I mean...

759
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,420
Hey, you are dirtier than I thought.

760
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,157
"Dirty"?
How could you say that about me?

761
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,632
What about this, then?
Why put this on your lips?

762
01:00:28,169 --> 01:00:31,494
If I wanted to kiss you, I would
have done it a long time ago.

763
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,100
Why would I put my lips on this sogeum?

764
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,120
Liar.

765
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:38,834
You are the liar. You are sleepy,
but you are not going to sleep.

766
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,360
You are the coward.

767
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:42,882
Kissing does not scare me.

768
01:00:43,919 --> 01:00:44,769
Same here.

769
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:48,189
Then, try it.

770
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,039
You try it.

771
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:53,539
You...

772
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,683
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

773
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:38,422
It feels weird to lie down here with you.

774
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,794
I came back here to live as Dal's wife.

775
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,393
I am not here as the Princess or to play.

776
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:43,893
Are you sure you will not regret it?

777
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:46,099
What is my daughter-in-law doing?

778
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,200
I am coming.

779
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:49,974
I ask to be the head
of the royal bodyguards.

780
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,500
You despicable spy.

781
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:54,244
I will end you here, so
you never go back to Silla.

782
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,403
I will get everyone at
the palace on my side.

783
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:58,342
Get the Prince's trust first.

784
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,383
You planned it when you
were at the palace, right?

785
01:03:00,389 --> 01:03:02,843
And me becoming a general
must be part of your plan.

786
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,784
Do you know why I am not
teaching Dal the swordsmanship?

787
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,284
Once he wields the sword,
he is bound to see blood.

788
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,423
That is the fate of a swordsman.
