THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,194
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,050
EPISODE 18

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,302
The Princess went too
far in the King's presence.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,890
That was too far?

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,534
So many lost their lives...

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,194
due to the lack of support.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,334
How can you say such nonsense?

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,190
Nonsense?

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,843
Lord Yeon! You should watch what you say!

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,204
I spent my whole life up north...

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,543
fighting barbarians and sandstorms,

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,814
so I am incapable of watching what I say.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,670
What?

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,600
Will you two stop it?

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,980
Please calm down.

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,420
How dare he?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,994
The King is reluctant to see the Princess,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,494
and it is a great concern.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,194
She managed to fend
off the Baekje soldiers,

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,067
so that contribution stands.

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,290
Pyeonggang.

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,244
Are you showing off because you won?

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,610
What do you mean?

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,550
I hear the Goguryeo people
weep tears of gratitude.

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,884
The Princess aided the young King...

27
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,490
and made a great accomplishment at war.

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,984
If it had not been for you,

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,624
how would your insufficient brother
have managed his kingly duties?

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,310
That is not what I meant.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,250
It is not?

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,764
That is how it sounded to me.

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,482
All I voiced was the pity that
we needlessly lost good men.

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,320
And so, during a meeting,

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,444
in front of all the ministers,
you scolded the King?

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,360
Who do you take me for?

37
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,900
Answer me, Pyeonggang.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
Am I the King?

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,023
Or am I your younger brother?

40
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,020
You are the King.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
Do you mean that?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,850
Yes.

43
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,234
If you went any further,

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,573
I would have severely punished you.

45
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,652
But I will stop at
stripping your military title.

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,630
Love you or hate you,

47
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,790
you are my sister.

48
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,930
You are excused.

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,567
Will you not do anything about it?

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,373
Did we fight for an award?

51
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,607
Did we fight to gain honors?

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,873
Jin. The Princess needs to rest.

53
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,820
We should go.

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,190
Let go of me.

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
What is this mess?

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,044
We fought Baekje,

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,783
and you, me, and Ga Jin...

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,554
got back after nearly
losing our own lives.

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
And the King treats us like insects.

60
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,480
Jin.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
He is our King.

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,060
He is my brother,

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,067
but before that, I serve as his subject.

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,974
I would like you to refrain from
speaking like that around me.

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,660
The Princess is right.

66
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,400
Calm down.

67
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,617
Is your new home ready to live in?

68
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,944
Sorry for dragging you to war
as soon as you got married.

69
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,230
Do not say that.

70
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,757
If you call, we come,
even during the night.

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,260
Right, darling?
Do not darling me.

72
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,210
I carved it myself.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,754
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

74
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,610
Same side?

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
We are on the same side.

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,990
And we are married.

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,867
The Goguryeo you dream of, Ga Jin.

78
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,503
The country you wish to make.

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
I will live there too.

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,130
I am...

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,077
in this world to be your sword.

82
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,484
It will be worth a lot.

83
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,954
It is much fatter than the one before.

84
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,827
Yes, it is.
Untie it quickly.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,280
We should hurry.

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
You hold tight.

87
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,337
Let us get going.
Come on and...

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,973
It got caught in someone's trap,

89
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
and we were letting it go.
Yes.

90
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,704
That is true.
We should go.

91
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,390
Take it to your mother.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Come along.
Go on.

93
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,317
Are there any herbs here?
No.

94
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,040
Oh, dear.

95
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,330
What is this?

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,420
This is a trap that we dug.

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,940
Darn it.

98
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,127
Help me get out of this pit.

99
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,770
Help me out first.

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,050
Me first!

101
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,430
Hey!
Push me up!

102
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,210
What are you doing?

103
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
We could have the meat to eat.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,520
Do you not hear me?

105
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,734
What do you want to nag about
that you came all the way here?

106
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,394
The beast is already dead.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Eating its meat would do us no harm.

108
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,834
Not eating it will do no harm either.

109
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,690
Not again.

110
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,080
Does everything I say
sound like I am nagging?

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,270
Dal.

112
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,000
You fool.

113
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,623
Do not leave while I am still talking.

114
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,620
Goodness.

115
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,020
What a good son you are.

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,547
Morning and night, for four years,

117
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,117
you have been bowing at a mound of soil.

118
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
You are a mirage.

119
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,090
What?
You are...

120
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,127
a fake I created in my mind.

121
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
My real mother is...

122
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,574
Why do you not finish the sentence?

123
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,260
What about your mother?

124
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,457
Why do you keep carving that thing...

125
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,927
when you will not even sell it?

126
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,940
It puts my mind at ease.

127
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,746
Because it reminds you of
your wife when you hold that?

128
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,750
Mother.

129
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,803
Tell the truth to just me.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,667
You have not seen the Princess in years.

131
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,310
You would love to go to the Capital.

132
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,020
I do not.
I bet you do.

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,130
Dal.

134
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,430
I said no!

135
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,730
Who were you talking to?

136
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,100
Oh, come on. My gosh.

137
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,730
I told you never to come here.

138
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,994
You did say that, last fall.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,724
But I need to see check on you
each season to see you are alive.

140
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,994
To at least get your bones
back if a tiger gets you.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,850
Dal.

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,440
Do not be like this.
Let go.

143
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,443
Will you pack up and move somewhere else?

144
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,074
Do you think I came back to meditate?

145
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,930
I know.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,413
That is why the Princess cannot visit.

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,914
For fear that...

148
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,884
you will act out and go
somewhere we cannot find you.

149
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,010
That is why...

150
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,657
she told me to check on you.

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,260
The Princess' sword is
always wet with blood.

152
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,030
This year alone, she
has been in five wars.

153
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,564
Because she cares more
than anyone about her country.

154
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,420
You idiot.

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
It is because of you.

156
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,704
If she is in the palace,

157
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,544
she cannot stop thinking of you,

158
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,644
so she volunteers to go and fight.

159
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,517
To make up for your absence.

160
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,117
That is just what she would do.

161
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,170
Dal.

162
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Come to the Capital.

163
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,980
See the Princess...

164
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,840
and catch up with her.

165
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,660
Hey!

166
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,270
Will you just let him go?

167
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,130
He is your oldest friend.

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,053
It bothers you too, right?

169
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,094
That the Princess goes to
war and gets drenched in blood.

170
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
She has a King.

171
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,864
They are siblings, so
they must get along well.

172
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,814
Do you think 10 brothers
make up for a husband?

173
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,460
Mother.

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,330
What?

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,374
Do you want me gone?

176
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,500
Because I nag?

177
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,930
Ga Jin and I.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
We must not meet.

179
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,410
Whether it is my death...

180
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,793
or a mishap that happens to Ga Jin,

181
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,433
our end will be bloodshed.

182
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,007
To stop that from happening,

183
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,114
I am living in hiding when
it hurts more than death.

184
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,970
What if...

185
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,387
you live as a hermit all your life...

186
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,500
and then die?

187
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,693
Would that be a pretty sight?

188
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,530
You are the greatest in Goguryeo.

189
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,997
You are the greatest fool ever.

190
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,300
What is this?

191
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,394
Since I am no longer a military officer,

192
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,733
I went to the library to kill time.

193
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,020
And?

194
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,337
I remembered something
our late father said.

195
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,977
Wol Gwang said this to me one day.

196
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,180
That my time is coming to an end.

197
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,950
He said the Crown Prince...

198
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,953
and Princess will reign over Goguryeo.

199
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,860
I thought about it, and he is right.

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
Why would you say that?

201
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,310
You are still strong.

202
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,090
Princess.

203
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes, Father.

204
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,973
When the Crown Prince becomes King,

205
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,278
support him with your
utmost effort and passion.

206
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,710
I will do that.

207
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,117
I was never good to you, and I always...

208
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,817
give you more responsibilities.

209
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,030
I am sorry.

210
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,640
So...

211
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,754
you want me to learn how to reign...

212
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,754
from the books you chose for me?

213
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,440
You do not lack learning,

214
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,897
but they will help you rule.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,850
Why not?

216
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,570
I will read them.

217
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,940
But I require help other than books.

218
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,444
My commanders are said to be brave,

219
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,514
but they are like tigers without teeth.

220
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,024
They served since my father's
time, so they would be old.

221
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,880
Right.

222
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,380
You did fight well,

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,300
but you are a woman.

224
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,160
I want to make your husband
the Superior Commander.

225
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,480
Your Majesty.

226
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,034
He has been away for long.

227
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
It is time he returned.

228
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,810
Go to him and persuade him.

229
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,743
No one, not even me can make him...

230
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,900
take up his sword again.

231
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, dear.

232
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,717
Were you and him not a
match made in heaven?

233
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
Because of me,

234
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,330
he suffered for many years.

235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,733
I will not make him fight again.

236
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,794
Go Geon fled to Silla,

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,564
and instead of suffering,
he lives in luxury.

238
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,834
Starting with Silla, I
will behead Go Geon,

239
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,040
and then unify the three nations!

240
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,477
The perfect man to assist me...

241
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,030
is your husband.

242
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,860
Only General On can help.

243
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
I will support you in your great endeavor.

244
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,310
However,

245
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,590
do not involve General On Dal.

246
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,250
What?

247
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,250
SEORABEOL, SILLA

248
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
Why are you doing this?

249
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,550
You have been in
Seorabeol for four years now.

250
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,384
I get that in the first year,

251
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,254
everything was unfamiliar
and you were confused.

252
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,927
But even now, you waste time with drink.

253
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,794
You were commanded to come to court today.

254
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,256
What is the point in going
when there is nothing to do?

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The King thinks highly of you.

256
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
I know that.

257
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,083
Why do you look at me like that?

258
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,830
You knew that...

259
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,340
my true human nature...

260
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,210
is to drink and play.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,667
You and your father are good with money,

262
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,200
and you are raking in great profits.

263
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,937
I should help with spending it.

264
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,160
General.

265
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,177
Do not forget how Gochuga died.

266
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,474
He died bitterly before
he was able to achieve...

267
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,680
his dream of...

268
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,440
Do not...

269
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,570
mention my father.

270
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
That night,

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,712
I should have killed On Dal,
the Princess, and then myself.

272
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,273
Because you got in my way,

273
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,150
I am now a drunkard.

274
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,930
General.

275
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,240
Leave.

276
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,500
I said leave!

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,653
Is General Go Geon not yet here?

278
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,390
The thing is,

279
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
he suddenly fell ill.

280
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,970
Oh, dear. What happened?

281
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,260
I doubt he fell ill. Is
he not just hungover?

282
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,610
No. Of course not.

283
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,103
I heard that heroes like drink and women.

284
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,230
He truly lives up to his name
of the Gyeru Tribe's heir.

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,730
Lord Hae.

286
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,117
I expect a lot from General Go.

288
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,460
Tell him that before
my patience wears out,

289
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,560
I would like to discuss politics with him.

290
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,460
I will uphold your command.

291
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,250
He just fell asleep.

292
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,414
I went in to see the King today...

293
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,553
and got well and truly insulted.

294
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,724
Because of that good-for-nothing fool!

295
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,530
Father. You might wake him.

296
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,724
Who cares if a drunkard wakes up...

297
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,850
or falls down?

298
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,850
We can talk in your room.

299
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,540
Because he lives a wasteful life,

300
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,207
the both of us could be insulted too.

301
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,520
Father. Come with me.

302
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,010
Why is Gochuga's son such a slob?

303
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,800
Father.

304
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,044
So what if he looks fine on the outside?

305
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,414
He is the worst waste
of space in the world!

306
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,100
Father, please.
Darn him!

307
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,364
Rumors inside and outside
the palace are concerning.

308
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,634
That the reason the King
stripped you of military command...

309
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,574
is because he is wary of your
prowess and accomplishments.

310
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,313
The rumors are groundless.

311
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,053
But not utterly unfounded.

312
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,853
How do you think a young king...

313
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,656
managed to secure his
place so quickly and firmly?

314
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,354
It is because you shed
sweat and blood to help him.

315
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,210
Uncle.

316
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,110
Lord Yeon has a point.

317
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,970
If you do nothing,

318
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,433
you could be excluded from government.

319
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Then I will go back to my embroidery...

320
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,373
and stay in Magnolia Hall.

321
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,150
Princess.
Princess.

322
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,450
You misunderstand the King.

323
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,987
He commanded me to get General On.

324
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,770
General On?

325
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,127
To unify the three kingdoms,

326
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,627
he says he needs General On.

327
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,094
If His Majesty wished to limit my power,

328
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,804
he would not place such heavy
responsibility on General On.

329
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,818
In that case, are you
going to visit General On?

330
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,483
Hey. Promise you will not tell her.

331
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,700
I promise.

332
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,240
I am sorry.

333
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,984
Show me around your house some other time.

334
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,382
That is too bad. We prepared
a feast for the Princess.

335
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,474
It is okay. We will eat
all the food ourselves.

336
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,904
Are you still upset with me?

337
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,760
No.

338
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,350
I have my husband now.

339
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,844
You should hurry back to the palace...

340
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,544
and take care of state
affairs or whatever.

341
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,230
You do not mean that.

342
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,350
What are you talking about?

343
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,017
Actually, a few days ago...
Hey!

344
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,793
You promised not to tell her.

345
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,840
Jin was pestering me,

346
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,993
so I went to check on Dal.

347
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,030
He seemed to be doing okay,

348
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,926
but he kicked me out before
I could ask him about much.

349
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,870
That is a relief.

350
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,370
What do you mean?

351
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,214
All he does all day is
carve a wooden flute.

352
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,660
Can you guess why?

353
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,970
Obviously,

354
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,114
it is to stop thinking about you.

355
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,064
That is why he carves
wood all day like a fool.

356
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,480
Stop.

357
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,224
I know that. So you can stop, Jin.

358
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,297
It has already been four years.

359
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,464
Do you not miss him?

360
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,164
Do you not want to know how he is doing?

361
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,894
Do you not even feel sorry for him?

362
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,260
What is with you?

363
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,350
I miss him.

364
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,690
I miss him like crazy.

365
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,764
I am leaving so that I
do not have to lose you.

366
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,637
You must become the
person you desire to be.

367
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,504
Whether it is becoming
the sister of the future King...

368
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,577
or becoming the Queen yourself.

369
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,230
I made your bed.

370
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,447
You must be tired. You
should go to bed now.

371
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,470
Nanny.

372
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes, Princess.

373
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,900
I miss him.

374
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,810
I should not see him,

375
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,840
but I miss him so much.

376
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,010
Then you should see him.

377
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,507
Is it really okay if I do that?

378
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,773
What if I go to see him...

379
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,504
but he kicks me out?

380
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,190
What are you afraid of?

381
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,844
Even when your father
forbade you to go out,

382
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,917
you ran out without hesitation.

383
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,474
You even lied to all the
ministers that you were married.

384
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,827
Whenever you set your mind on something,

385
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,167
you took action immediately.

386
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,467
You were never afraid of anything.

387
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,970
Dal.

388
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,780
You are here again.

389
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,660
Where did you hide the general's sword?

390
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,603
Why do you need to know that?

391
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,400
I want to sell it for some taffy.

392
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,120
Forget it.

393
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,740
My goodness.

394
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,914
I have never seen the moon
this beautiful during the day.

395
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,084
During the day or at night,
it makes no difference.

396
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,054
You should come here and see it.

397
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,127
It is such a bright, full moon.

398
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,560
Leave me alone. I am not interested.

399
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,794
Your name means the "moon".

400
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,200
Why do you not want to see the moon?

401
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,800
By any chance, does the
milky-white, demure moon...

402
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,350
remind you of someone?

403
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,804
You told me to kick her out
when I brought the injured girl here.

404
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,250
That was ages ago.

405
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,674
Do you not know that I
can see right through you?

406
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,814
You want to run to the
palace right at this moment.

407
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,514
You want to hold her in your arms...

408
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,853
and shower her with your affection.

409
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,030
Stop! Please!

410
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,924
Please go away. Stop tormenting me!

411
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,780
Leave!

412
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,033
You are not even my real mother.

413
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,210
Mother.

414
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
Where did you go?

415
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,464
This is not funny. Come out this instant.

416
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,320
Mother.

417
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,920
Gosh.

418
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,290
Mother!

419
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,030
Mother.

420
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
Your son is right here.

421
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,687
I am right here. Where did you go?

422
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,533
You can torment me all you want.

423
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,433
You can do whatever you want.

424
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,580
Do not leave me, Mother.

425
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,280
General.

426
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
I am entering the palace.

427
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,250
Why, all of a sudden?

428
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,376
The King of Silla is sending
an envoy to Goguryeo.

429
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,730
I did hear that.

430
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,577
I have had enough
fun to last me a lifetime.

431
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,153
It is time for me to work.

432
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,883
General.
You and I are outsiders.

433
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,784
It is only because the Silla palace...

434
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,523
is packed with insiders...

435
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,827
that I have been lying low so far.

436
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,480
General Go.

437
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,910
Your Majesty.

438
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,473
If I send you to Goguryeo as my envoy,

439
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,020
you will be beheaded...

440
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,077
as soon as you set foot in their palace.

441
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,010
You may be right.

442
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,444
Are you not afraid?

443
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,130
I have already died once.

444
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
Why would I be afraid?

445
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,600
If I become beheaded,

446
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,430
it will give you
justification to start a war.

447
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,264
I heard that you were
indulging in alcohol and meat.

448
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,804
Perhaps you have
been waiting for this day.

449
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,534
Still, if you send General
Go as your envoy...

450
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,140
I volunteered to go.

451
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,624
Whether I get to deliver
Silla's great cause...

452
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,444
or get killed even before I open my mouth,

453
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,130
I am ready for either.

454
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,740
You must not go.

455
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,124
Even if you go to Goguryeo,

456
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,663
it will not go according to your plan.

457
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,750
My plan?

458
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,330
Do you know my plan?

459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,850
Of course.

460
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,804
Your plan is to kill the Princess...

461
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,543
and face the end yourself.

462
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,377
I am not going there to die.

463
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,190
I do not believe you.

464
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,914
In these turbulent times,

465
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,453
you drifted all the way here to Silla.

466
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,157
But I am with Mo Yong on this matter.

467
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,397
Do not go there, General Go.

468
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,624
The King gladly gave his permission,

469
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,494
and my determination will not falter.

470
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,594
I do not want to hear another word.

471
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,480
General Go.

472
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,840
In that case,

473
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,950
I will follow you.

474
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,120
Mo Yong!

475
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,073
You said you were not going there to die.

476
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,317
We will go there together...

477
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,850
and return together, safe and sound.

478
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,150
If I say no,

479
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,290
will you stick a needle in me again?

480
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,420
My goodness.

481
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,880
Goodness.

482
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,580
Darn it.

483
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,980
What? "Darn it"?

484
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,074
Weed out the vegetable
garden over there on the hill.

485
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,792
Water, vegetable garden,
laundry, and bush stems. I got it.

486
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,620
What is your name?

487
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,850
Yeom Ga Jin.

488
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,153
My goodness, what a pretty name.

489
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
I am good at playing the pipe.

490
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,620
Hey. That...

491
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,100
Mother.

492
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,223
Please forgive me for taking this long...

493
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,330
to visit you.

494
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,100
But I am glad...

495
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,140
that Dal is by your side.

496
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,933
I am not even close to repaying you...

497
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,567
for the kindness you had shown me.

498
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,924
Please forgive your
ungrateful daughter-in-law.

499
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,950
Please leave.

500
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,650
This place is too modest...

501
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,790
for a princess.

502
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,610
Dal.

503
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,890
I am hungry.

504
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,992
The sun goes down pretty
early. Please leave right after...

505
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
I wanted to put this on again.

506
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,270
Can I take this with me?

507
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,010
Let us eat.

508
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,690
This is delicious.

509
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,850
You can season
vegetables well like Mother.

510
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,040
You should eat too.

511
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,330
I will leave now.

512
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,607
It is nice to see you again.

513
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,397
Can you make me one promise?

514
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,300
I know I do not deserve it.

515
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,240
But I miss you.

516
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,190
So promise me that...

517
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,550
you will be here the next time...

518
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,400
I come back to see you.

519
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,130
Just promise me that.

520
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,753
Is that also too much to ask?

521
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,110
I am...

522
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,900
a man of Goguryeo.

523
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,110
I must comply with...

524
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,280
the Princess' request.

525
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,230
Okay.

526
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,520
Then, you just made me a promise.

527
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,440
Yes.

528
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,020
Please...

529
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,560
do not get hurt.

530
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,300
Your life is precious.

531
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,700
You too, Your Highness.

532
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,290
Ga Jin.

533
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,740
Ga Jin!

534
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,810
Ga Jin.

535
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,010
Ga Jin!

536
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,604
I came back because I thought
a princess deserves the truth.

537
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,490
I cannot...

538
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,230
keep my promise.

539
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,100
I will...

540
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,350
leave here and move
deeper into the mountain.

541
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,290
If I stay here,

542
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,640
Pung Gae...

543
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,763
and you will keep coming to see me.

544
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,300
I will go to a place
where no one can find me.

545
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,170
I really missed you.

546
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,147
But I should not have been greedy.

547
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,070
Ga Jin.

548
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,157
Now that I have left my sword behind,

549
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,310
I am happy.

550
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,463
I do not smell blood anymore.

551
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,610
Because you let me go,

552
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,280
I could live.

553
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,290
Can I...

554
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,300
just live with you?

555
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,478
We could hide in a mountain
where no one can find us.

556
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,094
We can live together
there. Just the two of us.

557
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,090
What about Goguryeo?

558
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,170
The King is still young.

559
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,367
Can you just leave him at the palace?

560
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,020
I know.

561
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,620
It is okay.

562
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,170
Deer.

563
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,970
Yes.

564
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,370
That is me.

565
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,880
Your deer.

566
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,997
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

567
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,350
I am going to find you.

568
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,110
You will fail...

569
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,364
because I will make sure no one finds me.

570
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,220
No.

571
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,720
I know I can find you.

572
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,860
Lady Gongson.
Yes.

573
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,477
I usually prefer to follow my father.

574
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,090
But today, I could not.

575
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,283
Father did not like sweet stuff.

576
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,453
But why do I like it so much?

577
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,590
The Princess...

578
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,454
took care of it since you
were little, Your Majesty.

579
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,824
Her Highness wanted to take care of you...

580
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,630
by making snacks using good-quality honey.

581
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,330
The Princess is only concerned
about the empire and you.

582
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,583
Please do not misunderstand her.

583
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,800
Won! No!

584
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,370
Do not drink it.

585
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,260
You have not drunk a drop of it, right?

586
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,554
There is poison in your medicine.

587
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
You brought me sweets.

588
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,180
I came here to thank you.

589
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,870
You believed that my
medicine was poisoned.

590
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,443
You must have been flustered.

591
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,773
Even so, I am still grateful.

592
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,314
Did you say the representatives
of Silla are coming tomorrow?

593
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

594
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,487
His Majesty has not arrived.

595
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,130
What are they doing?
Who do you think you are?

596
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,770
How dare you!

597
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,333
Are you not the traitor Go Geon?

598
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,404
You are no less than an animal.
How dare you show yourself?

599
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,090
Have you lost your mind?

600
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,677
Is that brat Hae Ji Weol's stepdaughter?

601
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,577
I, Go Geon, the envoy of Silla,

602
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,640
have come to Goguryeo to
have an audience with the King.

603
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,890
I am deeply moved...

604
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,670
to see you on the throne, Your Majesty.

605
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,020
I heard...

606
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,904
King Pyeongwon held a
great funeral for my father.

607
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,777
How dare he?
I am grateful...

608
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,804
from the bottom of my heart.

609
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,490
Who does he think he is?

610
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,347
King Jinheung of Silla
has sent his message.

611
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,540
Stop there.

612
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,573
Go Geon.
Yes, Your Majesty.

613
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,540
Are you here...

614
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,030
to die in your own land?

615
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,044
I am here to send the
message from the King...

616
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,783
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!

617
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,640
I remember that night.

618
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,230
Your Majesty!

619
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,280
Master Go!

620
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,967
I see that you are still alive.

621
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,867
The sin you and your father have done...

622
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,410
You have become faster.
How dare you!

623
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,360
I am delighted to have found
that you have trained well.

624
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,300
Go Geon!

625
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,280
Yes.
You have betrayed your family...

626
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,554
and your father to come back as an envoy.

627
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,760
A lowly servant such as myself...

628
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,024
is suitable for the peace
between the two countries.

629
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,990
How dare he?

630
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,830
Give him the letter.

631
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,660
Gosh, Your Highness.

632
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,600
Where did you go without telling us?

633
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,504
I need to take a break, Nanny.

634
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,222
The Palace has been turned
upside down while you were away.

635
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,640
Do not be surprised.

636
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,183
An envoy came from Silla, and he is...

637
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,590
An envoy from Silla?

638
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,334
I thought they would
lock us up in a damp jail,

639
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,980
but this is...

640
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,864
much more than I deserve.

641
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,670
You deserve more than this.

642
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,764
We will be beheaded nonetheless.

643
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,620
Why?

644
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,043
Are you regretting it now?

645
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,120
Are you regretting...

646
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,350
that you should have remained in Silla?

647
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,583
It would be my greatest honor...

648
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,220
to die on the same day
and at the same time as you.

649
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,020
You should not kill them.

650
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,350
I should not kill them?

651
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,440
The King of Silla...

652
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,604
has sent General Go Geon as his envoy.

653
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,410
Why do you think he did so?

654
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,347
He wants to shed blood by offending you.

655
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,900
Then he has succeeded.

656
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,254
I must behead him
because he has offended me!

657
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,940
If you kill an envoy,

658
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,290
you are basically offering
a reason to start a war.

659
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,824
Are you saying we should
keep Go Geon alive...

660
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,763
to avoid a war against Silla?

661
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,504
I am only saying we should not
fall for the obvious trap they have set.

662
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,410
Have you seen the message
Go Geon has brought?

663
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,360
It is quite a spectacle!

664
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,050
Silla wants to ally with our empire.

665
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,544
They want to join forces
and destroy Baekje.

666
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,014
And they want to divide
their lands among us.

667
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,540
An ally with Silla?

668
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,540
That is ridiculous.

669
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,780
Of course!

670
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,890
They have sent Go Geon on purpose...

671
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,763
to insult Goguryeo and the King!

672
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,864
It is a trick the king of
Silla is trying to pull...

673
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,550
as I am a young king.

674
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,974
Do you still expect me to keep him alive?

675
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,713
Yes, Your Majesty.
My gosh.

676
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,780
Despite all that, he is still an envoy.

677
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,414
If we do not send him back safely,

678
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,487
there will be war in our lands.

679
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,763
We need to avoid such tragedies.

680
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,680
Lord Sa.

681
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,004
I would have killed him if
he were an ordinary envoy,

682
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,450
but he is Go Geon.

683
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,460
Your Highness.

684
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,274
You cannot dishonor the King...

685
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,614
because you are afraid of Silla's king.

686
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,087
It is a provocation against Goguryeo!

687
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,414
Are you bearing a
grudge against the King...

688
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,100
for losing your position?

689
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,350
You are going against
everything the King is suggesting,

690
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,750
Your Highness!

691
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,304
Those gathered in the
Hall of Convenience are...

692
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,022
weighing the pros and cons
of letting you live, General Go.

693
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,480
It is not a matter to discuss for long.

694
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,414
They will eventually give
an order to behead me.

695
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,287
You still came knowing that?

696
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,010
Yes.

697
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,650
Even if I die,

698
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,816
I thought I would have to
see the Capital before I die.

699
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,050
Gochuga...

700
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,106
was confident and dignified
until his last moment.

701
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,290
But his son...

702
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,504
ran away to Silla, betraying his family.

703
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,804
And he is back as an envoy?

704
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,143
Did you just ask me where I belong?

705
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,880
Did you see that?

706
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,240
Pardon?

707
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,560
My father...

708
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,450
gave all his heart...

709
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,560
to this woman.

710
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,177
In the end, he was betrayed by her...

711
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,813
and was killed that night.

712
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,090
And now, she is blaming me.

713
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,550
How cunning...

714
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,700
can a human be?

715
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,580
General Go.

716
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:47,960
Queen Jin!

717
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,083
Queen Jin!
I do not want to hear it.

718
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,160
But you must.

719
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,423
I know you have come to see General Go...

720
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,823
to spare yourself from death.

721
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,104
I will announce my decision.

722
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,310
Go Geon may be an envoy of Silla,

723
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,714
but the sins he committed as a
royal blood of Goguryeo are great.

724
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,454
The king of Silla has aimed to
use this fact with this petty trick.

725
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,924
Therefore, I will not treat his
envoy with diplomatic respect.

726
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:35,970
Your Majesty.

727
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,490
Do not interrupt me.

728
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,998
Hence, I sentence Go Geon and
those who came with him to death.

729
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,910
Your Majesty.

730
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,183
We are discussing matters of state.

731
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,724
If you have something to
say, please do so in private.

732
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,924
I have something to tell you
regarding matters of state.

733
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,050
I implore you.

734
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,270
Please listen to what I say as
I am the Queen of this empire.

735
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,970
What is it?
I know that you are...

736
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,834
deeply concerned about the
decision you will have to make soon.

737
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,784
Therefore, I thought
about it to give you help,

738
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,043
and I thought of King Pyeongwon.

739
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,070
In such cases,

740
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,744
King Pyeongwon would have
sent back the envoy from Silla.

741
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,750
What?

742
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,500
Also, you would laugh
over their petty trick.

743
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,570
He would have shown
his generosity as King.

744
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,470
Queen Jin.
Anyway,

745
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,958
please show us the generosity
King Pyeongwon has shown us.

746
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,000
Queen Jin.

747
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,860
I agree with Queen Jin.

748
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,376
Please make a decision that
would be best for Goguryeo.

749
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,596
Since it is not a hasty decision
to make, let us decide tomorrow.

750
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,013
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!

751
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,690
I was deeply impressed
by your loving mind.

752
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,323
Who knew you would keep General Go alive?

753
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,770
You must have wanted
to atone before Gochuga.

754
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,500
Then did you not forget your first love...

755
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,447
and begged to spare General Go?

756
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,030
That is wild speculation.

757
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,753
I only made that request for Goguryeo.

758
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,270
Also,

759
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,493
I have a husband who is dear to me.

760
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,540
I see.

761
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,893
Are you talking about the man...

762
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,548
who refused to live with you
and has renounced this world?

763
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,990
Yes.

764
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
When the King's reign settles,

765
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,520
I will go live with him.

766
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,004
I hope you will give your help...

767
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,210
so that that day may come sooner.

768
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,720
Sure, I will.

769
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,380
Use me as your spy.

770
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,080
Your spy?

771
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,233
If I make it back safely with General Go,

772
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,843
I will tell you of every affair in Silla.

773
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,277
You can use that information...

774
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,917
to open a new path for the Prince.

775
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,260
How would I trust you?

776
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,550
Four years ago,

777
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,387
I brought General Go
to Silla on that night.

778
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,754
What mattered to me the most
were his life and his security.

779
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,640
You must...

780
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,363
feel the same way about the Prince.

781
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,803
So, if I let General Go live,

782
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,280
you will become my spy.

783
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,660
Right.

784
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,943
I thought you were shrewd,

785
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,147
but you are taken captive by young love.

786
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,087
How could you say such a thing?

787
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,714
This is not something you
should involve yourself in!

788
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,987
I am the Queen of the former King.

789
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,354
If I can help with the matters of state,

790
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,124
there is no reason I should stay quiet.

791
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,730
That is the problem!

792
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,650
There is...

793
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,207
a dirty rumor going around about you.

794
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,347
About you and the dead Gochuga!

795
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,330
Father!

796
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,383
And you are trying to keep his son alive!

797
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,520
You are trying to
keep a failing light alive!

798
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,970
This is...

799
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,640
all for Geon Mu.

800
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,933
How is any of this for Prince Geon Mu?

801
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,256
If Go Geon causes trouble
to Goguryeo by serving Silla,

802
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,840
then not only the Prince...

803
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,177
but also you will be in deep trouble.

804
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,074
I have thought about it too.

805
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,944
Are you saying you are willing
to risk it all for your thoughts?

806
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:59,800
Father!

807
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,484
You have become the leader
of the Five Tribe council...

808
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,170
after Gochuga has passed.

809
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,923
Are you now trying to control me as well?

810
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,794
You should learn to voice your
opinion at the Five Tribe council.

811
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,867
I am the Queen of Hwayang Hall.

812
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,947
It has been four years, Master Go.

813
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,180
Please excuse us.

814
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,290
I need to speak with Master Go separately.

815
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,880
Did you not hear her?

816
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,577
I am here to tell you
the words of the King.

817
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,350
We will reject the alliance with Silla.

818
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,753
The Crown Prince has become quite clever.

819
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,680
Or...

820
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,094
did you give him your advice?

821
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,044
He is not the Crown
Prince. He is now our King.

822
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,740
And the rejection of the alliance...

823
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,104
is the decision the King has made.

824
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:30,960
I see.

825
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,940
Why are you here?

826
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,510
Are you here to die?

827
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,553
To see you, Your Highness.

828
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,357
I thought it would be more meaningful...

829
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,930
to see you one last time...

830
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,664
than to live a meaningless life in Silla.

831
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,190
That is why I came.

832
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,420
Are you not...

833
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,420
glad to see me at all?

834
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,473
Your plan will never go your way...

835
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,570
as the King...

836
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,380
plans to send back the envoys.

837
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,720
I want to ask you one more thing.

838
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,560
That night...

839
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,430
Was it your sword?

840
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,850
That stabbed my father?

841
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,700
That is right.

842
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,417
Just like how your father...

843
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,690
shot an arrow at my mother.

844
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,960
It should end with that night.

845
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,138
The resentment and ill
fates should end with us.

846
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,033
Princess, the ill fates...

847
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,703
could have ended long ago.

848
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,918
If the two families came
together through a royal wedding,

849
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,874
you and I would have changed this empire.

850
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,760
Not at all.

851
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,950
It would have become the world...

852
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,780
of the Gyeru Tribe that
Gochuga dreamed of.

853
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,050
Go back to Silla.

854
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,960
And forget all of your memories from here.

855
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,554
There is a woman who only loves you.

856
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,410
So what?

857
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,898
What about the man who
only loved you, Your Highness?

858
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,470
Did you reject me...

859
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,434
so you would be with someone like him?

860
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,290
Master Go!

861
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,317
I am here to die. I want to die...

862
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,450
to end our ill fate.

863
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,730
Here.

864
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,930
Come on.

865
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,540
Gosh.

866
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,840
Ga Jin and I are married.

867
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,497
I am her husband, and she is my wife.

868
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,167
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

869
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,580
I am going to find you.

870
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,364
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

871
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,170
Raise an army and chase after Go Geon now!

872
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,434
If you feel falsely accused,
show me your loyalty.

873
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,373
Just kill me.
Where is On Dal?

874
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,874
You saw him in his hiding place.
What did you speak of?

875
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,730
Master?

876
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,814
Princess!
I need to see the King!

877
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,184
Do you really want to become the King?

878
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:12,054
If that is what you want to
be, then I would fight for you.

879
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,554
So that you can take the throne.

880
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,484
Can you recover Adan Fortress?

881
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,524
If you believe the Princess'
innocence and let her go,

882
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,324
I will gladly fight for the empire.

883
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,494
I know you will lose in that
fight, so how can I let you go?

884
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,636
It is also a fight to win
back my father's legacy.
