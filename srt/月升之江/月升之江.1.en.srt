1
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:07,225
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,745
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:25,745
EPISODE 1

4
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:53,306
Dal. Wait for me.

5
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:05,246
Hang in there, until I come.

6
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:53,556
Dal.

7
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,246
Ga Jin.

8
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,885
I miss you.

9
00:03:56,956 --> 00:04:00,086
Dal. Dal.

10
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:09,795
We won.

11
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,165
By fighting to the death.

12
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,336
You should have waited.

13
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:17,475
You are so stupid.

14
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,776
Ga Jin.

15
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,785
You are my Goguryeo.

16
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,656
You are my nation.

17
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,365
Thank you for staying alive.

18
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:07,555
Your Highness. Where are you going?

19
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:10,425
PRINCESS PYEONGGANG, KING
PYEONGWON'S ELDEST DAUGHTER

20
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:31,816
GOGURYEO'S PYEONGYANG CASTLE,
561A.D., 3RD YEAR OF KING PYEONGWON

21
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,185
Come on!

22
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:45,026
Is that even right?

23
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:48,336
How dare a servant act
like he rules Father's nation?

24
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,105
Watch what you say, Princess.

25
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:53,136
Are you not even angry, Mother?

26
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,506
Then what?

27
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,475
Must I shed blood?

28
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:26,365
They want their new tribe...

29
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:32,175
to have exclusive
rights to salt for eternity?

30
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:34,816
The exclusive rights to salt...

31
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,685
is what the Five Tribes live on.

32
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,586
That is true, Your Majesty.

33
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:45,156
It would be utterly unreasonable
to take back the rights now.

34
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,326
Please be understanding.

35
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,066
So you brought your private army...

36
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,735
to threaten me?

37
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:58,235
That is not the truth.

38
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,235
Shut your mouth.

39
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,475
KIM PYEONG JI, DAEDAERO, HEAD OF OFFICE

40
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,105
Approve the request, Your Majesty.

41
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,745
All of this...

42
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,975
was your idea, was it not?

43
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,346
Who currently holds the power
that keeps Goguryeo standing?

44
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,915
The Jeollo and Sunno Tribes
are defending the borders,

45
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,756
and our other three
tribes stayed together...

46
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:54,096
to keep our nation going.

47
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,725
Your throne...

48
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,966
only exists because of us.

49
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,605
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

50
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:22,216
I must rest.

51
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:26,526
The salt monopoly,

52
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:30,096
I will leave it to you to decide.

53
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:02,995
GO SANG CHEOL, GYERU TRIBE COMMANDER

54
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:32,286
I will patrol our land as planned.

55
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,556
PATROLLING WAS A MEANS
OF SURVEYING THE LAND.

56
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:37,466
Is that truly the only way?

57
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:41,635
If we let the Five Tribes
continue to have their way,

58
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:43,466
it will threaten the royal household.

59
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,875
Princess.

60
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,046
Why did you sneak in here like a mouse?

61
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,385
It is just that...

62
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,786
I missed out on the timing to greet you.

63
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,855
I came out of concern for Father.

64
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,225
I will go and catch a real mouse.

65
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,426
Princess.

66
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,196
I apologize.

67
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:41,855
The king is like a glass bowl.

68
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:46,466
If you so much as
touch his jealous spirit,

69
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,466
he will shatter easily.

70
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,836
ROYAL CONSORT JIN, KING
PYEONGWON'S CONCUBINE

71
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,005
You got to monopolize salt.

72
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,375
What more do you want?

73
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,615
His queen is egging him on.

74
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:06,745
She insists on going on
patrol in these circumstances...

75
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,716
because she has a plan.

76
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:12,786
The Jeollo Tribe's heroine.

77
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:17,155
She may be young, but
we must not take her lightly.

78
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:22,096
Are you jealous because
she is younger than you?

79
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:29,275
Hide this in the queen's
chambers after she leaves on patrol.

80
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,576
What is this?

81
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:35,446
A talisman that will make you queen.

82
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,046
The current queen is young and healthy.

83
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,456
I would not dare dream of replacing her.

84
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,456
Who knows what could
happen while she is on patrol?

85
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,485
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

86
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:19,125
Where were you the whole day?

87
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,895
I could use a ruler and still
not be as accurate as you.

88
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,865
It does not show, so do not worry.

89
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:34,076
Mice keep sneaking into the palace.

90
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,936
I shall have the maids catch them.

91
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,076
Should I let loose some cats?

92
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,816
They will be hard to catch.

93
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:43,245
They are really nasty.

94
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:46,645
Pardon? Bring my training outfit.

95
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:48,655
Your Highness.

96
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,655
Why do you want to train
in pointless martial arts?

97
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,485
Not that again.

98
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:55,755
Is it because a woman cannot be king?

99
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,666
Of course not. You are wrong.

100
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:02,466
I will follow in my father's
footsteps and become ruler.

101
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,806
Slicing with the blade comes later.

102
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:12,605
Gather your strength.

103
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,916
You must see but not look,

104
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,796
and hear but not listen for
your family to be at peace.

105
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,725
I pray that...

106
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,096
you return from the patrol safely.

107
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:43,706
You are trying to run
when you cannot even walk.

108
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,816
Master Go. Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:52,086
Did you hear about the salt monopoly?

110
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,855
And that the Five Tribes
threatened the king?

111
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,525
Concentrate on your training.

112
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,995
It is possible that in the near future,

113
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,365
I might get to meet your father.

114
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,765
That will make us sworn enemies.

115
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,806
That will not happen.

116
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,336
I am Go Geon, Gyeru Tribe's first in line,

117
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,505
and I will loyally serve your family.

118
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:21,446
What if you must choose between...

119
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,086
the royal household and your tribe?

120
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,985
I do not care for either.

121
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,956
Because I will choose you.

122
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,515
Won. While I am on patrol,

123
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,686
you must be well.

124
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:02,956
I want to go with you.

125
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,786
We are not going for enjoyment.

126
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,495
Here. A sweet snack?

127
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,995
We will only be gone a few days.

128
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,706
Can you wait?

129
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,436
You must come home quick. I will.

130
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:27,916
Let us go.

131
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:56,975
I sent my carrier pigeon.

132
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,676
A carrier pigeon?

133
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:02,375
You are concerned for your queen's safety.

134
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,485
Did you think I would not notice?

135
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,916
If anything untoward is to happen,
we will hear of it immediately.

136
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,725
Then you will hear of
it in due time yourself.

137
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,166
Before visiting her native Jeollo Tribe,

138
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,596
she said she would visit the Sunno Tribe.

139
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,365
The Sunno Tribe?

140
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,836
Are you saying...

141
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:32,775
she went to see General On Hyeop?

142
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,696
SUNNO TRIBE BORDER

143
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,436
ON HYEOP, SUNNO TRIBE CHIEF

144
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:06,246
SUNNO: ONE OF THE FIVE TRIBES,
DEFENDS THE JEOLLA BORDER

145
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,685
Move faster!

146
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,526
You should have attended
the Five Tribe meeting.

147
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,296
I do not care for
pathetic political games.

148
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:24,625
But our tribe always lags in the back.

149
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,125
Do not be silly.

150
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,736
Guarding the southern border...

151
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:31,905
is our tribe's greatest duty.

152
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:33,836
Yes, sir.

153
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,705
General!

154
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,445
General!

155
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:45,586
General. I have terrible news.

156
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:49,756
Your treasured sword is missing.

157
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,195
You will get squashed by
it before you get to wield it.

158
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,465
I must be able to lift it
to be a great general.

159
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:02,836
You should put it back
before you get caught.

160
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,465
Go and bring a wooden sword instead.

161
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,135
You cannot beat me with that.

162
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,536
Do not fall over. Come at me.

163
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,276
Hey, hey!

164
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,016
Hey, you. My gosh.

165
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,786
What are you doing?

166
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,175
Before you learn how to take a life,

167
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,675
you must learn how to save one.

168
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,925
This is not any fun.

169
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:01,296
It is training required
to defend the border.

170
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,596
It is not for fun.

171
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:07,365
I can do this when the time
comes. It is not hard anyway.

172
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,236
Go and grab a rope.

173
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:11,865
If you can hang on until I reach the top,

174
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:14,635
this sword...

175
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,905
I will give it to you. Are you serious?

176
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,316
General. Do you think Dal can manage?

177
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:32,355
Ignore him even if he asks for help.

178
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,836
Hey.

179
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:53,776
Oh, dear.

180
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,816
Do not give up!

181
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:01,455
If you give up,

182
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:04,316
your father and your
comrade loses his life.

183
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:12,826
A man's life is in your hands.

184
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:17,935
Oh, dear.

185
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,605
Do not come closer!

186
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:27,746
I can do this. I will do it on my own!

187
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,986
Hold on!

188
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,395
General, are you all right?

189
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,965
Father!

190
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,665
General.

191
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,066
Father.

192
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,786
Your father just died.

193
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,806
Bury it.

194
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,605
Where are we, Father?

195
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,806
It looks like a grave.

196
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,476
Later.

197
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,516
I will tell you later.

198
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,546
When you are ready to be a true fighter.

199
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,435
Father.

200
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:38,006
I am sorry for what I did...

201
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,336
The queen sent him.

202
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:05,006
The queen? Yes.

203
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:08,675
She's headed to our tribe to meet you.

204
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:12,145
She should arrive around dawn tomorrow.

205
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:25,726
Mother.

206
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:29,596
Who is the strongest person in our nation?

207
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:33,425
By that, do you mean power...

208
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:36,236
or military training and capability?

209
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:39,905
I am asking if anyone can beat Gochuga.

210
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,836
You mean Gyeru Tribe's Go Won Pyo?

211
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:43,905
Yes.

212
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:47,705
The man who brought his
private army to threaten Father.

213
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:52,986
A little further up is a
temple called Yibullansa.

214
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,786
Famed for his skills, General Son...

215
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,486
I mean, Wol Gwang lives there.

216
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,625
A monk? Can a monk beat Gochuga?

217
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:06,125
Before he became a monk,
he was Jeollo's greatest fighter.

218
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,135
You are from the Jeollo Tribe, Mother.

219
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:14,135
Let us drop by. I would like to meet him.

220
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,175
It is very late.

221
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:19,675
You should sleep.

222
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:04,086
Well done, General Son.

223
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:14,596
So, with this sword,

224
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,236
you beheaded the leader
of the Gokturks that invaded?

225
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,405
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:01,375
You must forget such dreadful rumors.

227
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,076
Rumors?

228
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:06,645
12 years ago,

229
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,855
you married the young queen.

230
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:13,685
Less than eight months
later, the princess was born.

231
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:19,066
It just so happened, that winter,
Jeollo Tribe's General Son...

232
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:22,796
resigned from his
station to become a monk.

233
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:27,806
Do you dare voice doubt
about the princess' heritage?

234
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:30,776
Your queen is so young and beautiful.

235
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:35,175
That must make you anxious.

236
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:51,726
A woman's love runs strong and deep.

237
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,566
Even if she tries to hide it,

238
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,336
it is bound to leave a trace.

239
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,415
A carrier pigeon arrived
from the patrol party.

240
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:14,586
The queen...

241
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,286
went to the temple Yibullansa.

242
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:23,256
Wol Gwang. That is where he is.

243
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,205
I found it!

244
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:58,326
A talisman that will make you queen.

245
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,976
You left the troubled world behind,

246
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:18,076
and I am left alone in sorrow.

247
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:21,185
YIBULLANSA

248
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,726
We are separated by 120km,

249
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:37,336
but our hearts are just 10cm apart.

250
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,105
THE SUNNO TRIBE

251
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:47,105
I run to you ever single moment.

252
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,576
My lover, my master.

253
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,526
You must relax.

254
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:02,425
I will kill them.

255
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:04,655
The immoral witch and scum both!

256
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,526
Your queen gave you a son.

257
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,965
How would killing her make you look?

258
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,635
I do not care.

259
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,736
I will kill them both myself.

260
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,076
Then...

261
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:23,445
will you leave it to me, Your Majesty?

262
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:38,125
Greetings, Your Highness. I am On Hyeop.

263
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,096
You may stand, General.

264
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:49,705
As of now, the man
stronger than Go Won Pyo...

265
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:52,546
is General On Hyeop who stands before us.

266
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,860
Are you curious about my sword?

267
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,330
You are the strongest general in Goguryeo.

268
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,430
So I want to know what
kind of sword you use.

269
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:35,839
I am sorry.

270
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:39,239
I used to have a sword that was
much more precious than this one.

271
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,710
But it broke, so I cannot show it to you.

272
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,749
That is a pity. I wanted to see it.

273
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:55,319
I advise you to stay away from swords.

274
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,530
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

275
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,100
I am proud to hear that.

276
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:07,240
When that day comes, that
sword will be used to protect you.

277
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,139
Princess.

278
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,929
You want us to dispatch our troops?

279
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,270
Go Won Pyo keeps looking
down on the royal family.

280
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,509
Sooner or later, he will
try to take over the throne.

281
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,350
But I am just a soldier.

282
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,779
I am not interested in politics and power,

283
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,089
and I do not know much either.

284
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,259
The king recently banned
the monopolization of salt,

285
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,429
but he brought soldiers and
threatened the royal family.

286
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,980
I am not just asking you
to protect the royal family.

287
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:12,199
I am asking you to protect
the people of our country.

288
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,569
She is right.

289
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,839
That man, Gochuga, is a horrible man.

290
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,179
He told me to keep my mouth shut...

291
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
even though I saw everything.

292
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,520
What did you see?

293
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,689
I saw him secretly meet up with
Royal Consort Jin a few days ago.

294
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,659
She heard about the patrol,
and she told him that right away.

295
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,129
Why are you telling me that now?

296
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:42,730
Mother.

297
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,200
Go and wait somewhere else.

298
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,540
Did I do something wrong?

299
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,869
I told you to go.

300
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,360
I guess princesses also receive scoldings.

301
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,460
My father scolds me all the time.

302
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,790
Do you want to see this?

303
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,659
Is it not great? I carved it myself.

304
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,429
If you look here, you can
see the saddle and helmet.

305
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,439
I still need to carve this
part a little more though.

306
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,439
Get that out of my face.

307
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,010
What is so great about a wood carving?

308
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,749
Once I become a ruler, I
will rule the entire cavalry.

309
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,520
How can a princess become a ruler?

310
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,619
How dare you talk to a princess that way?

311
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,619
Only a prince can become a ruler.

312
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,189
It is a man's job, not a woman's.

313
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,589
Says who? What kind of a rule is that?

314
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,683
you are a princess, but you
are even stupider than I am.

315
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,760
What is your name? Why?

316
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:50,670
I will teach you a lesson as
soon as I become the ruler.

317
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,670
You cannot become a ruler
just because you want to.

318
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,969
You need to receive
acknowledgement from our people.

319
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,499
What is your name?

320
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,570
My name is On Dal, the
future general of this country.

321
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:01,909
Hey!

322
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,800
I must go back.

323
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,969
If Go Won Pyo asked about the patrol,

324
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,439
he definitely would
have planned something.

325
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,570
Your Majesty, the guards will
not be enough to protect you.

326
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,810
I will go to the village
and gather more troops.

327
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,109
Please wait until I come back.

328
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,279
I will take you to the palace.

329
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Father.

330
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:32,000
Guard Her Majesty.

331
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,289
Hurry!

332
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Get going!

333
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,060
Please do not kill us. Please.

334
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,799
Go! Please show us mercy.

335
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,539
You have permission to
kill whoever fights back.

336
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:15,180
Arrest all the traitors!

337
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:22,779
What happened to the queen?

338
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,820
Tell me what happened!

339
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,289
What are you talking about?

340
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,060
We are not traitors!

341
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,289
What did we do?

342
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,289
Shut your mouth!

343
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,529
You expect to stay alive
after having killed the queen?

344
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,299
Take them.

345
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,399
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

346
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,500
Get up! Come on!

347
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,880
They turned us into traitors
so they could get rid of us.

348
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:50,979
I was a fool.

349
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,750
I underestimated Go Won Pyo.

350
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,989
You should go to
Yibullansa and hide there.

351
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,460
If you ask the monks for help,

352
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,690
they will send a letter
to Pyeongyang Castle.

353
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,359
Dal.

354
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:09,299
I want you to lead the queen and princess.

355
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,870
What? How?

356
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Get to your senses.

357
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,239
This is a life and death situation.

358
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,310
I will stay here.

359
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,810
Your Majesty. Mother.

360
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,950
This happened because of me.

361
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,880
I cannot leave my
people and just run away.

362
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,989
But... I will...

363
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,489
deal with this.

364
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,589
Leave this place to me.

365
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,460
Meanwhile, I want you to follow him.

366
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,669
No, I want to stay with you.

367
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,669
You are the princess of Goguryeo.

368
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,539
Keep your dignity.

369
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,409
If anything happens to me, make sure...

370
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,739
you tell your father everything.

371
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,149
Until then,

372
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,919
this stone will keep you safe.

373
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,919
Mother.

374
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,500
Please take good care of the princess.

375
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,370
You are the only person
who knows the forest.

376
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,940
This time, do not ever let go of the rope.

377
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,810
Do you understand?

378
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:31,109
Yes.

379
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,129
Princess.

380
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,030
Let go.

381
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,479
Hurry.

382
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,050
Move it!

383
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,619
Go!

384
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,040
My goodness. Please show us mercy.

385
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,790
Spare us! Stop what you are doing!

386
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,889
General! General!

387
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:21,200
No one here is a traitor!

388
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,800
What do you think you are doing?

389
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,570
Withdraw your troops right now.

390
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,430
Long time no see, Hyeop.

391
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,460
Go Won Pyo.

392
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,099
What do you think you are doing?

393
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,269
That is what I would like to ask.

394
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,400
I thought you left to patrol our land.

395
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,269
But I guess your goal
was to conspire against me.

396
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:47,749
We pledged our alliance to Goguryeo.

397
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,979
What made you become so disgraceful?

398
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,320
Did you suddenly become greedy for power?

399
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:56,089
You arrogant punk. Get out of my way.

400
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:00,330
I have no interest in you and your tribe.

401
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,259
Go Won Pyo.

402
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,300
Withdraw your troops right now.

403
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:10,369
Do you think you will be able to
get away with killing the queen?

404
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,139
Do you not understand?

405
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,580
His Majesty was the person who told me...

406
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:21,680
to kill you.

407
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:08,700
No!

408
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,050
Your Majesty.

409
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,690
I will not forgive you even after I die.

410
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:49,759
You will never be able
to take over Goguryeo.

411
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,869
Goguryeo is...

412
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,999
already mine.

413
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,239
Your Majesty!

414
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:11,349
Your Majesty.

415
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,200
If you admit that you are a traitor,

416
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,900
I will spare the lives of everyone else.

417
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:34,280
General.

418
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,150
No, General!

419
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,780
Do not do it! No!

420
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,580
General! Please do not!

421
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,619
General!

422
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,889
General!

423
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:00,839
General, do not!

424
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,050
Princess.

425
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,219
I cannot go. I cannot go alone.

426
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,759
How am I supposed to do this?

427
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,359
Then do you just want to die?

428
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,160
My father and the queen stayed
there to fight so they could save us.

429
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,520
Do you want them to fight in vain?

430
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,970
How can you call yourself
the princess of Goguryeo?

431
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,210
I thought you wanted to become the ruler.

432
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,540
If you give up now,

433
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,609
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

434
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,609
Who says I am going to give up?

435
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Keep climbing!

436
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,139
No, get up here!

437
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,639
If you give up now,

438
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,940
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

439
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:14,310
Get up here!

440
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,280
Just keep climbing!

441
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,050
Keep climbing!

442
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,889
Hey!

443
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,110
Wol Gwang!

444
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,170
Where are you hiding, Wol Gwang?

445
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,180
Find Wol Gwang!

446
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,100
Tell me where Wol Gwang is.

447
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
I do not know.

448
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,870
Wol Gwang!

449
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,210
Where are you hiding? Wol
Gwang, where are you hiding?

450
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,450
I am going to find you
and rip you into pieces!

451
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,549
Mother.

452
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,719
Tell me where Wol Gwang is.

453
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,819
I do not know anything. Please spare me.

454
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,860
The Princess is missing.

455
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,489
Search the area thoroughly.

456
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Pyeonggang.

457
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,400
Ga Jin, are you okay?

458
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,299
8 YEARS LATER

459
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Is it clear?

460
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Let us go.

461
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Hey!

462
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,410
Who are you?

463
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,819
I heard about a group of weaklings
leeching off the late royal family.

464
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,319
And one of them is right here.

465
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:09,319
I am here to punish...

466
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,630
the brute of Goguryeo
on behalf of the universe.

467
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:16,169
When they said the group consisted
of mere assassins of low status,

468
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:17,999
they were talking about you.

469
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,850
I will be drinking your blood tonight.

470
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,479
It was the chief's order.

471
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,950
We must eradicate every
descendant of Goguryeo.

472
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,049
If you consider yourself as the
best swordswoman of Cheonjubang,

473
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,270
there is no room for mercy.

474
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,969
No!

475
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,039
Ga Jin, what is wrong?
Are you out of your mind?

476
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
No, Ga Jin.

477
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,440
Go ahead. You too. Stop it.

478
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,210
Ga Jin, you cannot do this.

479
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,110
How will you explain this to the chief?

480
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:53,219
Did you have another nightmare?

481
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,069
You already have nightmares.

482
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,140
But when you wake up from
them, you have headaches.

483
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,640
How could you live in that state?

484
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,410
You have been...

485
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,749
having more nightmares lately.

486
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,350
Perhaps, your job is catching up with you.

487
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:27,759
And that is why you must
be having piercing headaches.

488
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,819
You said it was because I had a fever.

489
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,690
What?

490
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,460
You said I had a fever when I was little.

491
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,999
And that is why my brain is messed up.

492
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,229
You said that is why I cannot
remember my past clearly.

493
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,600
Right. Yes.

494
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,069
Gosh. This all happened
because of that darned fever.

495
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,610
Of course. Yes.

496
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,579
Dad. Yes?

497
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,650
Give me a bit more time.

498
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:58,420
I have something in mind.

499
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,450
What is that?

500
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:10,130
I told you to kill every
single person from Goguryeo.

501
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,130
Tae Mo followed my order as my swordsman.

502
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,769
How come you scolded Tae
Mo for following my order?

503
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,739
I believed Cheonjubang was not...

504
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,610
justified to kill a baby.

505
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,840
When that baby is old
enough to wield a sword,

506
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,150
it could have been directed at you and me.

507
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,880
Have you forgotten that our
sworn enemy is Goguryeo?

508
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,690
You graciously welcomed
my father and me...

509
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,319
when we had nowhere to go...

510
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,299
after losing our family to
the soldiers of Goguryeo.

511
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:39,329
And I will never forget your kindness.

512
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:43,160
That is why after being
selected as the swordswoman,

513
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,670
I have followed all of your orders
at the expense of my own life.

514
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,569
However,

515
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,539
I do not wish to see blood anymore.

516
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:00,249
If I could live my life in peace
with my father working with salt,

517
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,319
I would have nothing more to ask for.

518
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,350
Please...

519
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,819
give me your blessing...

520
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,229
to stop taking away lives.

521
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,549
It cannot seem to fly
when the door is wide open.

522
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,420
Do you think you can fly?

523
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:39,319
I am not trying to fly.

524
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,090
I am only asking, so I can live my life.

525
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,590
I want to be free of nightmares and pain.

526
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,160
I want to live a peaceful life.

527
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,460
Please...

528
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,469
consider my request.

529
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,309
Get up.

530
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,509
In a few days,

531
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,549
the King of Goguryeo will climb
to Cheonjedan at Mount Songhak.

532
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:14,420
Where are you, my ladies?

533
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,620
Where are you?

534
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,219
There you are.

535
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,460
I want you to kill...

536
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,460
the enemy of Cheonjubang,

537
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:25,600
the King of Goguryeo.

538
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,170
I have already come up
with a plan and prepared for it.

539
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:34,340
You will act as my sword
and stab him. That will be...

540
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:37,279
your last mission.

541
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,009
"Last"?

542
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,850
That will be the end of your
duty as my swordswoman.

543
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,829
Bring death to that man,

544
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,999
Pyeongwon.

545
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,079
Gosh. We must have caught something.

546
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,150
We caught it. Really?

547
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,920
We got it. Let us hurry.

548
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,190
Hurry up.

549
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,890
We got it. I wonder what we got.

550
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,559
Hurry. Let us go.

551
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,059
We got one!

552
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:00,989
Score. We got it.

553
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:03,833
We got a big one.

554
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,569
It is still alive. Cut them.

555
01:01:05,569 --> 01:01:06,630
Cut where?

556
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,600
Cut the antlers. But
it is still breathing.

557
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,700
Come on.

558
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,100
Cut them. All right.

559
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,680
What? What was that?

560
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,309
It hurts! Who are you?

561
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,910
Who did that?

562
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,219
Let go of the deer.

563
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:31,529
Hey, who do you think you are?

564
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:35,829
Hey, are you okay?

565
01:01:36,229 --> 01:01:37,299
It hurts, right?

566
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,870
The deer feels pain too. Come here.

567
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,370
Even if animals cannot speak,
they still hate being in pain.

568
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,940
Gosh. You are unbelievable.

569
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,150
You are going to get hurt too!

570
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,090
Hey. You little brat.

571
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,450
Sorry.

572
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,019
I really hope in your next life,

573
01:02:37,259 --> 01:02:38,960
you will be a human.

574
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,100
When you do, do not be awful like them.

575
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:45,999
Be good.

576
01:02:59,749 --> 01:03:00,749
Gosh.

577
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,860
No need to thank me.

578
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,229
Hey.

579
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,210
You cannot leave just yet.

580
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,960
What are you doing?

581
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,999
I know you.

582
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,539
I know you.
