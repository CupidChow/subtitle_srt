1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,883
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:10,857
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,509
Hurry and run away.

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,184
If you wish to save the old woman,

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,870
do not resist my blade.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,700
My child.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,900
Dal.

8
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,240
EPISODE 12

9
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,950
It is fortunate. The
arrow missed vital spots.

10
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:04,919
Is she okay?

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,920
She will be once the wound heals.

12
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,870
Then she will be fine.

13
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,809
Dal.

14
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,156
Calm down and wash yourself.

15
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
Where did you go?

16
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,259
I buried him.

17
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,800
What?

18
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,819
If I left him there,

19
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,250
he would lure wild animals.

20
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,130
Forget about it.

21
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,489
It could not have been helped.

22
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,000
It is not your fault.

23
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:29,093
They were people sent
by Go Won Pyo to kill us.

24
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,314
If not for you, both Mother...

25
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,453
and I would have been in danger.

26
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,609
You speak like...

27
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,269
when you were a killer.

28
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:48,469
Dal.

29
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,999
Dal.

30
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,369
Mother.

31
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,329
Mother. Are you awake?

32
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,822
Mother. Are you all right?

33
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,700
Water.

34
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,256
You should have stayed at home.

35
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,353
Why did you pack your things?

36
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,356
You should be training in some mountain.

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,200
What are you doing here?

38
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,210
Were you hurt?

39
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,469
No.

40
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,689
I just need you to recover.

41
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:45,839
Dal.

42
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,549
Does he feel guilty
because of what he did?

43
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes.

44
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,424
It is because that was
the first time he hurt a man.

45
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:00,599
My child.

46
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,270
You.

47
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,509
Were you hurt?

48
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,640
I am fine.

49
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Thanks to Dal.

50
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,470
Okay, then.

51
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,109
That is a relief.

52
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,084
Scholars who were
writing a petition in secret...

53
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,770
suffered a huge blow.

54
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,850
I heard that some
even died trying to flee.

55
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,356
You are ruining my appetite.

56
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,656
I say this out of concern for you.

57
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,956
I heard of the impregnation ceremony.

58
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,820
Can you afford to
drink on a night like this?

59
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,030
How did you know of that?

60
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,490
Pardon? I only mentioned a ceremony.

61
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,822
I never said what it was for.

62
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,770
I knew it.

63
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,669
You were the middleman.

64
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,483
Royal Consort Hyeon wishes
so much to get pregnant.

65
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,156
Even the lowliest court maid knows that.

66
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,914
If there were a ceremony,

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,644
that would be the only reason.

68
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,330
You get away yet again.

69
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,344
You have great explanations.

70
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,150
Anyway, I told you clearly.

71
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,087
Today, I plan to find out...

72
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,482
everything you are hiding.

73
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,269
So, shall we begin?

74
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:50,869
Begin what?

75
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,844
We will take turns to ask
what we want to know,

76
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,650
and must answer truthfully.

77
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,284
If you think the answer is a lie,

78
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,683
you drink as a penalty.

79
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,622
You are very strange tonight.

80
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,330
I am not just strange.

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,400
I can be fun as well.

82
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:12,809
I shall go first.

83
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,239
Do you...

84
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,099
love me?

85
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,599
Commander.

86
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,099
Commander.

87
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,352
You must drink if you will not answer.

88
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,270
Go on.

89
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,460
Me, love you?

90
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,700
What gave you that idea?

91
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,999
I asked the question.

92
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,170
Now answer.

93
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,220
Do you love me?

94
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,169
I do not.

95
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,883
I do not believe you.

96
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,483
If you call a truth a lie,

97
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:05,169
then I have no choice.

98
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,000
Fine.

99
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,079
This time...

100
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,599
it is your turn.

101
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,414
You became the Crown Prince's master...

102
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,687
and Head of the King's Bodyguards.

103
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,757
It is because of the Princess, right?

104
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:32,419
To gain her affection
whenever she returns.

105
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,456
She has married another man.

106
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,883
Why should I wait for her?

107
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:41,939
That is a lie.

108
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,204
We might both get very
drunk on penalty drinks.

109
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,090
To this question, I really hope that...

110
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,493
you give an honest answer.

111
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,269
Ask me whatever you will.

112
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:07,229
Since when...

113
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,969
did you start?

114
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,209
Spying for Silla.

115
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,590
Or are you originally from Silla,

116
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:34,019
and did you smuggle
yourself into Goguryeo?

117
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,946
Do you want to lose your
head instead of taking a shot?

118
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,620
General. Later.

119
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,220
Go Sang Cheol returned gravely wounded.

120
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,600
I will have you watched.

121
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,953
Do not think of running away.

122
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,740
Father.

123
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,750
Why did you go against your word?

124
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,213
What word? I said that...

125
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,144
I would take care of anything
regarding the Princess.

126
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,883
Why did you send your men?

127
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,280
Did you really...

128
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,200
try to hurt the Princess?

129
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,183
You are wrong about one
and right about the other.

130
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,456
I never gave you my word. And yes,

131
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,254
I did give the order to kill the Princess.

132
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,993
As well as On Hyeop's son.

133
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,484
The bud has grown,
and it is only time to nip it.

134
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,690
You cannot do this without
so much as a word to me.

135
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:03,199
What?

136
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:08,284
Did you not smuggle out
Daedaero without my permission?

137
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,213
I told you to arrest Kim
Pyeong Ji at that gathering.

138
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:12,739
You ruined my plan.

139
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,399
Rather than confine him,

140
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,783
you must make him an ally.

141
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Either way, the spark was lit.

142
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,150
Now we just have to kindle the fire.

143
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,770
What fire?

144
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,819
The weeds that are in the way.

145
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,490
The fire will eliminate them all.

146
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:42,909
Be cautious.

147
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,150
The one who lights the fire...

148
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:54,152
is most likely to get burned.

149
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:05,939
Yes.

150
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,930
I will remember that.

151
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,199
Dal.

152
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,910
The men I cut down.

153
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:48,579
I see their eyes.

154
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,570
I hear their screams.

155
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420
The more I try to forget them,

156
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,864
the clearer they become
and it drives me crazy.

157
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,517
How many more must I kill...

158
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,530
and cut down?

159
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,770
What we wish to do.

160
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,252
Is it really worth that much?

161
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,249
If it tortures you too much, you can stop.

162
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,816
You suffer so much
that you have nightmares.

163
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,186
You need not force yourself.

164
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,819
Do I not look pathetic to you?

165
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,920
No. Why would you say that?

166
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,629
What you do not like,

167
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
I do not like either.

168
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,850
We are married.

169
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:19,949
What did you say?

170
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,713
We must suppress the Sunno Tribe?

171
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,495
Who do you think supported
those who were writing petitions?

172
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,914
They must have been in contact
with Sunno Tribe survivors.

173
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,184
They are currently gathering
men and making weapons.

174
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,353
They plotted treason once.

175
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,416
They would not hesitate to try again.

176
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,090
If Gochuga is right,

177
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,056
you must hastily... That is nonsense.

178
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,813
The Princess is there. Why
would they plot treason?

179
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,211
Are you trying to turn my
own daughter into a traitor?

180
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,590
She is probably being threatened.

181
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:58,284
On Hyeop's son is holding her...

182
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,490
and using her as a hostage. So...

183
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,884
give us your permission...

184
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,343
to eliminate the traitors
and save the Princess.

185
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:06,389
Not a chance!

186
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,581
I will not send my men
based on your insistence alone.

187
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,730
Please be understanding.

188
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,843
Please be understanding.
Please be understanding.

189
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:16,729
Bodyguards!

190
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,787
As of this moment, anyone...

191
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,553
who mentions treason or suppression...

192
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,983
is to be killed in the King's name!

193
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,830
I will obey your command.

194
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,220
Salute! Salute!

195
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,822
Go Won Pyo's private army?

196
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,620
Thanks to Dal, I got back safely.

197
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,640
Mother is safe too.

198
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
The cowards.

199
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,943
I would have killed
them all if I were there.

200
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:53,799
As if.

201
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,514
Is it not the first time that
Go Won Pyo sent assassins?

202
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,453
So the situation is not good.

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,317
He made an attempt for my life.

204
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
He will not stop now.

205
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,943
He can come at us.

206
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,583
We will fight to the death.

207
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:13,322
Yes, friend. Now we are on the same page.

208
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,830
Do not worry.

209
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,922
Our kids have learned how to use a blade.

210
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,870
Silence!

211
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,123
It is not about the Gyeru Tribe.

212
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:26,729
They might...

213
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,757
send an army to wipe us out.

214
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,840
An army?

215
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:35,016
To frame us for treason and kill us all.

216
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,843
They turned us into traitors
so they could get rid of us.

217
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,316
General. I will look after the tribe.

218
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,390
When you suggested we revive our tribe,

219
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,860
I expected a danger
like this would befall us.

220
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,070
And so...

221
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:34,267
I sent a secret letter to our
scattered people to join us.

222
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,570
Chief.

223
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:42,499
Princess.

224
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,619
Please lend us your wisdom.

225
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,882
You twins must speed up
the training of the grown men.

226
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,269
Yes. Yes.

227
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,269
Father.

228
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,916
Yes? Yes, your wish is my command.

229
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,714
We must block the entrance
with a fence made with stakes.

230
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,413
Pung Gae can get the wood.

231
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:04,684
Father, you are in charge
of making the fence.

232
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,730
Do not worry.

233
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,744
We also need lots of food.

234
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,430
Do not worry about that.

235
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,014
I will go through our stores
and steam what we can...

236
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,153
and dry the meat and make jerky.

237
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,343
I will help out too.

238
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,029
Thank you. Good girl.

239
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,519
Think of the late General On's wish.

240
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,986
Please help us as best you can.

241
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,730
Yes, Chief! Yes, Chief!

242
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,570
Chief.

243
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,157
I want to ask you something.

244
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,270
About Dal's father.

245
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,410
General On Hyeop.

246
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,010
How far must we go?

247
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,949
We are almost there.

248
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,383
At least tell me where we are going.

249
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:54,589
Just follow me.

250
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,723
I am in no mood for jokes.

251
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,389
Do you not remember this path?

252
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,400
As a child,

253
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:13,293
you said you followed your
father to a grave covered in stone.

254
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,923
I asked the Chief about it...

255
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,760
and also heard from Mother.

256
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,749
About General On.

257
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,930
What about my father?

258
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,456
He wished that you
would never hold a sword.

259
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,612
I think it was because he
knew you would be like this.

260
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,370
I wondered about that.

261
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,919
Who is buried in that tomb?

262
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,569
Do you not want to know?

263
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,900
No. No!

264
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,930
He said it was his fault.

265
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,623
So he did not even adorn the grave.

266
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,900
But...

267
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,670
deep down in his heart,

268
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,516
he put a rock on it instead.

269
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,170
Where are we, Father?

270
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,829
It looks like a grave.

271
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,540
Later.

272
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,670
I will tell you later.

273
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,957
When you are ready to be a true fighter.

274
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,169
Dal.

275
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:40,609
Like a fool,

276
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,182
I had failed to keep my woman safe.

277
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:48,439
You...

278
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,482
must not follow in my footsteps.

279
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:54,499
Father.

280
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,244
The great cause of
protecting the empire...

281
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,284
or the justification
of saving the people...

282
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,250
These are...

283
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,129
all nonsense.

284
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,150
The only person you
must risk your life to protect.

285
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,219
And the only reason a
man must wield a sword.

286
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,529
She is your only reason.

287
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,810
Are you ready?

288
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,999
Yes.

289
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:40,529
I will protect my woman.

290
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,569
I finally realized...

291
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,179
why I must fight.

292
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,590
I am still contemplating
what to do with you.

293
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,853
As you held a superstitious ritual,

294
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,083
you must be beheaded.

295
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,033
But you must be curious
about my humble talent.

296
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
If I am as good as people say,

297
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,789
that would be a waste, would it not?

298
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,869
Do not think you can save
yourself with your rash words.

299
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,863
Before I came into the
palace, I had a reading.

300
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,550
A dangerous aura has engulfed the King.

301
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,950
Soon, he will be facing
a serious misfortune.

302
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:57,899
Shut your mouth.

303
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,813
Are you trying to stall
time with your nonsense?

304
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:00,939
If I am wrong,

305
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,329
you can behead me then.

306
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:10,643
I have no idea how they could spy...

307
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:13,116
on our meeting for the secret appeal.

308
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,011
Do you think General Go
had something to do with that?

309
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,640
No.

310
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,484
If it were not for him, I would
have been caught then...

311
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,690
and imprisoned.

312
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,523
Please do not suspect him.

313
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:28,269
Anyway,

314
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,514
Go Won Pyo and the Five Tribe council...

315
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,444
will not back down this easily.

316
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,843
Perhaps, they might
gather private guards...

317
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,649
and attack the Sunno Tribe.

318
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,200
I will not allow that.

319
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,343
Send a secret message to the Jeollo Tribe,

320
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,749
so they can dispatch an army of men.

321
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:46,514
If they leave the border unguarded,

322
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,544
how will we stop invasions
from Northern Zhou?

323
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,514
We crumble either from within or outside.

324
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,040
It is all the same.

325
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,419
I will put an end...

326
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,617
to this fight between
Go Won Pyo and myself.

327
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,400
You do not seem well.

328
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,289
Are you afraid?

329
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,890
Not knowing what I should fear...

330
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,239
scares me.

331
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,223
Your stepfather bragged...

332
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,630
how his stepdaughter...

333
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,453
was as brave and smart as a son could be.

334
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,880
You are too kind.

335
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,920
That is why I am giving
you an important task.

336
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,730
Secretly make...

337
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,170
some medicine.

338
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,552
May I ask who will be taking it?

339
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,300
The King.

340
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:47,422
He will be poisoned with the medicine.

341
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:51,741
And that medicine will be
rescuing this rotten empire.

342
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,613
Due to his acute stomach illness
that causes vomiting and diarrhea,

343
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,143
even the royal physician
who will rush over...

344
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,784
cannot find out why he
is sick. And in the end,

345
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,590
the King will pass away within that night.

346
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,200
Can you make that happen?

347
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:16,439
However,

348
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:18,969
how could I...

349
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,887
Show me what you can do with my support.

350
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,570
Or you will face death for
learning about my grand plan.

351
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:28,269
Choose.

352
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,313
You became a spy for a favor
to a man who saved your life.

353
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,759
At that young age,

354
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,670
with that determination,

355
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,913
you crossed the border?

356
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:59,813
When I began on this
journey, the peril of it...

357
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,499
kept things interesting.

358
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,640
How?

359
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,292
Plotting schemes and
manipulating people was fun.

360
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,661
Just like you are trying
to come up with a way...

361
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,217
to use me instead of reporting me.

362
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,684
Seeing how you have
reached that on your own,

363
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,823
things will be easier on my end.

364
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,583
I am sure you know it
is the Princess' plan...

365
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,589
to bring back the Sunno Tribe.

366
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,784
I also know that the son of
General On Hyeop has joined her.

367
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,657
Tell me everything you know.

368
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,849
Tell me why the Princess
is coming to your store...

369
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,953
and why you are helping them.

370
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,484
That is a promise between
the Princess and me.

371
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,170
So you will not tell me?

372
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,048
If that is your answer,
you will go straight to jail.

373
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,313
You tell me it is my decision to make,

374
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,119
but you are threatening me.

375
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,290
Indeed. Like father, like son.

376
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,982
Are you saying I am like my father?

377
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,684
What are you talking about?

378
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,570
Last night,

379
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,200
I have met with Gochuga.

380
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:17,801
He secretly ordered me to make
some poisonous herbal tonic.

381
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,717
He said it was intended for the King.

382
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,583
You will decide whether I live or not.

383
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:32,025
So please tell me how I
can get out of this alive.

384
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:36,689
Should I serve the poisonous herbal tonic?

385
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:40,316
Or should I let your father end my life?

386
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,460
The Head of Bodyguards is here.

387
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:10,202
Is the King all right?

388
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,356
I am protecting him day and night.

389
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:13,802
Yes. You ought to.

390
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,223
Father.

391
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,623
Never mind.

392
00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:45,712
Dal.

393
00:30:49,463 --> 00:30:50,313
Dal.

394
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,737
How come you did not tell
me that you were leaving?

395
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:57,197
I told you that I was
going back to the mountain.

396
00:30:57,203 --> 00:31:00,237
I did not know that you would be
leaving this early in the morning.

397
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:03,006
If I were to stay to say goodbye,
my mother would start nagging me.

398
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:04,506
And I know that you are busy.

399
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,247
You have a lot of
work to do in the village.

400
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:09,517
Even so. How could you
leave without even a goodbye?

401
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:12,497
I am sorry. Please take
good care of my mother.

402
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:14,023
I will be back.

403
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:15,942
Dal.

404
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,392
Do not go if that is not in your heart.

405
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,143
We have a lot to do here.

406
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,542
Do you remember?

407
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:29,297
When you went to Pyeongyang
Castle to get your memories back?

408
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,703
That is what I told you to stop you.

409
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,313
Whatever happens, I
ought to face it head-on.

410
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:39,313
Otherwise, I would never improve.

411
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,642
Great! Keep going.

412
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,452
Like this. Like that.

413
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:05,622
Hey. Nice.

414
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:08,192
Here I am! You are here.

415
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,509
I do not know what destiny they hold.

416
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:50,147
I wonder if I am pushing them...

417
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:52,086
to death to fulfill my goals.

418
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:58,862
I feel as if what happened
to Dal is my fault.

419
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:03,666
He did not wish to play the world's game.

420
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:07,740
But he is on a tough
road because he met me.

421
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:11,472
We cannot place any blame for such things.

422
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:13,945
That is done out of trust and love.

423
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:19,912
Dal is not the one who
is suffering from pain.

424
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:25,255
You have yet to shake
off your confusion as well.

425
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:30,683
"Confusion".

426
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:35,025
What can I do to rid myself of confusion?

427
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:41,539
You are asking me for the
answer you already have.

428
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:53,103
Wol Gwang!

429
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:06,742
Wol Gwang!

430
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:17,122
Ga Jin.

431
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,206
What brings you here?

432
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,892
I am here to teach you.

433
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,063
And I will learn as well.

434
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:33,183
What do you mean?

435
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,996
This is a real sword. On Dal.

436
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:45,993
I am your master.

437
00:34:58,782 --> 00:34:59,822
I fooled you.

438
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:02,377
I wanted to use you,

439
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,783
so I stole your heart and your life.

440
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:06,903
I know.

441
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,057
I see you in great pain, but I
never did anything to ease that pain.

442
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:18,913
No.

443
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:21,797
I knew what you were
doing, but I still chose you,

444
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:22,797
so you did not fool me.

445
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:26,466
Why are you doing this for me?
Why? I do not deserve your love.

446
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,992
Have you forgotten?

447
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,910
You are the destiny I chose.

448
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:32,033
Why?

449
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:00,392
I am scared...

450
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:03,462
that we might change...

451
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,342
and will eventually be ruined.

452
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:07,843
Do not fear.

453
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,902
We will never change.

454
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:20,612
Dal.

455
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:31,913
My dear wife.

456
00:36:36,313 --> 00:36:37,353
You are mine.

457
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:44,544
This is the guardian stone
my mother left behind.

458
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,383
This stone will keep you safe.

459
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:56,086
Please take good care of the princess.

460
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:00,382
Right.

461
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:03,683
I remember this necklace.

462
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,735
The late Queen gave you this that day.

463
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,775
And this will keep you safe now.

464
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:13,322
And this represents...

465
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:17,073
our shared fate as husband and wife.

466
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,586
Are you making any progress
with your martial arts training?

467
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:36,986
General Go's hands are
full with the bodyguards,

468
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:38,672
so I am training alone.

469
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,996
If you miss 1 day, it takes
10 to get back on track.

470
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,096
Make sure you work hard.

471
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:47,102
Yes. I will keep that in mind.

472
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,721
By the way, is it because of
Gochuga that the palace is...

473
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,132
under strict guard?

474
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:56,777
It is none of your business.

475
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:00,495
I beg you to deal with the
matter with the utmost severity.

476
00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:05,063
Now eat. Yes.

477
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:14,582
Father.

478
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:17,113
Father.

479
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:19,253
Father!

480
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:22,736
Father, are you okay? Father.

481
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:25,282
Is anybody there? Father!

482
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:37,516
How dare you show up here?

483
00:40:38,283 --> 00:40:40,086
I heard that His Majesty is unwell.

484
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:42,456
Did you forget that you
are under probation?

485
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:44,557
Still... Go back to your chambers.

486
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:47,363
Why would you cry? It brings bad bad luck.

487
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,937
Explain what happened.

488
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:02,137
He has taken medicine
for acute indigestion,

489
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:03,907
but he is not getting better.

490
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:05,876
His heart is beating too fast as well.

491
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,549
I cannot figure out what the problem is.

492
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:11,376
How can you say that
as the royal physician?

493
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:14,115
Could there have been poison in his food?

494
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:16,743
Won.

495
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:20,287
All his food was thoroughly
examined, but no poison was found.

496
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:22,456
Vomiting and diarrhea are clearly...

497
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:24,126
symptoms of acute indigestion.

498
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:26,596
Then why don't you try
other kinds of medicine?

499
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:29,502
Medicine should be
used with extreme caution.

500
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:33,583
Father! Your Majesty.

501
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:36,292
Are you okay, Father?

502
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:39,913
A dangerous aura has engulfed the King.

503
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:41,702
Soon,

504
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:46,082
he will be facing a serious misfortune.

505
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,735
Your prediction was right.

506
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,797
His Majesty is in critical condition.

507
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:02,483
I am sorry to hear that.

508
00:42:02,502 --> 00:42:04,182
If you are so excellent,

509
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:07,866
do you also know how
to prevent misfortunes?

510
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,805
It is nothing to boast about,

511
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:13,213
but I do know a thing or
two about medicinal herbs.

512
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:14,533
If I may,

513
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:18,446
I would like to have an
audience with His Majesty...

514
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,652
before I come up with a solution.

515
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:42,942
Prepare an antidote.

516
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:44,632
You made the locks.

517
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:48,147
I am sure you can make the keys as well.

518
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:50,086
That was not just any poison.

519
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:52,203
Whoever poisoned him...

520
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:54,746
managed to disguise it as a natural death.

521
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,687
I cannot guarantee that
my antidote will be effective.

522
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:58,543
Mo Yong.

523
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:06,297
Just follow my father's
order and prepare an antidote.

524
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:08,036
That way, you can be safe.

525
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:15,086
Still, I will not be able to
tell His Majesty in advance.

526
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:20,530
Even if I was interrogated
about who poisoned His Majesty,

527
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,416
I could not answer that it was my father.

528
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:25,522
In that case,

529
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:29,025
how are you going to use the antidote?

530
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,637
The royal physician will
demand an explanation.

531
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:39,588
Even with the antidote, I
will be faced with a dilemma.

532
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:44,852
Do you...

533
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:48,263
trust me?

534
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:00,923
Lady Hae says this
medicine is your lifeline.

535
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,673
You do not deserve a comfortable death.

536
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:24,039
Wait until your empire falls...

537
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:26,543
and your children vomit blood.

538
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:29,292
Take your last breath...

539
00:44:30,153 --> 00:44:33,417
as a beautiful misery
unfolds before your very eyes.

540
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:25,983
The King survived.

541
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,907
Are you sure you prepared
the poison properly?

542
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:32,193
I would never...

543
00:45:32,783 --> 00:45:34,583
dare to disobey your order.

544
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:40,382
I guarantee that the poison was effective.

545
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:48,942
Get lost.

546
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,592
I am sorry.

547
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:58,656
It is to transfer
control of the military...

548
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:00,182
to the Five Tribes.

549
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:03,612
Please approve it.

550
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:07,643
Is this why you wanted
to see me so urgently?

551
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:11,336
The ongoing rebellious activities
must be suppressed immediately.

552
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,275
I beg you to give an order...

553
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,082
on behalf of the royal family.

554
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:22,560
Once the Crown Prince approves,

555
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:25,023
two goals will be achieved.

556
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:29,926
By pressuring the Crown
Prince into giving an order,

557
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,227
we can first suppress the rebellion.

558
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:34,566
After that, when the time is right,

559
00:47:37,003 --> 00:47:39,467
we will hold the Crown Prince responsible.

560
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:41,406
With His Majesty still alive,

561
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:44,914
the Crown Prince is
giving a royal order himself?

562
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:49,217
That would make him an
undutiful and disloyal son.

563
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:50,956
He would sustain his life,

564
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:55,330
but he will not be able to
keep his title as crown prince.

565
00:47:56,622 --> 00:47:57,742
That is why...

566
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:01,323
I asked you to come. To read a fortune.

567
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:04,042
Will Prince Geon Mu...

568
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,553
rise to the throne?

569
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:18,432
I...

570
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:26,813
cannot sign this.

571
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:30,916
Your Highness...

572
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:32,855
How dare I make a decision...

573
00:48:33,592 --> 00:48:36,059
that is meant for the King to decide?

574
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:38,265
But this is an urgent matter.

575
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:41,395
Besides, before my father had fallen ill,

576
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:44,811
he made clear about the
fate of the Sunno Tribe.

577
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,222
I cannot...

578
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:49,845
cross his will as his son.

579
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,842
You are a filial son, Your Highness.

580
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,747
But you should consider the
safety of the Princess also.

581
00:48:57,753 --> 00:49:00,846
The fact that the Sunno
Tribe is threatening my sister...

582
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:02,652
is merely a claim you made.

583
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:04,356
Because that is the fact.

584
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:08,266
But my sister is not someone
who will be controlled by others.

585
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:10,632
And I do not...

586
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,697
wish to be controlled by others either.

587
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:15,983
Your Highness...

588
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,506
Your Highness! Your Highness.

589
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:24,163
How can you be laughing?

590
00:49:24,313 --> 00:49:27,257
Is the young Crown
Prince's guts not admirable?

591
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,376
If we cannot get through
to him with a justification,

592
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:31,047
then we should get through
to him using our skills.

593
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,416
What do you mean by skills?

594
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:33,846
The Sunno Tribe can be...

595
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:37,317
subjugated by the private
army of the Gyeru Tribe alone.

596
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:39,990
The advance guard must already be there.

597
00:49:41,463 --> 00:49:45,175
You only need to agree on
behalf of the Five Tribe council.

598
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:51,486
We need two more men to
guard around the Fox Rock, right?

599
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:54,507
The byroad to the village
can be seen well from there.

600
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,193
You and San can leave.

601
00:49:57,313 --> 00:49:59,277
What? This is the Sunno Tribe's fight.

602
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:01,676
The Gokturks, such as yourselves,
do not need to get involved.

603
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:02,876
Hey, Sa Pung Gae.

604
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:05,349
I am just worried that you might die.

605
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:09,286
I mean, you are the type to act up.

606
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:12,956
So what I am trying to say is...

607
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:16,613
Dong Mun!

608
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:23,893
No, Jin.

609
00:50:36,753 --> 00:50:37,793
What is this?

610
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:42,217
It belonged to General On Hyeop.

611
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:44,823
Please make a good one out of it. Okay.

612
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:48,886
If it is a sword that Dal will use,
then we need to do a good job.

613
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:49,742
Chief!

614
00:50:51,203 --> 00:50:52,643
There is... Chief!

615
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:57,553
Chief!

616
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:07,022
You came right on time.

617
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:11,646
This is Woo Yeong who used to
serve General On Hyeop with me.

618
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,519
This is Princess Pyeonggang.

619
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:17,892
It is my honor to meet you, Your Highness.

620
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,042
My name is Woo Yeong.

621
00:51:22,063 --> 00:51:23,183
Please get up.

622
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:30,182
It seems like...

623
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:34,207
he came here with his army as
soon as he got my secret letter.

624
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:37,106
The old comrades of our
tribe are also gathering...

625
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:38,707
to make their way here.

626
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:41,307
We must take part in
this important fight...

627
00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:43,446
as we spent years in resentment.

628
00:51:43,922 --> 00:51:45,676
We are grateful, Your Highness.

629
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:48,549
I feel as though I
gained a thousand troops.

630
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:55,496
Princess Pyeonggang! Princess Pyeonggang!

631
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:00,632
Your Highness, we are in trouble!

632
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:18,322
You seem familiar.

633
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:24,625
How many of you are there?

634
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,293
How many weapons have you got?

635
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:30,836
There are 10,000 soldiers
and 1,000 war horses.

636
00:52:32,203 --> 00:52:33,643
Are you surprised?

637
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:39,553
Pung Gae!

638
00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:42,653
You worthless barbarian.

639
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:46,582
What? You do not deserve
to be called a human.

640
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:50,503
You piece of trash.

641
00:52:51,283 --> 00:52:52,323
Are you okay?

642
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:54,573
Darn it.

643
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:57,086
Down this mountain,

644
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,484
dozens of soldiers from the
Gyeru Tribe are stationed.

645
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:03,066
That means they are the advance guard.

646
00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:05,797
They must have spied out on
us, so they know we are fortified.

647
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:08,727
That must be why they
put a halt to the attack.

648
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:12,136
Just as you said, it was important
to build a fence around the village.

649
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:15,267
There is only a handful of them.
We should just get rid of them.

650
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:16,953
What if Jin gets hurt?

651
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:21,553
Do not worry.

652
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:25,086
I will come up with a way to save her.

653
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:36,143
Lady Hae.

654
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:45,642
Go wait for me at the dock.

655
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:55,307
Are you trying to run away at night?

656
00:53:55,313 --> 00:53:57,913
If I have to leave, will you let me go?

657
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:01,020
I have fulfilled all my duties.

658
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:02,872
It is not over yet.

659
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,029
I do not wish to let you go.

660
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:12,163
I do not want to be used anymore.

661
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:13,872
Especially...

662
00:54:16,543 --> 00:54:19,343
by a man who has
someone else in his heart.

663
00:54:23,882 --> 00:54:26,082
Then why do you not come into it?

664
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:29,532
I will open...

665
00:54:32,283 --> 00:54:33,643
my heart for you.

666
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:40,462
I guess you have not heard.

667
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:42,943
The person you love...

668
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,152
is in deep trouble.

669
00:54:58,283 --> 00:54:59,723
Jin, are you okay?

670
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:01,833
Yes.

671
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:05,483
What about you?

672
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:10,437
Why did you have to spew
such nonsense earlier?

673
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:14,054
I had to so that you and
the others would not be hurt.

674
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:18,982
That is right.

675
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:22,892
Who are you?

676
00:55:25,973 --> 00:55:30,389
I am the eldest daughter of the King
of Goguryeo, Princess Pyeonggang.

677
00:55:32,313 --> 00:55:33,433
Your Highness!

678
00:55:48,662 --> 00:55:49,862
Father. Father!

679
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,677
Geon. Because the
tangled fate still continues,

680
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:02,345
the King is on the throne.

681
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:04,193
Goguryeo originally...

682
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:07,822
belongs to our family.

683
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,250
It is time to take back our place.

684
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,303
Are you...

685
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:16,643
prepared?

686
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:25,102
Are you plotting a conspiracy?

687
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:31,032
It is a subjugation.

688
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:33,737
The cavalry and soldiers of
the Gyeru Tribe will gather...

689
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:35,423
before the break of dawn.

690
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:37,863
Go and attack.

691
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:41,093
Attack and...

692
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:43,116
seize the Princess you wanted. Father.

693
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:46,022
I started the fire, but
you should control it!

694
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:53,206
That is what the next chief
of the Gyeru Tribe should do.

695
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,022
I will...

696
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:13,322
accept your order.

697
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,146
Do not be burned by the fire.

698
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:17,943
Yes, Father.

699
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,042
Let them go! Yes, sir.

700
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:36,697
Everything will be okay now.
You should go back to the village.

701
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,903
What about you?

702
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:41,693
Pung Gae, are you okay?

703
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:45,737
We cannot go without
you. What will you do?

704
00:57:45,743 --> 00:57:47,247
I will follow you right after.

705
00:57:47,253 --> 00:57:48,606
You expect me to believe that?

706
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:50,745
Do not believe her. It is a lie.

707
00:57:51,652 --> 00:57:54,552
You must have forgotten,
but I am a princess.

708
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:58,517
I am the daughter of Goguryeo's king.

709
00:57:58,523 --> 00:58:00,323
Would they dare to hurt me?

710
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:04,112
Let them go. Yes, sir.

711
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,322
Be careful.

712
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:17,340
Take care of Dong Mun. What?

713
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:19,083
Why? What about you?

714
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:21,546
I need to go to Dal. What?

715
00:58:22,882 --> 00:58:24,242
Hey. I should go.

716
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:27,602
But... Hey, Pung Gae!

717
00:59:18,142 --> 00:59:18,992
Won.

718
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:23,393
Father.

719
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,393
Father.

720
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,693
Are you here, Master?

721
01:00:02,213 --> 01:00:03,063
Dal.

722
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,119
Pung Gae. What are you doing here?

723
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:29,175
THE CHIEF OF NORTHERN ZHOU

724
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,092
THE BORDER OF GOGURYEO

725
01:00:38,622 --> 01:00:40,302
Oh, no! What is going on?

726
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:43,226
It is the Northern Zhou! Sound the alarm!

727
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,102
It is the Northern Zhou!

728
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:48,096
It is the Northern Zhou! Get ready!

729
01:01:03,713 --> 01:01:06,180
Go back to Gochuga and tell him this.

730
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:09,817
Even the last man of the
Sunno Tribe will fight against him.

731
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:12,090
The same goes for the Gyeru Tribe.

732
01:01:15,723 --> 01:01:19,371
You must stop, Your Highness,
to put an end to this fight.

733
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:22,126
You want me to end a fight
that has not even begun?

734
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:24,399
The King is in critical condition.

735
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,730
The Crown Prince is all alone too.

736
01:01:27,102 --> 01:01:28,902
You must go back with me...

737
01:01:30,503 --> 01:01:32,503
to bring peace to this empire.

738
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:37,433
Please get up.

739
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:42,373
Your Highness.

740
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:47,622
You talk of peace,

741
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:50,856
and yet, you brought your army here?

742
01:01:50,862 --> 01:01:52,817
You only need to go back with me.

743
01:01:52,823 --> 01:01:55,156
This is Gochuga's order, is it not?

744
01:01:55,932 --> 01:01:57,292
That is not true.

745
01:01:58,463 --> 01:02:00,663
I am here for you, Your Highness.

746
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:02,396
I am here for you and Goguryeo.

747
01:02:02,402 --> 01:02:03,682
If I follow you,

748
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:07,873
everyone remaining here will be killed.

749
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:11,372
That is what you are here for.

750
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:19,993
You should...

751
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:22,893
just kill me only.

752
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:33,395
Whether or not you follow,

753
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:37,102
the traitors will be punished.

754
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:41,806
Please do not see anyone's blood...

755
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,552
and just come with me.

756
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:49,202
Ga Jin!

757
01:02:59,493 --> 01:03:00,343
Ga Jin.

758
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,293
Hey, Go Geon!

759
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:31,420
Do not kill innocent people,

760
01:03:32,493 --> 01:03:34,893
and have a one-on-one fight with me.

761
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:36,963
You are asking for your death.

762
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:38,773
Dal, stop it.

763
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:42,903
I cannot stop. You know I cannot.

764
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:49,570
You deserve more than death
considering what you did to Mother.

765
01:03:53,682 --> 01:03:55,042
Drop your swords.

766
01:03:57,753 --> 01:03:59,433
Hey, country bumpkin.

767
01:04:01,122 --> 01:04:03,122
You learned some petty tricks.

768
01:04:05,823 --> 01:04:09,407
Do you know how it feels to
kill a man with a real sword?

769
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:17,312
Even a wooden sword...

770
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,472
is too good for the likes of you.

771
01:04:40,862 --> 01:04:42,542
General Go! What is it?

772
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:46,836
The Northern Zhou has invaded our border.

773
01:05:11,623 --> 01:05:12,916
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

774
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:14,757
The Sunno Tribe is to head to the north...

775
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:16,487
and stop the Northern Zhou.

776
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:18,173
I only fight for you.

777
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:21,370
When the King told me that I am his son,

778
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:23,153
that I am your husband,

779
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:24,982
I was really glad.

780
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:28,206
I sent a false secret
message to Silla just for you.

781
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:30,106
There is a talented fortune-teller.

782
01:05:30,112 --> 01:05:33,824
That is the guy from Songhwadang,
the chief of Cheonjubang.
