EPISODE 4

4
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,596
I do not need any of you!

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,906
You are foolish and vulgar!

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,206
Who is there?

7
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:32,546
Do not hide there like a rat.

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,247
Show yourself.

9
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,067
Do you...

10
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,067
recognize me?

11
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,207
You are...

12
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,906
Yes. I am Pyeonggang.

13
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:08,447
Why did you do it?

14
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:12,717
Why did you abandon me?

15
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,626
It is a ghost.

16
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:18,527
I see a ghost.

17
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,796
Is anybody there? Father.

18
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,436
There is a ghost!

19
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,467
I saw a ghost!

20
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:28,167
There is a ghost in there!

21
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,577
Inside there! Get the ghost!

22
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,906
Get the ghost!

23
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:39,546
The ghost...

24
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:46,117
A ghost... I saw a ghost.

25
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,597
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

26
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:51,027
This is how sick my soul is.

27
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:07,376
This stone will keep you safe.

28
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:08,907
Princess.

29
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,627
LADY GONGSON, PYEONGGANG'S NANNY

30
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,996
Princess.

31
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,766
Nanny.

32
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,317
Princess. It is you, right?

33
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:47,917
I am sorry.

34
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,687
I stayed alive.

35
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:57,426
Why would you say that?

36
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:58,996
I am...

37
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:04,296
grateful that you are still alive.

38
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:07,167
I am so thankful.

39
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,206
Nanny.

40
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,116
Who did you say attacked?

41
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,716
You are such a mess.

42
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,127
It was me.

43
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,357
GO SANG CHEOL, GYERU TRIBE COMMANDER

44
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:32,197
General. They seemed to slack off,

45
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,567
so I teased them.

46
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:38,366
You have learned your
lesson. You may leave now.

47
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,007
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

48
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,126
GO GEON, GO WON PYO'S ELDEST,
LORD OF SONGHAK FORTRESS

49
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,407
Where is Lady Gongson?

50
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:51,877
How would you know that?

51
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,716
I asked a question.

52
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,687
I sent her to the palace
on Gochuga's orders.

53
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:59,956
But the palace was turned upside-down.

54
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:03,197
Why? The King saw a ghost.

55
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:07,697
But the ghost looked
like the dead princess.

56
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:17,177
You grew up to be so beautiful...

57
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:19,336
and so elegant.

58
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:24,247
My father...

59
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:27,547
called me a ghost.

60
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:34,187
He would be in shock.

61
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,427
He lost all sense of reason...

62
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,827
a long time ago.

63
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:43,096
The Crown Prince is
very concerned, is he not?

64
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:45,336
The Crown Prince...

65
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:52,237
Can you not rest here in peace tonight?

66
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:56,007
I will report to the King in the morning.

67
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:59,016
No. Not yet.

68
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:01,887
I must find out something first.

69
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,567
Halt.

70
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,007
I am Go Geon, Head of Capital Defense.

71
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,307
Who are you and where do you work?

72
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,677
We are 10 steps apart.

73
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:35,547
Even if you run, I will cut you down.

74
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,687
Reveal your identity.

75
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,956
You are trying to run
when you cannot even walk.

76
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:46,057
Master Go. Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:55,367
It has been a long time, Master Go.

78
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,916
Is it really you, Princess?

79
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,416
Then the person I saw earlier...

80
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,887
How have you been all... Halt.

81
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,757
If you let me go right
now, we will both live.

82
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,367
If you do not,

83
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,396
one of us will die.

84
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:30,177
Why did you try to harm the King?

85
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:33,677
I must leave to find
out why. Or actually...

86
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,047
I must go.

87
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:40,987
Let me go, Master Go.

88
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:51,557
Just 400m outside the
palace gate is our stable.

89
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:59,166
Show this and they will give you a horse.

90
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:08,406
Your Highness. Please return a princess.

91
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,516
If you come as an assassin,

92
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,786
then I will cut you down.

93
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,456
Who is there?

94
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,387
It is the Head of Capital Defense.

95
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,197
I think I had about two jugs.
Now it begins to taste bitter.

96
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:11,437
Where is my friend?

97
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:14,776
Why? Will you go on waiting?

98
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,877
Wake me when she comes.

99
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:20,747
I would like to nap.

100
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,156
If you are worried, untie me.

101
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,327
I cannot let my collateral go.

102
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,526
Your collateral is going to sleep.

103
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,126
Your guts earned you another chance.

104
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,596
One,

105
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:40,037
tell me all you know
about her and leave safely.

106
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,907
Or stay hanging upside-down
and wait aimlessly.

107
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:46,476
Of course, you will get no food or water.

108
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,647
I do not like going hungry.

109
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,716
Can you not just untie me?

110
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,726
There are five chunks
of silver on her head.

111
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,897
I will make up for what
my friend owes you.

112
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,596
1,000 nyang, was it?

113
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:15,407
You could have gotten
out of here long ago.

114
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:18,307
Then my friend would
feel lost when she returns.

115
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,777
You trust that she will return.

116
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,177
She said she would, so she will.

117
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,557
You do not know anything about her.

118
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:33,386
Her real name, her real identity.

119
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,456
Knowing nothing,

120
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,557
you just believe what you want and wait.

121
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,567
I do not care about that.

122
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,697
I just want her to be okay.

123
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,897
She will return when
she finishes her business.

124
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:49,006
What shall I do first? I will do anything.

125
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,476
Whoa.

126
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:29,246
Does a monk called Wol Gwang live here?

127
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,177
WOL GWANG, YIBULLANSA MONK,
WAS A JEOLLO TRIBE GENERAL

128
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,126
Do you know...

129
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,327
who I am?

130
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:56,407
You have traveled far, Princess.

131
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:21,567
The King tried to use a human curtain.

132
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,466
TO USE PEOPLE AS COVER

133
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:36,006
It was the Queen's doing.

134
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,017
The Queen sent the princess' ghost.

135
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,787
What did she say?

136
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,756
She asked if I recognized her.

137
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,187
She said she was Pyeonggang.

138
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,886
She... She blamed me.

139
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:50,697
He has been like this all night.

140
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,356
You must relax.

141
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,327
Yes. I need an exorcism.

142
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,096
A massive exorcism.

143
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,466
An exorcism?

144
00:11:58,466 --> 00:11:59,966
Try to calm down.

145
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:09,376
Organize an exorcism.

146
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,647
I need to get rid of the princess' ghost!

147
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,366
It is possible that in the near future,

148
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,966
I might get to meet your father.

149
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,216
What brings you here?

150
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,956
The princess...

151
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,927
is alive.

152
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,736
If father and daughter meet again,

153
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,006
before we even set up a plan,

154
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,506
things will spiral out of control.

155
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,147
Kill her as soon as you find her.

156
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:23,346
She is a Goguryeo princess.

157
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,116
That changes nothing.

158
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,527
She is just an assassin
who tried to kill the King.

159
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:30,756
Father!

160
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,096
I said kill her.

161
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,907
You should not kill the princess.

162
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:47,947
Do not say the word so freely.

163
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:52,417
Only Gochuga and a few people
on the Five Tribe council know.

164
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,216
That is why it is an opportunity.

165
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:57,456
If the princess were to return alive,

166
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,657
Gochuga is the one who
will feel most threatened.

167
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:03,486
We need him to waver...

168
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,027
if our Sono Tribe is to gain a foothold.

169
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:10,537
We shall just sit back and enjoy the ride.

170
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,836
It would be even better if
we were to catch the princess.

171
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,136
The princess?

172
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,047
Do you have a plan?

173
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:29,086
My plan involves a person.

174
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:33,787
Gosh, you are strong. That is impressive.

175
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:39,557
Will you hurry up?

176
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:40,726
Step aside.

177
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:48,537
Give me that.

178
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:55,677
Oh, these poor things.

179
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,376
I pray you are born
again as a human being.

180
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,287
I am sorry.

181
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,447
Hey!

182
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,547
You?

183
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,346
Why are you here?

184
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,417
What on earth are you doing here?

185
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,956
Me? I brewed some medicinal herbs.

186
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,897
Now I must trim the
Siberian chrysanthemums.

187
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,797
Siberian chrysanthemums? Yes.

188
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,366
These have a lovely smell.

189
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,466
Take some while you are here.

190
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,037
Do you even know Ghost
Valley was overturned?

191
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:57,136
Why? Why else? Because of you.

192
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,376
You followed a killer to Cheonjubang...

193
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,277
and did not return for days.
Of course, we were all worried.

194
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:05,547
Well, I was going to send word but...

195
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,116
Forget it. We are leaving.

196
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,447
Bow to your mom and beg for forgiveness.

197
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,287
If you do not, she will kill you.

198
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,687
I will return, but not now.

199
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:19,027
What? Until Ga Jin returns,

200
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:20,866
I must wait here.

201
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,697
When will that be?

202
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,537
I do not know.

203
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,096
What is she to you?

204
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:31,407
Is she that important that you
would rather make your mom...

205
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,206
and everyone in Ghost Valley worry?

206
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,376
Yes.

207
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,187
Pung Gae.

208
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,716
I do not know why that is,

209
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,327
but that is how I feel.

210
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,756
You idiot.

211
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,756
You eat all the Siberian chrysanthemums.

212
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,866
Tell my mom not to worry.

213
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,496
I do not care, you moron.

214
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,736
Why did he hit me so hard?

215
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:42,346
Ga Jin.

216
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,247
Deer.

217
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,916
What happened to you?

218
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,586
You were waiting.

219
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:00,497
I said I would wait.

220
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,696
Are you all right?

221
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,567
I have nowhere to go.

222
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,037
I do not know...

223
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,977
where to go.

224
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:13,636
You silly.

225
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,676
You do have a place to go.

226
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,277
Home.

227
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:22,346
Come with me.

228
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,886
Where are you going?

229
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:35,027
You must pay what you
owe. You cannot just leave.

230
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:38,436
How can you mention money right now?

231
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:41,836
She came back half-dead. That is so cruel.

232
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,277
What did you tell her?

233
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:45,707
Dal.

234
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,217
I promise to pay what I owe.

235
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,646
Did you find out what you wished to?

236
00:18:56,616 --> 00:19:00,257
Leave it. I told you not
to go and you insisted.

237
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,926
Take the horse to cover some of the debt.

238
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,126
I will pay the rest.

239
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,396
We should go.

240
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:13,336
Will you just let them go?

241
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,237
Let them be.

242
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:22,547
The South Gate?

243
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:24,376
No. I searched even the empty homes.

244
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,846
If we searched everywhere
and could not find her,

245
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,517
Ga Jin is not here.

246
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:31,156
Must we taste something
to know what it is?

247
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:33,487
We keep searching until I say we stop.

248
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,926
Wait. What about...

249
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,126
Shall we go over the
layout of the Capital?

250
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,126
Forget it. Wait.

251
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:08,086
It is called Ghost Valley,

252
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,626
but it is just a village.

253
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:15,467
People who got chased
from Goguryeo gathered here,

254
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,696
creating a village.

255
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,537
Come with me.

256
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:24,906
Dal. Yes, hello.

257
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:26,777
What is up?

258
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,416
Who is the girl?

259
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,047
Is it not obvious?

260
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,487
He saved her from death.

261
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:41,626
Dal has the worst kind of karma.

262
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,757
Can you not say that?

263
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,757
If he did not rescue you,

264
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:48,567
you and you both would
have died on the mountain.

265
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,997
I did not deny that.

266
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:53,767
Yes. We owe Dal our
lives. He is our lifesaver.

267
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:55,406
Not me.

268
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,037
He might have saved you,

269
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:01,346
but our chief saved me.

270
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,346
Good for you.

271
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,027
It may look disastrous right now,

272
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,926
but it will be fine after some fixing up.

273
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:36,946
Come in.

274
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,277
Gosh, look at the cobwebs.

275
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,356
Are you hungry?

276
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,967
These are corn cakes.
Have this for dinner.

277
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,166
If you are to cook,

278
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,336
you will need a cauldron and bowls.

279
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,666
I will bring that tomorrow.

280
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:09,247
Here.

281
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,517
Did everything work out in the palace?

282
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,217
You took longer than I
thought, so I was worried.

283
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:25,757
Oh, dear. The roof needs fixing.

284
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:28,196
So does the wall.

285
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,767
Deer. Yes? What?

286
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:33,436
I want to sleep.

287
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,537
Yes. You must be tired.

288
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,176
You must sleep.

289
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,077
Get some rest.

290
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,696
She only knows her name.

291
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:05,767
Yeom Ga Jin.

292
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,166
But that is not her real name.

293
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:10,967
She hurt her head and
does not remember anything.

294
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,876
Can you please let her stay here...

295
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,876
at least until she gets her energy back?

296
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,547
She is a Cheonjubang killer.

297
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,416
Would they not do something?

298
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,457
They will come all the way
here to find their comrade.

299
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:29,257
She said she would kill no more.

300
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,027
That is what you think.

301
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,957
She said that herself.

302
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:36,227
Dal. Yes, Chief?

303
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:39,497
Ghost Valley consists
of Sunno Tribe survivors,

304
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,636
and people who managed to survive...

305
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,977
but must stay in hiding.

306
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,446
I know that.

307
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:52,446
I do not know the girl's story,

308
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:54,547
but if for some reason...

309
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:56,916
she puts our village in danger,

310
00:23:57,856 --> 00:24:00,186
I myself will not allow that.

311
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,287
I will take full responsibility.

312
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,926
Can I trust you with that?

313
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,497
Yes. Father.

314
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,926
Dal said he will be responsible.
That is good enough.

315
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,626
Do not mention it again.

316
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,666
Thank you, Chief.

317
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,007
Your mother is greatly concerned.

318
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,977
Did you visit her?

319
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:26,277
Mother, I am hungry.

320
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:27,717
Give me food!

321
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:29,916
My gosh.

322
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,487
You troublemaker.

323
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,886
I will kill you and then take my own life!

324
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:37,727
Come here, you fool!
You will hurt yourself.

325
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,656
Let go of me.

326
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:43,096
My gosh. You are strong. I am!

327
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:47,537
Wait. What is this sound?

328
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:03,116
She has been through so much
pain both mentally and physically.

329
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,817
She had nowhere to go, so I
took her to an empty house.

330
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,327
She must be very pretty, then.

331
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:11,086
What? Is she so pretty that...

332
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:12,757
she makes your heart pound?

333
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,096
Not that again.

334
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,926
Do you plan to make her your wife?

335
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:20,136
What do you mean? Me and Ga Jin?

336
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,136
My goodness...

337
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:24,136
Drink some cold water and wake up.

338
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,136
A person whose fate is twisted...

339
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:28,606
will twist the fate of those around them.

340
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:31,517
I can straighten it out for her.
What do you know about her?

341
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,317
Does the past matter?

342
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,247
I can look after her in the future.

343
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:40,817
He has fallen for her so bad.

344
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:53,567
I knew you were the
princess as soon as I saw you.

345
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,707
There is no way the
Queen could return to life,

346
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:00,207
so you must be her daughter.

347
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:03,606
The day Mother died.

348
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,477
I must know what happened that day.

349
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:13,386
Wol Gwang.

350
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,557
When I returned,

351
00:26:17,557 --> 00:26:19,997
blood had already been shed.

352
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,567
Because of some groundless rumor,

353
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:28,007
the King suspected the Queen and me.

354
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,207
He lost his mind and took many lives.

355
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,376
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.

356
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,916
They were framed for treason.

357
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,527
Someone's greed and treachery...

358
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:53,727
caused a great tragedy.

359
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:00,196
Then...

360
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:04,007
the rumor surrounding my mother...

361
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:07,336
It is nonsense.

362
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,007
She did marry at a young age,

363
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:13,416
but the Queen truly loved
her husband and king.

364
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:14,987
Then why...

365
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:18,517
did you not tell the King the truth?

366
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,086
Even if it were late, you should have...

367
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,886
He would not have believed it.

368
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:27,757
His doubt caused him to kill his wife.

369
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:31,096
He would be unable to accept the truth.

370
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:34,497
He knew I was alive,

371
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:36,737
and yet he never came to see me.

372
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,106
He could not...

373
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:46,416
bring himself to face his past mistake.

374
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,257
It is my fault.

375
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:57,186
If I were not there,

376
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:02,196
Father would not have become jealous.

377
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,207
Do you know...

378
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:12,007
the kind of life I lived so far?

379
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:20,376
I became a killer.

380
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:24,547
I killed people as if they were insects.

381
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:29,027
With this sword,

382
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,896
I even tried to harm my father.

383
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,537
Now...

384
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,666
How am I to live now?

385
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,737
You must find...

386
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:54,176
a way to live as a princess.

387
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:23,446
These are corn cakes.
Have this for dinner.

388
00:29:37,987 --> 00:29:40,997
Gosh. The moon is so bright.

389
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,439
You must have some urgent news...

390
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,409
seeing that you came here yourself.

391
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,409
That is nonsense.

392
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,049
I just came outside to get some sun.

393
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,590
You own the biggest
herb store in Goguryeo.

394
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,950
You cannot possibly be that free.

395
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,060
I heard His Majesty ordered
people to carry out exorcism...

396
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,260
because of the ghost he saw.

397
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,619
I heard it is going
to be a very big ritual.

398
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:33,200
We live in a troubled
world, so things happen.

399
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,180
I cannot believe he saw
a ghost in the palace.

400
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,170
I will leave you to enjoy the sun.

401
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,410
Many herb collectors
go to Mount Daeseong...

402
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,880
to collect herbs.

403
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,249
And recently, an herb
collector came from there...

404
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,289
along with a woman...

405
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:57,359
who looked just like the woman
in the drawing you showed me.

406
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,799
Is that true? Well...

407
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,529
I might have been mistaken.

408
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,670
Mount Daeseong?

409
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,239
She is the owner of
the Jangbaek herb store.

410
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,879
She was adopted by Hae Ji Weol.

411
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:22,680
Is she the one who makes the
intoxicating drugs for the king?

412
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:23,779
Yes.

413
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,219
Bring her to me.

414
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,159
Yes, my lord.

415
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:43,969
Dal.

416
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,139
Gosh, is he going to
do that all by himself?

417
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,879
It will be very tiring.

418
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,109
Dal is a very strong man.

419
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,779
He might even marry her soon.

420
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,189
Dal is only helping her
because he is kind at heart.

421
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,160
Do not even think of
making me do all the work.

422
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,500
I am only going to help you a little bit.

423
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,700
We should get rid of
everything on the floor.

424
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,070
What are you doing? Here.

425
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:35,589
You are doing great.

426
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,109
Gosh, my back.

427
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,149
It looks like a bird's nest. Great job.

428
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,160
My gosh, seriously.

429
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,790
My goodness.

430
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,000
You smiled.

431
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,130
See? You should smile like that.

432
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:20,749
That will make everything better.

433
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,070
Dal!

434
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,769
Dal.

435
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,040
Dal!

436
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,649
What is all that?

437
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:33,609
You cannot help her all by yourself.

438
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:34,720
It will take too long.

439
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,480
This stuff is easy.

440
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,389
We saw everything.

441
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:41,420
You are here to fix things, but
you totally destroyed the roof.

442
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,760
The sun will not be out
for long. Let us hurry.

443
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,160
You came such a long way.

444
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,429
You should get some rest.

445
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,269
Where should I put the bucket of water?

446
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:57,799
Where should I put it?

447
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:05,250
They came to greet you.

448
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,250
They are here to welcome
you to Ghost Valley.

449
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,689
Let us hurry.

450
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,049
Why are you so nice to me?

451
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:45,390
What?

452
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,790
I did nothing for you.

453
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,730
Because you do not take care of yourself.

454
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,600
You deserve someone to look after you.

455
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,400
Are you upset that it is me?

456
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,199
Do not overthink things.

457
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,410
It is better to keep your body busy.

458
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,580
I have to go home now.

459
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,090
You should also go home and get some rest.

460
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,689
She is so young. Eat up.

461
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,520
You should also eat.

462
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,929
Is it that yummy?

463
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,660
Ga Jin.

464
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,299
Come and eat with us.

465
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,670
She is right. Come on.

466
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,939
It is okay. This does
not happen often here.

467
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:39,140
You should fill yourself up
when there is a memorial service.

468
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,410
Come on. She is right. Join us.

469
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,549
Whose memorial service is it?

470
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:52,220
He used to be a general and
the leader of everyone here.

471
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:55,220
He passed away while
trying to save the villagers.

472
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:56,989
Am I right?

473
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,689
Only the elders and Sunno
Tribe members knew him.

474
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:03,059
We came to the village later
on, so we do not know anything.

475
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,199
You do not need to know much.

476
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,839
Dal's character already proves
what a great man he must have been.

477
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,910
Deer... I mean, what about Dal?

478
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,509
Dal is his son.

479
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:16,040
General On Hyeop.

480
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,009
I guess she did not know.

481
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:21,150
"General On Hyeop"? Eat up.

482
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,449
The race cake turned out nice.

483
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,549
It is very delicious.

484
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:39,100
Everyone here is safe...

485
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,739
just like what you had hoped for.

486
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,170
So do not worry too much.

487
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,439
GENERAL ON HYEOP

488
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Dal.

489
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,420
There will be...

490
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,619
no revenge.

491
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,590
Father...

492
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,830
There should be no resentment...

493
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,230
in your life.

494
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,369
Live like a fool...

495
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,710
and live peacefully...

496
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,040
and quietly.

497
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,350
Father.

498
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,150
Father...

499
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,379
Father.

500
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:33,020
Father.

501
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:05,189
Is it not great?

502
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:06,189
Get that out of my face.

503
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,059
What is so great about a wood carving?

504
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,660
Once I become a ruler, I
will rule the entire cavalry.

505
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:14,530
You cannot become a ruler
just because you want to.

506
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,900
You need to receive
acknowledgement from our people.

507
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,199
What is your name?

508
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,230
My name is On Dal, the
future general of this country.

509
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,910
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

510
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,540
That is my name. On Dal.

511
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,920
As of now, the man
stronger than Go Won Pyo...

512
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,829
is General On Hyeop who stands before us.

513
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:58,040
I advise you to stay away from swords.

514
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,140
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

515
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,439
I am proud to hear that.

516
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:04,510
When that day comes,

517
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,610
that sword will be used to protect you.

518
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,890
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.

519
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:13,949
They were framed for treason.

520
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,729
Father! No!

521
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,000
Father!

522
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,630
We are not allowed to go any further.

523
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,079
This mountain is apparently
filled with lost souls...

524
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:58,770
that were abandoned by Goguryeo.

525
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:00,699
Is that so?

526
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:05,640
Then we are at the right place.

527
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,479
We are here to find the
ghost of the princess.

528
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,979
Ga Jin.

529
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,490
Ga Jin.

530
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,260
Where is she?

531
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,500
Where did she go? Dal!

532
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,030
Wol, have you seen Ga Jin?

533
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,699
Is she not home? Did you not meet her?

534
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,309
What is the matter? The thing is,

535
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:15,579
she suddenly ran somewhere
in the middle of her meal.

536
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,380
We are all very worried about her.

537
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,549
Do you think she left?

538
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,219
No.

539
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,490
Dal!

540
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,650
How...

541
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,120
How did I fail to recognize you?

542
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,920
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

543
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,890
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

544
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,729
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

545
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:09,799
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

546
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,699
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

547
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,170
Ga Jin! Where are you?

548
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,500
Ga Jin! Ga Jin!

549
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,939
Ga Jin! Where is she?

550
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,439
Ga Jin! Where did she go?

551
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,410
Ga Jin!

552
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,250
Who are you looking for?

553
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,280
A dog.

554
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,689
You all came out here just to find a dog?

555
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,929
Do you live in Ghost Valley?

556
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:47,799
No, I live down the mountain.

557
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,439
How dare you lie to me.

558
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Hey.

559
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,870
Dal.

560
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,280
You should go back.

561
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,209
What are you going to do? He has a sword.

562
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,579
I told you to go. I will bring the others.

563
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,559
I have no time for a country bumpkin.

564
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,760
I am here to find someone.

565
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,390
There are no humans here.

566
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,799
There are only ghosts in this village.

567
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:20,929
Is that so?

568
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,900
Then let us see...

569
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,309
if a ghost sheds blood.

570
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,679
You are starting to scare me.

571
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,679
You seem...

572
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,910
very similar to the man who
was held hostage at the herb store.

573
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:37,880
Where is the lady that ran away...

574
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,219
from the palace?

575
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,420
I do not know.

576
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,420
I do not know of her.

577
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,890
You leave me no choice but to hurt you.

578
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,240
You are the first person to
walk past the straw threads.

579
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,910
I must say, you are brave.

580
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:04,179
Country bumpkin, quit playing around.

581
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:05,849
Okay?

582
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,120
I want to help, but I cannot do that.

583
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,819
Things will get complicated if the
world finds out about Ghost Valley.

584
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,809
I am not interested
in you or the villagers.

585
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:17,890
I am here to find the princess!

586
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,990
"Princess"?

587
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,329
What are you talking about?

588
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,429
I am sorry, but this country
bumpkin does not have time for you.

589
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,199
The Jangbaek herb store!

590
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,270
You left that place
along with the princess!

591
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,670
What...

592
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,240
did you just say...

593
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,439
right after "Jangbaek herb store"?

594
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:40,309
She is the daughter of the king.

595
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,719
That is whom...

596
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,719
you left with.

597
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,150
Princess Pyeonggang.

598
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,200
How can you call yourself
the princess of Goguryeo?

599
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,229
If you give up now,

600
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,099
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

601
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:00,799
Who says I am going to give up?

602
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:06,410
We are in trouble. Hurry.

603
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,439
Dal.

604
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,809
Are you okay? I heard
you had to fight a soldier.

605
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:11,839
Where is Ga Jin?

606
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,849
The only place we did not check is...

607
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:14,709
by the entrance where people pass by.

608
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,949
This is the first time
a soldier came this far.

609
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,520
What are we going to do?

610
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,920
Stop causing a fuss.

611
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,390
I will deal with this.

612
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,120
I want you guys to take
everyone back to the village.

613
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,860
Okay. I told you...

614
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,429
that lady will only bring trouble.

615
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,329
I said I will deal with it.

616
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,910
We should go.

617
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,510
Okay. Come on. Let us go.

618
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,189
This stone will keep you safe.

619
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,689
You had this necklace at the time.

620
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,530
Do you remember anything?

621
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,670
Gosh, I am so dumb.

622
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,709
I cannot believe I did not
notice even after I saw that.

623
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:10,569
My goodness.

624
00:46:24,979 --> 00:46:26,790
I must have been out of my mind.

625
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:30,890
Who did I think I was...

626
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,290
to live an ordinary life?

627
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:40,170
I put you...

628
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,770
and the people of your tribe in danger.

629
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,870
I must have no shame.

630
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:07,989
What do you think you
are doing? Are you crazy?

631
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,259
Let go of me.

632
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:10,999
I cannot. Let go.

633
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:12,630
If I let you go, you will jump off.

634
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,100
Just let go of me!

635
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,870
You will regret...

636
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,439
saving my life.

637
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:20,439
Why?

638
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:22,709
Because you are Princess Pyeonggang?

639
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:27,350
How did you...

640
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,880
You are sorry now?

641
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,550
You would rather die?

642
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,749
I am the one who wants to die.

643
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,420
How did you find out?

644
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,330
Since when?

645
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,689
Today. Just now.

646
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,060
The arrogant soldier told me...

647
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:45,999
that he is here to find the princess.

648
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,070
How could it be you?

649
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,469
What am I supposed to do now?

650
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,679
Your father...

651
00:47:57,939 --> 00:48:01,979
killed my father and annihilated my tribe.

652
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:04,820
Why does it have to be you?

653
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,449
I do not know.

654
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,590
I feel so guilty.

655
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,630
I do not know what I should do now.

656
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:19,499
I would rather just kill myself.

657
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:25,910
Listen to me carefully.

658
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:29,410
Your life is not yours alone.

659
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:32,779
The people of the Sunno Tribe,

660
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,719
my father, and I sacrificed
our lives to save you.

661
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,600
If you want to kill yourself,
you need to get their permission.

662
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,789
Stop trying to kill yourself
when your life is not yours.

663
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:48,830
Dal.

664
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:53,330
We need to get rid of the
soldier who came looking for you.

665
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,469
Leave it to me.

666
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,439
I am the source of misfortune,

667
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,679
so I must end it myself.

668
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:06,479
I will do it.

669
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,959
They are here to get that woman.

670
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,429
At this rate, they will raid the village.

671
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:26,100
Seeing how they cut
through the warning ropes,

672
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,330
they are not here to play.

673
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,670
I knew this would happen.

674
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,170
I told you not to let just
anyone into the village.

675
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,170
My gosh, when did you ever say that?

676
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,610
You brat. I definitely...

677
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,709
Come on! Keep quiet.

678
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,110
We cannot take it lying down!

679
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,850
Pung Gae!

680
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:47,820
It is time for war.

681
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,620
What? But Dal is not here.

682
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,620
Get ready.

683
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,229
Are you here to save me?

684
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:08,939
Or are you here to seal my lips?

685
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:09,939
Master Go.

686
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,249
You should not have come here.

687
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,209
I came to save you, Your Highness.

688
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,679
The princess is dead.

689
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,890
The assassin you are after
has already disappeared too.

690
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,489
I do not think...

691
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,560
my father will give up that easily.

692
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:34,199
That is why I have to kill you.

693
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,370
Not for me...

694
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,340
but for the people of this village.

695
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,679
I do not want to put
this village in danger.

696
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,110
Your Highness, I only want to take you...

697
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,610
I said, the princess is dead!

698
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:56,759
She died...

699
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:59,429
eight years ago.

700
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,769
Are you going to stay in this village?

701
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,400
Even if I want to,

702
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,209
I cannot stay here anymore.

703
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,580
Because my father and my country...

704
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:21,209
destroyed their lives.

705
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,019
Then let us go back to
the palace, Your Highness.

706
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,590
No.

707
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,219
Since you have found this place,

708
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,860
no one is going back safely.

709
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,600
Hey, Yeom Ga Jin!

710
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:45,033
Have you not given up being an assassin?

711
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,469
Is killing a man that easy for you?

712
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,870
I will take care of him instead of you.

713
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,380
I did not say I was going to kill him.

714
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,539
Nothing will change anyway.

715
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:54,009
Yeom Ga Jin! Show
courtesy to the princess!

716
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,489
I will not mention this village.

717
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,789
So please come with me to the palace.

718
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,309
I do not believe any
word from the Gyeru Tribe.

719
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,269
Do not be fooled.

720
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,769
Who is giving me that advice?

721
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:20,769
The mighty princess or
the assassin Yeom Ga Jin?

722
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,050
We do not need a princess in our village.

723
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,820
But we will take in a girl
who has no place to go.

724
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,170
It is the ghosts.

725
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,340
What are those?

726
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,499
They must be the ghosts of the mountain.

727
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,759
Nonsense.

728
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,979
Those jerks...

729
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,620
Oh, no. Keep quiet!

730
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
Stop right there.

731
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:47,459
General Go.

732
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:50,699
We made a trip in vain.

733
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,400
There is nothing in this mountain.

734
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,670
Besides,

735
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,999
this mountain is bewitched.

736
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,709
It is not a place to live.

737
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,140
What about the search?

738
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:04,499
We are returning to Pyeongyang Castle.

739
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:19,759
I nearly died out there.

740
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:44,719
They were the royal soldiers!

741
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,489
You can only scare away the
herb collectors and poachers.

742
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,320
How can you pull a stunt
like that on the royal soldiers?

743
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:52,459
In the end,

744
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,090
they went away.

745
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,400
What did you say?

746
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,830
My goodness. Please calm down, Chief.

747
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,239
Everyone is safe, so that settles it.

748
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:07,810
Pung Gae was so brave.

749
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,479
I apologize.

750
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,550
This all happened because of me,

751
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,820
so I will leave the village.

752
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,890
My gosh.

753
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,789
You said you have nowhere
else to go. Where are you going?

754
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:25,590
This can happen again.

755
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,429
I will not cause trouble anymore.

756
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,469
Come on! Everyone here is the same.

757
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:38,670
From him to her, everyone
causes trouble here.

758
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,969
This guy, for instance.
His name is Seok Gu.

759
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:43,939
He used to work at a stable,

760
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:46,810
but he ran away because he did
not want to starve and be beaten.

761
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,749
And Pil Gu over here...

762
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,580
I was taken to Jangan Castle.

763
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,050
They made me work all day and all night.

764
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,644
So I ran away in the middle of the night.

765
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,519
They are still bent on finding me!

766
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,590
My goodness.

767
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,529
Why are you keeping quiet?

768
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,400
You are the one who brought her here.

769
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
I found out...

770
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,070
who I am.

771
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,910
Your injured head is all healed now?

772
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:14,539
But...

773
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,610
if you find out who I am,

774
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,749
you will not be able to forgive me.

775
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,120
We do not get surprised
by most stories, so it is okay.

776
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,350
You can just share it with us.

777
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,090
Actually...

778
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:34,390
The reason everyone here,
including On Dal, has to live in hiding...

779
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,600
is because...

780
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,229
I am...

781
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,800
Goguryeo's...

782
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:46,969
and the king's... She is an assassin!

783
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,539
What? What?

784
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,380
What did he say? I have no idea.

785
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,509
An assassin of Cheonjubang. An assassin?

786
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:54,629
You have heard of it, right?

787
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:58,779
They are willing to risk anything
to kill the king of Goguryeo.

788
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:01,150
That is who Ga Jin
used to be, an assassin.

789
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,890
An assassin? An assassin?

790
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,360
A slim woman like her?

791
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,890
But you are not an assassin now, right?

792
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,300
You said you would quit.

793
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,929
That is why Dal brought
you to Ghost Valley.

794
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,209
Then that settles it!

795
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,239
Is that not right, Chief?

796
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,279
Of course.

797
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,080
I will take responsibility.

798
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,320
I am the one who brought Ga Jin.

799
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:32,279
Since I said that I
will take responsibility,

800
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,989
I will take whatever punishment you give.

801
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:36,920
Stop it, Dal.

802
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,660
It is late, so everyone
go back to your homes!

803
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:43,229
I will give him punishment later.

804
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:47,999
Let us go.

805
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,300
I cannot believe it.

806
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,300
She was an assassin?

807
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,150
Dal. Do not ask.

808
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,150
I also do not know.

809
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,150
You can go...

810
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,989
and find a way to live on your own.

811
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,550
The princess is alive?

812
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,489
Kill her as soon as you find her.

813
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,189
The princess is dead.

814
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,499
What if you must choose between
the royal household and your tribe?

815
00:58:54,499 --> 00:58:55,769
I do not care for either.

816
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:59,410
Because I will choose you.

817
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,029
You are all dismissed.

818
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,640
Your Majesty, you mentioned...

819
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,310
that you have seen the
ghost of the princess, right?

820
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:39,340
That is why I told Gochuga
to prepare an exorcism ritual.

821
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:42,880
I do not know what is taking him so long.

822
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,620
You did not see a ghost, Your Majesty.

823
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,459
What did you say? The princess...

824
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,219
is alive.

825
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,560
General Go, you must
be still drunk like me.

826
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,300
I have seen the princess
myself, Your Majesty.

827
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,610
Do not mock me.

828
01:00:38,999 --> 01:00:40,009
"Pyeonggang".

829
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,709
It is a blessed and strong name.

830
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,209
That is your name, Pyeonggang.

831
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,679
Do you like it?

832
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,120
Now that we have a healthy princess,

833
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,150
Goguryeo will become a stronger nation.

834
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,830
It is jade.

835
01:01:01,259 --> 01:01:04,759
The meaning of jade is
good health and immutability.

836
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,570
Just like this jade, my
love for you will not change.

837
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,370
Thank you.

838
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,850
I am Pyeonggang.

839
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:38,259
I will figure out a way to
bring back the princess safely.

840
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:40,370
You can give us your order...

841
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,900
when we are ready to go, Your Majesty.

842
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:14,573
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

843
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:27,487
Ga Jin!

844
01:02:28,116 --> 01:02:29,126
Do not go.

845
01:02:29,657 --> 01:02:31,257
Live as Yeom Ga Jin with us.

846
01:02:31,487 --> 01:02:33,427
The assassin brought the body?

847
01:02:33,427 --> 01:02:36,967
She looks like the assassin who is wanted.

848
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:38,366
I am sure she is the princess.

849
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:40,536
You are doing everything for me.

850
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:41,936
Is there anything I can do for you?

851
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:44,637
It is something very difficult.

852
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:46,106
Will you be okay with it?
