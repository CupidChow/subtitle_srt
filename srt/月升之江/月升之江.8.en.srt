00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,054
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,794
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,650
EPISODE 8

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,097
Your Majesty. General
Go wishes to see you.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,407
Tell him to come back later.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,520
General.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,610
I was waiting to see
you since early morning.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,050
I told you to come back later.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,120
It involves the Princess' safety.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,080
Keep going.

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,960
Hey.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
I got nothing. No one knows...

13
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,864
what Songhwadang is.

14
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,834
That does not mean
you can drink my alcohol.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
What man gets upset so easily?

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,340
Jin, he is more
narrow-minded than he looks.

17
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,704
Do you have something?

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,977
No. No one has heard of that name.

19
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,130
Where is On Dal?

20
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,544
He has one last place to ask.

21
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,017
Does he think he is Ga Jin's husband?

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,030
That is what he is like.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,714
Once he decides he will protect something,

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,187
he will do it, even if the sky falls.

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,570
Ga Jin is just like that.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
She is the same.

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,446
It must be tough being friends
with someone so frustrating.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,560
Exactly.

29
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,300
Hey! Move.

30
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:22,940
Owner!

31
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,240
Today must be my day
for unwelcome visitors.

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,390
I am a valuable guest.

33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,710
I am here to offer you a way out.

34
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,026
What are you doing here?
You do not need to know.

35
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,732
The women who should
have gone to Northern Zhou.

36
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,710
Where did you take them?

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,627
I am guessing you sold them to Silla.

38
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,664
Tell me which road they are taking.

39
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,520
Women?

40
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,904
Do you buy and sell people too?

41
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,534
There is nothing in the
world that cannot be traded.

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,073
That goes for people and their hearts.

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,220
You should not act out
behind Gochuga's back.

44
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,454
What if he scolds you again?

45
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,554
This has nothing to do with my father.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
On the contrary,

47
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,527
the silver I got in
exchange for the women.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,860
Who do you think took half of it?

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,340
The Princess...

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,204
hid herself among the
women sold off as tributes?

51
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,877
So General Go took the special forces...

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,947
and the King summoned Hae Ji Weol.

53
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,957
The Princess has overturned her fortune.

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,230
We should do as she wishes.

55
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,740
Do not try to talk yourself out with lies.

56
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,203
I am here on the King's command.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,347
Tell me where the women are.

58
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,617
You should just cut me down.

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,750
I am giving you a chance to come clean.

60
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,530
But you refuse it.

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Would I be the only guilty party?

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
I knew you would do this.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
I sent some men out at dawn already.

64
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,094
They will check all the routes to Silla.

65
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,812
Even if you keep quiet, I
will eventually get what I want.

66
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,937
And the Princess will protect the women.

67
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,113
The Princess? She is with them now.

68
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,877
To save the Goguryeo people.

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,660
Ga Jin? Where did she go?

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
She is a princess.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,910
General!

72
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,494
We searched the main
roads, piers, and rivers,

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,633
but we could not find the women.

74
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,534
You have one last chance. Speak the truth.

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,864
Cut out my tongue then slit my throat.

76
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,830
Hae Mo Yong!

77
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,990
Squirrel Pass.

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,536
Drug dealers and poachers
from Silla choose that path.

79
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,430
That is the only way out if
they want to go undetected.

80
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,558
General. Are you sure
you will not regret this?

81
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,860
Tie her up and take her in!

82
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,140
Yes.

83
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,100
General. General, you must not do this.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Lead the way.

85
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,470
Keep going.

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
Hey. Stop there.

87
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,800
Whose is it?

88
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,820
Is it yours? No.

89
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,990
It is at your feet!

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
No. It is hers, not mine.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,610
Stop!

92
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,970
Drop the sword.

93
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,203
Do not do it. He cannot kill us.

94
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,550
Shut your mouth.

95
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,942
He paid a lot of silver for us.
He will not be able to kill me.

96
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,130
I said, drop the sword.

97
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,124
Just kill me too! I do not
want to live like this anymore!

98
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,863
Kill me too! Just kill me!

99
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,630
Kill me! Kill me!

100
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,540
Kill me! Keep quiet!

101
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,950
Just kill me!

102
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,620
I am sick of this!

103
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
Kill me! Kill me!

104
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,000
Move!

105
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,880
They are gone.

106
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,903
They have gone. We are safe now.

107
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,850
Are you all right?

108
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,810
Dal.

109
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,340
Ga Jin.

110
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,020
Mo Yong.

111
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
I cannot believe this.

112
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,210
The Princess...

113
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,410
must be determined to
destroy the Sono Tribe.

114
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,500
Calm down.

115
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,914
Did Lord Kim also get caught?

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
No, I think he managed to escape to Silla.

117
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,080
That is all that matters.

118
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,524
You should quickly meet Gochuga
and find a way to deal with this.

119
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,210
I have already met him.

120
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,107
Gochuga is a very complicated man.

121
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,042
He has failed to keep
his own son under control.

122
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,634
Princess, what is it
that you need to tell me?

123
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,124
It is embarrassing enough...

124
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,030
that he tried to sell the
women of Goguryeo.

125
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,937
But he even secretly sold them to Silla.

126
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,514
And it was done by the
head of the Sono Tribe.

127
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,547
I hope you are right this time.

128
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,220
I witnessed it myself. I
heard and saw everything.

129
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,727
These women are also my witnesses.

130
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,046
Is it true that you were meant
to be sent to Northern Zhou?

131
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
Look at me.

132
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
Is that true?

133
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,117
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,764
It is not good to let people
outside the palace hear them cry.

136
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,770
Let us talk about this inside.

137
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
He is right.

138
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,340
We should also listen to
what Lord Hae has to say.

139
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,820
Do not worry.

140
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,243
I will resolve what happened.

141
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,460
Thank you. Thank you.

142
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,830
The Sono Tribe is in charge of...

143
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,233
trading many different items,

144
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,860
which is probably what
caused the unfortunate incident.

145
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,104
They are not items. They are people.

146
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,577
They are beautiful women of Goguryeo.

147
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,844
How could you give such an excuse...

148
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,914
after having made a
deal with a Silla merchant?

149
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,770
Lord Hae.

150
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,153
What you did was foolish and wrong.

151
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,614
I am extremely ashamed of myself.

152
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,140
That is not enough.

153
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,324
You sold those women for
your own personal interest.

154
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,224
You violated the law and
traded with our enemy, Silla.

155
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,686
They are all serious crimes
that cannot be overlooked.

156
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,207
We need to get one thing straight.

157
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,434
Lord Hae did not do it for
his own personal interest.

158
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,107
I was the one who asked him for a favor.

159
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,953
What do you mean, Gochuga?

160
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,960
Our country is in financial trouble.

161
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,894
So I asked him if he knew a
way for us to gather more silver.

162
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,694
I know very well that he did
it out of loyalty to Goguryeo.

163
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,060
But that means...

164
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,204
General Go, I want you to
go to the royal warehouse...

165
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,890
and check the silvers.

166
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,670
Yes.

167
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,780
General Go.

168
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,020
Let us go back.

169
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,887
Gochuga is a very complicated man.

170
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,484
He has failed to keep
his own son under control.

171
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,623
He told me to move the silver...

172
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,470
to the royal warehouse.

173
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,272
He also said he even already
moved the silver we gave him.

174
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,904
He is making a small
sacrifice to save everyone.

175
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,643
Even so, we will be losing so much money.

176
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,990
We need to stay alive...

177
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,777
for any of that to even matter.

178
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,694
Right now, we need to
make sure we stay alive.

179
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,588
He chose the wrong method
to fill the treasury fund,

180
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,130
but you must not doubt Lord Hae's loyalty.

181
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,963
And if this information leaks...

182
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,334
and the people of Northern
Zhou find out what happened,

183
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,673
things will surely get out of hand.

184
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,770
He is right.

185
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,088
They will get furious at
us for deceiving them.

186
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,544
Lord Hae made a secret
transaction with our enemy.

187
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,450
Are you going to let
him get away with that?

188
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,748
His big contribution makes
up for his small mistake.

189
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,586
Father, I hope you will give
him the right punishment.

190
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,854
It is clear that Lord
Hae has committed a sin.

191
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,783
But I praise his loyalty for Goguryeo.

192
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,342
Additionally, this incident
must stay confidential...

193
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,368
to protect the dignity
and face of our country.

194
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,600
Your Majesty.

195
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,494
Being able to get away
with committing a crime...

196
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,033
already harms the dignity of Goguryeo.

197
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
Princess. My goodness.

198
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,343
I want the historians to write this down.

199
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,384
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,

200
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,782
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.

201
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,840
That is the discipline...

202
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,260
that King Jumong had
when he built Goguryeo.

203
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,223
And it is the principle...

204
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,158
that King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.

205
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,738
Although I have announced
to keep this confidential,

206
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,046
Lord Hae will still have to take
responsibility for his actions.

207
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,190
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

208
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,470
Your Majesty!

209
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,990
Strike one!

210
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,060
Strike two!

211
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,900
I have sinned greatly.

212
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,950
I have sinned greatly. Strike three!

213
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,650
Strike four!

214
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
At this rate, the next person
will either be me or you.

215
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,050
Lord Jin.

216
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,630
Strike five!

217
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,034
How is saving the face of a criminal...

218
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,704
considered a punishment?

219
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,782
We are talking about the
head of the Sono Tribe.

220
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,674
It is already a big punishment...
I have sinned greatly.

221
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,213
for a man like him to go through this.

222
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,520
I have sinned greatly.
I have sinned greatly.

223
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,600
Strike seven!

224
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,170
Strike nine!

225
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,450
The Princess keeps acting out.

226
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,952
Are you going to let her
keep behaving that way?

227
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
Your Highness.

228
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,250
Calm down.

229
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,726
I safely sent the women
home along with new clothes...

230
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
and some money.

231
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,874
Those who live far away
got escorted by my soldiers.

232
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,730
Thank you.

233
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,308
I would not have been able
to save them without you.

234
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,696
Then do you finally believe
that I will stand on your side?

235
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,070
Yes.

236
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,427
But I am certain Gochuga
is very angry now.

237
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,694
I will try to find a way...

238
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,494
to stop him from sending
you to the borderline.

239
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,967
No, that is between me and my father.

240
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,467
You do not need to worry about it.

241
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,670
I forgot to thank your
friend for leading the way.

242
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,307
Please thank the country bumpkin for me.

243
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,010
You could have let it go.

244
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,224
You did not have to punish him.

245
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,238
He committed a crime.
I could not let it slide.

246
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,000
But this will make your
subjects very upset.

247
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,430
I am the king.

248
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,643
Must I care about how they feel?

249
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,244
I heard the Princess will no
longer be confined in Magnolia Hall.

250
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,744
Confinement: FORBIDDING
SOMEONE TO LEAVE A CERTAIN AREA

251
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,630
Good going.

252
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,254
That will only bring
bigger chaos to the palace.

253
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,110
My Queen.

254
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,780
Go and bring my medicine.

255
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,834
What is it? Do you wish to
say something to me too?

257
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,130
Yes.

258
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,047
What? I think you did the right thing...

259
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,500
by punishing Lord Hae.

260
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,914
I know it was a difficult decision,

261
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,787
but you did what you
had to do as the King.

262
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,123
I truly admire your decision.

263
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,150
Take it away.

264
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,344
I do not want to drink it today.

265
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,150
But it will help you sleep.

266
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,250
I told you to take it away.

267
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,090
Gosh, stop sweeping. It is
only making the place dusty.

269
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
Should I come live here?

270
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,603
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

271
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,660
Dal keeps leaving home.

272
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,243
So I am sure you feel lonely.

273
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,010
If I live here, I can sweep the yard...

274
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,664
and run errands for
you. It will be very nice.

275
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,787
Hong Mae will get upset if you leave.

276
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,284
She only cares about the chief all day.

277
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,557
She does not care about me at all.

278
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,627
She might move in
with him sooner or later.

279
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,010
You little brat.

280
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,000
Look at you talking
about me behind my back.

281
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,450
How dare you.

282
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,004
What? I said nothing wrong.

283
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,910
You are always busy
talking about the chief.

284
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,314
Goodness, your one-sided
love for him is hard to watch.

285
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,387
My goodness, did you hear that?

286
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,314
This is why they say it
is useless to help anyone.

287
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,170
Be quiet.

288
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,124
Have you not heard anything
about Dal and the rest?

289
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,906
I do not know. I think they
will be back today or tomorrow.

290
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,954
The hunt is lasting longer than expected.

291
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,693
They did not go on a hunt.

292
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,667
I am sure they went to the palace.

293
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,650
Pyeongyang Castle? Why?

294
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,450
Is it not obvious?

295
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,570
He went there to see
the Princess from afar.

296
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,560
My goodness, that fool.

297
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,830
SONGHWADANG

298
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,960
He went to bed early.

299
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,683
I have something to tell him.

300
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,590
He does not want anyone to disturb him.

301
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,110
Okay.

302
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,374
I want the historians to write this down.

303
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,874
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,

304
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,272
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.

305
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,100
That is the discipline...

306
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,660
that King Jumong had
when he built Goguryeo.

307
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,593
And it is the principle...

308
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,488
that King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.

309
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,490
Your Majesty.

310
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,247
I will not forgive you even after I die.

311
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,920
You will never be able
to take over Goguryeo.

312
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,693
Is the daughter trying to follow...

313
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,037
the path where her mother fell?

314
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,400
What did you just say?

315
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,870
Eight years ago,

316
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
the Sunno Tribe was
wrongfully blamed as traitors.

317
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,184
They need to get back on their feet.

318
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,870
That is what I just said.

319
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,120
That is nonsense.

320
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,464
They say one who has
tied a knot must untie it.

321
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,203
The knot you tied wrong...

322
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,033
can only be untied by you.

323
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,734
This is not a matter you
should be concerned about.

324
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,207
I can tell you this because it is me.

325
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,683
If it were not for them, I would be dead.

326
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,290
Those people who saved
me eight years ago...

327
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,950
If you give up now,

328
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,030
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

329
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,997
They saved my life this time as well.

330
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,403
I am the daughter of their nemesis,

331
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,658
but even after realizing it,
they gladly looked after me.

332
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,960
They are kind-hearted...

333
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,017
and faithful, both back then and now.

334
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,513
Please restore their honor...

335
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,723
and accept them as one of us.

336
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,484
If you resolve their old resentment,

337
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,023
they will be your reliable supporters.

338
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,990
But there will be a strong backlash.

339
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,660
You are the king.

340
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,764
Who will dare overturn a
decision made by the king?

341
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,960
The king...

342
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,708
has to listen to 10,000
resentments with his 2 ears,

343
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,788
but he has only one
mouth to govern the nation.

344
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,417
Your order is the law of this nation.

345
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,370
The Sunno Tribe and I...

346
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
will be your supporters.

347
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,450
The Sunno Tribe?

348
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,020
Are you not well?

349
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,863
I heard you went to bed early last night.

350
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,750
How can I be so well...

351
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,590
when I feel depressed?

352
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,074
Are you upset because
you had to endure shame...

353
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,813
at the Five Tribe council?

354
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,170
Or is it because...

355
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,948
the silver was transferred
to the national treasury?

356
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Do not worry.

357
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,474
I did not say anything about
the silver to the Princess.

358
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,924
As your son, I should
not harm your reputation...

359
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,063
before I set off a long journey.

360
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,837
You do not need to go to the borderline.

361
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,230
Pardon?

362
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,074
The order has been withdrawn,
so you do not need to leave.

363
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
What is the reason?

364
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,753
I just chose to grant your wish.

365
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,824
I suggest you keep trying...

366
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,630
to win the Princess' favor.

367
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,300
Your son drowned...

368
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,004
and your husband is
bedridden after a stroke.

369
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,210
My goodness. You are
truly good. That is all true.

370
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,153
What can I do to change my fate?

371
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,014
I will write you a
talisman. Wait downstairs.

372
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,460
I will. Thank you.

373
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,540
You should call it a day.

374
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,594
Each time you channel your energy,

375
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,467
your life span... Are you...

376
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,900
able to attack and kill the King?

377
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,090
I can.

378
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,720
I will behead the King.

379
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,713
With the assassins we have left,

380
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,614
we cannot even scale the palace walls.

381
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,060
Our only option...

382
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,450
is to make the King come and see me.

383
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,110
This is so embarrassing.

384
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,408
I cannot believe I am
locked up in my own home.

385
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,767
It is a good excuse to get some rest.

386
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,640
We will hear some good news soon.

387
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,800
Good news, you say?

388
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,780
What are you talking about?

389
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,372
Gochuga will not let the
Princess act out any longer.

390
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
He will be thinking of a plan.

391
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,340
A plan?

392
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,080
A plan?

393
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,674
What happened this
time that we were called...

394
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,480
at the crack of dawn?

395
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,566
Every single day feels like
I am treading on thin ice.

396
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,396
Lord Hae cannot be here
because he was told to repent.

397
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,578
He told a chief of one of
the Five Tribes to repent?

398
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,953
Things are getting worse and worse.

399
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,100
Here comes His Majesty.

400
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,454
Dealing with the recent
Sono Tribe incident...

401
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,017
weighed greatly on my heart.

402
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,032
I know how loyal and hard-working
the chiefs of the Five Tribes are,

403
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
so it made me feel even worse.

404
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,184
Therefore, I thought
about the kind of authority...

405
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,124
the Five Tribe council should
have as the core of our government...

406
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,130
I wish to speak, Your Majesty.

407
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,684
Before we hear your wise
ideas regarding the government,

408
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,450
I would like to speak.

409
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,877
What do you wish to discuss?

410
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,313
It is about the Princess' marriage.

411
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,530
Her marriage?

412
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,456
Is that true? You do not
have to leave for the border?

413
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,120
Yes.

414
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,834
I will remain in Pyeongyang
Castle as Head of Special Forces.

415
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,973
That is great. It is great news.

416
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,620
But...

417
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,447
do you honestly think it is great?

418
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,580
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

419
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,340
I am not sure.

420
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,927
I can never tell what he is thinking.

421
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,870
Princess. Open the door.

422
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,250
Princess.

423
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,260
You are together.

424
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,664
What brings you here?

425
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,864
Seeing you together after what I heard...

426
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,864
makes me think this is a pretty picture.

427
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,670
What are you talking about?

428
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,847
You two are such a great match.

429
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,860
My gosh, honestly.

430
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,910
Your Highness. Wait...

431
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,663
You knew, didn't you, Master Go?

432
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,010
It is news to me too.

433
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,420
Do you not believe me?

434
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,664
When the people are overjoyed
by their princess' return,

435
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,353
if she were to marry as well,

436
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,787
it will be such a joyous occasion.

437
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,870
But it is too sudden.

438
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,523
It is not entirely unexpected, though.

439
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,684
The marriage of the kingdom's...

440
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,454
two main families, the Gyeru
Tribe and the royal family,

441
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,393
is a long-standing tradition.

442
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,120
That is preposterous.

443
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,373
I have no intention of marrying.

444
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,210
Why are you even discussing this?

445
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,730
You are...

446
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,650
of marriageable age.

447
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
This is not for you to decide.

448
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,440
Are you...

449
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,857
not satisfied with your spouse?

450
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
If I may say about my own son,

451
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,394
he is not lacking as a possible
husband to the Princess.

452
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,934
It is not about General
Go's qualifications.

453
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,620
Then what is the problem?

454
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,190
Father.

455
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,647
I do not wish to... I cannot...

456
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,800
allow it.

457
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,360
When the princess is ready,

458
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,460
she will pick a man she wishes...

459
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,430
and marry with my blessing.

460
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
Their plan is...

461
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,668
to use my marriage to
restrict both you and me.

462
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,133
They wish to hold me hostage.

463
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,000
I know that.

464
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,712
How can I not know what
the sly man is thinking?

465
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Do not worry.

466
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,360
Without my permission,

467
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,547
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

468
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,370
Father.

469
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,560
The Princess makes him
think he has all the power.

470
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,550
Still, would he easily give
permission to the marriage?

471
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,500
If words do not work, I will use force.

472
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,262
You must have a grudge
regarding the recent incident.

473
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,284
Gochuga, if you are
planning to raise an army,

474
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,277
I will offer you my support.

475
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,430
Why are you smiling?

476
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,100
The marriage.

477
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,630
I am in awe of your scheme.

478
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
I was trying to think of...

479
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,740
my own way to approach the Princess.

480
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,980
Your own way?

481
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,682
I wished to go to
Hwayeongjeon. Why are we here?

482
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,487
You will find out when you go inside.

483
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,000
Gochuga.

484
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,940
Are you out of your mind?

485
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,197
Do you know whose seat that is?

486
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,540
It is King Pyeongwon's.

487
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,590
Or rather...

488
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,780
it is Go Yang Seong's.

489
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,310
Go Yang Seong: THE KING'S NAME

490
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,450
How dare you?

491
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,420
Is anyone outside?

492
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,000
Guards!

493
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,287
I sent away your bodyguards.

494
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,450
Behold.

495
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,003
Eight years ago, that arrow speared...

496
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,320
your woman's heart.

497
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,120
A man crazed by jealousy...

498
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,847
killed his own wife and people.

499
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,027
Does he deserve to sit up here?

500
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,660
The only reason you were
able to play king until now...

501
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,790
was because I allowed it.

502
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,443
How... How dare you, Go Won Pyo.

503
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,770
However...

504
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,717
if you forget your place and act out,

505
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,617
I must oust you immediately.

506
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,570
Even if the sky caves in,

507
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,423
I will not permit the marriage. Never.

508
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,700
I said that permission is mine to give.

509
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,294
When the day breaks, the
people will hear the good news.

510
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,318
Because the King will have
announced the Princess' engagement.

511
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,083
You will never get your own way.

512
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,057
Do you truly know what my wish is?

513
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,594
It is to get rid of the
troublesome Princess...

514
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
and to bring down...

515
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,703
your sickly son from his seat as heir.

516
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,670
Would you like to see me get my way?

517
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,400
You cannot do that.

518
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,680
They are my unfortunate children.

519
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,650
Which is why...

520
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,770
I am offering a chance.

521
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,310
A chance for you and your
offspring to save your lives.

522
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,380
That salt must be heavy.

523
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,864
We need at least this much to
last a season at Ghost Valley.

524
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,550
Let me help you carry it.

525
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,643
No way. It is fine. Leave it.

526
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,280
The man should do the heavy lifting.

527
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,588
Us Gokturks do not
discriminate women from men.

528
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,080
This is Goguryeo.

529
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,293
You should be treated like a woman.

530
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,474
Well... I never asked
to be treated specially.

531
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,794
What does that say?
"The King's son-in-law"?

532
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,294
What is that? "The King's son-in-law"?

533
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,864
"The King's son-in-law"?

534
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,264
What is that about? What is going on?

535
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,974
What? The Princess should marry.

536
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,504
Is she still single? Too bad.

537
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,966
Do you know what this is
about? The King's son-in-law.

538
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,453
I just left the King's chambers.

539
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,154
You will not be allowed to see him.

540
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,200
I still must.

541
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,120
Your Highness.

542
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,297
I may not be the best Daedaero,

543
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,734
but I am still the King's subject.

544
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,132
If you have a command,
please call on me at any time.

545
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,614
He said no one is allowed in.

546
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,500
Step aside.

547
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,180
Your Highness.

548
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,096
Father, it is Pyeonggang.
Do you hear me, Father?

549
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,900
What is this about? A royal wedding?

550
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,634
I will never become a
member of the Gyeru Tribe.

551
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,040
Father! Please rescind your command!

552
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,790
Father!

553
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,450
Let go of me!

554
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,787
Your Highness. Do not touch me.

555
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,953
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?

556
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,327
It is cold. Come to Magnolia Hall.

557
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,860
Leave me be. Your Highness.

558
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,180
Oh, dear...

559
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,610
What is the problem?

560
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,213
Do you truly have no idea?

561
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,643
Did you not say so yourself that...

562
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,014
you would gain the Princess'
favor and make her yours?

563
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,220
I gave you an opportunity.
You should be grateful.

564
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,023
This is an arranged marriage.

565
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,770
How am I to be grateful?

566
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,170
I refuse to be manipulated.

567
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,830
Whether it is for riches,

568
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,230
the want of power,

569
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,387
or maybe even one's good looks,

570
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,620
every marriage in the
world is about manipulation.

571
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,864
Taming the Princess with this
marriage is good enough for me.

572
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:17,720
But...

573
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,567
what is it that you truly want?

574
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,740
Without my permission,

575
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,957
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

576
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,347
Your Highness. The Crown Prince is here.

577
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,990
Pyeonggang. Get up. You might faint.

578
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,540
Pyeonggang.

579
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,260
Go Won Pyo.

580
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,800
I will not forgive you.

581
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,830
The Princess may try to fight,

582
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,094
but she will not be able to
go against the royal wedding.

583
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,833
If Gochuga becomes in-laws with the King,

584
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,267
he will become even more powerful.

585
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,280
Do not worry.

586
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,870
I know he will...

587
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,816
take Prince Geon Mu's
side, not the crown prince.

588
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,472
You do not think the rumor
going around the palace...

589
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,500
is true, do you?

590
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,727
Gochuga and the late Queen Yeon...

591
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,010
had a special... Father!

592
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,850
The time is out of joint.

593
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,870
Be mindful of your conduct.

594
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,666
I hear the Five Tribe council is
choosing the King's son-in-law.

595
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,707
No matter how many
sons of noble there are,

596
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,044
they will end up choosing General Go.

597
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,146
I hear General Go will not accede
to becoming king's son-in-law.

598
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,560
My goodness. Your Highness.

599
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,494
What are you all waiting for?
Take her back to her chamber.

600
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,033
Your Highness. Wake up, Your Highness.

601
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,914
Taming the Princess with this
marriage is good enough for me.

602
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,770
But...

603
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,657
what is it that you truly want?

604
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,143
Notify Jangbaek herb store...

605
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,228
of my sister's condition and
tell them to send medicines.

606
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,470
Pardon? But...

607
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,014
Lord Hae and his daughter
are put on probation.

608
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,116
She is the best one in Goguryeo
when it comes to handling herbs.

609
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,354
I will give you permission
as a crown princess.

610
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,160
So send someone right away.

611
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,820
Yes, Your Highness.

612
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,043
Hang in there, Pyeonggang.

613
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,947
We need to stop the royal wedding.

614
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,554
But when Gochuga mentioned
it, you said it was a clever move.

615
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,624
Why the sudden change in thought?

616
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,894
Gochuga already has
control over the state affairs.

617
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,294
If he takes the princess
as his daughter-in-law...

618
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,124
and seizes control of the royal household,

619
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,330
the Sono Tribe,

620
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,020
as well as the Gwanno Tribe
will become their servants.

621
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,070
Power is like water.

622
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,677
Once it becomes
stagnant, it will rot away.

623
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,844
We will need to come up with an idea...

624
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,626
to defend ourselves against
Gochuga's arbitrary executions.

625
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
Quietly and secretly.

626
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,124
My Lord, someone came
looking for you from Magnolia Hall.

627
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,194
Magnolia Hall? Are you saying
the princess is looking for Mo Yong?

628
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,240
Yes, My Lord.

629
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,350
We need to lower her fever first.

630
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,454
We will help her recover her
cold as we watch her condition,

631
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,324
but first, please bring me
some warm water and a bowl.

632
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,290
Yes, I will.

633
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,550
Father...

634
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,690
Please...

635
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,220
do not turn away from me.

636
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,420
Father...

637
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,513
Welcome back! You guys are back.

638
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,744
I thought you went to get some
groceries, but it took you so long!

639
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,314
It must have been a lot
of work. Put them here.

640
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,587
My gosh, what is this? It is salt!

641
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,200
Where is Dal?

642
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,400
I have no idea.

643
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,800
Where are you going? Just stay here.

644
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,370
Did something happen at the Capital?

645
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,520
Not at all.

646
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,628
We had nothing much to do
there, so we were really bored.

647
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,847
You must be Pung Gae. Yes, I am here.

648
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,870
Oh, I brought some salt.

649
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,657
Why did you come alone? Where is Dal?

650
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,323
There were some leathers left to sell.

651
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:54,010
How dare you lie to me?

652
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,994
He could not go hunting,

653
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,533
so there is no leather to sell at all.

654
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,650
Well... Where is Dal?

655
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,848
What is he up to right
now? Tell me everything.

656
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,674
LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES TO
BECOME THE KING'S SON-IN-LAW

657
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,213
Who will become the King's son-in-law?

658
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,250
I am sure all the sons
of noble will apply for it.

659
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,804
Nonetheless, the best one
among them is General Go Geon.

660
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,440
Are you kidding me?

661
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,094
The Five Tribe council
needs to evaluate them.

662
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,236
Does that mean Gochuga
will evaluate his own son?

663
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,663
You are right. Then it would not be fair.

664
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,683
Are you up, Your Highness?

665
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,630
What are you doing here?

666
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,474
Did Nanny call you?

667
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,013
Lady Gongson went to decoct the herbs.

668
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,448
You will get better soon if you
take the medicine for a day or two.

669
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,994
I hope you will get better
soon, Your Highness.

670
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,360
I will leave now.

671
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,380
Mo Yong.

672
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,690
Yes, Your Highness.

673
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,304
All your hard work will go in vain.

674
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,074
You are a criminal who violated
the law, no matter what you do.

675
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,600
That is why I understand
how you feel more than anyone.

676
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,080
I committed a crime under duress.

677
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,284
And you have to get
married against your will.

678
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,424
We are undergoing the same thing.

679
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,142
Are you saying you committed
the crime because of Gochuga?

680
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,940
He has absolute power.

681
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,330
Who would dare to go against him?

682
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,864
If you cannot win, then run
away from him, Your Highness.

683
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,737
No, I am not going anywhere.

684
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,804
If I were to run away
because of such a small matter,

685
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,610
I would not have come back.

686
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,827
I am sure Dal is going to cause trouble!

687
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,700
Before he does,

688
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,367
we need to do something, Chief.

689
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,673
He is not someone to act rashly.

690
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,003
Pung Gae said he saw him too!

691
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,574
The face of our nemesis
of the Gyeru Tribe!

692
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,074
Is that not true, Pung Gae?

693
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,280
On top of that, that lady
is going to get married.

694
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,217
So Dal must not be in his right mind.

695
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,744
If what you are saying is true,

696
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,084
we do not have any good ways to stop him.

697
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,866
We need to bring him back
here even if we have to drag him.

698
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,780
Calm down.

699
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,154
Let us trust Dal and patiently
wait until he comes back.

700
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,256
My goodness. This is why I told
him not to go to the mountain...

701
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,800
nor the Capital. Forget it, then.

702
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,170
I told him this so many times,

703
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,148
but there is nothing I
can do. Here, grab this.

704
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,830
Who is he?

705
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,430
He is Ga Jin's father.

706
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,290
The father of that fox who seduced my Dal?

707
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,060
You are quite harsh.

708
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,054
Do you expect me to say nice things then?

709
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,424
How poorly did you raise your daughter...

710
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,164
that she is causing
trouble wherever she goes?

711
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,994
What is wrong with my daughter?

712
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,867
She is shrewd, and
she has a heart of gold.

713
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,264
Then why did a good-hearted
daughter of yours seduce my son?

714
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,120
"Seduce"?

715
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,174
My gosh. Your son is the one
who fell head over heels for her.

716
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,444
You old fogey. How dare
you babble on about my son?

717
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,083
"Old fogey"? Look at this old fart.

718
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,784
I called you old because you are!
Yeom Deuk! Please calm down!

719
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,690
Darn you! Darn you!
You think you are young?

720
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,057
Darn you, you old fogey! Darn you!

721
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,894
Darn it. Darn you! Educate
your daughter properly!

722
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,494
What is wrong with them?

723
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,700
I hear Ga Jin is getting married.

724
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,468
"Married"? That means
there will be a royal wedding.

725
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,134
Then what about Dal?

726
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,674
That is what I am saying.

727
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,752
So I do not think those
two will become in-laws.

728
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,710
My goodness.

729
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,740
I have a favor to ask.

730
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,530
I have something to tell you too.

731
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:53,810
Come on in.

732
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,180
Do not worry.

733
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,320
Without my permission,

734
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,137
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

735
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,650
Are you not satisfied with your spouse?

736
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,790
I thought you were not feeling well.

737
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,960
When you have too many
thoughts, you need to move.

738
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,950
My fever broke though.

739
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,077
Why do you not teach me a move?

740
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,970
I will no longer...

741
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,483
be your master of swordsmanship.

742
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:00,780
From now,

743
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,863
I will be your husband, Your Highness.

744
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,980
What did you just say?

745
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,590
Please marry me.

746
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,000
I will always be...

747
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,217
on your side no matter what.

748
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,547
Our parents might be ill-fated,

749
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,600
but we are different.

750
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,382
If we come together as one,
we can change Goguryeo...

751
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,210
and make a better world.

752
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,264
I will pretend I did not
hear what you just said.

753
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,403
It is a marriage of convenience.

754
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,332
That is right. I know the
deep resentment you have...

755
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:47,850
against my father.

756
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,840
But there is no one else...

757
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,717
who knows you better than I do.

758
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,847
That is because I have
been watching you...

759
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,687
and loving you for a long time.

760
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,510
I will protect you...

761
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,233
without a change of heart.

762
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,720
Please accept...

763
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,640
my proposal.

764
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,590
I am sorry.

765
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,120
Even if it is not a
marriage of convenience,

766
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,750
I cannot accept your feelings.

767
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,890
I will take care of my father.

768
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,454
I will stop him from defaming you...

769
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,927
and the King. This is not about that.

770
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,130
I already have someone else...

771
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,030
in my heart.

772
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,537
My heart has been telling me...

773
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,647
that he is the one for a while.

774
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,950
If I do not see him, I feel worried.

775
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,123
When I see him, I feel bad for him.

776
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:11,590
You have feelings...

777
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
for that mere country bumpkin?

778
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,390
That is right.

779
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,640
He is my man.

780
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,700
He is the one whom I
will share my fate with.

781
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,980
I will never...

782
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,720
give up on you.

783
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,503
You are willing to marry the princess?

784
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,170
Is that what you are saying? Yes.

785
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,384
Please proceed with
the royal wedding quickly.

786
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,753
Why did you change your mind?

787
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,220
Even yesterday, you seemed not to want it.

788
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,140
If...

789
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,493
there is someone I strongly desire,

790
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,970
I must have her...

791
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,640
even if that means I have to use force.

792
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,550
That is what I realized.

793
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,217
Even if the princess
refuses until the end?

794
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,083
She will eventually become mine.

795
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,583
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

796
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,254
We need to make a dress for your wedding.

797
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,254
The wedding where the bride is
bartered is not a joyous occasion.

798
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,780
We do not need any more
misfortune in the royal family.

799
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,794
Help me. We will stop the Gyeru
Tribe from abusing their power,

800
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,467
and I will punish Go Won Pyo in the end.

801
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,407
You are actually the son of On Hyeop?

802
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,366
On Hyeop, you are tormenting
me even after your death?

803
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,574
You ended up bringing
disgrace on your father!

804
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,580
You are no longer my daughter.

805
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,714
Royal wedding and marriage
of convenience are all over.

806
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,114
What do you mean it is over?

807
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,640
I will kill anyone who gets
in my way and the princess!

808
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,300
I am sorry.

809
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,002
I can track it down,
whether it is a lie or not.

810
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,380
Chil Gu?

811
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,864
This is the only way I can
avoid the royal wedding.

812
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,600
Please forgive your father.

813
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,560
Father.

814
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,470
He is my husband.

815
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,180
We got married.

816
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,187
He was the general of Goguryeo.

817
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,240
He was a commander.

818
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:28,772
I am the son of General On Hyeop,
the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

819
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,970
My name is On Dal.
