1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,874
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,974
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,830
A revolt?

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,790
Juam Fortress rose up?

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,870
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,053
I will continue to lead our troops.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,384
You hurry back to Pyeongyang Castle.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,124
We do not know what Go Won
Pyo and his son may be up to.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,684
And you are the only
person who can stop them.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,890
Your Majesty...

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,048
From now, I am going to
punish the traitor for his crimes.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,694
What do you mean, he is in custody?

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,600
Inform the Gwanno and
Sono Tribes immediately.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,420
Tell them to be armed...

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,464
and go straight to the palace.

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,604
It is over, Master Go.

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,610
Only my father's plan is over.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,580
My plan has not even begun.

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,170
Give up, Master Go.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Come at me if you want to die!

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,964
A breach of prison?

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,564
It is not my duty to get him
and his father out of prison.

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,090
When things change,

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,633
the promises can be altered too.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,640
I will go if you tell me to go...

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,313
and stop if you want me to stop.

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,900
EPISODE 17

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,590
Hey!
Let me out!

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,454
Let me out of here!

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,260
Let me go!
Why am I in here?

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,450
Be quiet!
Let me go!

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,997
Go Won Pyo, his son Go Geon,

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,374
and the Gyeru Tribe
soldiers are all locked up.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,904
The Gyeru should serve
as a pillar of our empire,

35
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,734
and yet they committed treason?

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,473
They must all be beheaded.

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,183
The Go family is of royal blood.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,483
It is easy to behead them,

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,258
but then we cannot avoid
harming our reputation.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
But Your Majesty.

41
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,784
Any news from the Sono Tribe?

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,990
Lord Hae Ji Weol and his
daughter have disappeared.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,816
I have men searching places
where they could be hiding.

44
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,170
The Go family may be of royal blood,

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,046
but the crime of treason
carries much more weight.

46
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,390
That is so.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,420
Lord Jin is right.

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,390
Show your strict
determination, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,208
You ended your convalescence
and returned early.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,880
Do not say...

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,600
anything else.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
You deceived my father and me,

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,074
and now you are full of yourself.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,930
Then...

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Shall I lock you up next to Go Won Pyo?

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,640
What...

57
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,463
Is your condition any better?

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,150
Yes.

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,814
Thanks to your concern,
I have fully recovered.

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,807
The skies have helped
you. That is a relief.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,680
The prince asked for you so much.

62
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,380
I apologize.

63
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,934
Have you decided how to deal
with Go Won Pyo and his son?

64
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,170
Tomorrow at daybreak,

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
they will be beheaded.

66
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,490
Are we there yet?
Yes.

67
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,630
Hello. You are so cute.

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,680
Weol, come along.

69
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,944
Okay.
There are many pretty things.

70
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,350
Let us come back later and see them.

71
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,620
I am here.
Okay.

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,200
I missed it again.

73
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,820
How should I aim?

74
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,820
Dal?

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,270
Yes?
Did you and Pyeonggang fight?

76
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,590
Not at all.

77
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,447
I thought you argued about Master Go.

78
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,714
He said he would be loyal to
us and yet he committed treason.

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,680
How dare he?

80
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,180
You should have killed him on sight.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,920
I heard you killed over 100 men in battle.

82
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,998
How did that feel? It
must have felt gratifying.

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,933
Do you want to know how it feels...

84
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,250
to kill someone?

85
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,673
Empty chest, full stomach.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,430
What are you doing?

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,244
When aiming with a bow,

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,884
Empty your heart, strengthen your stomach,

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,740
and aim.

90
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
What are you doing?

91
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,880
Let me go.

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,040
The neck or the heart.

93
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,140
That is an instant kill.

94
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,850
Are you crazy?

95
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,120
General!

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300
You should have told
us if you were coming.

97
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,464
Then we would have
sent a palanquin or a cart.

98
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,174
The walk must have been dreadful.

99
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,113
I am not fit for a palanquin.

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,210
You are Goguryeo's
princess' mother-in-law...

101
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,090
and the general's mother.

102
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,494
Last time, Dal went to
suppress the traitors...

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,087
and returned with a great victory.

104
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,930
Yes.
That is right.

105
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,810
He suppressed people?
Yes.

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,420
I see.
Move aside.

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,567
I see you are using the cane I made you.

108
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,904
It is nice and thin, just right for me.

109
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,590
You are not sick, then?

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,912
Would I have come all
the way here if I was sick?

111
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,900
So,

112
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,940
I can tell from your voice
that you are doing very well.

113
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,370
Just a bit.

114
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,422
That is true. You look like
you belong in the Capital.

115
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,233
Weol, it must be hard on you.

116
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,430
You used to be the size of a pea,

117
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,764
and now you are all grown up.

118
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,450
Take your hands off me.

119
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,443
How dare you grab a grown woman's cheeks?

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
You are grown?

121
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Dal!
My gosh.

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,560
How are you?
Dal is here.

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,210
Mother.

124
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,310
Dal?

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,450
Mother.

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,860
Let me see my son. Give me a hug.

127
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,050
Mother.

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,633
My goodness... My dear son...

129
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,320
Mother.

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,330
Yes.

131
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,130
Yes. It is your mother.

132
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,060
I came here to see you.

133
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,580
I missed you too.

134
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,583
I know that. That is why I am here.

135
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,030
Are you crying?

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,810
I am not.

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,833
People would think someone died.

138
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,890
Stop crying.

139
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,450
I am not crying.

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,134
Why would a great general of Goguryeo...

141
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,540
cry in public and embarrass himself?

142
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,460
You dear thing.
Mother.

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
I know. Mom is here.

144
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,340
Yes.

145
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,014
I missed you so much.

146
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,620
Yes, I know you did.

147
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,394
Nice and flat, right?

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,467
Yes. There are no rocks either.

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,880
Right.

150
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,820
Mother.

151
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
How long has it been?

152
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,750
Are you all right?

153
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,200
Yes.

154
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,170
It is nice and warm.

155
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,286
I apologize, Mother. I should
have sent for you sooner.

156
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,164
I cannot believe I am in the palace.

157
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,903
It is almost like a dream.

158
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,810
This is where we live, Mother.

159
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,343
It is spacious and grand, right?

160
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,618
It does seem so. Every
corner smells lovely too.

161
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,554
You came a long way.
Rest well while you are here.

162
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
I should not rest.

163
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,326
So, I heard there was a
huge uproar in the palace.

164
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,863
It is all over. General On did very well.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,733
Are you talking about the suppression?

166
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Where did you hear about that?

167
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,290
Did Hong Mae blabber?

168
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,140
Or was it Pil Gu?

169
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,890
Why are you so angry?

170
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,630
I am not.

171
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,140
Dal.

172
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,020
Mother. How about moving into the Capital?

173
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,154
We will find you a place to stay.

174
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,280
No, thank you.

175
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,994
It may be a hut that is about collapse,

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,867
but I have a home of my own.

177
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,294
We would feel reassured
if you lived closer.

178
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,100
I appreciate your thoughts.

179
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,010
Still, give it some serious thought.

180
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,390
Do not push her.

181
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,040
She said no.

182
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,270
Princess.

183
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,987
I see you made a long trip, madam.

184
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,954
She is my nanny and is like family to me.

185
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,293
Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.

186
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,610
I am just a court lady.

187
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,310
Politeness is not needed.

188
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,467
Princess. The King
requested to see Lady Sa.

189
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,090
My father?

190
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,304
I wanted to know about the woman
who raised General On so well,

191
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,990
so I asked to see you.

192
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

193
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,580
When I was in deep trouble,

194
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
she took very good care of me.

195
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,584
She also scolded me as
any mother-in-law would.

196
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,440
My child.

197
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,090
Your Highness, back then...

198
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,833
I really scolded her just a little.

199
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,140
The princess who fears nothing...

200
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,503
met her match in her mother-in-law.

201
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,034
I am impressed with what you did...

202
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,720
even when you cannot see.

203
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,600
Goguryeo women should treat
you as an example and learn.

204
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,800
Therefore,

205
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,332
I would like to give her jewelry
and uncut skins and cloth.

206
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,227
That would be a great honor.

207
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,167
What you offer is beyond what I deserve.

208
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,910
Instead of any reward...

209
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,673
I would like to ask for a simple request.

210
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,490
A request?

211
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,873
Tell me whatever that may be.

212
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
My son On Dal.

213
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,824
Allow him to return home
with me this very day.

214
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,240
Mother.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,280
He grew up with nature,

216
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,284
with the bare soil as his bed
and the sky as his blanket.

217
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,233
I heard he served his country well.

218
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,477
Please let him return to nature...

219
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,590
and live a free life.

220
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,653
When did I say I wished to go home?

221
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,923
My wife is here and so are my friends.

222
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,754
I live well and eat well here.

223
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,624
Much better than you worry about.

224
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,670
Dal, stop it.

225
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,467
Mother is the one who should stop.

226
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,904
I wondered what brought
you all the way to the Capital.

227
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,504
You came here to talk nonsense.

228
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,110
I know you too well.

229
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,804
You may be high up and live well,

230
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,010
but that does not make you happy.

231
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,964
My life is not as great
as some other people's,

232
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,314
but Dal, I am trying to help you breathe.

233
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,520
As your mother.

234
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,684
I have had enough.

235
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,540
Dal.

236
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,958
I have no intention of
returning to the mountainside.

237
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,910
Stop talking nonsense.

238
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,820
Dal.

239
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,170
Mother.

240
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,470
Hey.

241
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,454
Must you leave like this?

242
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,900
Where will you go?

243
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,494
I do not know. Anywhere but here will do.

244
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,233
Jin, stay and talk it out.

245
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,520
I do not want to.

246
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,430
I am sick of it all.

247
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,720
Bye, Dal.

248
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,310
I came to vent,

249
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,410
but what was that about?
Why did she say bye?

250
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,314
What happened?

251
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,744
I asked what that was about.

252
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,814
She said she is sick of everything.

253
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,287
Of you, me, and Ga Jin. Of everybody.

254
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,084
She left forever, and
we are not to look for her.

255
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,554
So you just let her go?

256
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,924
What else could I do?

257
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,610
She insisted on leaving.

258
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,480
Hey.

259
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,217
The Chief wishes to see you.

260
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,047
I have no business with you.

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,560
Come quietly.

262
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,860
Do not make us spill
blood in broad daylight.

263
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,930
Drink it all.

264
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,083
It is a good cough remedy.

265
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,153
I know well of my disease.

266
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,730
I wished to hear Dal's
voice one last time.

267
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,580
That is why I came here.

268
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,350
Mother.

269
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,670
What on earth happened to Dal?

270
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,047
He no longer has the voice I knew.

271
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,613
He also lets off a crueler aura.

272
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,760
Many bad things happened.

273
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,684
It is all my fault.

274
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,084
It is no one's fault.

275
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,423
That is how the world and life are.

276
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,394
I apologize, Mother.

277
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,200
Even if I were to beg him to come with me,

278
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,750
he will not listen.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
Because he is a fool...

280
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,033
who cares only for the princess.

281
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,564
There is something I
promised General On Hyeop.

282
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,327
That even if the skies fall apart,

283
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
I would protect Dal.

284
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,830
If I am unable to keep that promise,

285
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,803
I would like you to do so in my place.

286
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Yes, Mother.

287
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,640
My child.

288
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,810
You are so beautiful.

289
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,000
Tonight.

290
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,523
We will assassinate the King.

291
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,410
There is still a chance.

292
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,180
Grab your sword.

293
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,110
I am sick of everything.

294
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,530
I will return to the land of the Gokturks.

295
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,660
Ga Jin betrayed me,

296
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,930
and Tae Mo is dead,

297
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,510
so I decided to make you my heir.

298
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,010
Will you let me down when I raised you?

299
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,390
I say this...

300
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,783
because I respect what you did for me.

301
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,864
Even if you get into
the palace, you will fail.

302
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,623
Ga Jin is waiting for you.

303
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,180
Is she?

304
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,603
Yet you tried to leave her side.

305
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,290
Wait here.

306
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,904
When the fate of the skies is determined,

307
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,643
you will change your mind.

308
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,993
You left and look at you now.

309
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,764
What are you doing here?

310
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,194
The King and Ga Jin are in danger.
What?

311
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Cheonjubang's chief will
attack the palace tonight.

312
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,150
Hurry, untie me.

313
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,060
Okay.

314
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
I was a coward.

315
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,550
I knew the chief was gathering killers,

316
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,413
but I did not tell Ga Jin.

317
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,984
I hated her a lot recently.

318
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,670
You can stay a coward.

319
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,127
But do not tell anyone else.

320
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,790
Go to the Sunno Tribe and tell Lord Sa.

321
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,624
Tell him to gather his men
and come to the palace.

322
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,963
What about you?
I must alert Ga Jin.

323
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,470
Let us hurry.

324
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,040
Cheonjubang?

325
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,884
I told Tara Jin to bring
the Sunno Tribe soldiers.

326
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,284
I also told sentries by the
gates to strengthen security.

327
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,623
He does not have many killers left.

328
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,854
They will be wiped out before
they even pass the gates.

329
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
But he still set out to fight?

330
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,394
He is even willing to die.
He will listen to no one.

331
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,660
What is going on?

332
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,504
No need to get up so early.
Please rest some more.

333
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,870
No, I have to go.

334
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,173
I think the sun has already set.

335
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
Not now, Mother.

336
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,790
Who goes there?

337
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,920
General.

338
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,360
Open this now.

339
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
You have come.

340
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,053
This is the friend I spoke of earlier.

341
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,310
She is also my lover.

342
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,080
You have suffered much.

343
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,263
So you dragged in outsiders now?

344
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,508
Does the color of the
rope that saves us matter?

345
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,747
I know you are a spy for Silla.

346
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,344
I also know that my foolish son...

347
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,678
got rid of a troop commander
in order to protect you.

348
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,220
Please forgive me, General.

349
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,694
As soon as this revolt is over,

350
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,567
I shall cut off your head...

351
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
and send it to the king of Silla.

352
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,290
Father.

353
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,540
You need to take
care of this revolt first.

354
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,898
The Cheonjubang soldiers
have infiltrated the castle.

355
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,204
What are you doing? Move!

356
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,650
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

357
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,977
I will go to the King's palace.

358
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,360
Escort him.

359
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,590
I must go alone.

360
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,514
If the King's chambers are empty,
he will be in the Hall of Convenience.

361
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,920
We need to hurry before we lose him.

362
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,484
It is dangerous here.

363
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,984
Fall back to the outside of the castle.

364
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,654
Once the revolt is over, we shall meet.

365
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,180
I will go with you.

366
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,780
No.

367
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,320
Let us go.

368
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,690
Yes, sir.

369
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,140
Sit here.

370
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,910
Mother, you wait here.

371
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,980
By herself?

372
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,824
We do not know what is going on outside,

373
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,630
so it is rather safer here.

374
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,720
Do not go anywhere else.

375
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,550
Just stay right here.

376
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,560
Dal.

377
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,490
It will be all right.

378
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,377
I will be back to get you soon.

379
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,660
Ga Jin, we should go.

380
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,930
My child.

381
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,110
Please,

382
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,100
be careful.

383
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,800
Do not worry.

384
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
All right. Go.

385
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,270
He will have gone to
the Hall of Convenience.

386
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,200
Stop.

387
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,190
Gochuga.

388
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,643
Take the prince and leave us.

389
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,860
Go.

390
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,200
Mother.

391
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,533
I cannot let a mere assassin slay you.

392
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,643
I will get rid of you myself.

393
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,170
Gochuga.

394
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,440
Why...

395
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,940
did you?

396
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,610
Why did you betray me?

397
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,227
I was deceived by the Princess.

398
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,767
So instead of trusting my promise,

399
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,273
you put your faith in the Princess' ploy.

400
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,437
I needed to protect the prince.

401
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,913
As a mother, I had no other choice.

402
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,890
The prince?

403
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,930
Yes.

404
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,360
He is all you think of.

405
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,130
Please kill me.

406
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,700
If I were to die in your hands,
I will accept my fate gladly.

407
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,070
Please leave the prince alone.

408
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,130
Please let him live.

409
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,260
Kill me.

410
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,530
Kill me...

411
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,060
and please forgive us.

412
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
Forgive us.

413
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,670
Please, forgive us.

414
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,270
Shut your mouth!

415
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,308
Do not think of seeking
salvation through death.

416
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,600
I have no intention
of forgiving you, ever.

417
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,124
Take the Crown Prince and escape first.

418
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,010
Father.
Now!

419
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes, sir.

420
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
I have waited for this moment.

421
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,507
I shall end your life with my own hands.

422
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,500
Come.

423
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,683
Your head will be the first to fly.

424
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,630
My son.

425
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,190
My son is here right now.

426
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
To witness your end.

427
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,980
Father.

428
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,560
Ga Jin.

429
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,500
Father.

430
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,780
Won.

431
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,620
Empty your heart,

432
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,097
and strengthen your stomach.

433
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,020
I did as you taught me.

434
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,364
I am very proud of you.

435
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,410
You did well.

436
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,404
How could assassins
enter the palace so easily?

437
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,770
What is going on?

438
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,774
We do not yet know the details.

439
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,474
First, let us get out of here.

440
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,330
Let us go.

441
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,100
Your Majesty.

442
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,624
I see you are still alive.

443
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,510
General Go.

444
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,690
You rat!

445
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,320
Father.

446
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,290
Are you the one...

447
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,500
behind Cheonjubang?

448
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,884
It looks like the chief failed.

449
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,623
Master Go. How dare you...

450
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,300
Surrender quietly.

451
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,627
You will be treated with courtesy.

452
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,230
Leave him to me, Your Majesty.

453
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,390
Escort him.

454
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,130
Father.

455
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,923
The entire royal family is here.

456
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,154
It would have been a hassle
chasing each of you down.

457
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
How fortunate.

458
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,697
Go Won Pyo, how could you...

459
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,910
Father.

460
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,670
Why are you even surprised?

461
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,240
I am here to get back
my Goguryeo from you.

462
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,890
Shut it!

463
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,110
Escort His Majesty to the Hwayang Hall.

464
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,260
Pyeonggang.

465
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,874
Protect the Queen and the Prince as well.

466
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,320
That is your duty.

467
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,684
Your Majesty, I ask you to go with Won.

468
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,970
I will catch up.

469
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,870
Princess.

470
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,130
It is no use.

471
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,393
It will only change who gets slain first.

472
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,070
What are you waiting for? Won!

473
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,730
Let us go.
Yes, sir.

474
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,090
Princess.

475
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,464
Drop your sword, and
I will kill you painlessly.

476
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,320
Shut it.

477
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,504
You are the one who shall die in pain.

478
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,310
Like mother, like daughter.

479
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,040
I will not forgive you...

480
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,850
even after I die.

481
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,590
You will never...

482
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,330
be able to take over Goguryeo.

483
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,120
Are you here for revenge,

484
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,450
Queen Yeon?

485
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,890
Go Won Pyo.

486
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,190
You may never...

487
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,270
take over Goguryeo.

488
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,117
Your sword must have become strong...

489
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,914
by sucking all the
blood on the battlefield.

490
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,770
Today,

491
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,654
it shall be drenched with your blood.

492
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,510
Sure.

493
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,010
Move!

494
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,263
General, you must hurry to the garden.

495
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,590
Gochuga has...

496
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,520
What happened?

497
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,203
We can take care of things here.

498
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,940
Father.

499
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,010
Father.

500
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,210
Father. Open your eyes.

501
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,580
Father. Are you okay?

502
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,420
Geon.
Yes?

503
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,907
Yes, Father. It is me, Geon.

504
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,550
My death does not mean...

505
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,620
that the fight is over.

506
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,110
Do not stop.

507
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
Continue to fight.

508
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,887
I need you to be there, Father.

509
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,554
I need you to witness it.

510
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,360
You promised to see me take over Goguryeo.

511
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,480
I will be watching.

512
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,210
With my eyes wide open.

513
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,750
Father.

514
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,643
Do not do this to me, Father.

515
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,600
Are you...

516
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,870
hurt?

517
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,510
No.

518
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,857
I am perfectly fine, Father.

519
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,650
Good.

520
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,510
Stay with me.

521
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,190
Father.

522
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,790
Father!

523
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,690
Father...

524
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,730
Father...

525
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,800
Father...

526
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,960
This way!
Yes, sir!

527
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,260
Dal.

528
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,140
How is His Majesty?

529
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,530
He is safe.

530
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,617
Go Geon. I lost that little rat...

531
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,620
while getting rid of his underlings.

532
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,997
It is okay. Everything is over.

533
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,264
The Sunno Tribe and the
Jeollo Tribe have joined us.

534
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,260
My love.

535
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,780
You are beautiful.

536
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,200
Dal!

537
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,490
Are you okay?

538
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,640
You came.

539
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,310
Pung Gae.

540
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,080
We have to go.

541
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,080
Let us go see Mother.

542
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,270
Yes, we must.

543
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,090
Is that you, Dal?

544
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,510
My child, is that you?

545
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,100
Who is it?

546
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,360
Who are you?

547
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,840
Did the Princess pass by here?

548
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,660
Hey!

549
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,616
I asked if the Princess
and On Dal passed by here.

550
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,180
It seems so.

551
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,380
They did not go that way.

552
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,480
Let go.

553
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,894
I said they went the other way!

554
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,940
Let go of me!

555
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,220
No one passed by here!

556
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,150
Let go of me.

557
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,894
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!

558
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,494
What of the traitors?

559
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,234
We are sweeping the remnants.

560
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,040
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

561
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,134
Escort His Majesty to his chambers!

562
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,904
Escort His Majesty!
Your Majesty!

563
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,304
Where are the Princess and General On?

564
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,044
They headed to Magnolia Hall.
Why did they?

565
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,783
Apparently, General On's mother is there.

566
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,644
Escort Father to his chambers.

567
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,444
Escort His Majesty now!
Escort His Majesty!

568
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,890
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

569
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,190
General Go, you cannot go out there.

570
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,880
Move.

571
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,294
The soldiers of the Sunno
and Jeollo Tribes have arrived.

572
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,564
They already hold a dominant
position, what can you do now?

573
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,770
The Princess...

574
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,980
and On Dal...

575
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,470
I must kill them.

576
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,860
General Go!

577
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,870
I must kill them...

578
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:46,940
I must...

579
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,080
Father...

580
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,690
My father died...

581
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,670
before my eyes.

582
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,117
Even if my body is torn to pieces,

583
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,287
I will destroy the two of them.

584
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,740
Tonight is not the time.

585
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,630
You should come to Silla with me.

586
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,827
Let us go there and come up with a plan.

587
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,533
I will support you with my life.

588
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,610
So, please...

589
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,073
Please do not turn down my request.

590
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:40,860
Mo Yong.

591
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,100
Go back to your country.

592
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:49,930
My grave...

593
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,870
is here.

594
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,410
You are the only one...

595
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,540
whom I truly love.

596
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,260
I know that.

597
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,140
You are also...

598
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,060
the one I truly love.

599
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,030
So I will not...

600
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,160
let you go.

601
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:49,960
Mother.

602
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,800
I am here.

603
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,370
Get up.

604
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,250
Mother.

605
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,860
Mom.

606
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,030
Mom.

607
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,730
Please open your eyes.

608
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,110
Mom... Mom! Darn it!

609
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,917
Hold his funeral with courtesy.

610
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Your Majesty, he is a traitor!

611
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,523
He was the Gochuga of our empire...

612
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,990
and a brave general.

613
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,780
He was also my friend...

614
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,100
who overcame life-or-death crises with me.

615
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,270
Let him go in peace.

616
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:09,350
Your Majesty!

617
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,812
We have not figured out the
whereabouts of General Go.

618
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,700
Your Majesty!

619
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,382
The soldiers of Silla have
occupied the Adan Fortress!

620
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,150
Adan Fortress?

621
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,090
Do not go.

622
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:43,990
Please, do not go.

623
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,430
I am taking my mother.

624
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,024
I am taking her to a sunny
gravesite so she can rest in peace.

625
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,030
I know you will not come back.

626
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,840
I will.
That is a lie.

627
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,803
I know you are leaving for good.

628
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,607
You are going to abandon me.

629
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,010
Ga Jin.
I am sorry for everything.

630
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,660
So please do not go, Dal.

631
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,543
I am the one who is sorry.

632
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,164
For thinking that we
were meant to be together.

633
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,450
I was wrong.

634
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,010
You had your own path,

635
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,000
and I should have known my place.

636
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,373
Yet, I tried to ignore it.

637
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,203
You know how foolish I am.

638
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,140
You said you will be my sword.

639
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,350
You said you will stay by my side forever.

640
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:57,614
You are the only person
I will protect with my life.

641
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,557
That is the reason I hold a sword.

642
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,910
All of that is over now.

643
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,097
That is not true. It is not over yet.

644
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,433
You and I must lead Goguryeo from now.

645
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,013
There are only sunny days waiting for us.

646
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,880
I cannot let you go like this.

647
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,550
Then will you come with me?

648
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,457
We can hunt rabbits and pick herbs...

649
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,300
like we used to.

650
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
Can you live like that?

651
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,330
Okay, I will come with you.

652
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,137
The moment we started
being with each other,

653
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,720
we lost our loved ones.

654
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,190
Your mother, my father,

655
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,230
and this time my mother.

656
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,510
Sometime in the future,

657
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,137
I might lose you too,
or I might break down.

658
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,030
Dal...

659
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,544
I am leaving so that I
do not have to lose you.

660
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,230
Please do not leave me.

661
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,287
You must become the
person you desire to be.

662
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:49,186
Whether it is becoming
the sister of the future King...

663
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,637
or becoming the Queen yourself.

664
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,674
I will return to being
the fool of Ghost Village.

665
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,200
No, do not do that.

666
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,170
Dal...

667
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,610
Dal!

668
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,320
Dal!

669
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,117
I will protect you from now on.

670
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,550
And this means...

671
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,834
that we are a couple
that shares the same fate.

672
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,160
Could it be my karma?

673
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,150
Did the greed and jealousy,

674
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,320
which I conceived in the past,

675
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,063
put my empire in danger...

676
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,510
and engulf my children...

677
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,150
in misfortune?

678
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,040
Do not regret nor blame yourself.

679
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:47,850
Your reign...

680
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,550
was coming to an end nonetheless.

681
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,470
You need to help...

682
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,536
the Crown Prince and the
Princess shape a new Goguryeo.

683
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,787
That is the duty you have left.

684
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,460
Please forgive...

685
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:12,870
my wrongdoing, General Son.

686
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,460
4 YEARS LATER, NANGBYEOK
FORTRESS, GOGURYEO

687
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,150
Move.

688
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,294
His Majesty told us not to let anybody in.

689
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,980
Do you not know who I am?

690
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,104
I am the sister of the King.

691
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:24,960
But...

692
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,030
Stop what you are doing!

693
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,400
Let go of me!

694
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,943
I have already heard the news of victory.

695
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,644
The soldiers of Baekje
were terrified and withdrew.

696
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,050
You promised to send reinforcements.

697
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,460
Why did you not?

698
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,414
There were things that needed
to be handled in the Capital.

699
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,284
I trusted you to take care of
them, and it is a relief that you won.

700
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,223
We lost half of our soldiers!

701
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,027
If you had sent reinforcements,

702
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,960
their lives would not
have been sacrificed.

703
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,473
Are you reproaching the King?

704
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:33,243
AN ACT OF EXPRESSING DISAPPROVAL

705
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,680
I am only concerned about you.

706
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,048
I am concerned about the
mistake my brother has made.

707
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,153
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

708
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,800
Am I the King...

709
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,853
or your brother, Princess?

710
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:23,884
General Go, if you go to
Goguryeo as an envoy of Silla,

711
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,554
you will be beheaded.

712
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,994
I, Go Geon, the envoy of Silla,

713
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,994
have come to Goguryeo to
have an audience with the King.

714
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,850
Go Geon!

715
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:33,934
I am seeing the ghost of Mother.

716
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,564
Dal, let us go to the Capital.

717
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,564
You should go and see the Princess.

718
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,434
I know it is shameless
of me, but I missed you.

719
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,240
Ga Jin and I are not meant to be together.

720
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,680
Whether I die or something
bad happens to her,

721
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,744
the end of us will always be a bloodbath.

722
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,954
You will be an excuse for
the King to raise an army.

723
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,693
Please do not get injured.

724
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,470
Your life is precious.

725
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,610
You too, Your Highness.
