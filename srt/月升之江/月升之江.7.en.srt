1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,914
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,724
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,530
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,490
The criminals that got
caught are my friends.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,194
As soon as we save your friends,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,264
we will be returning to
Ghost Valley right away.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,120
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,804
I am the eldest daughter
of Goguryeo's King,

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,410
Princess Pyeonggang.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,572
The one we have to keep in
check is the Princess, not the King.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,574
If she takes after her
late mother's nature,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,180
soon, her claws will be directed at us.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,150
It has been long.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
I am delighted to see that you
are in good health, Your Highness.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,563
I have been well, thanks to you.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,370
EPISODE 7

17
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,260
Let us go.

18
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,760
Hurry.

19
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,020
The King is pleased you are back,

20
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,030
but he is also very surprised.

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,384
Did you see the Crown Prince?

22
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,284
I should greet the Queen first,

23
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,490
before visiting the Crown Prince.

24
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,410
He looks more like his father each day.

25
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,900
PRINCE GEON MU

26
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,610
He is so strong too.

27
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,550
That is good.

28
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,923
When the Crown Prince becomes king,

29
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,857
he can do his duty as a younger brother.

30
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,250
I am sorry.

31
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,323
He has a bad cold and is asleep.

32
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,306
Come to Magnolia Hall
as soon as your cold heals.

33
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,487
There is a lot I wish to tell you.

34
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,340
You do not have a sister.

35
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,154
Princess Pyeonggang
is not your true sister.

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,427
The late Queen Yeon had an affair,

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,463
and she was the dirty result.

38
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,524
She wants my son to clean
up after the Crown Prince?

39
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,564
I could not believe what she said.

40
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,237
That is rightly what a sister would say.

41
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
What did I say?

42
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,764
We should have demoted the Crown Prince...

43
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,970
and replaced him with my Geon Mu.

44
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,270
Now it looks like the
Princess will get in our way too.

45
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,447
There is a time for everything,

46
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,944
and the power must be balanced.

47
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,350
That power could go to the Princess.

48
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,763
She looked carefully at my son's face.

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,920
As if...

50
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,540
she suspects that...

51
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,947
he is not the King's offspring.

52
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh? Is that not Dal?

53
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,924
My goodness. Chief. Chief.

54
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,050
What happened?

55
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,437
We heard no news, so
we expected the worst.

56
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,570
There was a huge fuss.

57
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,124
You will faint if you hear what happened.

58
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,250
What happened?

59
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,150
Who are they?

60
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,037
Something happened in the Capital.

61
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,850
It is a long story. I will explain inside.

62
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,790
Yes. I shall come with you.

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,614
I will make some kudzu tea.

64
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,953
No. This is between father and son.

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,240
Did he have to upset me?

66
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,520
Princess?

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,350
I see.

68
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,300
She is the Princess.

69
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,603
Why do you not seem surprised, Mother?

70
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,388
Not much will surprise
you when you are my age.

71
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,140
It is for the best. How so?

72
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,507
Now, because of that girl...

73
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,444
Because of the Princess, you
will not have to fret anymore.

74
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,450
And Ghost Valley will be safe.

75
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,383
Think it was a crazy dream...

76
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,970
and forget about it.

77
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
What are you suspicious of?

78
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,874
I was told the Sunno
Tribe was plotting treason,

79
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,888
so I sent soldiers over
to quell the rebellion.

80
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,387
I had to save you and your mother.

81
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,300
However...

82
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,213
Mother died a gruesome death,

83
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,960
and I lost my memory
and was left to wander.

84
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,503
Do you think that happened...

85
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,270
all because of me?

86
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,486
Yes. I am a good-for-nothing
father, and I am ashamed.

87
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,734
Is that good enough?

88
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,420
I just want to know...

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,780
if you send soldiers
for a different reason.

90
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,976
Was it truly just a rebellion
that you suspected?

91
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,410
That is enough.

92
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,797
You return after eight years...

93
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,034
only to blame your
father, and on top of that,

94
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,963
you even suspect nonsense.

95
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,430
I am too ashamed to face you myself.

96
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,530
At the ceremony,

97
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,672
I almost committed a crime for
which I could never be forgiven.

98
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,773
We need not discuss the past.

99
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,540
Did you not do that...

100
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,980
because you had lost your memory?

101
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,230
But...

102
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,860
it will remain with me for a long time.

103
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,290
My terrible actions at the ceremony,

104
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,110
and your command to send soldiers...

105
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,473
to attack the Sunno Tribe.

106
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,954
The air is cold in the evenings.

107
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
Come indoors.

108
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,910
The moon is very bright.

109
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,930
Porridge will be easier
to swallow than rice.

110
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,264
Crush this up and put it on your wounds.

111
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,120
Well...

112
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,640
I am very grateful.

113
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,504
You even got us a house
to keep us from the dew.

114
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,243
This is a palace compared to a damp cave.

115
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,044
Did you live without a place to call home?

116
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,783
Well, something like that.

117
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,700
Do not speak too much.

118
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,527
We at least fought Goguryeo.

119
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,770
Instead of hiding like you.

120
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,470
What did you say?

121
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,410
I knew you would call on me one day.

122
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,783
I brought in the fake corpse.

123
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,150
Because my son told you to?

124
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,694
Is that what your excuse will be?

125
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,550
No.

126
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,488
General Go said the corpse
was that of the assassin.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
But I also knew that...

128
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,767
the assassin was Princess Pyeonggang.

129
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,850
Your herb store seems
to reach every corner.

130
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,230
Your trickery...

131
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,374
is how the Princess got away.

132
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,113
I did it to save my family and my father.

133
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,947
I think highly of your honesty.

134
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,467
But do not think you
will get off easily...

135
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
when you deceived me.

136
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,627
You will have no use
for my worthless life.

137
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,107
What is it that you want me to do?

138
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Why are you here at this hour?

139
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,110
Well...

140
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,533
Did he question you for helping me?

141
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,010
No.

142
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,894
He said he has been feeling weak
and asked if I have any good herbs.

143
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,580
Quit with the nonsense.

144
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,520
It is the truth, General.

145
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,700
Even if you are
threatened for what you did,

146
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,714
do not get involved in
something dangerous.

147
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
Something dangerous?

148
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,053
Everything related to the Princess.

149
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,224
While brewing medicine for Gochuga,

150
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,497
shall I brew some for you as well?

151
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,180
Oh, dear. My gosh...

152
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,270
What do you want?

153
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,730
Blame Ga Jin for this.

154
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,087
She is the reason Cheonjubang scattered.

155
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,780
Our chief fled too.

156
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,480
Take him.

157
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,320
Hey.

158
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
What are you doing, you jerks?

159
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,743
Let him go. Let go of him!

160
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,780
Mister. Get out of the way.

161
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,280
Let us go.

162
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,470
Nice.

163
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,583
Say hello. This is Ga Jin's father.

164
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,264
I was told the Sunno
Tribe was plotting treason,

165
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,234
so I sent soldiers over
to quell the rebellion.

166
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,507
I had to save you and your mother.

167
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,700
The Sunno Tribe also
suffered for no reason.

168
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,653
They were framed for treason.

169
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,950
The Queen...

170
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,780
remained with the
Sunno Tribe until the end.

171
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,610
Master Go.

172
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,467
Go Geon greets you, Your Highness.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,530
When too much is on your
mind, you must be active.

174
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,030
I needed an opponent.
I am glad you are here.

175
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,214
Next time, you must
find a different opponent.

176
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,504
I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.

177
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,410
Father and the Prince
find me uncomfortable.

178
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,090
I am pleased.

179
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,880
Now you are back.

180
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,010
I owe you a lot.

181
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
I will not forget it.

182
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,280
Right.

183
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?

184
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,004
Every herb that enters the palace...

185
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,690
goes through that woman.

186
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,450
And my father is not the kind of person...

187
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,330
to call her over just to discuss herbs.

188
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,060
I heard you supply...

189
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,420
the Crown Prince's herbs.

190
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,937
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,

191
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,077
you must know well of poisons too.

192
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,228
Add this to the Crown Prince's
morning medicine tomorrow.

193
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,300
Okay.

194
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,170
Dal.

195
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
Did you come for me?

196
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,248
Were there not some extra
herbs they sent to put in?

197
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,613
You foolish girl. Such a scatterbrain.

198
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,308
Add this to the Crown Prince's
morning medicine tomorrow.

199
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,110
The Crown Prince...

200
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,070
Stop!

201
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,150
Who are you?

202
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,340
Stop!

203
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,820
Won.

204
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,377
Your medicine will get cold.

205
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,220
Your Highness.

206
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,974
What is the use of
drinking this day and night?

207
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,074
It only makes my mouth stuffy,
but my body still remains weak.

208
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,147
You will soon become healthier.

209
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,280
Here. Drink up.

210
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,610
How is my sister doing?

211
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,260
You should go to
Magnolia Hall to visit her.

212
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,507
She will be glad to see you.

213
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,172
No, I do not have anything
to say to her anyway.

214
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,000
Drink up.

215
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,200
Won! No!

216
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,730
Do not drink that.

217
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,340
You did not drink a single drop, right?

218
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,497
Princess Pyeonggang, what is the matter?

219
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
The medicine is poisoned.

220
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,284
Why were we summoned
to the palace all of a sudden?

221
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,890
I feel so perplexed.

222
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,480
Do you think it is because of
what we sent to Northern Zhou?

223
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
Do not say that out loud.

224
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,277
Do you know what this is about?

225
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,017
The Crown Prince was in danger.

226
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,730
The Crown Prince?

227
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
What is this?

228
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,627
There was poison
mixed into the medicine...

229
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,364
that the Crown Prince regularly drinks.

230
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,220
What?

231
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,560
"Poison"?

232
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,190
Are you sure?

233
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,270
I tasted it myself.

234
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,274
It was fatal enough to
keep me paralyzed all night.

235
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,742
And this morning, the Crown
Prince almost drank this.

236
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,524
An attempt to poison the Crown Prince...

237
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,330
is a severe act of treason.

238
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,670
But if you are framing someone...

239
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,674
by making a wild assumption,

240
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,080
that will also not be taken lightly.

241
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,842
I am not making an
assumption. I can tell you...

242
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,050
that the person behind
this is in this room.

243
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,043
Watch what you say, Princess.

244
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,927
They are all loyal servants of Goguryeo.

245
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,828
Sometimes, you find rice
hulls among grains of rice.

246
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,433
If the perpetrator confesses,

247
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,634
we will be able to find out
who was behind this incident.

248
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
Bring her in.

249
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,390
Your Majesty, she is my daughter.

250
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,494
Hae Mo Yong, you are the
owner of the Jangbaek herb store.

251
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,694
Do you bring in the medicine
for the Crown Prince?

252
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,550
Yes.

253
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,440
Yesterday, you sent a
different bag of medicine...

254
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,643
on top of what you normally use.

255
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,110
What was it made of?

256
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,860
Mo Yong.

257
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,010
You put poison inside the
Crown Prince's medicine.

258
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I tasted that medicine myself.

259
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,847
Who gave you orders to do that?

260
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,003
I am sure that person is in this room.

261
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,200
Tell us the truth.

262
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,594
I never added any kind of
poison, so there is nothing to tell.

263
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
If you are innocent,

264
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,970
drink this medicine.

265
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,618
If you are still alive
even after you drink it,

266
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,410
I will believe you.

267
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,250
Mo Yong.

268
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,380
Stop.

269
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,807
I see you are trying to kill yourself...

270
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,104
because you are scared
to tell who was behind this.

271
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,070
Mo Yong!

272
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,810
This medicine was not made to kill anyone.

273
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,780
Your Majesty.

274
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,334
Did you find out the
components of the medicine?

275
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,190
Yes.

276
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,804
Based on the investigation
carried out by the physicians,

277
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,266
Goldcrest Wilma was added
to the original ingredients.

278
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,087
Goldcrest Wilma cleans your blood.

279
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,220
That cannot be true.

280
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,973
I am sure it was poisoned.

281
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,377
You will have no use
for my worthless life.

282
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,157
What is it that you want me to do?

283
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,300
I heard you supply...

284
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,770
the Crown Prince's herbs.

285
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,787
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,

286
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,207
you must know well of poisons too.

287
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,934
How do you plan to get away
with poisoning the Crown Prince?

288
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,620
He is not our target.

289
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,780
Geon will be back soon,

290
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,414
and I want you to pretend like
you ran into him by coincidence.

291
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,104
Why are you here at this hour?

292
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,462
He said he has been feeling weak
and asked if I have any good herbs.

293
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,350
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?

294
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,900
Then he will tell the Princess...

295
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,660
that I met you.

296
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,400
Move.

297
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,960
No one is allowed inside.

298
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,280
What kind of trick did you play this time?

299
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,760
You upset me.

300
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,384
All I did was make medicine
for the Crown Prince.

301
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,166
I did not play any tricks. I
know that you and my father...

302
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,550
plotted to put the Princess...

303
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,970
in trouble.

304
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,350
I see.

305
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,634
I finally see what caused the
Princess to get the wrong idea.

306
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,294
If you were going to give her a heads up,

307
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,433
you should have been more clear.

308
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,333
The Princes is in trouble.

309
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,843
She brought chaos to the palace.

310
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,254
How could you doubt your loyal servants...

311
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
just because of some nonsense?

312
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,710
A princess...

313
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,738
should always be careful
of her speech and behavior.

314
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,680
You were too careless this time around.

315
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,052
My daughter may still
be young and insufficient,

316
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,844
but her loyalty to the royal
family and her country...

317
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,450
is as great as mine.

318
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,616
I cannot express how sad
and upset I am, Your Majesty.

319
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,590
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

320
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Calm down, everyone.

321
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,900
The Princess...

322
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,206
surely has been through
a lot outside the palace.

323
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,644
It is not a surprise that she is not
used to the customs of the palace...

324
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,644
and the proper behaviors
of a royal family member.

325
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,042
If you admit that her behavior
was not very adequate,

326
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,017
we are willing to put this behind us.

327
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,110
Princess.

328
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,370
Apologize to them.

329
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
You must admit to your faults.

330
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
I did nothing wrong.

331
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,490
What?

332
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,006
I only did what I could
to save the Crown Prince.

333
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,500
I do not think...

334
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,113
I need to apologize for that.

335
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,570
Silence.

336
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,184
Starting from today, you will not
be allowed to exit Magnolia Hall.

337
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,657
Father. You will be punished there...

338
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,593
until you are told otherwise.

339
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,750
This is outrageous. She has no respect.

340
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,887
My goodness. Goodness gracious.

341
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,618
This is all my fault. I
should not have said...

342
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,944
what I was not sure of.

343
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,910
Either that,

344
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,884
or you schemed this with your father...

345
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,770
to fool me.

346
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,193
Princess. I do not care...

347
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,670
whether you fooled me...

348
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,010
or got used yourself.

349
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,124
What I know for sure is
that no one in this palace...

350
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,797
cares for my father or the Crown Prince.

351
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,820
I will...

352
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,660
stand on your side.

353
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,643
You? The son of the Gyeru Tribe?

354
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,114
He is the most powerful
man in this country.

355
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,576
But at the same time, he
is the weakest and loneliest.

356
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,020
I will protect him.

357
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,550
I must protect him.

358
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,000
Nanny, this necklace...

359
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,554
A long time ago, the King sent this here.

360
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,354
So we can keep it safe
here at Magnolia Hall.

361
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,880
Gosh. It is like he knew that
you would be coming back.

362
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,360
Who was it?

363
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,400
Pardon?

364
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,747
The only person that could protect me...

365
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,484
is in the mountains, very
far away from the palace.

366
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,370
Then,

367
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,893
who was that from last night?

368
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,170
I am sure you mobilized an assassin.

369
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,893
It may be dangerous inside the palace.

370
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,074
But the Princess would
be alone outside the palace.

371
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,334
On top of that, she was
helpless being intoxicated.

372
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,234
It was the perfect chance for
you to secretly get rid of her.

373
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,920
And even if you fail,

374
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,664
you can argue that she
wrongfully caused trouble...

375
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,537
and diminish her reputation.

376
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,860
Am I wrong?

377
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,600
Your insight is...

378
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,720
too good to waste at Pyeongyang Castle.

379
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,848
I heard the Gokturk twins
were spotted at Gyeru Fortress.

380
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Go and take care of them.

381
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,710
Are you...

382
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,864
kicking me out to a
remote area in the north?

383
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,646
If you accomplish greatness
there, it will help our family.

384
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,144
Leave in a few days.

385
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,270
I will not go.

386
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,780
Withdraw your unjust order.

387
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,030
If you go against my order,

388
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,300
I will disown you.

389
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,274
Do you wish to become a lowlife
instead of being the eldest son...

390
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,960
of Gyeru Tribe's Chief?

391
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
Is that what Gochuga told you to do?

392
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,974
I am talking about the herbal
medicine meant for the Crown Prince.

393
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,924
So you lent a hand in
tricking the Princess...

394
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,873
and putting her in danger, correct?

395
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,830
No.

396
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,974
I only provided medicine
for the Crown Prince.

397
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,110
Politics is...

398
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,964
no more than an economic
means for our prosperity.

399
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,764
I do not care if the palace is in chaos.

400
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,738
I will be happy as long as we
are left with gold in our hands.

401
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,113
Do not get involved more than that.

402
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,650
Of course.

403
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,660
Oh, right. A guest...

404
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,322
gave us a message that their
expected arrival is tomorrow.

405
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,693
It is an important and discreet guest.

406
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,423
Be careful, so the news does not leak.

407
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,433
I will prepare thoroughly.

408
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,280
Thank you for making this long trip.

409
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,080
Please.

410
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,720
This way.

411
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,174
Make sure there are no mistakes.

412
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,030
Of course.

413
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
My Crown Prince.

414
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,810
I can come another time if I am intruding.

415
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,804
You are my brother. How
could you be intruding?

416
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,490
My visit will be brief.

417
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
I remembered this from my childhood.

418
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,723
When I whined to have more of this,

419
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,853
you always let me have it.

420
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,070
You brought me sweets.

421
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,640
I came here to thank you.

422
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,437
You believed that my
medicine was poisoned.

423
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,903
You must have been flustered.

424
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,273
Even so, I am still grateful.

425
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,900
All right, then.

426
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,753
This is too much for just me.

427
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,783
Would you like to have some too?

428
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,710
May I?

429
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,480
"May I?"

430
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,794
Be casual with me like you used to.

431
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,434
It is making me uncomfortable.

432
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,290
But...

433
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,720
Can...

434
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,190
I?

435
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,584
Sweets will not taste
good when they get soft.

436
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,460
After Mother's funeral,

437
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,390
Father became someone else.

438
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,020
He was enraged.

439
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,454
And at one point, he started to weep.

440
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,727
He neglected the state of affairs.

441
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,876
And there were many days
when he did not leave his chamber.

442
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,367
This must have been
very difficult for you.

443
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,590
I...

444
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,290
I am okay.

445
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,330
I am sorry.

446
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,964
I should have returned to
the palace as soon as I could.

447
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,000
I am sorry.

448
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,970
Pyeonggang.

449
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,027
That woman must pay for what she did.

450
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,080
Who?

451
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,400
The woman from the Jangbaek herb store.

452
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,433
She is providing Father with awful drugs.

453
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,734
Everyone at the palace
will not openly discuss it.

454
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,420
But I hear things too.

455
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,700
People say that her drugs are
nibbling at Father's body and soul.

456
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,740
"Awful drugs"?

457
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,587
She secretly brings it in from Silla.

458
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,864
That is a serious
violation of the law, right?

459
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,580
Won.

460
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,497
Keep what you told me to yourself.

461
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,480
Why?

462
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,634
What if you also get
punished just like me?

463
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,320
That does not scare me.

464
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,944
Those Five Tribes are plotting
schemes behind our backs.

465
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,630
I find that disloyal.

466
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,953
You have grown up a lot while I was away.

467
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,740
Cheers to our business.

468
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,304
Now, everything has been resolved.

469
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,574
Mo Yong, do not just stand
there. Pour him a drink.

470
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,600
Yes, Father.

471
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,600
Here.

472
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,170
Gosh.

473
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,770
The drinks...

474
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,650
What a greedy man.

475
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,388
He must have been
happy to finalize a big deal.

476
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,420
Being a daughter of such a man...

477
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,200
must be tough.

478
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,814
You are welcome to stay overnight.

479
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,354
We must walk and set sail.

480
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,227
I do not have time to waste.

481
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,410
Before I get exposed,

482
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,210
I must go back to Silla.

483
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,604
I wrote down a list of
generals, the number of soldiers,

484
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,204
and the weapons they carry...

485
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,330
on the border.

486
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,934
I checked several times.

487
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,740
I am certain it will match.

488
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,814
My King has recognized
your contribution to our empire.

489
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,914
Kim Cha Seung: IN CHARGE
OF MILITARY FORCES IN SILLA

490
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,684
When you come back to your hometown,

491
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,823
you will be graciously rewarded.

492
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,820
I am only doing my
duty as a woman of Silla.

493
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,057
Hurry back before the morning breaks.

494
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,480
16 YEARS AGO, OUTSKIRTS OF BISABEOL, SILLA

495
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,170
I plan to use you for something important.

496
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,040
Are you prepared?

497
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,183
You saved me from certain death.

498
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,713
I will jump into a fire for you.

499
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,260
Go to Goguryeo.

500
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,940
Let me see...

501
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,950
What is important...

502
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,684
is that riches is the
only thing that is forever!

503
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,890
Yes, that is true. You are right.

504
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,060
Oh, dear. My lord. My lord.

505
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,900
My lord. Oh, dear.

506
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,020
Oh, no.

507
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,850
What happened? My lord.

508
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,730
We must have another drink. My lord.

509
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,840
What is it you want? Speak.

510
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,830
Do you want silver,

511
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,880
or do you want land?

512
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,577
I am an orphan with nowhere to go,

513
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,434
but I know herbs and acupuncture
and am quick with math.

514
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,883
I wish to work for you, my lord.

515
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,190
May I serve you like a father?

516
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,280
Stand.

517
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,610
Princess.

518
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,860
Do not go, Princess.

519
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,433
Nanny. The King told you to behave.

520
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,044
If you disobey him
again and get into trouble,

521
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,610
then his subjects will truly revolt.

522
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,036
His subjects? The men who
think nothing of the royals?

523
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,060
Princess.

524
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,553
Nothing you say will stop me.

525
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,010
This is for Father.

526
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,920
Are you surprised?

527
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,217
When you were here as an assassin,

528
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,720
I followed you,

529
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,184
and barely found this passageway.

530
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,654
Do not get in my way, Master Go.

531
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,668
I am here to help you.
I do not need your help.

532
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,160
I have a loud voice.

533
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,134
I can shout from here and
wake the sleepy guards...

534
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,464
at the North Gate at once.

535
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,603
I have no time to joke with you.

536
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,968
I did not wait here just to
exchange jokes with you.

537
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,570
In a few days,

538
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,983
I must head to a northern fortress.

539
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,587
I cannot disobey my father's command.

540
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,157
So I came here to keep my promise.

541
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,470
I will be on your side.

542
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,133
What can I do to help you?

543
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,394
I am aware that Hae Mo Yong...

544
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,344
is illegally smuggling
herbs into the country.

545
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,894
Here, she has hidden
hundreds of kilos of herbs.

546
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,664
You know she is
smuggling it in from Silla.

547
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,737
Her drugs are ruining the King.

548
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,373
Why did you let it happen?

549
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,280
Because I also made a deal with her.

550
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:36,740
What deal?

551
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,030
Come with me.

552
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,840
Not long ago, I saw she had herbs here.

553
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,690
She moved them already.

554
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,100
What is it?

555
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,290
Step back.

556
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,390
Do not be afraid.

557
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,890
Princess.

558
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,090
Change clothes with me.

559
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,574
What are you thinking?

560
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,447
I need to know why
these children are here.

561
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,460
What is the Princess up to?

562
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,660
She does not leave Magnolia Hall.

563
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,330
She just reads.

564
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,333
She only pretends to read.

565
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,267
If you notice anything suspicious,

566
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,290
alert me immediately.

567
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,930
Princess.

568
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,230
You must stay safe.

569
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,610
Come!

570
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,170
Get up. Get up.

571
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,900
Get up. Get up.

572
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,620
Take them.

573
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,230
Get up.

574
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,470
Come on.

575
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,280
Let us go. Walk.

576
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:40,820
Move it.

577
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:47,760
Walk.

578
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,700
Who are they?

579
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,670
Where are they going?

580
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,880
I do not know.

581
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,732
We only know that we
are going to Northern Zhou.

582
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:08,880
What?

583
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,834
They are the tribute to Northern Zhou?

584
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,690
Yes.

585
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,404
The grain and tributary gifts
were sent off a few days ago.

586
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,260
But...

587
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,880
we were brought here before that.

588
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,740
There is nothing over
here. What about there?

589
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,740
Nothing but moss.

590
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,570
That is odd.

591
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,380
We always leave a wooden
pass beneath these rocks.

592
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,900
They abandoned you.

593
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,884
The other killers will have gathered.

594
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,850
All but you.

595
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,180
It is obvious.

596
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,784
What did you just say?

597
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,670
Step aside.

598
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,910
Quick, look underneath.

599
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,650
Hang on. You... Darn you.

600
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,304
Lift it a bit higher. Quick.

601
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,190
I found it.

602
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,190
Step back.

603
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,690
Where do you go?

604
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,753
"Song", "hwa", "dang". Songhwadang.

605
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,040
Where is Songhwadang?

606
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,427
I do not know if you do not.

607
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,660
I have never heard of that place.

608
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,290
I have geotjeori.

609
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,300
SONGHWADANG

610
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,063
I have men all over the city.

611
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:26,434
They will spread word
of a talented fortune-teller,

612
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,134
so people will flock in soon.

613
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,788
The darkest place in the
world is right beneath the lamp.

614
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,866
Now, instead of a 180cm
sword, I will use my tongue...

615
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,580
to penetrate the King's heart.

616
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:47,238
Have you come up with an
idea of how to enter the palace?

617
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,803
Has the Princess woken up?

618
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,732
She has not yet. It looks
like she has caught a cold.

619
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,060
What about the doctor?

620
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,200
Pardon?

621
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,614
You should have called
the doctor for the Princess.

622
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,484
Yes, you are right. I was
about to call the doctor.

623
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,654
She must be sick because
she is under heavy stress.

624
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,994
I need to check how she is doing.

625
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,680
But she is still in bed.

626
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,080
Step back.

627
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,868
You said she was sick with a
cold. Where is the Princess?

628
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
I asked where the Princess is.

629
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,550
Since last night...

630
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,160
I have not seen her.

631
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,380
What?

632
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,310
Hey, you! Get up!

633
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,514
We walked all night
without even a sip of water.

634
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,720
How dare you? Take a short break.

635
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,257
We are quite far from the Capital.

636
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,340
It will be okay to rest.

637
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,200
Yes, my lord.

638
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,540
Rest! Take a rest.

639
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,390
Thank you.

640
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,274
As if the offerings are not enough,
they are sending women too?

641
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,747
If we are not going to Northern Zhou,

642
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,630
what will happen to us?

643
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,687
Their clothes and
accent are that of Silla.

644
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,970
Silla?

645
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,950
We were sold off.

646
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,794
We should be going to Northern Zhou,

647
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,894
but they hid us to sell us to Silla.

648
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
The great people from high up.

649
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,640
Do not worry.

650
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,664
The King's soldiers will
come before we reach Silla.

651
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,334
I am from the government.

652
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,190
Are you?

653
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,374
What did our country ever do for us?

654
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,614
It is the same for us, whether
we go to Northern Zhou or Silla.

655
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,884
We will serve some rich
lady or marry some old man.

656
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:31,700
No.

657
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,390
All of you will get to go home. I promise.

658
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,493
There is a knife in my back pocket.

659
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,950
Get it for me.

660
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,173
Will the King's men really come?

661
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,760
Goguryeo...

662
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,242
would not let their people
be sold to another nation.

663
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,947
Protecting them is the empire's duty.

664
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,680
We should go now.

665
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,053
Get up now. Get up! Stand up!

666
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,310
Get up.

667
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,833
What? The Princess has disappeared?

668
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,837
It is such an embarrassment.

669
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,312
She always got up to
something since her return.

670
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,934
She even disobeyed my order to behave.

671
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,673
Where on earth did she go?

672
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,280
She will be somewhere in the palace.

673
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,144
Do not worry too much.

674
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,017
We searched for her already.

675
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,670
She is not in the palace.

676
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,960
How dare she?

677
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,810
Father.

678
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,240
Actually...

679
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,097
I went to Magnolia Hall yesterday.

680
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,637
Your Majesty. General
Go wishes to see you.

681
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,634
Tell him to come back later.

682
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,490
And?

683
01:00:59,010 --> 01:00:59,860
General.

684
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,950
I was waiting to see
you since early morning.

685
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
I told you to come back later.

686
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,420
It involves the Princess' safety.

687
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,050
Keep going.

688
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,490
Hey. Stop there.

689
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,480
Whose is it?

690
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,440
Is it yours? No.

691
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:50,610
It is at your feet!

692
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,640
No. It is hers, not mine.

693
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,783
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

694
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,854
The Princess hid herself among
the women sold off as tributes?

695
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,084
No matter how much power
or wealth one may have,

696
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,254
anyone who violates the
law will be held responsible.

697
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,694
It is the principle King Pyeongwon
follows as he rules the country.

698
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,550
Say hello.

699
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,168
It is the arrow that shot
your girl eight years ago.

700
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,240
You two make a good couple.

701
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,770
I will marry you.

702
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,250
Royal marriage?

703
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,547
I will never join the Gyeru Tribe.

704
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,744
Is the daughter trying to follow...

705
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,784
the path where her mother fell?

706
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,657
I will never give up on you.

707
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,663
She will eventually become mine.

708
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,724
If you cannot win, you should run away.

709
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:07,018
If I had planned to run, I would
never have returned to the palace.
