1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,079
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,599
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,220
Give me your blessing
to stop taking away lives.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,949
I want you to kill...

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,819
the enemy of Cheonjubang,
the King of Goguryeo.

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,519
Are you really going to
attack during the ceremony?

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,870
A shaman tried to kill
the King, then got away.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,830
Hold on tight!

9
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,800
If she got hurt,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,240
you should have taken her to
the village, not bring her here.

11
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,709
That is my name. On Dal.

12
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,379
What?

13
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,510
He told you to find
your real parents first.

14
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,110
You are saying...

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,419
I am an orphan, right?

16
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:48,720
Hey!

17
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,290
You have not killed him?

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,889
You told me to seduce him instead.

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,089
You? As if.

20
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,790
EPISODE 3

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,900
Hi.

22
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,459
Your friend came to pick you up?

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,260
Yes, she is my childhood...
We met each other in the palace.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,400
She is my hometown friend.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,609
And we worked at the palace together.

26
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,809
I see.

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,109
How did you come all the way here?

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,609
I followed the footsteps.

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,549
What is with you? Why
are you interrogating us?

30
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,689
I am just checking if it is okay...

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,820
to just send you away like this...

32
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,930
and if the place you are going to is safe.

33
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:39,400
Oh, I do not have any money
to give you, but take this.

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,669
I carved it myself.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,949
The Sunno Tribe... I mean...

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,449
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,320
Same side? Yes, we are on the same side.

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,160
But I have nothing to give you.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Gosh.

40
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:02,990
Yes, you do.

41
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,769
Darn you!

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,179
Does it hurt here?

43
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,790
You are okay, right?

44
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,690
See you. Yeom Ga Jin.

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,030
Do not get hurt. Your life is precious.

46
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,350
"Your life is precious"?

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,810
"The same side"?

48
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:03,119
Shoot. What was that?

49
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,369
You should not push people!

50
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,869
That was rude.

51
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,780
Why am I like this?

52
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,060
So I came this way.

53
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,299
This is just great.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,570
You come later.

55
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,964
We will be suspected
if we return together.

56
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,340
It is dangerous alone.

57
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,869
We have no time to argue.

58
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,239
Be careful.

59
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,149
Did she leave?

60
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,389
Yes.

61
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,730
It is true.

62
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,559
I sent her off with a stern warning.

63
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,530
Do not resent me.

64
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,069
Every life is unfortunate
if you look closely enough.

65
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,439
What do you mean?

66
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,939
A young woman wielding a
sword and shedding blood.

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,140
Her life must have been rough.

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,210
What kind of revenge is she after that...

69
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,879
she became an assassin?

70
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,179
I did not ask.

71
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,520
You did not ask her?

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,249
I pretended not to notice
she was an assassin.

73
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,720
Well, she has gone now.

74
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,369
Do not get involved in
other people's business.

75
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,530
We just breathe and get by.

76
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,330
That is how we live.

77
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,470
I know that. I just felt sorry for her.

78
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,400
The moon is so...

79
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,009
Is it bright?

80
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,080
Yes.

81
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,280
As if it cares not for how I feel.

82
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,900
I knew you would sneak
back like a stray cat.

83
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,640
Where is my father? See the chief first.

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,710
Yeom Deuk is not here now anyway.

85
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,049
What? You returned. He will be let go.

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
My goodness. Oh, why are you doing this?

87
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,890
Oh, dear...

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,929
Please, guards.

89
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh, dear...

90
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,299
I will accept the punishment for failing.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,410
Please release my father.

92
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,540
Holding family responsible
for a killer's mistake...

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,879
is not our rule.

94
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,410
You disappeared without notice.

95
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,549
How will you defend that crime?

96
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,679
I will willingly accept any punishment.

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,989
If you will please
release my father first...

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,689
Tae Mo. Yes, chief.

99
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,189
Release Yeom Deuk.

100
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,460
Should I just let him go?

101
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,439
They strengthened the
defense of Pyeongyang Castle.

102
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,309
If you go back, are you
sure you can succeed?

103
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,350
Before that, there is
something I must know.

104
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,220
Who on earth am I?

105
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,270
I need to know who I am.

106
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,569
Chief.

107
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,040
You know, do you not?

108
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,470
It means nothing.

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,580
You are Cheonjubang's
best killer Yeom Ga Jin,

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,540
and my most favored blade.

111
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,410
Even if you recover your
memory, nothing will change.

112
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,679
That decision...

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,489
is for me to make once I know who I am.

114
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,419
If you will not tell me,

115
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,530
I must find out for myself.

116
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,230
Is that...

117
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,530
truly what you want?

118
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,470
Yes.

119
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,169
You foolish thing.

120
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,369
Why is a butterfly called a butterfly?

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,299
I feel so strange.

122
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,239
What did you climb up there for?

123
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,809
Weol. Did something happen to Dal?

124
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,909
I think he has lost his mind.

125
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,420
Stop speaking nonsense...

126
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,119
and come down and go to work.

127
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,220
Take this.

128
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,460
Do not eat it in one
go. Eat when it is time.

129
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,300
Dal, get down here now!

130
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,100
Why do you keep coming up
here when there is nothing to pick?

131
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,670
What about Ghost Valley?

132
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,869
That foxy girl...

133
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:58,269
has truly messed with your mind.

134
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,810
How dare you? You are wrong.

135
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,509
My gosh.

136
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,080
You stuck flowers in your
hair and grin to no end.

137
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,019
Am I wrong?

138
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,249
Weol. Is this not truly beautiful?

139
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,659
If you wish to befriend nature,

140
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,359
you must learn to appreciate it.

141
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:18,629
What is so special about mountains
and streams we see every day?

142
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,999
You might end up wanting
to save that girl's father.

143
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,109
What about her father?

144
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,440
You have not heard?

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,680
Heard about what?

146
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,710
Ga Jin. Do not get worked up.

147
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,249
You cannot fight the chief.

148
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,920
If anyone messes with my
father, I will make them pay.

149
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:51,789
I heard something about Cheonjubang...

150
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,129
and that something bad
happened to her father.

151
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,399
Why are you telling me that now?

152
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,300
Dal! What about the balls of rice?

153
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,440
Dal.

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,580
Cheonjubang? Yes.

155
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,489
Rumors say they are a group of assassins.

156
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,359
I hear they are a group that
has a grudge against Goguryeo.

157
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,489
The chief manages a group of killers.

158
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,700
They are served by migrants
who have a point system.

159
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,259
Where is this chief?

160
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,100
Why do you wish to know?

161
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,200
Well... I have a reason to.

162
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,109
I heard he moves around each
season with no set residence.

163
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,210
Even the killers communicate
with a secret method.

164
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,619
Now, he might be on Mount
Janggok or Mount Bongchu.

165
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,420
So he is on one of those two mountains?

166
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:54,720
Dal!

167
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,129
What are you doing?

168
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,830
What is up with you?

169
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,129
I must save someone.

170
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,159
Where is Ga Jin?

171
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,670
She got back safely, so do not worry.

172
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,139
She is not safe.

173
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,609
Why not? Where is she now?

174
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:00,680
This is urgent.

175
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,019
I must see you leave.

176
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,570
Ga Jin wore the exact same clothes.

177
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,279
The jade necklace. You must find that.

178
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,090
Jade!

179
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,879
Hey.

180
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,690
It is you. Ga Jin's friend.

181
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,789
How did you find this place?

182
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,320
How is Ga Jin? I heard
her father is in danger.

183
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,830
Be quiet.

184
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:23,259
Your assassin friends are everywhere.

185
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,050
Mister, I am back. Yes, good.

186
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
You are the country
bumpkin Ga Jin was with.

187
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,619
Who is a country bumpkin?

188
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,389
You went to get a necklace
and came back with him?

189
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,690
It so happened.

190
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,430
You can relax.

191
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,629
He helped Ga Jin when she was hurt.

192
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,230
Oh. And take this.

193
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,330
Are you Ga Jin's father? Oh, my goodness.

194
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,509
It is done. All is well.

195
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,139
Now we just need to get Ga Jin.

196
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,639
The thing is, I checked and...

197
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,950
Woong Tae and Sam Bok are on guard.

198
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,820
If they identify us during the fight...

199
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,850
Hey. We must lure them.

200
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,619
Lure them?

201
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,940
Did you just see a green snake?

202
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,379
Who are you?

203
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,210
A green snake just came in here.

204
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,249
Mister.

205
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,399
Ga Jin.

206
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,700
She inhaled a powder
that put her to sleep.

207
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,800
A sleeping powder?

208
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,170
Wake up, will you?

209
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,279
Father. Yes, it is me.

210
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,350
You?

211
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,590
Yes, it is me. The deer.

212
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,389
Go Won Pyo wants Ga Jin's head.

213
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,989
Do it, chief.

214
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,100
If she quits killing, Ga
Jin is of no use to us.

215
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,070
You do not know her true value.

216
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,170
Her value?

217
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,440
Ga Jin must kill King Pyeongwon herself.

218
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,609
If she does that, Goguryeo...

219
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,879
will turn upside-down.

220
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,279
But Ga Jin said she wishes to quit.

221
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,299
We must hold a rite to
clear the muddied soul.

222
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,799
Just how we did a long time ago.

223
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,180
Your soul will be cleansed
with the energy of Cheonjubang.

224
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,120
This drug will erase your whole past.

225
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:39,860
The chief brought you here, Ga Jin.

226
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,499
He said you would have
no memory when you wake...

227
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,269
and told me to raise you as my own.

228
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,739
I had lost my family,

229
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:53,610
and the chief took me in
when I had nowhere to go.

230
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,249
How would I dare disobey his command?

231
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,620
Since that day,

232
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,299
you became my daughter.

233
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,140
Are you really...

234
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,610
not my birth father?

235
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,710
I should have told you before.

236
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,049
Then you would not have become a killer,

237
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:36,420
and you would have found your parents.

238
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,059
It is my fault. It is all on me.

239
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,599
Do not cry, Father.

240
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,339
You had this necklace at the time.

241
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,809
Take a look.

242
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,480
Do you remember anything?

243
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,480
I think I saw it in a dream.

244
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,890
I am not sure.

245
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,289
They are here. What?

246
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,829
You must get out of here.

247
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,029
Find your real parents and live happily.

248
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,700
Where can I go when you are here, Father?

249
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,110
I am not your father.

250
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,710
Mister, you must get home
before they find out. Hurry.

251
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,110
Father.

252
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Will you get me killed too?

253
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,349
We must each fend for our own selves now.

254
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,420
Ga Jin, do not worry.
We will look after your dad.

255
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,489
Get out of here for now, okay?

256
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,690
Come along.

257
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,089
Father.

258
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,380
Find Ga Jin!

259
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,749
Darn it.

260
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,289
Your friend says this
tunnel leads outside.

261
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,730
Follow me.

262
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,950
Are you okay? Can you manage?

263
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,489
When did you realize?

264
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:03,529
That I am a Cheonjubang assassin.

265
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,269
From the start.

266
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,299
Why did you pretend not to know?

267
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,809
Is that important right now?

268
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,210
If I had shown I knew, you
would have had to kill me.

269
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,849
I did not want to make you take a life.

270
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,089
If we fight here, someone will get hurt.

271
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,420
I do not want that, so we must hurry.

272
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,069
Come on.

273
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,220
Follow me.

274
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,610
If it is too much, get some rest.

275
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,610
No. It is just the effect of the powder.

276
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,279
There is an excuse for everything.

277
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,980
Do not worry about your father.

278
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
He seems stronger than he looks.

279
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,890
Your friends are not bad either.

280
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,759
I must go to Pyeongyang Castle.

281
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,829
Yeom Ga Jin.

282
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,339
Oh, my goodness. Ga Jin...

283
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,710
She left the rest of us
to save her own skin.

284
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,110
This is why they say one should
not take in another human being.

285
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,420
She is truly evil! Stop.

286
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:05,150
My goodness...

287
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,089
Tae Mo, what are you doing?

288
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,960
My goodness...

289
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,099
My goodness...

290
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:31,180
You got out of Cheonjubang...

291
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,950
and decided to quit killing.

292
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,989
You should live quietly in the wilderness.

293
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,989
What kind of wilderness? Your home?

294
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,860
Do not even dream of that.

295
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,390
Who said we would take you in?

296
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:51,999
Think again about going to Pyeongyang.

297
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,239
Many people deliberately bury their past.

298
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,309
There is no guarantee that...

299
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,140
recovering your past will make you happy.

300
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,950
I fear of falling asleep.

301
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,420
Each time I have a nightmare,

302
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:16,190
I wonder if it is a dream
or a memory I have lost.

303
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,789
It hurts so much I cannot even scream.

304
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,099
I am alive, but I feel as if I am dying.

305
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,640
Do you know how that feels?

306
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:42,480
However scary it may be, if
I do not find out who I am...

307
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,549
and why I am in such turmoil,

308
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,019
I cannot do anything.

309
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,819
Why not?

310
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,559
You may not remember yesterday,

311
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,679
but there is today, tomorrow,
and the day after that.

312
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,960
Just think of the days that will come.

313
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,269
Your parents and hometown?

314
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,970
Even without that,

315
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,970
human beings get by somehow.

316
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,150
About you.

317
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,049
Did something happen
before you went into hiding?

318
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,120
Fearing the world is just an excuse.

319
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,059
Did you commit a terrible crime?

320
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,860
Oh, come on.

321
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,130
I saved your life and you
repay me with an insult?

322
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,170
Whatever it is, that is your issue.

323
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,069
I will go to the Capital.

324
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,069
My gosh.

325
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,839
How do you think you will get in?

326
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,110
Since what you did last time,

327
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,180
they will not even let a mouse in now.

328
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,079
Then you go home.
Your mother is all alone.

329
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,480
We are as good as dead because of you.

330
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Exactly. Do not follow me
around and be a nuisance.

331
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,960
When was I ever...

332
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,819
Hey. Ouch, that is hot. Shoot.

333
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,559
Yeom Ga Jin! Wait up!

334
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,329
Yeom Deuk, San, and Jin
say they did not go to the cave.

335
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,769
They are lying, so a beating...

336
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,400
Do not be foolish.

337
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,809
You must find Ga Jin first.

338
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:18,809
I will find her. You cannot kill her.

339
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,549
She still is of some use to Cheonjubang.

340
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,589
Will you look at that?

341
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,730
What... "What did I say?"

342
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,329
Do not dare say that.

343
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,599
You cannot get into the palace.

344
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,170
What will you do now?

345
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,440
The court lady in Magnolia
Hall seemed to recognize me.

346
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,049
I wanted to ask her.

347
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,819
You should have said so sooner. Follow me.

348
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,759
Hey.

349
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,660
Salute!

350
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,930
Hey. Why are you still there? Come along.

351
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,269
I have the drawing you asked for.

352
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,160
Her hair is thicker than this.

353
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,829
And it is softer.

354
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,630
She does not just have a killer spirit.

355
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,499
She was also haughty and elegant.

356
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,269
Her lips should be plumper...

357
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,339
and have a sheen.

358
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,410
I will commission another drawing.

359
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,279
No. Leave this with me.

360
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,249
They will soon send
the head of the assassin.

361
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,890
That is good news.

362
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,620
This Cheonjubang chief.

363
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,890
He is not entirely trustworthy.

364
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,099
Then what?

365
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,999
Will word get out that we hired him?

366
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,900
What matters now is the King's health.

367
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,670
GO WON PYO, GYERU TRIBE'S GOCHUGA

368
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,809
His sickened soul
took him to death's door.

369
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,349
He will need even stronger medicine.

370
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,279
I had the Head Eunuch
bring something to him.

371
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,180
He will forget his earthly worries...

372
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,589
and fall into a trance.

373
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,789
My goodness. Who are you?

374
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,140
Who are you?

375
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,349
That herb is still young.

376
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,309
Do not touch it.

377
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,720
If you had hurt my hand,

378
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,089
you could not have made up
for it even if you sold this store.

379
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,559
What a pity.

380
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,960
If I had hurt your hand,

381
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I could show you myself
just how effective that herb is.

382
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,329
And before that,

383
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,170
you would have lost your head.

384
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:46,039
Are you saying your hand is worth my life?

385
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,269
Not at all.

386
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,210
It would be worth...

387
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,509
at least 10 of you.

388
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,220
Do Gyeru Tribe royals
have gold on their hands?

389
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,019
Do you know me?

390
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:06,460
You used to enjoy drinks and
women more than most jobless men,

391
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,960
but these days your life is boring
because you are after an assassin.

392
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,140
Now I get who you are.

393
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,809
I had heard that Hae Ji Weol
has a clever adopted daughter.

394
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,809
I am Hae Mo Yong.

395
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,019
Like you said, I ended up
here doing something boring.

396
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:34,019
Did a suspicious man sneak in here?

397
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:35,960
I did not see anyone.

398
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,660
Did you not?

399
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,400
Then I wasted my time.

400
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,670
We got to meet, so for me, it was a gain.

401
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,033
We need to find the owner of
the herb store in Mount Jangbaek.

402
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,264
An herb store? Yes.

403
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:14,733
That person knows
everything that happens...

404
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,104
in and outside of Pyeongyang Castle.

405
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:18,304
And that owner pretty much
has connections to everyone.

406
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:21,104
You might even get to meet
the court lady you are looking for.

407
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:23,104
But why are we at the mountain?

408
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:25,714
Do you think it will be easy
to meet someone like that?

409
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:29,444
We should at least bring
that person some wild ginseng.

410
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:30,843
Wild ginseng?

411
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:33,784
But how? That stuff
is really rare to find.

412
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,854
I found it!

413
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:46,863
Why are the leaves so...

414
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:50,304
It is a bellflower root.

415
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:54,304
But I am sure I saw five leaves.

416
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,054
It even tastes like a
bellflower root. Try it.

417
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:26,673
What?

418
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:32,974
Ga Jin, let us just pick all
the herbs in this mountain.

419
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,214
Bellflowers, dong quai roots,
and Siberian chrysanthemum.

420
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:36,334
Let us just pick everything.

421
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:41,214
Let us go.

422
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,093
He is unbelievable.

423
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:57,263
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

424
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:07,873
Your Majesty.

425
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,084
She is not an assassin. She is a ghost.

426
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,783
A ghost is here to get me.

427
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,714
She is a ghost. Your Majesty!

428
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:19,924
Your Majesty!

429
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,123
Please stop, Your Majesty. Get lost.

430
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:25,864
Get lost!

431
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,234
Your Majesty!

432
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:29,964
Please calm down.

433
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,473
Are you going to wait all night?

434
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:37,903
You should go now.

435
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,114
I should say hello.

436
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,544
CROWN PRINCE WON, FUTURE KING YEONGYANG

437
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:46,114
The king and crown
prince will not last very long.

438
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:49,153
He will try his best to
maintain his power...

439
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:51,924
until the crown prince grows older.

440
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,433
But in his state, he will
only last another year or two.

441
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:57,894
Then...

442
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:00,563
He will either collapsed
due to an overdose of drugs...

443
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:03,204
or willingly give up the throne.

444
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,103
AN ACT OF ABDICATING THE THRONE

445
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:07,204
There will come a day
when we will need a regent.

446
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:10,774
A PERSON WHO GOVERNS THE
COUNTRY ON BEHALF OF THE KING

447
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:18,214
The day you become a regent,

448
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:22,683
Geon will become the crown prince.

449
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:26,294
Then he will succeed
the throne in the future.

450
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:46,873
I want you to burn everything right now!

451
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,843
Yes... Your Majesty.

452
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:02,324
What is going on?

453
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:05,223
He asked them to burn everything
that belonged to the princess.

454
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:07,294
Why all of sudden?

455
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,864
I do not know.

456
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:11,764
Everyone must be seeing her ghost.

457
00:37:12,574 --> 00:37:14,074
What do you mean?

458
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,873
The thing is, a few days ago...

459
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,113
Princess.

460
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:24,684
She said "Princess"?

461
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:25,783
Strange, right?

462
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:29,553
Lady Gongson raised the
princess ever since she was a baby.

463
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,293
She would never mistake
her for another court maid.

464
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:56,684
I am worried this
might all be for nothing.

465
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:00,153
It might be better not
to remember anything.

466
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,223
I would do anything...

467
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,524
to forget what I have been through.

468
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:21,233
Goodness, you did not have
to bring me this at this late hour.

469
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,074
I know you are worried about Dal,

470
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:26,113
but we were worried about you.

471
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,473
Eat up so you can stay healthy.

472
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,884
That way, you will have the energy
to beat Dal once he comes back.

473
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:33,954
Why are you telling her to
beat Dal? He did nothing wrong.

474
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:37,884
Wol, do you know something?

475
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:41,954
My goodness, of course
not. I do not know anything.

476
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:44,064
Do not worry too much.

477
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,194
You know Dal would
not get himself in trouble.

478
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:48,694
My goodness, he should know better.

479
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,334
What is the matter?

480
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:51,704
Forget it.

481
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:54,074
I have too much on my mind. You should go.

482
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:58,004
Come on. Let us go.

483
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,144
That darn punk.

484
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:11,853
Thank you.

485
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:17,524
What is that?

486
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,303
You are awake.

487
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:25,504
It is nothing.

488
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:27,834
It is a drawing of the assassin.

489
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,403
Then it is something.

490
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:47,124
Did you also see the assassin that day?

491
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,024
No, I did not.

492
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,363
My lord, a letter just
came from the palace.

493
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,033
I will leave you to it.

494
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:12,314
Lady Gongson went after
the maid, but she disappeared.

495
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:16,624
Who do you think that maid was?

496
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:22,694
Is anyone there?

497
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:30,363
I separately packed the
medicinal herbs for His Majesty.

498
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:36,074
No one should find out which
medicinal herbs were used.

499
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,704
Of course.

500
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,533
Did I keep you waiting for too long?

501
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:07,954
I had to deliver some
medicinal herbs to the palace.

502
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:22,824
If you wish to find a woman, you
should go to a courtesan house.

503
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:24,884
She is the assassin
who tried to kill the king.

504
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,434
Have you ever seen that letter?

505
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:39,633
"A shaman..."

506
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,944
"will attack the king."

507
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:46,814
That letter was secretly given to
me on the day of the ceremony.

508
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,343
Do you think...

509
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:51,483
I was the one who sent it?

510
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:53,513
This place...

511
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:56,924
not only sells medicinal herbs.

512
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:00,223
I heard you also sell
people and information.

513
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,393
I want you to find the assassin.

514
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:07,893
And bring her to me first.

515
00:42:07,964 --> 00:42:12,034
Then what will I get in return?

516
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:13,103
"In return"?

517
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:16,873
You will not have to worry about...

518
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,914
my soldiers destroying your herb store.

519
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:24,684
The court musician who disappeared...

520
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,184
used to work for you.

521
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:32,523
You keep asking me
things I do not know of.

522
00:42:33,753 --> 00:42:34,753
Then...

523
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:39,294
I would also like to
ask you for something.

524
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,733
I want to know why Gochuga...

525
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,534
suddenly took...

526
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:48,304
Lady Gongson.

527
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:50,674
What?

528
00:42:51,843 --> 00:42:54,074
My lady. Come back later.

529
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:58,944
A couple of herb collectors
are selling their stuff outside.

530
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:09,564
Are your eyes dim, and do
your hands and feet feel numb?

531
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:13,034
And do you have a sore throat and knees?

532
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:16,103
Do you have no appetite?

533
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:18,934
And does alcohol not taste good?

534
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:23,273
That is all because you lack energy.

535
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:26,074
Take a look at her!

536
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:27,714
Ever since she was a kid,

537
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:31,483
she was always sick and weak.

538
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:35,454
So I checked her condition and figured...

539
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:38,554
that 20 of these pills will do the magic.

540
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:43,664
She gained so much
energy after she ate this.

541
00:43:43,794 --> 00:43:45,393
Whoever marries her...

542
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,733
should be ready to
exhaust himself to death.

543
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:49,664
My goodness.

544
00:43:50,204 --> 00:43:51,334
It must work wonders.

545
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:52,873
What are you doing?

546
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:58,074
I would not have gathered
you if I only had pills.

547
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,773
Mount Yongchu, Mount
Gonam, and Mount Baekryong.

548
00:44:00,773 --> 00:44:03,983
I went to all the great mountains...

549
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:06,353
to gather all these precious herbs.

550
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,654
After she ate these herbs,

551
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:14,054
she even picked up the
energy to learn martial arts!

552
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:15,824
Is that true?

553
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:18,194
You will believe me once
you see it for yourself.

554
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:20,434
What are you doing?

555
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:21,834
Come on.

556
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:25,603
Do you have a death wish?

557
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,473
I am doing this to live.

558
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:30,743
I am not going to play along with this.

559
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:33,183
Do you not want to meet the
owner of the Jangbaek herb store?

560
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:38,184
Come on. People are waiting.

561
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:40,914
I will seriously hurt you.

562
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:14,284
Did you see that?

563
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:17,723
Did you see her flying around?

564
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:22,324
That is all thanks to
the herbal pills she took.

565
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:24,664
Let me have some of that.

566
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:26,133
My goodness, stop pushing. Move.

567
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:29,304
Everyone, line up!

568
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,684
What are they doing?

569
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:45,883
Stay still.

570
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:49,424
How dare you cause a scene?

571
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:51,383
Who do you think you are?

572
00:45:56,324 --> 00:45:59,064
My goodness. Oh, dear.

573
00:46:02,964 --> 00:46:05,034
Take it easy, will you?

574
00:46:07,404 --> 00:46:09,773
How dare you create a scene?

575
00:46:09,773 --> 00:46:13,643
I wanted to meet you
and ask you something.

576
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:22,924
She is the assassin
who tried to kill the king.

577
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:35,834
I am here to find someone.

578
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,233
She can come in, but not him.

579
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:51,414
Who are you looking for?

580
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,853
She is someone who
worked at Magnolia Hall.

581
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,853
She is a middle-aged lady.

582
00:46:56,253 --> 00:46:57,554
Lady Gongson.

583
00:46:58,623 --> 00:46:59,753
"Gongson"?

584
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:01,554
You are very lucky.

585
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,393
I just heard something about her.

586
00:47:04,623 --> 00:47:06,393
What can I do to meet her?

587
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:08,034
Why are you looking for her?

588
00:47:08,863 --> 00:47:10,003
I cannot tell you.

589
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:11,804
Then what is your name?

590
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:13,503
You do not need to know that either.

591
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:19,143
I have my reasons, so please help me.

592
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:21,743
I will pay you... You already
helped me make money.

593
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:29,753
I was offered five chunks
of silver to find you.

594
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:32,184
That means...

595
00:47:33,523 --> 00:47:37,123
you will not be able to
walk out of here alive.

596
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:44,464
The moment something happens to me,

597
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:48,003
your friend will get beheaded.

598
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:17,334
Let us start over.

599
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,473
What is your name?

600
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:23,103
I do not know.

601
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:28,314
I am trying to meet with
her, so I can find that out.

602
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:31,084
You are telling me that you
do not know who you are.

603
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:32,853
If you let me talk to her,

604
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:36,383
I will gladly let you tie me up.

605
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:40,393
Then, you can hand me over to
the soldiers and take the reward.

606
00:48:57,973 --> 00:48:59,773
Forgive me for not treating you better,

607
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:01,544
but wait here quietly.

608
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,534
What?

609
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:41,013
Who are you?

610
00:49:42,584 --> 00:49:43,584
By any chance,

611
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,523
do you know who I am?

612
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:02,843
I vaguely remember a lullaby.

613
00:50:05,444 --> 00:50:07,414
I remember going to Magnolia Hall.

614
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:14,414
Was I a maid at the palace?

615
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:19,523
Goodness.

616
00:50:22,154 --> 00:50:23,993
Praise the divine forces.

617
00:50:25,964 --> 00:50:26,964
Lady.

618
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,634
You cannot be here.

619
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,704
You must run away at once!

620
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:35,303
If they find out you are alive,

621
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:37,573
they will try to kill you, My Princess.

622
00:50:42,013 --> 00:50:43,184
"Princess"?

623
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,743
What are you talking about?

624
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,184
I am not... How could you say that?

625
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:51,954
You are the daughter of the King.

626
00:50:52,454 --> 00:50:54,424
You are Princess Pyeonggang.

627
00:51:05,404 --> 00:51:06,404
Who are you?

628
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,243
Princess!

629
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,684
Other soldiers will be here.

630
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:25,283
You must run away now. Hurry!

631
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:35,364
This stays between you and me.

632
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:56,154
You two, clean up the
warehouse. Yes, my lord.

633
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,783
The four of you will chase
after the woman that just left.

634
00:51:58,954 --> 00:52:00,354
You are never to kill her.

635
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:01,573
Yes, my lord. Yes, my lord.

636
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:18,674
You are the daughter of the King.

637
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,914
You are Princess Pyeonggang.

638
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:08,523
What is going on?

639
00:53:55,134 --> 00:53:56,973
Where did the guards all go?

640
00:53:57,344 --> 00:53:58,344
Open it.

641
00:54:10,723 --> 00:54:13,553
Did you go to Magnolia Hall
the day before the ceremony?

642
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:14,624
Yes.

643
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:17,823
I go there once every 10 days...

644
00:54:18,164 --> 00:54:19,793
and clean the hall.

645
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:22,293
And you saw a maid you
have not seen before there.

646
00:54:25,104 --> 00:54:26,473
No, I did not.

647
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:27,773
There is a witness.

648
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:30,803
How dare you lie to him?

649
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,174
Well,

650
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:36,684
around the death
anniversary of the princess,

651
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:39,283
I tend to get confused.

652
00:54:39,414 --> 00:54:41,513
So I must have hallucinated...

653
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,753
and misspoken.

654
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:45,654
If what you are telling me is true,

655
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:48,104
your time at the palace
must be nearing its end.

656
00:54:49,094 --> 00:54:51,563
The prince has not recovered fully.

657
00:54:51,563 --> 00:54:53,493
I must look after him.

658
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,303
We cannot sacrifice the prince...

659
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:02,573
for the sake of the late princess.

660
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,344
Choose.

661
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:08,114
You can leave the palace now.

662
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:12,983
Or you can look after the
prince and be my eyes and ears.

663
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:21,993
Allow me...

664
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:25,563
to look after the prince.

665
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,283
I am not trying to run away.

666
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:54,454
The blood is all going to my head.
I wanted to be more comfortable.

667
00:55:57,263 --> 00:55:59,493
Tell me everything you
know about your friend.

668
00:55:59,993 --> 00:56:02,694
I do not know much. I
only met her recently.

669
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:05,434
But you risked your life for
someone you barely knew?

670
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:06,773
Who says I am going to die?

671
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:09,773
I will not die in a shed like this.

672
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:12,973
I am trying to help you.

673
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:16,013
It is hard to believe that when
you stick a dagger at my throat.

674
00:56:17,884 --> 00:56:19,483
Where is my friend now?

675
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,154
She needed to meet someone.

676
00:56:23,154 --> 00:56:25,483
So I told her how she could do that.

677
00:56:25,884 --> 00:56:27,993
You are just as I heard.
You do know everything.

678
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:31,223
Thank you. I will pay for your help.

679
00:56:32,594 --> 00:56:34,694
She will repay me.

680
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:37,134
I just secured collateral for her promise.

681
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,464
Collateral?

682
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,604
You.

683
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:45,174
Well, this position is
quite uncomfortable.

684
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,174
But it is doable.

685
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:48,644
"Doable".

686
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:58,723
For every two hours,
you will bleed half a hop.

687
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:02,394
You must pray that she comes back...

688
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:04,624
before you bleed out.

689
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:07,033
Hey.

690
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:09,563
You should pray too.

691
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:13,503
If anything happens to my friend,

692
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:17,003
I am going to destroy this place.

693
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:22,944
Sure. Let us pray together.

694
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:34,214
Princess!

695
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:37,013
My goodness. Where are you going?

696
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:24,993
Father!

697
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:32,604
My Princess. I did not hear you
come in. How did you get here?

698
01:00:32,664 --> 01:00:34,833
It is a secret. No one knows it, but me.

699
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,844
You will keep that a secret?

700
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,674
I have a present. Please close your eyes.

701
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:41,844
Sure.

702
01:00:44,884 --> 01:00:46,144
You can open them now.

703
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:52,654
Yes. This flower resembles...

704
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,553
the lady of Magnolia Hall.

705
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:11,644
I do not need any of you!

706
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:13,973
You are foolish and vulgar!

707
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:18,243
Who is there?

708
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:25,654
Do not hide there like a rat.

709
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:27,253
Show yourself.

710
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:45,944
Do you...

711
01:01:47,414 --> 01:01:48,973
recognize me?

712
01:01:52,114 --> 01:01:53,114
You are...

713
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,924
Yes. I am Pyeonggang.

714
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:05,023
Why did you do it?

715
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:09,263
Why did you abandon me?

716
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:13,874
Father.
