00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,980
EPISODE 13

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,784
50,000 Northern Zhou men attacked
and broke through Liaodong Fortress,

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,250
and then they felled Baekam Fortress.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,330
The main army is moving
south quickly to cross the Paesu.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,204
It has only been a few years
since we vowed to stay friendly...

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,810
and help each other.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,500
But they raised an army against us?

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,170
You must focus on your health...

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,840
Our border was penetrated...

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,850
and you want me to lie in bed?

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,080
Gochuga, what do you think?

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,930
First of all,

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,350
you must summon all the
men who serve Daemodal...

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,260
and the Five Bu soldiers
of the Central Army.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,290
I agree with you.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,360
Also, the Five Tribes'
private army should also...

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,260
prepare to fight.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,840
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,460
The longer we drag this on,

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,230
the more disadvantageous it will be.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,500
We must gather my men and yours...

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,810
to defeat the enemy
before they cross the Paesu.

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,280
You should reconsider going to war.

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,340
It is the King's duty.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,460
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,020
General Go! What is it?

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,930
The Northern Zhou has invaded our border.

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,460
Then we are at war?

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,910
Yes. Gochuga commands
you to gather your army...

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,570
and return quickly.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,750
What your scout reported.
What was that about?

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,020
Princess. If you are that curious,
return with me to the palace.

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,880
Master Go.

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,630
The Northern Zhou
army crossed the border...

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
and are headed south toward the Paesu.

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,804
THE PAESU: THE RIVER SERVING
AS THE BORDER TO CHINA

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,330
I heard that. Also,

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,250
the King will lead the army himself.

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,430
Do you get that?

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,580
In times like these,

43
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,320
this is not where you should be.

44
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,230
I decide where I must be.

45
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,190
Since I am here with my men,

46
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,110
I could decide for you.

47
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,620
Hey.

48
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,090
What are you threatening
her with this time?

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Do not rejoice that you survived.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,330
Your death was only postponed.

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,470
You and your tribe will
eventually be suppressed.

52
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,660
You punk.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,340
We have no time for this.

54
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,230
We must go.

55
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,140
Hurry!

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,490
Yes, General.

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,570
Hurry!

58
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,810
You cannot go to war.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,890
You only managed to
recover from your illness.

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,960
You cannot go to war like this.

61
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,630
Please change your mind.

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,970
The Crown Prince will accompany me.

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,340
Crown Prince.

64
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,100
The five fortresses to
the north of the Paesu.

65
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,700
The fortresses and camps...

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,610
that stretch across
Liaodong, I built myself.

67
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,210
This fight is to protect that land.

68
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,160
I shall willingly fight
alongside you, Father.

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,170
Good.

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Will Prince Geon Mu rise to the throne?

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,250
Your prince has the fortune to become...

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,570
a king one day.

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
Are you sure about that?

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
I swear that on my life.

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,210
Since you have decided to go to war,

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,850
there is nothing I can do to stop you.

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,950
I wish that you return
safely, Crown Prince.

78
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,130
Do not worry.

79
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,420
My goodness.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,690
Me, go to war at this age?

81
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,660
Lord Hae, why did you not say anything?

82
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,800
The King himself said he will...

83
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,670
lead his men into
battle in his frail state.

84
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,200
When we are at war,
we of the Five Tribes...

85
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,410
cannot just try to save our skin.

86
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,700
War is a crisis,

87
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,180
but it also serves as an opportunity to...

88
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,450
eliminate concerns inside and out.

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,790
The skies have blessed Goguryeo.

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,520
Do you wish to go to war?

91
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,700
It is a small number,

92
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,310
but we have enough men to form an army.

93
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,520
And we also have weapons.

94
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,540
So we raise the Sunno flag...

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,080
and go to battle?

96
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,940
This is an opportunity from on high.

97
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,470
If we gain victory,

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,430
the King will willingly agree
to reinstate the Sunno Tribe.

99
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,270
What do you say, General?

100
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,450
If you give the order,

101
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,760
I will take my men and fight.

102
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,260
Yes, Father. The time has come.

103
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,550
We should fight.

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,340
Hey. Why are you so quiet?

105
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,830
Well...

106
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,070
Fighting to protect the village...

107
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
is completely different from going to war.

108
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,280
Once we set out with
our men, we cannot stop...

109
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,410
nor turn back.

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,680
Are you backing down
because you are afraid?

111
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,550
Dal. If the Northern Zhou
manages to come down south,

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,320
we will no longer be safe here.

113
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,930
This is for Goguryeo, but it is also...

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
to protect the village.

115
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,850
If General On were here,

116
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,100
he would have gone to fight.

117
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,270
We need you.

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
We leave at daybreak.

119
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,790
Set off first with 500 men.

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,370
You must secure an area
south of the Paesu for our camp.

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,630
We will leave as soon as we are ready.

122
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,630
The Princess. Did you see her?

123
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes.

124
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,030
She will have armed the Sunno Tribe,

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,770
along with On Hyeop's son.

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,860
This is just my guess,

127
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,540
but I have a feeling the
Sunno Tribe will join the war.

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,770
I see.

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,040
I did not think of that.

130
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,320
They will try to use the
war to regain their honor.

131
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,410
That is it.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
Do not take them lightly.

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,660
General On's son...

134
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,150
was an immature fool.

135
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,900
He has become a strong fighter.

136
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,800
The bloodline of the defeated
leads only to more defeats.

137
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,660
Geon.

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,680
You must remind him of his fate.

139
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,100
I will.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,900
Are you curious about my sword?

141
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,990
I am sorry.

142
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,874
I used to have a sword that was
much more precious than this one.

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,310
But it broke, so I cannot show it to you.

144
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,850
I advise you to stay away from swords.

145
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,090
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

146
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,580
I am proud to hear that.

147
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,670
When that day comes, that
sword will be used to protect you.

148
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,800
You should tell your mother.

149
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,500
That you are leaving to war.

150
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,770
This was General On's armor.

151
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,010
He wore it when he went to battle.

152
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,750
I prayed to the skies and spirits...

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,860
that the day you wear it would never come.

154
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,870
It cannot be helped now. Our
nation is about to be ruined.

155
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,630
General On will protect you.

156
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,410
Believe that.

157
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,060
I will.

158
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,440
I am sure the thread
will follow the needle.

159
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,630
Do not worry too much.

160
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,450
Dal and I will return safely.

161
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
You should go.

162
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,930
Every moment counts.

163
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,600
How did you fall in
love in times like these?

164
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,080
Why are you here when you
must be busy with preparations?

165
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,320
I did not come to ask
you to pray for my safety.

166
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,154
PRAYERS WERE SAID SO MEN
WOULD RETURN FROM WAR SAFELY.

167
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
We are at war,

168
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,990
and you will send a
secret letter to Silla.

169
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,550
Write exactly what I say.

170
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,530
"Goguryeo's main army
fights against Northern Zhou,"

171
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,600
"but they do not neglect
security to the Silla border."

172
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,130
"Do not use the war..."

173
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,080
"as an excuse to attack rashly."

174
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,030
Write that.

175
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,420
Are you commanding me to betray Silla?

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,810
I am...

177
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,930
helping your king to
not make a bad decision.

178
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,060
If my letter is exposed as a lie,

179
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,870
my life will be threatened.

180
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,570
You achieved a lot so far as a spy.

181
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
They will not harm you easily.

182
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,710
I would rather you cut me down.

183
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,750
That way, there will be no backlash.

184
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,550
I have no intention of doing that.

185
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,080
Because...

186
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,810
you will do as I say.

187
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,160
Do not be so sure of that.

188
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
I am not your woman.

189
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,430
I will contribute greatly
to our victory and return.

190
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,910
I hope you will welcome me then.

191
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,240
You think you are great to the very end.

192
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,490
That is what I am truly like.

193
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,070
I hope you do not get hurt.

194
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,430
What is it?

195
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,370
Nothing.

196
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,780
Here.

197
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,390
It is a signal pouch with colored powder.

198
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,490
A signal pouch?

199
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,890
If you are in danger,

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,460
tie it to an arrow and shoot.

201
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,730
Then I can see even from far away.

202
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,780
I doubt I will need it.

203
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,040
I will always be next
to you even in battle.

204
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,780
How do you manage to crack jokes?

205
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,110
Northern Zhou or Goguryeo,

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I know nothing about all that,

207
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,940
nor do I care.

208
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,910
I only...

209
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,780
fight for you.

210
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,390
I will protect you too.

211
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,050
At your side.

212
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,310
50,000 Northern Zhou men
are camped across the Paesu.

213
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,510
They are transporting
wood to cross the river.

214
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,200
Do we have 30,000 men?

215
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,820
20,000 more will join us within days.

216
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,790
It is worth a fight.

217
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,150
The problem is Northern
Zhou's Mercenary Army.

218
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,680
The Mercenary Army?

219
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,670
You mean their special forces
made up of foreign barbarians?

220
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,970
I heard they are vicious
beyond imagination.

221
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,900
My scouts say...

222
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,600
they are detouring around the
front away from the main army.

223
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,570
I believe...

224
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,150
they plan to cross this plain.

225
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,900
They plan to delay...

226
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,610
the 20,000 men on the way to join us.

227
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,750
While they distract our rear,

228
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,150
the main army will cross the Paesu.

229
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,230
If their main army of
50,000 attacks our 30,000,

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,060
do you think we stand a chance?

231
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,980
Lord Jin.

232
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,330
I would like to send General Go Geon...

233
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,470
and my elite troop to the plain.

234
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,064
They can stop the Mercenary Army...

235
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,270
and protect our main army's rear.

236
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,360
General Go. Yes, Sire.

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,700
It is a hard and important fight...

238
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,410
that will decide the
outcome of our battle.

239
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
Leave it to me.

240
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,420
Barbarian blood will flow like a river.

241
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,070
I must leave for the plains soon.

242
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
You were right.

243
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,080
The Sunno Tribe seems to want to fight.

244
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,940
Really?

245
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,810
You are up against a vicious army,

246
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,480
which you also cannot guarantee victory.

247
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,450
So I sent a secret
message to the Princess.

248
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,820
What do you mean?

249
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,790
"The King showed favor to you traitors."

250
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,890
"The Sunno Tribe is to
go to Pyeongsa Plain..."

251
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,400
"and stop Northern Zhou's Mercenary Army."

252
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,270
That is what my letter says.

253
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,570
They are a rag-tag
bunch with very few men.

254
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
How could they...

255
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,190
You sent them...

256
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,880
to their death.

257
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,510
"Borrow one's strength to win."

258
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,850
TO USE SOMEONE TO TAKE OUT ANOTHER.

259
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,420
The traitors will be eliminated
at the hands of the barbarians.

260
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,360
They will stall the
barbarians until you get there,

261
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,460
and most likely weaken their force.

262
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,150
At the end of that fight,

263
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,430
you just have to return victoriously.

264
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,820
Father.

265
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,200
The Princess is among them.

266
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,070
I already gave you a chance,

267
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,940
but you failed to persuade her.

268
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,740
Whether she chooses to live or die...

269
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,720
is up to the Princess now.

270
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,040
This does not make sense.

271
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,960
We cannot fight 1,000 men with just 300.

272
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,610
And the Mercenary Army is
Northern Zhou's strongest army.

273
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,730
I have also heard of the Mercenary Army.

274
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,540
They're a group of barbarians
like the Gokturks and Mohe.

275
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,410
They want us to die, Father.

276
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,180
This is Go Won Pyo's trick.

277
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,480
He made a plausible excuse
to send us to our deaths,

278
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,610
hoping that we will be annihilated.

279
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,550
Chief. The Princess is right.

280
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,590
As planned, we should
join Goguryeo's main army...

281
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
That will not work.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,200
We will make no difference
if we mix in with them.

283
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,160
We should crush the barbarians,

284
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,230
the Mercenary Army, or whatever they are,

285
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,500
if we are to proudly say
we accomplished something.

286
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,540
Hey. They are paid soldiers.

287
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,270
Experienced fighters in battle.

288
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,530
Exactly.

289
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,110
We just have to get the leader.

290
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,450
What? That is what mercenaries are.

291
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,270
They fight for money.

292
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,190
If they see their leader die,

293
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,150
would they risk their lives to fight?

294
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,120
If we kill the leader,

295
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,420
they will scatter.

296
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,160
Okay, fine. But how do we get the leader?

297
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,640
That is something for
my smart wife to figure out.

298
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,060
Dal.

299
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
I get what you mean,

300
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,610
but the outcome of this fight is obvious.

301
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
We cannot win.

302
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,820
You call this an opportunity from on high.

303
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,110
If it were that easy, the
skies would not have sent it.

304
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,520
We are much closer to Pyeongsa Plain.

305
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,320
Before anyone else gets to them,

306
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,010
we must get them first.

307
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,250
I will do it, Ga Jin.

308
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,430
Hey.

309
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,270
Have you not seen me before?

310
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,250
You are ignoring me.

311
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,000
Hey. What are you doing?

312
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,550
He is Go Won Pyo's minion.

313
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,350
When they had us,

314
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,040
I bet he beat us up too.

315
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,520
Yes or no, he is a messenger.

316
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,210
Do you know what that is?

317
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,560
It is the same as an envoy.

318
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,170
You cannot hurt him.

319
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,390
What is the matter?

320
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
No. It is nothing.

321
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,070
You became a Goguryeo
person all because of a man.

322
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
You are crazy.

323
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,300
What?

324
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,800
Inform the main army.

325
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,190
The Sunno Tribe will go
to Pyeongsa Plain and...

326
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,680
that we will preemptively wipe out
the Northern Zhou Mercenary Army.

327
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,710
Please be safe.

328
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,510
This war came out of nowhere,
and now it is taking you away.

329
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,120
Stop crying already.

330
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,410
My goodness.

331
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,410
Here.

332
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,780
It is a talisman.

333
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,320
If you keep it with you, you will be safe.

334
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,330
Why are you giving this to me?

335
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,220
Everyone else has a partner,

336
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,030
but you do not have anyone.

337
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,560
Why, this little...

338
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,550
Thank you.

339
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,970
Ga Jin, if you find you cannot stand it,

340
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,160
just close your eyes...

341
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,970
and surrender.

342
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,320
The battle...

343
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,230
is not worth your life.

344
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,580
Do not worry, Father.

345
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,270
I shall win. All right.

346
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,050
Dal, I'm leaving her in your hands.

347
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,660
I will be right by her
side, protecting her.

348
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,110
Now.

349
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,580
To battle!

350
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,740
The Princess is heading to battle?

351
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,844
According to the information
provided by the messenger,

352
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,110
she is leading an army of 300
from the Sunno Tribe to the border.

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,510
Does that mean she is planning to
face the Northern Zhou mercenaries?

354
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,480
That is as useless as trying
to break a boulder with an egg.

355
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,690
Order her to disband immediately.

356
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,120
Is this not very much like her?

357
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,020
What?

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,060
She has undertaken a difficult fight...

359
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,334
for the Sunno Tribe, knowing
that they are suspected of treason.

360
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,600
Why not give the Sunno Tribe
this chance to redeem themselves?

361
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,004
General Go is also on his way there,

362
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,210
so their odds are not impossible.

363
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,514
First, you suggested
that we suppress them...

364
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,110
because you suspected them of treason,

365
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,840
and now you suggest
giving them an opportunity?

366
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,300
These are critical times.
When the nation is at stake,

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
personal feelings must be set aside.

368
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,190
If the Sunno Tribe achieves victory,

369
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,560
I will reward them accordingly
to the Non Gong Haeng Sang.

370
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,160
Including reinstating
their status, of course.

371
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,230
NON GONG HAENG SANG: REWARD BY
THE MAGNITUDE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT

372
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
Indeed, Sire.

373
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,290
The scouts have confirmed...

374
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,490
that they were unable to
discover traces of ambush.

375
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,394
SCOUTS: SOLDIERS CONDUCTING
RECONNAISSANCE OF THE ENEMY

376
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,000
If we keep marching,

377
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,700
we will reach Pyeongsa
Plain by sundown tomorrow.

378
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,590
That is so.

379
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,470
That will be too late.

380
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,280
We will cross Mount Seonak.

381
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,870
Yes, sir. Once we cross the mountain,

382
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,810
we will arrive at Pyeongsa
Plain during the day.

383
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,080
However, that is a dangerous path.

384
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,714
How can we cross it with
our horses and equipment?

385
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,250
If there is no path, we will make one.

386
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,050
Those who cannot keep
up will be left behind.

387
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,910
General.

388
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,390
I do not care if the Sunno
Tribe gets annihilated.

389
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,460
However, the Princess is there.

390
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,430
That is why we must hurry.

391
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,000
This plan will be difficult to pull off.

392
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,330
Yes, it is dangerous for
you, Princess, and for Dal.

393
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,260
Yet we have no hopes of
winning if we face them head-on.

394
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,870
We will have to take the risk.

395
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
But... Trust Ga Jin.

396
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,510
I will be there, as well as Pung Gae.

397
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,640
We also have San and Jin.

398
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,270
Not long after I had joined Cheonjubang,

399
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,880
the two of you came.

400
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,670
San was such a troublemaker.

401
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,410
Jin, you were the one
who took care of him.

402
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,540
What about it?

403
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,190
Whenever I struggle,

404
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,620
I think it would be nice
to have siblings like that.

405
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,750
I was envious.

406
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,160
San must feel lonely these days.

407
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,280
I have Dal,

408
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,920
and you have Pung Gae.

409
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,550
But Pung Gae is not...

410
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,400
Does that mean he has to be so sulky?

411
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,440
You saw him earlier, did you not? So rude.

412
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,830
How frustrating.

413
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,970
Jin.

414
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,080
We are fighting for our dignity.

415
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,880
If you and San are not on good terms,

416
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,570
all of us will feel bad.

417
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,730
Dismount.

418
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,730
Yes, sir.

419
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,800
Do not lose sight of the course.

420
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,474
Those who fall behind will be left behind.

421
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,330
Yes, sir.

422
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,790
Now, quickly!

423
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,390
Everyone is walking on a tightrope.

424
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,760
With even a single misstep,

425
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,770
they will fall into the abyss.

426
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,840
Is that not true for you also, My lady?

427
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,400
That is why you asked me to see...

428
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,340
whether General Go would die.

429
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,900
I see.

430
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,610
So he is the one you love.

431
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,800
Just answer the question.

432
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,690
I take no pleasure in our conversation.

433
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,450
My lady, you and that fellow...

434
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,790
will be a boon to one
another if you succeed.

435
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,080
But if you fail,

436
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,030
you will be buried together.

437
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,460
Fortune-tellers and shamans
always say the same thing.

438
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,374
Regardless of what they say,

439
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,710
they craft words in wily sentences,

440
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,440
and later put forward
just the parts they got right.

441
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,970
Go back.

442
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,300
What do you think will
happen to the Princess?

443
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,120
Do you not wish to know
whether she will live or die?

444
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,690
The Princess must disappear...

445
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,380
for your love to blossom.

446
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,800
We pray, we pray.

447
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,070
We pray to the skies and the spirits.

448
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
We pray for the safe return...

449
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
of Dal and my daughter-in-law.

450
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,550
We pray for the safety
of our Chief as well.

451
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,270
That's right.

452
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,390
Please ensure that everyone
from the village is safe.

453
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,340
This we pray.

454
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,780
This we pray.

455
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
This we pray.

456
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,824
I am Pyeonggang, the eldest daughter
of King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo.

457
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,590
I am the eldest son of General
On of the Sunno Tribe, On Dal.

458
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,920
We have come to surrender
to the Northern Zhou army.

459
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,490
Lay down your arms.

460
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,450
GENERAL WIBALTA, LEADER OF THE
NORTHERN ZHOU MERCENARY ARMY

461
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,160
The Sunno soldiers...

462
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,210
have surrendered to
the Northern Zhou army.

463
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,210
What do you mean, surrender?

464
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,620
Do you mean they
surrendered even without a fight?

465
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,070
Yes, I believe so.

466
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,010
What about the Princess?

467
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,670
It is said that the Princess herself
has led the soldiers to surrender.

468
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,410
The Princess, herself?

469
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,940
Why, this is...

470
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,500
I heard a rumor that you
were planning to face us...

471
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,110
with fewer than 300 soldiers.

472
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,800
Do you now fear death?

473
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,690
I do not fear death.

474
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,110
I simply do not wish
for death without honor.

475
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,970
What?

476
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,550
The Sunno Tribe was
abandoned by Goguryeo long ago.

477
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,250
However, they sent us to
the frontlines of war to die.

478
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,530
Who would wish to fight?

479
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,260
Where is the rest of your army?

480
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,530
There were far fewer than
300 when we counted them.

481
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,410
Several of them fled on our march here.

482
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,020
The princess of Goguryeo is...

483
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,390
betraying her father
and surrendering herself?

484
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Do you expect me to believe that nonsense?

485
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,290
I got kicked out because I
aroused my father's anger.

486
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,660
He cut ties with me, and I
was forced to leave the palace.

487
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,560
Now he is telling me
to die on the battlefield.

488
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,250
I cannot obey his order.

489
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,440
I am not betraying him. I
am only trying to survive.

490
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,540
So I heard the rumors about you.

491
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,170
They said the princess of
Goguryeo got married to a fool...

492
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,010
and got kicked out of the palace.

493
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,460
That was you guys.

494
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,220
Did you just call me a fool?

495
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,530
Please have mercy on us, General.

496
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,230
This is not for me to decide.

497
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,490
I will send you to our
military headquarters.

498
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,440
You can kneel before
our head general and beg.

499
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
I am coming along.

500
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,770
One of you should stay here.

501
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,290
Get the horses ready.

502
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,250
What shall we do? This
was not part of our plan.

503
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,880
It is okay. It will only delay our plan.

504
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,610
What do you mean it is okay?

505
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,784
You are going to the headquarters
of Northern Zhou alone.

506
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,470
I can protect myself.

507
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,910
Ga Jin.

508
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,650
I will come back before the sun sets.

509
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,120
Until then, stay put and wait for me.

510
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
If you get hurt even a little,

511
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,360
I will...

512
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,380
crush all of them.

513
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,280
You should be careful too.

514
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,650
Giddy-up!

515
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,210
Do not worry so much.

516
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,260
You know Pyeonggang would
not surrender without even trying.

517
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,130
She must have a hidden plan.

518
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,300
I know that.

519
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,470
That is why I am even more worried.

520
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,330
Pardon?

521
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,240
Pyeonggang has only taken the rough paths,

522
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,780
refusing to take the comfortable ones.

523
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,550
She is firm with her choices,

524
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,510
but I wonder if she will
be lucky this time as well.

525
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,200
I believe in Pyeonggang.

526
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,850
As soon as she destroys the
Northern Zhou Mercenary Army,

527
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,440
you should strike the
headquarters of the Northern Zhou.

528
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,500
Of course. I will do that.

529
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,040
I must do that.

530
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,810
What will you do?

531
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,390
Have you checked where
they put our weapons?

532
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,180
They moved them to the
wagons behind the barracks.

533
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,640
We will make our move at
night when Ga Jin comes back.

534
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,160
Did you hear? I hear General
Wibalta is going to kill them all.

535
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,020
Really?

536
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,770
I hear they took the girl to kill her.

537
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,520
Hey! We are in trouble!

538
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,610
Why are you causing a
fuss again? What is it?

539
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,520
I heard them talking
in Turkic while working.

540
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,180
They said Ga Jin will not be coming back.

541
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,654
They said the headquarters
will hold Ga Jin hostage,

542
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,680
and if that becomes
useless, they will kill her.

543
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,050
They will also kill all of us
as soon as the sun rises.

544
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,260
Are you sure about it? Of course!

545
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,264
They did not believe it when Ga
Jin said she will surrender herself.

546
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,764
Are you sure you did not hear them wrong?

547
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,260
I am a Gokturk. Do you think I
would mishear my own language?

548
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,430
It is because you are the clumsy type.

549
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,000
What did you just say?
Hey, hey. Cut it out.

550
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,690
If what San said is true,

551
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,980
we are like rats in a trap.

552
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,240
What is worse is that we
walked into the trap ourselves.

553
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,610
Then we should break out of the trap.

554
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,500
After that,

555
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,850
we are going to save Ga Jin too.

556
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,130
What is going on? Darn you!

557
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,630
What is happening? What is wrong with you?

558
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,320
Do not do that! Stop!

559
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,140
What is wrong with you? Stop it!

560
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,260
Hey, come on! Stop!

561
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,190
What is happening? Move!

562
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,850
Calm down, everyone.

563
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
It is nothing.

564
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,110
We were just playing around.

565
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,780
This is scary. Why would
you put these in our faces?

566
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,400
Let go of it! Hey!

567
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,210
What do you mean, let go?

568
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,070
Let us go!

569
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,840
Whoa.

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,850
Dal.

571
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,370
Get him!

572
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,360
Dal, wait for me.

573
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,480
Father.

574
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,990
Our army is here!

575
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,970
Please hang in there until I make it back.

576
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,860
It seems like it is already over.

577
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,860
Did I come too late?

578
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,860
The Northern Zhou Mercenary
Army must be exhausted.

579
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,940
Let us go and destroy them.

580
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,580
Are you okay?

581
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,520
San!

582
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,230
San!

583
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,200
Wake up!

584
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,350
You fool! Wake up! Are you okay?

585
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,000
You said...

586
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,220
you cannot live without me, right?

587
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,910
I cannot, so do not die!

588
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,890
No! Wake up, San!

589
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,620
San! San!

590
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,150
Ga Jin...

591
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,170
Dal.

592
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,750
I miss you,

593
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,090
Ga Jin.

594
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,070
Wibalta is down!

595
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,200
Wibalta is down!

596
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,380
Yes!

597
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,510
Wibalta is down! We won!

598
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,780
We won!

599
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,290
Yes!

600
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,520
Wibalta is down!

601
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,520
General Go, please give us your order now.

602
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,350
That is the flag of Goguryeo.

603
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,930
That is the flag of the Sunno Tribe.

604
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,430
How did they...

605
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,210
Dal. Dal.

606
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,060
We won.

607
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,890
I fought to the death.

608
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,520
You should have just
waited for me, you fool.

609
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,430
Ga Jin, you are...

610
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,990
my Goguryeo,

611
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,810
my kingdom.

612
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,100
Thank you for staying alive.

613
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,030
Salute! Salute!

614
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,800
The enemies will cross the river.

615
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,820
Have the reinforcements arrived?

616
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,030
They just joined the Sunno Tribe.

617
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,464
This is all thanks to
Princess Pyeonggang...

618
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,260
who destroyed the Northern
Zhou Mercenary Army.

619
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,590
Now, it is time for our
kingdom to show our bravery.

620
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,270
Advance the troops
and horses to the river!

621
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,220
Salute! Salute!

622
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,890
Salute! Salute!

623
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,360
Salute! Salute!

624
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,800
Salute! Salute!

625
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,430
Salute! Salute!

626
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,060
Hey, are you up?

627
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,240
Hey!

628
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,400
Hey, are you up?

629
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,650
My gosh. What is it? What happened?

630
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,790
A man came from the battlefield.

631
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,820
And?

632
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,790
And what happened? Tell
me quickly, I am dying here.

633
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,590
They won.

634
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,430
They did? Yes.

635
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,010
The Sunno Tribe won a great victory.

636
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,910
Continuing the winning
streak, the King's army...

637
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,510
kicked those Northern
Zhou rascals out of Goguryeo!

638
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,190
The war is over now!

639
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,640
Oh, so then...

640
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,750
what about Dal and my daughter-in-law?

641
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,660
They are safe. They
did not get hurt either.

642
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,510
My goodness. Thank you.

643
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,230
Thank the skies and the
spirits! Thank you so much.

644
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,670
I was worried sick that something
terrible would happen to the Chief.

645
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,360
There is no time to lose.

646
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,970
I should hurry and boil some chicken.

647
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,840
No. They are not coming straight home.

648
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,980
They are heading to Pyeongyang.

649
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,070
For what?

650
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,340
What else?

651
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,730
He is going to be
rewarded for his contribution.

652
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,490
He was summoned by His Majesty himself.

653
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,210
I see.

654
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,040
Pung Gae.

655
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,970
Yes?

656
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,890
You do not have to go to Pyeongyang.

657
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,090
Take the boy to Ghost Valley.

658
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:35,680
Yes.

659
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,640
Good work. Bye.

660
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,210
San did not only save us...

661
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,900
but also our country.

662
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,720
And he is not even from Goguryeo.

663
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,390
I am sorry, Jin. I am so sorry.

664
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,440
Princess Pyeonggang
and her husband, On Dal.

665
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,550
Your Majesty.

666
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,500
I, On Hyeop, the chief of the Sunno Tribe,

667
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,900
have successfully defended
the country against Silla.

668
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,480
I am proud of your bravery.

669
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,680
Much obliged, Your Majesty.
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

670
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,520
Your unknown and
insignificant subject, On Dal,

671
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,660
bow down humbly at your service.

672
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,400
You may stand up.

673
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,220
Stand up.

674
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,550
You are my daughter,

675
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,670
and you are my son.

676
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,540
You all are...

677
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,100
my soldiers and subjects.

678
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,280
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

679
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,520
Much obliged, Your Majesty.
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

680
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:50,690
Considering their outstanding
contributions to our victory,

681
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,120
the Sunno Tribe may return
to the Five Tribe council...

682
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,330
as of this day.

683
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,050
Also,

684
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,600
they shall no longer
be recorded as traitors.

685
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,330
All the wealth and property...

686
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,860
that was confiscated shall
be returned to them as well.

687
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,110
As you wish, Your Majesty.

688
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,330
Gochuga.

689
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,440
This has already been agreed upon,

690
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,050
so I assume that you have no objection.

691
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,970
You made a reasonable and
generous decision, Your Majesty.

692
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,570
Thanks to everyone's bravery and loyalty,

693
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,240
we overcame a crisis and prevented war.

694
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,910
Everyone in Goguryeo deserves a feast.

695
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,010
Open the royal storehouses!

696
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,420
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

697
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,400
Is your attire uncomfortable?

698
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,890
No.

699
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,040
It is just a bit too long.

700
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,850
Get used to it quickly. You
will be wearing it every day.

701
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,490
Pyeonggang.

702
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,300
Won. Won.

703
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,130
I mean, Your Highness.

704
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:29,090
I heard that you fought
as well. I am proud of you.

705
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,810
Father led 50,000 troops.

706
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,730
His dignity was breathtaking.

707
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,990
I wish you could have seen him.

708
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,870
Won, you should go back now.

709
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,940
You have preparations to make.

710
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,340
But it will be hours before the sun sets.

711
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,550
Do as she says.

712
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Dal and I will visit you
at your chambers soon.

713
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,910
As His Majesty has acknowledged you both,

714
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,150
I believe that it is
time to hold a wedding.

715
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,980
It shall be known to everyone.

716
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,990
I appreciate your offer,
but I must decline it.

717
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,950
We already had a wedding ourselves...

718
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,660
and exchanged our tokens of
affection. That is enough for us.

719
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,660
Tokens of affection? Which
gemstones did you choose?

720
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,950
Can you show me?

721
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,190
Lovely.

722
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,180
If that is what you
want, I will not insist.

723
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,970
Magnolia Hall will be under
renovation starting tomorrow.

724
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,380
There is much work to do before
you two can stay there together.

725
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,510
Magnolia Hall?

726
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,680
Is that where we are going to live?

727
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,370
I will explain later.

728
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,350
I heard that you took
very good care of Father...

729
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,040
while he was bedridden.

730
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,290
I cannot thank you enough.

731
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,740
Do not mention it.

732
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,240
It is the Queen's duty
to look after the King.

733
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,860
There is no need for you to thank me.

734
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,520
I understand.

735
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,870
It was truly a divine blessing.

736
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,544
A DIVINE BLESSING: FAVOR
AND PROTECTION FROM ON HIGH

737
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:30,740
It was with the help of an
excellent fortune-teller...

738
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,550
that His Majesty recovered.

739
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
All preparations are complete.

740
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,470
With Ga Jin moving into the palace,

741
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,670
today is the last day I
will play a fortune-teller.

742
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,770
I have waited for more than a
decade to carry out my divine mission.

743
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,890
Today is a good day.

744
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,630
On my way back from Pyeongsa Plain,

745
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,280
I realized something.

746
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,810
The real war...

747
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,640
did not begin in Northern Zhou...

748
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,320
but in Pyeongyang.

749
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,080
Right in the middle of the palace.

750
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,814
Princess Pyeonggang and the
son of General On Hyeop are,

751
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,250
by no means, easy opponents. Even so,

752
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,260
I will win this war at
all costs. And I will...

753
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,730
offer the two of them to you as trophies.

754
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,850
What do you think you are doing?

755
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,630
You showed me this portrait once,

756
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,820
telling me you were
looking for this woman.

757
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,350
So have you found her?

758
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,580
Have you won her over?

759
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,760
Burning the portrait will not
erase your feelings for her as well.

760
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,900
Please do not despair.

761
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,880
If you stop here,

762
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,524
you will be swallowing the
ashes this woman left behind...

763
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,260
for the rest of your life.

764
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,710
Lady Hae, you are wrong.

765
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:02,550
My heart...

766
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,230
is already a field of ashes.

767
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,430
The ashes are clumping together...

768
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,440
and hardening as we speak.

769
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,450
That cannot be true.

770
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,680
Your feelings are not ones to settle...

771
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,630
as easily as that.

772
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,740
Lady Hae!

773
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,680
Do you know me? No.

774
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,620
But I know my own heart.

775
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,460
Because I wrote a secret
letter for you, General Go.

776
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,450
I see it must have been in vain.

777
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:43,370
I hear that your medical
skills saved my life.

778
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,004
I hear that your fortune-telling
abilities are impressive as well.

779
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,940
It is my honor, Your Majesty.

780
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,130
Despite winning the battle,

781
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,100
I cannot simply enjoy the victory.

782
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,300
There are too many
layers at play in this country.

783
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,640
That is why I have called you here.

784
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,410
Reading the fortunes of palace affairs...

785
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,480
is quite different from
telling an individual's fortune.

786
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,120
Therefore, I have been so bold
as to ask your servants to withdraw,

787
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:11,050
to allow for a private audience
with you and the Crown Prince.

788
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,100
I have heard.

789
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,010
What will you do now?

790
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,160
I will read the flow of your energies,

791
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,690
and examine their synergy
with the skies and the earth.

792
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:37,110
In order to read your energy,
your mind and body must be pure.

793
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,160
Please drink.

794
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,390
Crown Prince, you have
even fought on the battlefield.

795
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,080
Do you fear this now?

796
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,620
I do not, Father.

797
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,910
Do you still not like it?

798
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,450
Like what?

799
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,650
That we are now living
together in the palace.

800
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,240
What are you talking about?

801
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,900
How can someone who
used to live in a little shack...

802
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,470
complain about living in the palace?

803
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,010
The Chief also said he will have
a residence in Pyeongyang Castle.

804
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,610
Pung Gae will be here too.

805
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,300
I like it. I am excited.

806
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,560
But you are worried about Mother.

807
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,090
Do not worry too much.

808
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,700
I will make sure we can bring her here.

809
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,930
What is it? Our victory in battle,

810
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,670
and the revival of the Sunno Tribe,

811
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,160
all of it is great.

812
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,750
But my favorite part about
all of this is something else.

813
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,690
It was when the king called me his son...

814
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,930
and said that I was your husband.

815
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,930
I liked hearing that the most.

816
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:52,370
Do you know what happens
when you drink poison hemlock?

817
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,310
Your body turns to stone,

818
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,050
but your mind remains clear.

819
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,670
In other words,

820
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,830
I am telling you to watch...

821
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,510
as I carve up your son, alive,

822
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,050
piece by piece.

823
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,110
Princess.

824
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,990
Forget about dinner. You can just skip it.

825
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,680
Nanny. No, do not worry.

826
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,700
I will prepare supper for you separately.

827
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,510
I was planning to eat with Father and Won.

828
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,800
The two of them went to the shrine,
so I do not think that is possible.

829
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,090
The shrine? Yes.

830
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,940
He went there at sunset to
discuss the fortunes of the kingdom.

831
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,510
Apparently, there is a
very skilled fortune-teller.

832
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,040
Queen Yeon has been singing
the praises of Songhwadang.

833
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,250
Songhwadang?

834
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,710
I have heard that before.

835
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,080
"Song", "hwa", "dang".

836
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,000
Songhwadang. Where is Songhwadang?

837
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,220
Songhwadang. It is he.

838
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,530
Who? It is he.

839
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,660
The Chief of Cheonjubang.

840
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,600
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

841
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,540
My wife has no time for rest.

842
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,710
Enemies abound in your vicinity.

843
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,590
Lady Hae, from now on, you
are closer to me than any woman.

844
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,150
General On Dal, receive this command.

845
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,250
I will do my best, unto death.

846
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,720
Their influence is trivial.

847
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,350
But at their center is the Princess.

848
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,890
The letter from the Queen to Go Won Pyo...

849
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,700
is evidence of their illicit relationship.

850
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,490
It is all over now.
