THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,083
EPISODE 10

4
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:23,684
What is it?

5
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:26,068
Where are you going after sundown?

6
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:28,338
It is none of your business.
Step aside.

7
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:31,352
Are you leaving to strike
where the Princess is?

8
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,926
I will strike you first if
you do not step aside.

9
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:38,844
Go inside.

10
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:42,490
Your father is waiting to see you.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,466
I will pay for my sins in death.

12
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:56,840
However, you and
your family will also be...

13
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,264
in a pool of blood.

14
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:10,217
You asked to see me?

15
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,248
If you cut down On Hyeop's son...

16
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:13,934
and burn their village,

17
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,961
do you think the Princess
will become yours?

18
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,971
She will when she runs
out of people to lean on.

19
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,407
She lied about being married to run away.

20
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,638
This is not something you
can control by brute force.

21
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,844
I am only doing as you taught me.

22
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,250
You killed the late Queen...

23
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,164
and beheaded On Hyeop.

24
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:44,827
It is a powerful scheme
that does not backfire.

25
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,827
I commend your courage,
but you have a long way to go.

26
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,633
Power is powerless
when that is all it has.

27
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,967
Justification is what you need
before you wield your sword.

28
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:58,013
Without that,

29
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:03,108
how different is a general at war
from a butcher in a slaughterhouse?

30
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:04,234
Justification?

31
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,777
I shall make something up.

32
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,147
It will come upon us without
us having to do anything.

33
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:15,218
Do you think the Princess can
live as a herb gatherer's wife?

34
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,904
Until we have our cause,

35
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,560
wait.
How much more time must I waste?

36
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,674
You are so slow.

37
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,530
To catch the chief, you
must first fell his horse.

38
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,624
Did you sleep well?

39
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,293
Yes.
Did you?

40
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:07,424
I did.

41
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:16,034
We should clean up.

42
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:21,983
General Go will be banished to the border?

43
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,656
Yes.
He helped the Princess many times,

44
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,687
Gochuga seems to be angry with him.

45
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,587
He is Gyeru Tribe's next chief,

46
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:33,326
but he is very different from his father.

47
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:36,803
I am aware of his
loyalty to the royal family.

48
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,329
The first person to notify
me the Princess was alive...

49
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,073
was General Go.

50
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,143
He is too great a
talent to lose like this.

51
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,703
Gochuga is so ruthless.

52
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:02,437
He is sending his heir
to such a faraway place.

53
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,444
I got on his bad side.

54
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:08,927
But this exile is to a truly far place.

55
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,600
I am to inhale sand way up in the north.

56
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,373
Are you upset that I am going far away?

57
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,253
It is not great news.

58
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:21,924
Then shall I stay?

59
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:22,863
Pardon?

60
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:30,357
On a day like this, I wish I
could sit in a boat on a river...

61
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,993
and drink for hours.

62
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,653
General Go Geon is to come
and see the King immediately.

63
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:53,281
Please do not be angry, Mother.

64
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:56,414
I know I am lacking,
but I will do my best.

65
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,704
Mother.
Ga Jin's father,

66
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,317
my father-in-law gave his blessing.

67
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,257
I do not believe what I am hearing.

68
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,996
You have no father-in-law.

69
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:13,113
Mother.

70
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:17,768
I will light the fire.

71
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,214
I am good at that.

72
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,463
Get out of the way.

73
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:42,774
Do not do this, Princess.

74
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:46,231
You are the noblest
of nobles on this earth.

75
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:49,063
You cannot do such rough work.

76
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:52,106
I am your daughter-in-law.

77
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,306
Do not tease an old woman.

78
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:00,213
Rest for as long as you are here.

79
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,024
My father commanded that...

80
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,787
I stay on a faraway border...

81
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:16,344
and do not show myself.

82
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:20,264
That is a punishment, not a command.

83
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,328
Is it because you helped the Princess?

84
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,454
I was never...

85
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,514
a satisfactory elder son.

86
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,645
My bodyguards have not
been as orderly as before,

87
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,564
and security inside and
outside the palace has been lax.

88
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,033
I am considering...

89
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:43,654
appointing you the new Head of Bodyguards.

90
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,591
I do not deserve that title.

91
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:52,184
But...

92
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:56,194
I have already packed
to leave for the border.

93
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,567
Packed luggage can always be unpacked,

94
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:02,524
and commands taken back.

95
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:04,703
Before that,

96
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,753
to keep you close,

97
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,144
I must be able to trust you completely.

98
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,534
To make me trust you,

99
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,583
gain the Crown Prince's trust first.

100
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:22,769
With that, I will gauge your
loyalty to the royal household.

101
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,353
Yes, sire.

102
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:43,664
He does not feel well,

103
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:45,683
and bids you come another day.

104
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,778
Did you tell him I am his
new martial arts teacher?

105
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:49,634
Yes.

106
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:52,694
The truth is,

107
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,557
since the day the
Princess left the palace,

108
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,387
he has not left his chambers.

109
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:00,658
TO NOT HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHERS.

110
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:03,564
He said he cannot be
bothered to do anything.

111
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,737
Pyeonggang, where on earth are you?

112
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:12,014
You are well, right?

113
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,757
I told you to get close to the King...

114
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,293
and you became the Crown Prince's trainer?

115
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,901
I am doing as you taught me.

116
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,477
To catch a chief, you
fell his horse, you said.

117
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,054
Yes.

118
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:43,838
The Crown Prince is the King's horse.

119
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:47,428
I will get the Crown Prince's
trust, and then the King's.

120
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,048
I will get everyone at
the palace on my side.

121
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:54,254
The subjects are as doubtful
as they are powerless.

122
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,787
Do you have a secret plan?

123
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:01,173
It would no longer be a
secret if I were to speak of it.

124
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,673
Leave the royals to me...

125
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,027
and keep the council in line.

126
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,804
They have more greed than they deserve.

127
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:13,236
No one knows what they will do in secret.

128
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:19,068
Some good came from the
Princess leaving the palace.

129
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:22,518
You have changed
enough to care for our family.

130
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,704
Love it or hate it,

131
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:27,417
I am the next Gyeru chief.

132
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:31,757
I must do my duty as the son.

133
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,393
Are you still up?

134
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,098
Why are you taking more bedding?

135
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,371
There is enough in the other room.

136
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,867
There is only one set.

137
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:50,553
You said you are married.

138
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,974
Will you sleep apart from her?

139
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,158
Ga Jin feels uncomfortable.
It is for her sake.

140
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,203
How am I to teach her?

141
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,333
Will there be any books?

142
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,914
She almost caught me.

143
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:19,714
Doing what?

144
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:21,794
Nothing.

145
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:27,178
I thought she would kick me out.
I am glad she did not.

146
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,544
That is not good.

147
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,907
She treats you like you are invisible.

148
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,593
She is putting you first.

149
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,894
She may be your nanny,

150
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,225
but she cared for you
more than any mother would.

151
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,034
That is how a mom thinks.

152
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,027
These are books on military
strategy that I brought from the palace.

153
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,473
Military strategy?

154
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,767
"Simseo", "Yukdo", "Samryak",

155
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,137
"The Art of War", "The Five Arts".

156
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:55,993
Hang on.

157
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:57,824
Wait.

158
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,377
I do not have to read all these, do I?

159
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:04,183
Reading once is not enough.

160
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,448
10 times, 20 times.

161
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:08,377
You must be able to quote
from it with your eyes closed.

162
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,848
I will study with you.

163
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:12,818
That is not fair.
You said you would teach me to fight.

164
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,987
What is the point in just
brandishing a sword?

165
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:17,260
You must be able to use your head.

166
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,366
Shall I have a look, then?

167
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:30,924
My gosh.

168
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:35,073
I think reading this will
make me even more stupid.

169
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:37,884
You are complaining even before you begin.

170
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:45,256
I am tired.
Can we just go to sleep?

171
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,373
Yes?
Please?

172
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:50,843
My gosh.

173
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,184
Oh, well.

174
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,037
Do you feel uncomfortable?

175
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,037
I can sleep in the bigger room.

176
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,938
Do you want to sleep separately
just after we got married?

177
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,624
Men can get divorced too.

178
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:07,723
Can they?

179
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,184
Even if it is a lie,

180
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,650
lying next to you feels
like we are married.

181
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:17,243
It feels strange.

182
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:20,404
I agree.

183
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:25,844
Ga Jin.
Yes?

184
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:31,064
Let us not tell Mother
that I am learning to fight.

185
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:37,773
She will fall ill the moment she hears.

186
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,093
Okay.

187
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:46,286
And you too.
Do not get in between Mother and me.

188
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:48,818
There is not much you can do to help.

189
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:52,344
Hey. Who else will look after
the wife than the husband?

190
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,443
That is so reassuring.

191
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:58,744
Still, leave it to me.

192
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,964
I am leaving to chop firewood.

193
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:39,004
I need to bring 3 or 4
stacks within the day.

194
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:43,504
Oh, and Ga Jin left already.
She went to get water.

195
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:46,664
Come here.

196
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:52,223
What is she up to?

197
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,678
What do you mean?
Why would a Princess...

198
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:58,017
come back to live in the mountains?

199
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:01,266
I do not believe she would
marry a herb gatherer.

200
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,054
Come closer.

201
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,073
You can tell your mom.

202
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:10,271
She is up to something else, is she not?

203
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:12,854
I seduced her.

204
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:16,923
It is true.

205
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:22,149
Instead of being cooped up,
she should be with me and fly...

206
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,876
and be free.
That is what I said.

207
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,586
You can deceive a ghost but not me.

208
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,664
You made it.

209
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:44,928
Well?
It is nice and spacious, right?

210
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:45,784
Yes.
Wow.

211
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,637
What about Mother?

212
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,576
I made up some kind of story.

213
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:53,346
What do I do first?
Tell me quickly.

214
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:57,763
Here.

215
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,924
That is not how you hold a sword.

216
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:10,417
Did you not learn as a kid?
It is the basic of basics.

217
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,751
I asked my father to teach
me, but he never listened.

218
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,754
General On?
Why not?

219
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:17,883
I do not know.

220
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,803
Here.
Support the weight with your left hand.

221
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,622
With your right hand,
you control its movements.

222
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:29,733
Like this?

223
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:33,794
Hold the sword higher.

224
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,124
Shoulders straight,
knees bent, back straight.

225
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,333
Why is it so complicated?

226
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,560
Learning the basics is the hardest part.

227
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:44,024
Lift your chin.

228
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,261
Keep your sight at the tip of the sword.

229
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:51,370
And pretend your enemy is over there.

230
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:54,023
Okay?

231
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:56,824
Come on.

232
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:02,593
Good.

233
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,784
Stay like this until I come back.

234
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:07,933
What?
Where are you going?

235
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,854
Hey.
This is a penalty, not training.

236
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,294
Stay like that!

237
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:15,343
Ga Jin!

238
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,813
What did you just say?

239
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,614
Revive the Sunno Tribe?

240
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:32,443
The King also wants
the Sunno Tribe to return.

241
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,043
Go Won Pyo brought up my marriage...

242
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,546
so he could not show his intent.

243
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,950
You cannot live in Ghost Valley forever.

244
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,117
You must gather your men, gain strength,

245
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,483
and regain power.

246
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:49,704
You must...

247
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:53,572
recover your position
on the Five Tribe council.

248
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,274
Is this why you returned?

249
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,271
To help revive the Sunno Tribe?

250
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,704
It is not just for your tribe.

251
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:08,189
While I was in the palace, I
realized how things really are.

252
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,651
Go Won Pyo and his allies...

253
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,377
damage the King's authority
and control everything political.

254
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:17,516
If we do not stop those few men,

255
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,993
Goguryeo will crumble from the inside out.

256
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:25,097
Please offer the King your support.

257
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,483
I may be the chief,

258
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:33,372
but this is not a decision
for me to make alone.

259
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,574
I will speak to the villagers.

260
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,057
To gather and train people,
we will need that much money.

261
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,994
It might not be enough,

262
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,599
but I will obtain some
silver that will get us started.

263
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:49,987
You are selling all these?

264
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,447
There is a woman who needs money urgently.

265
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,186
She needs silver and soon.

266
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:57,923
I think I saw these somewhere.

267
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,861
Who is it?
Do I know this woman?

268
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,944
This is the jewellery I
kept in Magnolia Hall.

269
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,807
I will leave it with you.
Find me a buyer.

270
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,077
What do you need this much silver for?

271
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:22,113
You do not need to know.
But the sooner the better.

272
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:25,343
Do forgive me.

273
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:29,093
I was requested to
keep her identity a secret.

274
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:32,804
Forget about that.

275
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,014
The medicine you gave me.

276
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,601
You said it would get me pregnant.

277
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,514
I do not think it works.

278
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:42,738
Even if you take medicines,

279
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:45,637
the balance of yin and
yang is hard to control.

280
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:47,323
Since we are talking...

281
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,284
The fortune-teller you mentioned.

282
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:55,201
If he is as good as rumours say,
he will do services as well, right?

283
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:12,564
Why are you at the
Crown Prince's chambers?

284
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:15,604
I heard you were appointed as his trainer.

285
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,707
There truly is nothing you do not know.

286
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,578
I also know the Crown Prince...

287
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:24,184
never leaves his room, let alone train.

288
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,784
Did you make another wasted trip?

289
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:33,147
If I had known he would
be so much trouble,

290
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:35,286
I would have left to the border.

291
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:39,343
When the Princess left,

292
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,790
she showed grave concern
for the Crown Prince's safety.

293
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:47,603
For her sake, I hope you
do not give up too easily.

294
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,313
I cannot tell what you are thinking.

295
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:01,319
Because of the Princess,
you had to face flogging.

296
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,950
Yet, you are worried about her.

297
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,833
I have a lot of pity...

298
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:12,280
for you who cannot move on
from a woman who has left...

299
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:16,020
and for the Princess who has
been disowned by the King.

300
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,431
My heart feels much compassion.

301
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:27,723
Hey.

302
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,164
Gosh.

303
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,318
Have you not moved since I left you?

304
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,818
You told me to stay like this.

305
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,387
You said mastering the
basics is the most important.

306
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:40,993
Gosh. That is enough.
You can stop that.

307
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:50,214
Goodness.

308
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,194
Are you laughing?

309
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,067
How can you laugh when you made me do it?

310
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,173
Do not move.

311
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:03,993
That feels nice.

312
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,117
Well, my wife can wash away
the fatigue just with her hands.

313
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:10,723
You little...
Do not get cheeky with me.

314
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:17,374
Ga Jin.

315
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,498
I know that this is just a wooden sword,

316
00:21:21,504 --> 00:21:24,768
but it feels awful to train
behind my mother's back.

317
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,813
We have no choice.

318
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:36,873
I know that.

319
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,898
I even made you promise to
never wield your sword before.

320
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,591
Now, I am learning it from you.

321
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,724
If you do not want to, you can stop.

322
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:54,133
I do not want you to be in agony.

323
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:58,643
I was just saying.

324
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:02,184
What is the next pose?

325
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,445
My gosh. It is cold outside.
Where have you been?

326
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:14,717
Oh, my. You are a princess.
Why are you carrying a jug of water?

327
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:17,048
Give me that.
It is okay. I can do it.

328
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,887
My gosh. That is absurd.
Put it down now.

329
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,488
Give me that.
No, it is okay.

330
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:21,614
Gosh.
Goodness.

331
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:23,973
Gosh.

332
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:25,313
Darn it.

333
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,413
What? "Darn it"?

334
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:30,954
Oh, no.

335
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,268
I am sorry.
I should have been careful.

336
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:34,954
Gosh, do not say that.

337
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:37,038
This kind of menial job is
for people of low birth like me.

338
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:40,116
I cannot let a princess
like you do such a thing.

339
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:43,008
If I do, I will be
gravely punished for it.

340
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:43,864
Mother.

341
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:47,346
I am here to live as Dal's wife.

342
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:50,723
I am not here to fool
around as a princess.

343
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:53,931
Please treat me how you
would treat your family.

344
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,657
Are you sure you will not regret...

345
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:02,343
what you just told me?

346
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:04,854
Pardon?

347
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,901
Will you not criticize me...

348
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,006
even if I give you a lot of hard jobs?

349
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:14,013
Please just tell me
what you want me to do.

350
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,183
In that case,

351
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,286
you need to get the water again.

352
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,787
And chop the firewood too.

353
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:30,973
Okay.

354
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,078
Where is Ga Jin?

355
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:54,677
I told her to tend the
vegetable garden in the valley.

356
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,883
The vegetable garden is a mess...

357
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,088
because you decided to
go traipsing around the city.

358
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,788
She cannot tend the garden all by herself.

359
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,154
Stay out of this.

360
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,927
She said she would be my daughter-in-law.

361
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:07,783
Mother.

362
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,098
She said I did not have
to treat her like a princess.

363
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:11,784
She will get her wish.

364
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:18,534
Gosh.
Oh, my.

365
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:20,364
Goodness.

366
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:21,664
Gosh.

367
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:25,254
You are so strong.

368
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:27,003
She really is.

369
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:31,483
Do not work yourself too hard.

370
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:34,103
You are eating so well.

371
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:38,727
Ga Jin has made up her mind now.

372
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:41,694
What do you mean?

373
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:44,014
She visited the chief.

374
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:47,528
And the chief told you to get
a book on battle formations.

375
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:48,798
I do not know what is going on,

376
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:52,068
but I am definitely certain
she has a big plan in mind.

377
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,474
So that must be why she came here...

378
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:57,437
pretending to have married a guy like Dal.

379
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,008
Nothing is wrong with Dal.

380
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,214
He is the son of a great general.

381
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,877
He does not have to feel small
because of a disowned princess.

382
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:07,403
I mean, look at his face
and his skills at martial arts.

383
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:09,931
Ga Jin is way too good for him.

384
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,657
Without Dal, you and your brother...

385
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,498
would not have been able to live here.

386
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,104
Did we ask for that?

387
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,300
My gosh.
You ungrateful girl.

388
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,766
"Girl"?
Do you have a death wish?

389
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:23,963
What are you doing?

390
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:27,907
Is that a lovers' quarrel?

391
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,108
It is sunny today.
Fight in the sun at least.

392
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,114
Do you also have a death wish?

393
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,303
I found it.

394
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:47,244
Hey, Ga Jin.
Your hand...

395
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:51,897
I am all right.
Just read your book.

396
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,800
No, that does not look okay.

397
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,738
We should put some herbs on it.

398
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:56,624
Let me see.

399
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:58,244
Read your book.

400
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:00,263
Your hand.

401
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:11,554
What is my daughter-in-law doing?

402
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,274
Come over here already.

403
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,814
What are you doing?

404
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:22,624
Yes, I am coming.

405
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:27,667
You must read the entire
first chapter of "Yukdo".

406
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,353
I will quiz you later.

407
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:47,554
It does not sound like you are sewing now.

408
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,923
I cannot get the thread
through the needle.

409
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:53,058
Do you not know how to sew?

410
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:56,264
Well, I have watched people
sew a few times before.

411
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:57,943
Give me that.

412
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:24,146
You told me yourself that you are
neither a princess nor an assassin.

413
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:27,427
From now on, learn how
to maintain a home properly.

414
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,058
If you want to support Dal,

415
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,127
you must work twice or thrice harder...

416
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,813
than a blind woman did.

417
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,003
You raised him until now...

418
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,273
when you cannot see.

419
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:42,177
I cannot even imagine how
it must have been for you.

420
00:27:42,183 --> 00:27:43,983
Just sew.
Stop chitchatting.

421
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:47,434
Okay.

422
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:57,957
Do not worry about the Princess.

423
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,813
She is as brave as a man.

424
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:06,467
She is not the only one I worry about.

425
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:09,738
I worry about the Crown Prince
who refuses to leave his chambers.

426
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,688
I strictly told him to
start training tomorrow.

427
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:16,738
But raising children is more difficult...

428
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,544
than ruling over an empire.

429
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:20,947
I am sorry that I do not know...

430
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:23,863
the trouble of a parent.

431
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:40,037
I have used all kinds of effective herbs.

432
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,233
But she never became pregnant.

433
00:28:42,774 --> 00:28:45,707
From what I have heard,
you can also perform a ritual.

434
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:48,538
A mighty owner of an herb
store was not able to do it.

435
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,277
Are you asking a fortune-teller to do it?

436
00:28:58,354 --> 00:28:59,588
She said she is willing
to pay whatever it takes...

437
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:02,058
as long as she is blessed with a child.

438
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:03,264
Bring her here.

439
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:05,456
I will feel her chi first.

440
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,828
And I will see if a ritual will work.

441
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,734
She is not someone who
can freely come and go.

442
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,223
Here.

443
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:16,667
I brought her date of birth,
so use this to read her fortune.

444
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,673
Unless I see her face to face,

445
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:20,623
a ritual cannot be done.

446
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,656
He does not seem ordinary.

447
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:36,623
He refused to take this much silver.

448
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:44,227
Not a lot of fortune-tellers would
burn anesthetic incense sticks.

449
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,166
He is very good at deception.

450
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:50,210
Do you think he can be trusted?

451
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:12,190
She has nice facial features.

452
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:14,790
And her nose shows a good
sign of wealth in her fortune.

453
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:15,646
However,

454
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:19,626
I can see her true face behind her wealth.

455
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:22,626
Look into her.

456
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,940
I must know how many faces she is hiding.

457
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:33,797
Darn it.
My water jug.

458
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:46,047
You fool.

459
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:01,987
My water jug!

460
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,490
Mother, I will go and get some water.

461
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:20,229
Okay.
Well, fill all the empty water jugs.

462
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,561
Once you are done with those,

463
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:26,791
weed out the vegetable
garden over there on the hill.

464
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:29,664
After that, wash the
laundry and hang it up.

465
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:32,171
Oh, right.
Before the sun comes down,

466
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:34,500
get some bush stems,
so you can make a broom.

467
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:38,171
Water, vegetable garden, laundry,
and bush stems. I got it.

468
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:41,633
And today, I am wearing the
clothes you made me before.

469
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:43,780
So my clothes will not
get in the way of my work.

470
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:44,986
I will be back.

471
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:48,637
What about your hands?

472
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,302
My gosh. How much more do
you want to torture her?

473
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:05,403
Are you sure she is a princess?

474
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,407
She is not a princess.
What?

475
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:09,976
She is my wife.

476
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:19,210
I am sleepy. What are you doing?
This is a hassle.

477
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,149
The order came from the King.

478
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:24,890
You can rest all you
want after the training.

479
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,696
Once this is over, I will bring in sweets.

480
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:32,816
You may go.

481
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:43,757
Grab the wooden sword.

482
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,770
Do you not wish to train?

483
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:48,643
I will not.
This is a hassle.

484
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,507
Then, let us have a bet.

485
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,589
If you can touch so much as my collar,

486
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:02,336
you do not have to train.

487
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,460
Are you serious?
Of course.

488
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:07,136
I will report to the King myself.

489
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:10,396
However, if you fail,
you must train with me.

490
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:29,881
I will not do it.

491
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:32,520
Then, as you promise,
you must train with me.

492
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,691
A king does not need
to know swordsmanship.

493
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,377
I can order my generals.

494
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,031
No generals or soldiers will not follow...

495
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:42,493
a king who will not fight
with them on the front lines.

496
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:47,144
A long time ago, your sister...

497
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,706
had the same bet.

498
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:53,777
She was young.
And she is a woman.

499
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:58,120
So I told her that I could not teach her.

500
00:33:58,857 --> 00:34:00,781
But she insisted that
she learned how to fight.

501
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,854
The Princess had a bet with me,

502
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:05,576
so she could train.

503
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,856
So what happened?

504
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:10,647
I...

505
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,137
became her master.

506
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:25,886
Well, we did have a bet.

507
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:33,587
Practice the basic strikes.

508
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:39,477
Lower your sword.
Again.

509
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,834
That is too far.
Do it again.

510
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,630
It is too short this time.
Again!

511
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:51,436
Why is this so complicated?

512
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,973
Strike it at the same angle.
Do it again.

513
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:05,587
Go over it again, so you do not forget it.

514
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,370
Mother, I need to go back
one more time to fill the jug.

515
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:27,768
I will go to the vegetable
garden in the valley today.

516
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:41,637
Hey.
Focus.

517
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:44,916
Yes, master.

518
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:57,506
Stand up again.

519
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:01,565
How will you protect our
empire if you are this weak?

520
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:35,443
Where is my daughter-in-law?

521
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:37,406
I am coming.

522
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,704
Gochuga is a tiger without his claws.

523
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:11,000
He failed to stop the royal
marriage from getting annulled.

524
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:14,270
And he just watched the
Princess leaving the palace.

525
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:18,865
How about Daedaero?
He used to try to be on our good side.

526
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,437
I heard that lately, he has
only been visiting the King.

527
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,820
I am sure Gochuga has a
plan he has not told us yet.

528
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:27,507
A plan?

529
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:32,331
Even his eldest son is on the King's side.

530
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:34,231
He is teaching the Crown
Prince martial arts now.

531
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,760
What plan could he have?

532
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:36,806
You are here.

533
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:45,534
Were you discussing things
I am not supposed to hear?

534
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,247
Of course, not.

535
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:50,787
We were discussing
envoys to Northern Zhou.

536
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:58,594
I have already thought about
which envoys and how many will go.

537
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:02,857
I am sure the Gyeru Tribe
will take the lead again.

538
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:06,469
And our people will be
no more than just fillers.

539
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,270
Well, let us do that then.

540
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:18,146
I heard General Go
Geon has been busy lately.

541
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:21,553
I hear the Crown Prince
has a lot of faith in him.

542
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:30,167
You brought me sweets.

543
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,907
I came here to thank you.

544
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,530
This is too much for just me.

545
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,660
Would you like to have some too?

546
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,086
Master.

547
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:42,857
Yes?

548
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,611
Master Go, do you have
feelings for Pyeonggang?

549
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,871
Why do you ask me that?

550
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:53,077
I just want for you to
be on her side, that is all.

551
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,719
Do not hate her too much,
even if she is married.

552
00:38:58,316 --> 00:39:00,116
No master hates his pupils.

553
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:02,217
On top of that,

554
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:04,959
the Princess was my first pupil.

555
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:09,224
I will always protect you both.

556
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:48,136
I need to find out what is going on.

557
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,577
You have brought useful information.

558
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,666
Good work.

559
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:05,111
I will call for you again when I
have decided on an area to spy on.

560
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:08,637
I saw some suspicious
people in front of the herb store.

561
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:10,336
And?

562
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,491
He was disguised as a merchant,
but he was a Cheonjubang killer.

563
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:14,857
From Cheonjubang?

564
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:16,567
Are you sure?

565
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,966
Yes, we corresponded directly.

566
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:23,430
After looking around
the herb store for a while,

567
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:24,286
he left.

568
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:25,966
Did you tail him?

569
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,537
He entered a fortune-teller's house.

570
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,026
It is called Songhwadang.

571
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:41,550
There is not much known about her.

572
00:40:41,556 --> 00:40:44,884
She appears to be an
orphan, with no known relatives.

573
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:47,450
Even with a status like that,

574
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:50,592
she became the adopted
daughter of the Sono tribe?

575
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,847
What a formidable woman.

576
00:40:56,236 --> 00:41:00,131
There is a rumour that she has been
gathering precious and rare herbs.

577
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:03,940
There was also talk that she
also secretly sold a palace maid...

578
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,813
off to Silla, causing havoc.

579
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:08,326
Silla?

580
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:11,710
But the person who
revealed that incident...

581
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,076
was the Princess.

582
00:41:27,436 --> 00:41:28,476
I am so busy.

583
00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:30,330
Why did you ask us to gather?

584
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:32,771
The Chief said he had
something to tell us.

585
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:33,930
Do you know what it is?

586
00:41:33,936 --> 00:41:35,136
I have no clue.

587
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,137
Hey, mister.

588
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:39,767
Hey.

589
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:44,966
You should spend some time
taking care of your daughter.

590
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:46,651
What is wrong with Ga Jin?

591
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:49,251
She is doing so much labour
as a newly married woman.

592
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,651
Chopping firewood...

593
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:52,991
and washing all the blankets in icy water.

594
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:55,021
Is that not right?
That is right.

595
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:59,059
She is running all over the
village all by herself doing chores.

596
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:03,498
My goodness. She must seem like
a real fox to her mother-in-law.

597
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:05,430
She had to let go of her one and only son.

598
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:07,401
I am sure she does not
look favourably on her.

599
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:08,367
My goodness.

600
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,627
Oh, my.

601
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:26,450
I have something to tell you
all, so have asked you to gather.

602
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,389
Let us discuss our village...

603
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,934
and the future of the Sunno tribe.

604
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,476
You must be a monk.

605
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:05,330
Are you lost? There is no
village or temple around here.

606
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:06,296
Who are you?

607
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:09,700
Dancing an outrageous
dance in the middle of nowhere?

608
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:11,066
Can you not tell?

609
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,936
I am practicing my swordsmanship.

610
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:17,027
Swordsmanship?

611
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:20,639
I thought you were having
an affair with those sticks.

612
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:24,491
Sir, those are some
harsh words for a stranger.

613
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:37,491
This would be perfect
to use as a walking stick.

614
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:40,569
Hey, you. Give that back
before I lose my temper.

615
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:44,367
All right, you fool.

616
00:44:05,497 --> 00:44:07,651
How long will you hang
ropes as a talisman,

617
00:44:07,657 --> 00:44:09,337
wave your goblin lights,

618
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:12,334
and live in hiding here in Ghost Valley?

619
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,027
Abandon the past,

620
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:17,401
so full of unjust and wretched days.

621
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,874
Let us prepare to re-enter the world.

622
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:22,910
We have a plan as well as funds.

623
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:25,640
We just need your backing.

624
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:29,017
I do not know about the Sunno tribe,

625
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:32,050
but I feel hesitant about it.

626
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:33,856
Do you call yourself a man?

627
00:44:34,356 --> 00:44:36,556
Who cares if we are Sunno or not?

628
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,621
She is just saying we have a
shot at living like human beings.

629
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:43,060
It is true that we have never
gotten any respect as a person.

630
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:46,930
We have just lived as worms,
shovelling dirt and being stepped on.

631
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,803
What will you do afterwards?

632
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,769
The people of Ghost Valley are few.

633
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,800
It is not enough to form troops...

634
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:55,246
and forge weapons.

635
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:57,326
You are right.

636
00:44:57,907 --> 00:44:59,640
We need a lot more people.

637
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:02,080
Homeless nomads roaming the towns,

638
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:04,741
people trampled underfoot by the nobles.

639
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:06,210
Once the preparations are complete,

640
00:45:06,216 --> 00:45:07,781
I am going to win them
over to our side, one by one,

641
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:09,854
starting with the nearest town.

642
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:12,236
I will do it personally.

643
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:17,926
I am in favour.

644
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:21,275
It is a promise made
by the Princess, after all.

645
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:24,286
Me too.

646
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:25,947
Fine, me too.

647
00:45:26,436 --> 00:45:28,116
Fine, I am in favour too.

648
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:30,667
Me too.
Me too.

649
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:34,957
We will give it a shot.

650
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:36,237
Let us try it.

651
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:40,310
It will be a new opportunity.
Let us go for it.

652
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:41,996
We have to do it now.

653
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,920
We have to try.
We can have a new life.

654
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:56,886
I was going to tell you.

655
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,367
But for you, training was the priority.

656
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:04,457
I am not angry with you.

657
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:12,193
It was something you were planning
when you were in the palace, right?

658
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,766
Me becoming a general...

659
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:18,020
is also in that plan, is it not?

660
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:23,264
Dal, this is for you and me,

661
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:27,366
and for the benefit of
the whole Sunno tribe.

662
00:46:28,236 --> 00:46:29,436
I am all right.

663
00:46:30,907 --> 00:46:33,440
I need to carry on my father's wishes.

664
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:35,326
And...

665
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,227
That is what you want.

666
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:51,324
But those people are different.

667
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:55,060
Those people have escaped to this place...

668
00:46:55,066 --> 00:46:58,778
because they have grown tired
and exhausted from the world.

669
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:03,937
They have barely survived until now.

670
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:06,116
How can we endanger that?

671
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,514
We need to change the world,

672
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:15,551
so that the people can live
life to the fullest, without fear.

673
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:23,151
That is the country we must
build, the new Goguryeo.

674
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:34,990
Although our lives seem peaceful,
apart from the world like this,

675
00:47:34,996 --> 00:47:37,260
even Ghost Valley will
turn into a bloodbath,

676
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:39,599
with a single word from Go Won Pyo.

677
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:45,977
When you first came to Ghost Valley,

678
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:51,352
you loved it because you
said it was like a dream.

679
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:01,777
I, the humble Go Geon,

680
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:06,403
will be so bold as to accept
the role of Head of Bodyguards.

681
00:48:10,907 --> 00:48:13,507
With the unchanging power of the sword,

682
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:18,469
protect the King and his
castle with loyalty and zeal.

683
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,767
I accept your command.

684
00:48:27,617 --> 00:48:28,737
Salute!
Salute!

685
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,266
"He lost his son to the King."

686
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:45,671
That is what the people
outside the castle are saying.

687
00:48:45,677 --> 00:48:47,930
They say the failed marriage
soured his relationship with his father,

688
00:48:47,936 --> 00:48:50,836
and that he has turned
his back on the family.

689
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:54,270
A parent cannot block the
path his child has chosen.

690
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:56,409
I fear for your safety, Gochuga.

691
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:01,056
If you let this happen, how
will you deal with the aftermath?

692
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:07,290
Why, are you planning to
turn your back on me too?

693
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:10,560
It appears your father
has a different goal in mind.

694
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:14,447
The Princess gave us a gift
by getting out of the way...

695
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:18,774
and forged a path for
me towards the throne.

696
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:24,561
Once the assassin squad has been
completed, a bloodbath will ensue.

697
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:29,357
I have only one desire.

698
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:32,480
For our son, Geon Mu,
to ascend to the throne,

699
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,486
with the aid of your strength.

700
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:38,136
"Our son".

701
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:49,727
Is that prince...

702
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:52,757
really my son?

703
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:56,927
What?

704
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,327
How can you say that?

705
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:04,413
You are the type of
woman who would argue...

706
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,671
that the sky is the earth to
seat your son on the throne.

707
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:18,477
I love...

708
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:21,447
your greed.

709
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:23,886
Geon Mu...

710
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:27,466
is your son.

711
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,027
The metal is all rotten.

712
00:50:36,446 --> 00:50:38,846
I could melt it down and reforge it,

713
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,450
but then I would need a bigger forge.

714
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:42,950
Still, please get started.

715
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,121
I will get you the materials you need.

716
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:45,977
All right.

717
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,076
Hey.

718
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:50,527
Ga Jin, is this really all right?

719
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:54,930
I told you I would get some silver.
Do you not trust me, Father?

720
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:57,336
Not that.
I meant your mother-in-law.

721
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:00,730
I heard she is making you suffer,
giving you a ton of chores.

722
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,403
That is not true.
She is very good to me.

723
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:07,943
Dal will be waiting.
I will be going now.

724
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:10,577
I will leave it to you.
All right.

725
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:13,886
The Princess is so in love with On Dal.

726
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:14,767
Ga Jin.

727
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,106
Good luck.

728
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:19,606
Let us go.

729
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:28,169
I am just as worried as you are.

730
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:32,606
Ga Jin is not used to
being in a relationship.

731
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:36,507
Do you think they spent
their first night together?

732
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:41,202
You know what I mean.
The steamy, inexplicable... Gosh!

733
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,540
I told you to keep their secret.

734
00:51:44,546 --> 00:51:46,226
That was a good kick.

735
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:50,436
Seeing that it is her,

736
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:56,313
I feel like she could really
change the world with Dal.

737
00:51:58,597 --> 00:52:01,197
I want to try my best to help them too.

738
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:06,916
SONGHWADANG

739
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:25,490
Since you told me to come alone,

740
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:28,693
you must be ready to perform the ritual.

741
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:32,930
I called you here to discuss matters
your adoptive father cannot hear.

742
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:33,786
What?

743
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:37,873
Or perhaps he already knows?

744
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:45,813
The fact that you are a Silla spy.

745
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:52,387
What nonsense do you speak of?

746
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:57,465
I was not quite sure, but
your expression has said it all.

747
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:02,975
The adopted daughter of
the Sono tribe is a spy after all.

748
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,430
What an entertaining turn.

749
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:08,103
I have heard enough foolishness for now.

750
00:53:08,597 --> 00:53:10,277
If you leave like this,

751
00:53:11,706 --> 00:53:14,439
I will not be able to keep my mouth shut.

752
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:17,974
I too am quite tempted to speak plainly.

753
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:22,539
The Cheonjubang leader,
disguised as a fortune-teller.

754
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:24,757
And his assassins.

755
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,417
What are you trying to do now,

756
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,651
after aiming for the throne
by using the Princess?

757
00:53:32,657 --> 00:53:34,790
Are you planning more treachery?

758
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:45,500
I knew you were a formidable woman.

759
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:50,440
Rather than throw the tribes
into chaos and mutual destruction,

760
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:53,346
we should try to help
one another, discreetly.

761
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:57,077
I will refrain from any
further foolish games.

762
00:54:02,956 --> 00:54:04,396
What should we do?

763
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:06,257
It is quite a waste,

764
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:09,307
but I have no choice.

765
00:55:11,557 --> 00:55:13,077
You despicable spy.

766
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:18,057
I will kill you right here so that
you can never go back to Silla.

767
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:33,747
My lady, stay with me.

768
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:35,657
My lady.

769
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:40,557
What are you doing here?

770
00:56:43,746 --> 00:56:44,866
By any chance,

771
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,186
did you hear...

772
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:52,497
what the man said?

773
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:56,107
What did he say?

774
00:56:57,327 --> 00:57:00,847
Let me take you to the herb store.
You may be in danger.

775
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:03,616
My lady.

776
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:24,750
I will not go easy on you.

777
00:57:24,756 --> 00:57:26,956
I need to check on your progress.

778
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:33,729
Do not cry after you lose.

779
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:37,047
Here we go.

780
00:57:39,976 --> 00:57:42,176
Where did I put my sewing basket?

781
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:45,856
Let me see.

782
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,167
Oh, there it is.

783
00:57:59,397 --> 00:58:01,130
What is a book doing here?

784
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:03,177
That is strange.

785
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:06,477
Hello?

786
00:58:08,436 --> 00:58:09,286
Who is it?

787
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:12,157
Hello?

788
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:14,786
Oh, my.

789
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:24,226
I am Ga Jin's dad.

790
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:29,183
I do recognize your unpleasant voice.

791
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:36,063
I was looking for wood
to turn into a hoe...

792
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,534
but ended up making a stick.

793
00:58:40,696 --> 00:58:43,030
I am thinking of giving it to my in-law.

794
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:44,903
Your in-law?
Who do you mean?

795
00:58:47,236 --> 00:58:51,140
Why not just accept it, seeing
how things turned out this way?

796
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:53,940
That would make the kids feel better.

797
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:56,679
Also, please stop being mean to Ga Jin...

798
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:59,119
That is enough.
You are out of line.

799
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:02,361
I am actually glad you are here.
Here, take it.

800
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,320
Tell me what book that is.

801
00:59:05,827 --> 00:59:06,947
I cannot read.

802
00:59:10,097 --> 00:59:10,977
Let me see.

803
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:14,777
Wait, there are pictures.

804
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:17,861
Is it a picture book?

805
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:21,067
Yes, there are pictures
of soldiers holding swords.

806
00:59:22,177 --> 00:59:24,710
Is this a book about military tactics?

807
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:29,814
In addition to learning martial arts,

808
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,651
is he studying military tactics too?

809
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:34,507
Who?

810
00:59:35,887 --> 00:59:38,754
Are you talking about Dal?
Did you not know?

811
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,487
That little brat.

812
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:47,359
Where are you going? That way,
you will end up in the mountains.

813
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,247
Be careful.
My goodness.

814
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:51,006
Do not worry.

815
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:53,440
I know every rock on this mountain.

816
00:59:56,046 --> 00:59:58,046
Oh, my.
She is walking so fast.

817
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:15,346
Lady Sa.

818
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,167
He just fell asleep.

819
01:00:26,107 --> 01:00:27,787
He stopped Silla spies...

820
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:30,980
from sneaking in through
the mountain fortress.

821
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,779
He says he fought bravely.

822
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,516
He threw stones and
swung his wooden sword.

823
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:41,257
In today's battle,

824
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:45,060
sixteen of our soldiers died.

825
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:56,252
We won the battle, but the
battlefield reeked of blood.

826
01:00:57,536 --> 01:00:59,216
Lady Sa.
Yes, General.

827
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:04,401
Do you know why I am not
teaching Dal swordsmanship?

828
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:08,527
Once he wields the sword,

829
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:15,364
he is bound to see blood.
That is the fate of a swordsman.

830
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,227
I do not want Dal...

831
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:24,196
to follow in my bloody footsteps.

832
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:54,797
Great job, Dal.

833
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:05,917
Mother.

834
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:08,656
What are you doing now?

835
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,131
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

836
01:02:38,137 --> 01:02:41,593
All this happened because
you married that wicked girl.

837
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:44,851
You turned me into an
ignorant country bumpkin.

838
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:47,671
I have been working
together with the people...

839
01:02:47,677 --> 01:02:49,477
to rebuild the Sunno Tribe.

840
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,447
I believe we can cooperate.

841
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,327
You are special to me.

842
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:55,551
My skills are not good enough.

843
01:02:55,557 --> 01:02:58,421
You should learn from a teacher
who is more experienced than me.

844
01:02:58,427 --> 01:03:01,883
First, become completely blank.
Skill comes after that.

845
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:03,807
Please do not go, Mother.

846
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:05,977
Run now.
