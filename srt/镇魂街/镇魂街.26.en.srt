1
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:02,165
Torso, throat, spine, all took serious damage.

2
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,498
The spirit armor

3
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,374
kept her alive,

4
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:14,832
but recovery's gonna be a long road.

5
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,624
Who did this to her?

6
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,624
If I knew,

7
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,207
I'd kill him!

8
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,415
Told you don't be a hero...

9
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,999
You stay with her.

10
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,874
I'll handle the rest.

11
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,707
What does the constables say?

12
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,249
lt's a real headache.â€¦

13
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,999
Let them have their little triumph!

14
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,624
It won't be long.

15
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,870
Feel better now?

16
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,540
Enough. Don't burn yourself out for me.

17
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,207
Keep some for yourself.

18
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,830
Whoa, Mr. Lu, what happened to you?

19
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,957
Lin Leilang?

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,999
You're not one of us. What are you doing here?

21
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,874
I wasn't, but I am now!

22
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,790
Xiang Kunlun brought every one of us in.

23
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,457
Seriously?!

24
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,624
When Mr. Lu asked

25
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,249
you all said no,

26
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,415
but for him, you're suddenly onboard?

27
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,874
Lu Tianyou.

28
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,374
Enough with the 'wise big brother' act, okay?

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,957
Don t forget who...

30
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:16,120
We owe him for what he've done...

31
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,040
but we're not gonna die

32
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,707
for some sort of dillydallier.

33
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,374
Me?

34
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,582
Let's just say,

35
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,707
Xiang's style suits us.

36
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,374
Mr. Lu may not care,

37
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,624
but I won't tolerate this bullshit.

38
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,499
Not your call to make here, I guess?

39
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,999
And I'd wreck you in a straight fight!

40
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,450
We'll see. Do you want to try?

41
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,290
You asked for it! Don't expect mercy!

42
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,790
Stop it, both of you!

43
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,457
It doesn't matter!

44
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,165
We're all members here.

45
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,374
Let people choose their own partners!

46
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,499
But they act like they own this place!

47
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,832
We have a visitor?

48
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,665
Look at the Sunstrike Archer now.

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,707
What happened to you?

50
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,415
And you are?

51
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,540
King Xiang, Qin Wanggong's asking

52
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,832
what to do with the fugitives?

53
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,624
His choice.

54
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:09,082
Hold this position. No one gets through.

55
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,165
Yes.

56
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,499
The forbidden ground is up ahead.

57
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,249
I'm flattered,

58
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,499
but I don't exactly fit the profile.

59
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,624
Don't worry.

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Your majesty.

61
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,665
Let us through

62
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,790
But this is a human...

63
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,832
Shall we run this by Constable Li first?

64
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,290
"Constable Li."

65
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,165
Every damn time!

66
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,457
Am I the one in charge here, or is he?

67
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,874
Get out of my way!

68
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,374
Aye!

69
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,082
Some King l am!

70
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:15,665
Weird. The old man pulls every string...

71
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,540
so why keep a puppet

72
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,249
that bites the hand?

73
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,582
I don't see what's so special about him...

74
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,957
but there must be a reason!

75
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,082
Lord Amaterasu, what do you want to show me?

76
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,749
Do you even see the bond between the living and the dead?

77
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,874
They are related.

78
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,040
Human here, ghost there.

79
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,999
Same soul,

80
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,457
different place.

81
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,207
Yeah,

82
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,332
the scales must balance here or there.

83
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,165
And the carriers are limited.

84
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,457
In human world:

85
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,915
a body grows, decays, and die.

86
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,290
Souls here don't fade.

87
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,165
Unless you go full demon

88
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,915
or get torn apart,

89
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,249
I guess

90
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,665
It can stay forever.

91
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,999
The wheel never stops turning.

92
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,624
Today's ghost is tomorrow's crying baby.

93
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,165
And get back to the human world.

94
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:34,080
You guys call it reincarnation.

95
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,332
some ghosts aren't lost their memory.

96
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,207
Choose to stay in the human world.

97
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,999
Their grief is strong enough to haunt for centuries

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,749
and bend even Death's rules.

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,160
The elusive concept of "love"

100
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:58,082
forges guard spirits and spirit carriers.

101
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,374
That may be god's will.

102
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,082
Then what does that make you guys?

103
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,874
Us?

104
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,332
We are the indigenous people here.

105
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,582
As for how?

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,207
Even the oldest among us forgot.

107
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,915
Massive, isn't it?

108
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,124
That's where the ghosts find their way back.

109
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:42,374
But I can't even touch it.

110
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,249
That's a goddamn joke!

111
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,665
Who put up this barrier?

112
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,457
My father, I guess.

113
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,457
The secret within this

114
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,082
maybe two people he trusted knew.

115
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,415
One of them is Li,

116
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,749
but he won't tell me anything.

117
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,165
Who's the other one?

118
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,040
Now you see why I asked you to come...

119
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:13,374
He's locked up in the deepest level of the Dark Inferno.

120
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,249
No bars. No doors. Just solid concrete.

121
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,124
These walls don't let anything out. Ever.

122
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,915
Cao Yanbing took out the guard.

123
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,207
Guess I owe him a big favor!

124
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:52,415
Oh. A human. How quaint.

125
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,415
Who are you?!

126
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:05,832
Something about me ring a bell?

127
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,332
Interesting!

128
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,540
Tianyin,

129
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,165
what are you doing way up here?

130
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,374
Is it done?

131
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,415
Cao's free.

132
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,999
But things between me and Xiang Kunlun

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,582
just got a lot more complicated.

134
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,415
What about others?

135
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,540
While you were gone,

136
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,249
the Kingdom Reunion came for the Drakepeach Grove.

137
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,249
Oh?

138
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,707
First the Rakshasa Street's Sophora,

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,874
and now Shuiyun Street...

140
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,082
According to reliable intelligence.

141
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,999
Intel confirms at least four knights.

142
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,207
If this goes hot, we're outgunned.

143
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,957
No peace.

144
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,165
This is so frustrating.

145
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,207
Alright,

146
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,290
let's get out of here.

147
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,957
Bullshit?!!!

148
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,040
Liu Yuchan took on couples of heroes...alone?

149
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,165
Hate to say it,

150
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,582
but right now,

151
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:30,874
he's outclassing both Tiger and Cao Yanbing.

152
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,457
He's unlocked every last one of his guardian spirits?

153
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,832
Exactly.They're the five generals,

154
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,624
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei,

155
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,790
Zhao Yun, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong!

156
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,740
Five spirits?

157
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,540
But Cao's got six.

158
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,624
The true power of warrior's body

159
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,457
isn't how many you have...

160
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,415
it's whether you can wield them all at once.

161
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,915
When the spirit carrier

162
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,165
and their spirit

163
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,624
achieve perfect sync...

164
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,290
And the form will also change.

165
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,915
that's when the Riot Form activates!

166
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,749
There's still one inside me,

167
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,665
fighting me every step of the way.

168
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,749
Wait...Cao Yanbing's down to his last spirit too.

169
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,540
Then that means...the hell?

170
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,582
Where did he go?

171
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,499
Gila?!

172
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,999
What are you doing here?

173
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:21,374
You're doing the "destroying nature" bit again?

174
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,457
The Kingdom Reunion is going all-out against the Ghostdom?

175
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:29,874
Right.

176
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,915
All ten Knights are in the field.

177
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,374
Primary targets confirmed - Drakepeach Grove and Imperial Elm.

178
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:37,915
Shit!

179
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,415
Master Tiger, A-Hua's the only one holding Xuanlong Street now...

180
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,415
Things seem like they got a little out of hand!

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,832
Why are you telling me this?

182
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:51,415
Hong Lian will be executed tomorrow.

183
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,624
This can't happen on my watch.

184
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,790
You help me out,

185
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,874
and I'll make it worth your while with something you'd like to hear.

186
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,332
How about it?

187
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,165
Now it makes sense!

188
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,457
He said "finish one thing"

189
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,040
before joining us

190
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,040
to break you out of the Dark Inferno!

191
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:25,499
I knew it...there's something going on between you two.

192
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,832
Gila, you betrayed the reunion!

193
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,082
Get your ass down!

194
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,832
I don't have time for this.

195
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,832
I'm leaving.

196
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,582
Wait, what? Does that mean it's already started?

197
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,874
Exactly!

198
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:50,624
Chances are, Liu's already in someone's crosshairs.

199
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,124
You're not Tianyin!

200
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,915
Of course I'm not.

201
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,415
I'm Death!

202
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,874
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei!

203
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,499
Your little spirit friends aren't coming out!

204
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,249
Look down.

205
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,040
Where is this place?!

206
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:31,249
The Trial Grounds don't lie.

207
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:37,624
The sinful soul will be swallowed up by the holy beast and banished forever

208
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,332
And you, too, have fallen under the curse of death,

209
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,124
and you cannot escape the fate of death.

210
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,124
Chan!

211
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,707
Ice Boy

212
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,790
I'd think twice about fighting you.

213
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,249
It's a pity!

214
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,165
Too bad Shuiyun Street will fall like a house of cards now.

215
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,249
Liu Yuchan is just fresh out of the Hall of Heroes...

216
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:19,624
and now the First Knight has his scent? He's so dead!

217
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,624
Your call: Hit the Kingdom's heart,

218
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,290
and I'll be your diversion.

219
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,165
Go for Liu,

220
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,665
and I'll hold the damn gate.

221
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,999
What do we do now?

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,457
Hesitate now, and we lose everyone!

223
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,124
There are no right choices,

224
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,082
only your choice.

225
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,707
The important thing is

226
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,290
that you must never doubt the decisions you have made.

227
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:15,082
You can't save them both.

228
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,290
So choose, do we go after Hong Lian, or Liu Yuchan?

229
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,499
Your choise:

230
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,540
Even Lord Floyd has backed in play.

231
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,999
It's about to blow up - big time.

232
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,707
Word is, they're heading for the Sacred Tree.

233
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,249
That's a whole army!?

234
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,915
They could wipe out this place

235
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,957
Wait, do you see someone over there?

236
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,499
Hey! You there!

237
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,165
Stop right now!
