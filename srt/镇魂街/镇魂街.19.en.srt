1
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,124
Is that all you got, kid?

2
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,749
You can't ride on

3
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,248
your spirit's shoulder forever.

4
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,832
When the real challenge comes,

5
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,832
you'll fall hard.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,082
Still persisting?

7
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,540
All brawn and no brains.

8
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,207
Persistence gets you nowhere.

9
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,999
Going out there

10
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,499
and getting yourself killed!

11
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,457
You're better off dying here.

12
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,374
Only someone as flexible as you

13
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,957
could push me

14
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,832
to my limits like this.

15
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,164
I don't care where you came from.

16
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,832
Take another step,

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,207
and you're so done.

18
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,207
Zhang He! Let's go!

19
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,832
What's with hm... Is
he some kind of hybrid?

20
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,990
Doesn't matter, you can't do nothing to me.

21
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,415
Let's not get carried away, kid.

22
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,165
Oops, didn't mean to hit that hard.

23
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,915
That was way too much for a human to take.

24
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,290
I was just starting to have fun.

25
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,790
There's no way anyone could survive

26
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,040
that and still move, not even a hybrid.

27
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,790
What did you do?!

28
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:53,415
This is so much easier
to handle than a knife!

29
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,082
Whoa, whoa, interesting!

30
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,707
You're the most interesting little thing

31
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,374
I've met in years!

32
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,665
This power...

33
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,582
He's Xiaoxiao's son,

34
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,665
but he should be exhausted.

35
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,707
How is he still standing?

36
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,999
Mister, good to see you!

37
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,415
How'd you guys get out?

38
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,874
This weapon's all Luo Fu need to

39
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,124
break down every wall in this prison.

40
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,999
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,165
I hid a weapon here years ago.

42
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,249
Funny how it's the thing
I need most right now.

43
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,415
They're too close to call.

44
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,082
I didn't see that coming.

45
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,624
The reason the guard is
called the Ghost Destroyer

46
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,624
isn't just his power to tame souls.

47
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,499
It's how

48
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,374
he can be immune to

49
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,040
spiritual attacks.

50
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,124
A hand-to-hand fight

51
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,124
doesn't make you safe.

52
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,207
You could still end up sealed.

53
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,249
Without spirits,

54
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,040
then it's up to us
humans to face the guard.

55
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,874
A human body

56
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,457
is just too fragile.

57
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,082
How did that kid

58
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,749
survive his attack...?

59
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,999
It's the Dark Armor!

60
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,457
No idea how he did it,

61
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,582
but his spirit didn't release energy,

62
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,999
and it reinforced his body like an armor.

63
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,499
How humiliating.

64
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,082
We had to lean on a kid for help...

65
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,124
A prison break isn't just
about beating the guard.

66
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,624
We can't do much,

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,457
but making a mess? That, we can do.

68
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,040
A pathetic human can hurt me!

69
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,915
This'll be so unforgivable.

70
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,582
I'm done playing! Come in now!

71
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,499
What happened? Isn't it a hybrid?

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,082
Find it out in hell!

73
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,290
If I can't take you in, then
I'll just have to kill you!

74
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,874
It's your show time, Zhang He!

75
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,990
You think this is over?

76
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,915
Keep this up, and he'll wear us down.

77
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,707
With the unstoppable power
of the Lord Myo in one hand

78
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,624
and the spirit-repelling
power of Guanyin in the other,

79
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,915
What's even more troublesome is

80
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,499
this guy's energy never seems to end.

81
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,040
It just reforms in no time no matter

82
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,832
how many times I destroy it.

83
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,707
What? Out of tricks?

84
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,875
Zhang He!

85
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,338
Look! The prayer beads
on his right shoulder...

86
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,790
You noticed that, too?

87
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,165
Every bead has been used

88
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,790
except for that one.

89
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,832
Remember the Darkfire
at the very beginning?

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,415
He's immune to spiritual power,

91
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,624
and held back all physical attack,

92
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,874
just like he has always done,

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,499
but only dodges that particular strike.

94
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,790
I figured it was a reflex at first,

95
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,665
but when I aimed for
his right shoulder again,

96
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,040
he still dodged.

97
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,957
That means...

98
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,249
The prayer beads is his weakness.

99
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,165
Here's the deal:

100
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,207
if this plan works, we win.

101
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,332
If it doesn't, we're done for.

102
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,207
You in?

103
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,374
I have bet my life on you

104
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,707
and this armor.

105
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,540
What do I have to lose?

106
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,290
You want to fight up close?

107
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,874
Do you really think you can
get past these two mountains?

108
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,124
Back off.

109
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,499
Master, go now!

110
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,957
Go ahead and try me.

111
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,457
Pathetic!

112
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,707
I'm Invincible.

113
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,124
No one in this world can defeat me!

114
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,249
Especially not a weak human like you!

115
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,457
What happened? An earthquake?

116
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,499
Something's going wrong
in the Dark Inferno?!

117
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,415
You shall shepherd lost spirits with grace.

118
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,874
In five hundred years,
sainthood shall be your place.

119
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,082
The saint is not showing up.

120
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,707
He lied to you!

121
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,374
The saint

122
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,040
sent me to end you.

123
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,290
May you find peace in your next life.

124
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,332
The world is blind,

125
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,499
unable to grasp the
wisdom of the sainthood.

126
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,749
I carry out the mercy of Guanyin
through the power of Lord Myo.

127
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,124
Abomination!

128
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,040
Fate won't bend,

129
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,915
nor wisdom lend.

130
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,082
Truth unspoken to the blind!

131
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,624
Without fate, one cannot cross

132
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,790
If you cannot be saved,

133
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,624
Truth unspoken to the blind!

134
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,457
It just means I haven't
done thoroughly enough

135
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:41,499
or I haven't killed enough.

136
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,040
How could the Underground
possibly be empty?

137
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,499
Bodhisattva will never come

138
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,332
The saint lied to you!

139
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,582
This is my path of practice.

140
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,999
The saint has not come because
my practice is not yet perfect.

141
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,832
When it is complete,

142
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,415
the saint will come to me.

143
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,832
Ayuturo Beads. My dear Ayuturo beads.

144
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,665
The saint gave it to me.

145
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,499
Without Ayuturo beads,

146
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:31,207
I can't return to the saint without it...

147
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,200
I... I...

148
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,915
Give him a swift death.

149
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,082
It's over.

150
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,457
What if he gets back
up and comes after you?

151
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,249
He is

152
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,249
just a poor guy who
completely trusted the saint.

153
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,290
He can't fight anymore. Anyways...

154
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,040
Moreover,

155
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,332
I've already taken back all the generals.

156
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,165
Generals, you've done
well. Come back to me.

157
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,166
Aye!

158
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,707
Surround the area, block all exits,

159
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,457
capture every escapee. Move!

160
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,458
Yes!

161
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,915
Such a bother!

162
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,999
I've had enough!

163
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:04,499
There's no way I'm going down now.

164
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,707
Take him down!

165
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,582
Buddy! You need help?

166
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,582
Bei Luo, what're you doing here?

167
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,249
Not just me. We're all here!
