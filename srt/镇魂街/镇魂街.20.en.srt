1
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,541
What?

2
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,833
We dig a tunnel?

3
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,125
This is it?

4
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,415
Heh, don't think it's easy.

5
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,124
The molten rock surrounds

6
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,665
the Dark Inferno

7
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,290
beneath as a natural barrier.

8
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,290
Beneath the surface,
just above the molten rock,

9
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,790
has a deadly barrier,
48 inferno thunder pillars

10
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,165
Once you touch it.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,374
That'll blow you to ashes.

12
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:29,957
The only safe way into it
is through the front gate.

13
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,832
Since you proposed this plan.

14
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,296
So, I guess you must be
pretty sure it'll work.

15
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,374
No, I'm not. But he is.

16
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:44,082
Here's the deal. We avoid
those pillars, head straight down

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,100
through the tunnel to the entrance area,

18
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,582
and keep digging our way
into it through the safe strip

19
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,957
between the tunnel and the molten rock.

20
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,582
But down there

21
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,707
we can't navigate or measure

22
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,207
with surface structures, can we?

23
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,624
That means we just dig blindly!

24
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,957
It's not going to work!?

25
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,499
No, that's not true.

26
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,291
So?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,665
With this map and Guo
Fengxiao's brilliant-ass mind,

28
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,832
it'll be... absolutely perfect.

29
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,249
Xia Ling, Feng Zha!

30
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,200
And... Guo Xiaoyao?

31
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Idiot!!

32
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,207
What did you bring them here for?

33
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,290
Are you trying to get us killed?

34
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,291
You're one to talk!?

35
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,767
You ditched us and put yourself in a ridiculous
situation. Are you out of your mind?!

36
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,707
Don't you trust us at all?!

37
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,374
We're in this together! You hear me?

38
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,499
How did these guys get in?!

39
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,165
The Dark Inferno is
supposed to be flawless...

40
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,707
Not now!

41
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,332
We need to get out of here!

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,374
Wuxin, follow me!

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,499
Do you really think I'd
just let you off easy?

44
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,083
Form up!

45
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,125
Shields!

46
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,708
Spears!

47
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,708
Archers!

48
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,957
We're gonna find out!

49
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,083
Move!

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,207
Wuxin, come!

51
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,624
Right now, or never!

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wait, what?

53
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,540
Take care!

54
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,540
Shi Lingming, let's go!

55
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,999
Nice try!

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
Trinity Formation.

57
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,707
Throwing yourself in
to stall for them, huh?

58
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,915
Fine,

59
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,957
go ahead and fight like crazy,

60
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,870
but you're not just up against me here!

61
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,249
Stop her!

62
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,999
Come on! Move!

63
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,082
It gets interrupted?

64
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,207
This is odd.

65
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,707
Universal Mind Web

66
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,374
We got a breach!

67
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,582
No matter where you hidet!

68
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,700
They can find you.

69
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,165
You can't run from this!

70
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,624
Didn't think someone actually
has the guts to break in!

71
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,249
They are just pawns. We need to move, now!

72
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,499
Hurry up.

73
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,457
Fengxiao set up a Trigram Array already,

74
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,624
but it won't buy us much time.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,957
You've got more important things
to do. Get on the watchtower.

76
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,874
We'll crash them.

77
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,082
I don't see any enemy.

78
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,915
Are they hiding where we can't see?

79
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,240
General Li, please help!

80
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,915
Impressive! Fortune favors the bold!

81
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,708
What's that?

82
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,415
They're coming up. No, wait!

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They're trying to escape!

84
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,040
Cao Yanbing?

85
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,207
Something's coming at us!

86
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,665
No, not us.

87
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,624
They're heading straight ahead!

88
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,082
They're trying to set off the pillars!

89
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,083
Watch out!!

90
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,165
Everyone needs to know.

91
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,915
Getting in is one thing,

92
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,040
but getting away clean? That's
where the real game begins!

93
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,540
In the Hall of Heroes, everyone's a player.

94
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,790
Especially Li Gucheng on the watchtower.

95
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,707
There's no way we are going back.

96
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,415
He'll force us out into the open.

97
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,374
If that happens, we split up

98
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,249
scatter through all exits,

99
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,915
divide them

100
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,457
to cover Master Cao's escape!

101
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,374
If they're only after Cao Yanbing?

102
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,207
Would it be way worse?

103
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,374
They won't let intruders walk away,

104
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,790
not with their pride on the line.

105
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,790
Exactly. I think the Hall
of Heroes will be disgraced

106
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,665
if it happens.

107
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,832
If they can't find Master Cao,

108
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,790
they'll have to split up!

109
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,374
Some kind of smokescreen?

110
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,290
Good thinking, but..

111
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,582
Good thing Bei Luo reacted fast,

112
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,415
or we would've been roasted alive!

113
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,874
Master, we're being watched!

114
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,790
Yanging, get them down!

115
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,915
You've got some balls to break in here!

116
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,290
They're right here!

117
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,582
Don't let them get away!

118
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,624
Idiots!

119
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,207
They're just accomplices!

120
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,124
Cao Yanbing escaped, and he's what we want!

121
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,457
If he gets away,

122
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,582
the Hall of Heroes will be a joke!

123
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,457
What?

124
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,499
Cao Yanbing escaped from the Dark Inferno?

125
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,790
You heard me!!

126
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,999
You're not going?

127
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,707
Don't worry about me. I'm just a nobody.

128
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,874
I don't care. Intruders
will never walk away.

129
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,374
Guess there's still a fight...

130
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,707
Li Xuanyuan, you're up!

131
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,457
You're lucky it's me.

132
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,207
At least I won't kill
you like everyone else!

133
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,624
My master's not much of a fighter.

134
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,016
How about you and I settle this instead?

135
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,915
Just you and me?

136
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,333
Sure!

137
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,582
Look what we have here!

138
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,915
Honestly, except for Cao Yanbing...

139
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,457
you're the only one
who's made me this curious.

140
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,665
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm
not attracted to you. Move!

141
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,207
Move?

142
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,165
No, no, no. If you leave,

143
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:20,165
who's going to satisfy my curiosity?

144
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,915
Commander Men!

145
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,870
He might seem fragile,

146
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,080
but he's got speed and power
that'll knock you out cold.

147
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,290
Hybrid!

148
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,040
What's your name?

149
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,499
Why do you care?

150
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,082
Then you'll just be
another nameless dead meat.

151
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,957
We've been made!

152
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,791
What?!
Seriously?

153
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,707
Everything's set,

154
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,499
but if we want to get out of here,

155
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,540
we've got to take this bet!

156
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,624
Stop him getting back!!

157
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,332
A classic diversion. Well played!

158
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,290
It's too late now!

159
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,999
Let's settle this right
here, just the two of us!

160
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,950
My job is to monitor the
situation and chase Cao,

161
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,124
not to get caught up in
a petty fight with you.

162
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,582
They've knocked out the watchtowers

163
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,707
and cut off the comms,

164
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,499
These guys came prepared!

165
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,874
They say

166
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,374
the best place to hide
something is in plain sight,

167
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,082
but who really knows where it is?

168
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,999
And who can really tell

169
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,665
