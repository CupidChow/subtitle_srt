1
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,874
Tang Wuxin?

2
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,082
What a surprise.

3
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,624
And since when do you hide here?

4
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,874
Tang Wuxin!

5
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:09,665
What are you doing here? Where's my mom?!

6
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,999
What I saw through the old man's eyes...

7
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:19,707
Did you really... see
it with your own eyes?

8
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,874
You failed to save your master

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,790
but still can protect her child.

10
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,249
Is that what you think?

11
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,915
You might have lived

12
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,624
if you stayed hidden,

13
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,665
but now...

14
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,415
Let's see

15
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,707
if your Blade Tempest
is as good as they say!

16
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:44,499
Wuxin, you made it...

17
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,874
But now, I can't do anything for you!

18
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,957
Oh, don't watch that.

19
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,832
I wrecked him really bad.

20
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,207
He's as good as dead!

21
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,790
Just worry about yourself!

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,957
You're just a lost soul

23
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,499
nothing like what you used to be

24
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,915
Now

25
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:20,082
you are just an unclaimed
soul drifting in the underworld.

26
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,374
So...

27
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,124
surrender peacefully!

28
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,082
Great move！

29
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,749
But...

30
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,040
Ten rounds is all I need to finish you.

31
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,707
This... isn't the real world...

32
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,624
Is it... inside my mind?

33
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,874
General, who are you?

34
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,040
I don't know why you led me here,

35
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,707
but let me out.

36
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,332
I've got work to do！

37
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,124
Oi! You hear me?

38
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,624
I don't have time for this.

39
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,208
What?

40
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,540
Just take your food and leave.

41
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,665
I'm busy here.

42
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,374
Seriously? You think I'm begging?

43
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,749
I don't care who you are,

44
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,082
let me out! I'm still fighting!

45
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,123
I'm still fighting with...

46
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,082
Wait... who?

47
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,082
Who am I even fighting...

48
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,707
and why?

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,457
I feel like there's someone

50
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,290
I'm forgetting... someone important.

51
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,207
Who was it?

52
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,660
Oh, still nothing?

53
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,999
Who... am... I?

54
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,749
Seems worse than this morning.

55
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,457
But maybe forgetting isn't so bad.

56
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,540
Wouldn't it be nice to
let go of all the worries?

57
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,415
Maybe.

58
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,624
It doesn't feel like

59
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,374
it was something bad, though.

60
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,374
Don't upset yourself, hmm?

61
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,875
Just eat.

62
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,957
What now?

63
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,582
Your blades are all gone,

64
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,374
and your body's not
healing like it used to.

65
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
Give it up.

66
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,124
Give me the kid, and I'll let you live.

67
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,915
I know

68
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,957
you'd rather die to save him,

69
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,332
but look at you.

70
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,749
You are pretty banged up.

71
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,289
No offense, but this is just
the difference in raw power.

72
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,624
Face the facts and walk away while you can.

73
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,164
Or I'll kill you.

74
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,040
Wuxin, do you know that

75
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,749
we have the Might Potion
that is not allowed to use?

76
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,290
"Hui Tian"

77
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,582
It can push you to the limit quickly,

78
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,499
but it'll

79
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,124
cost you every bit of life you've got.

80
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,624
You got the 'Hui Tian'? Give me one!

81
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,582
Relax!

82
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,332
I'd only use it as a last resort.

83
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,624
For instance,

84
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,999
if my kid's life was on the line

85
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,249
and I had no other choice.

86
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,790
And someday

87
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,540
if I had this potion.

88
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,166
What're you drinking?

89
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,749
I might still be a good mother,

90
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,832
right?

91
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,207
How does it feel to be farming

92
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,415
for over a month now?

93
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,457
Not bad.

94
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,624
I've been meaning to ask...

95
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,582
All these wounds...

96
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,624
I was a fighter once.

97
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,207
It's sad, really.

98
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,249
That fight could've been avoided.

99
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,915
But it's over now.

100
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,582
I just want to live a simple life

101
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,624
tending the land.

102
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,040
Did you lose the fight?

103
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,207
Yeah.

104
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,306
But it wasn't the enemy that defeated us.

105
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,457
It was our people.

106
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,749
Who?

107
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,290
A traitor.

108
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,951
I'd rather not talk about it!

109
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,207
If you were the king,

110
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,499
and two men came to you:

111
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,999
one with a big name,
the other with big money.

112
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,957
But you could only take one,

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,207
which would it be?

114
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,457
Why would you ask me that?

115
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,290
You've got no memory,

116
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,040
so now you must be the
most honest of all time.

117
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,124
Neither of them!

118
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,665
Why?

119
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,332
Does fame and money

120
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,040
really not matter?

121
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,541
Yeah.

122
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,665
I fought countless battles,

123
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,290
achieving glory after glory,

124
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,790
yet I was never truly valued or trusted

125
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,290
till I died,

126
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,915
all because

127
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,540
I came from nothing.

128
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,082
You're saying that doesn't matter?

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,915
A good leader is worth a thousand soldiers.

130
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,540
A real king doesn't
care about a man's birth,

131
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,290
but his heart and skill.

132
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,749
Money and fame are fleeting,

133
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,332
and what truly matters

134
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,749
is the loyalty and
skill of a great general.

135
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,665
Thanks for everything,

136
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,249
life's been calm and easy,

137
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,915
but something inside
me knows it won't last.

138
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,957
So you're leaving, huh?

139
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,582
Seek for more problems?

140
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
Wait.

141
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,582
At least take these with you.

142
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
What is it?!

143
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,290
Yanbing, I'm going back
to Rakshasa Street with you.

144
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,332
I pledge my loyalty to the Cao Family,
through fire and blood, for generations.

145
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,207
I'm BeiLuo Shimen.

146
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,790
And Shui.

147
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,540
I'm the Requiem General
from Stormride street.

148
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,665
He's Yan Fengzha.

149
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,165
Can only take you this far.

150
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,540
The Underground Priest.

151
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,290
I will follow you, wherever you go.

152
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,999
You don't even recognize my
guardian spirit. This is Xu Huang.

153
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,624
I admire you because you
have what it takes to lead.

154
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,832
You think humans can kill me?

155
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,749
I'm God.

156
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,374
Stubborn fool!

157
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,915
Do you see a scratch on me?

158
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:24,124
But you? You're at your limit.

159
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,207
Last desperate moves.

160
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,040
Now I'm sending this kid to his grave.

161
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,582
Don't you dare hurt him!

162
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,249
Yet you still persisted, huh?

163
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,082
Now! Attack.

164
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,874
Move!

165
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,332
What do you mean?

166
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,124
Wasn't this your test for me?

167
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,832
I remember everything now. Come with me!

168
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,832
Huh? Am I crazy?

169
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,414
I sheltered you,

170
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,039
and you burn my house and crops?

171
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Bullshit!

172
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,624
You can't just walk away from who you are!

173
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,832
You're not meant for this quiet life!

174
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,915
You're a general.

175
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,290
You could never...

176
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,707
waste your life... here!

177
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,541
No...

178
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,040
And in a way, I'm dead already...

179
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,457
Lies！

180
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,707
Or you wouldn't have helped
me defeat the Mook King!

181
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,457
You wouldn't have let me see it!

182
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,332
You can erase it all for good!

183
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,999
Let me forget forever.

184
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,624
The real you

185
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,707
deep down,

186
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,207
you've always craved the fight!

187
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,874
I lived a life of glory,

188
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,707
only to have it slip through my fingers.

189
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,624
My dreams died with me, incomplete.

190
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,165
I need a leader who will
let me finish what I started.

191
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,374
Cao Mengde was one of them,

192
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,540
but sadly, he left us too soon.

193
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,415
Kid, I helped you once,

194
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,832
but that doesn't mean I've agreed to this!

195
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,665
What do you want?

196
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,874
Show me what you've got!

197
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,915
First of all, I want your name!

198
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,082
Zhang Junyi from Hejian.

199
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,915
You're spent,

200
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,874
and the big buy behind
you isn't doing much better.

201
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,999
Surprised, huh?

202
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,415
The ghost can't even
hurt my impervious form!

203
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,749
That's why

204
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,915
they call me the Ghost Destroyer!

205
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,915
You're not weak.

206
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,665
It's just that we're on
completely different levels!

207
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,916
Where is he?

208
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,082
I don't care where you popped up from.

209
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,124
Take one more step

210
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,040
and I'll seal you!

211
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:24,290
Go ahead and bet your life on it!!
