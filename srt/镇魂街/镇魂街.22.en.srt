1
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,499
My lord, the gate's been shut.
All units are lying in wait.

2
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,332
Cao Yanbing won't be able to get away!

3
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,665
Don't get sloppy. Hold the north gate.

4
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,956
The capture thing will
be handled by others!

5
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,957
Be quick... hurry... inform the general,

6
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,832
the west gate is under assault.

7
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,707
Inform General Diao Lingyun now,

8
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,249
the Hall's south gate has been breached!

9
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,582
I can't count on Exorcism Breeze anymore.

10
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,124
I must forge my own strength!

11
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,165
Peak Realm of Pure Yang Infinite Power!

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,332
Li Xuanyuan is unable to
master its Peak Realm now.

13
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,499
Though it gained him some advantage,

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,832
it's also bringing
great damage to his body.

15
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,415
It's totally a momentary
victory with great cost!

16
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,795
It seems that you've
saved your strength before?

17
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,124
Then... then I won't hold back either!

18
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,583
Let's see it!

19
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:29,290
Don't try to teach fish to swim, silly guy!

20
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,082
Shi Lingming!

21
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,374
The same damn thing again!

22
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,874
Why could he react faster?

23
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,290
Could it be...

24
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,040
You've found it!

25
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,874
"Fighter's cigarette",

26
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,707
made with my guardian spirit's power,

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,124
is my weapon!

28
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,749
Is the speed raised by the white smoke?

29
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,874
Then this one...

30
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,332
Not my job to let you know!

31
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,207
That's for you to figure it out!

32
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,624
What's the glory in that?!

33
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,874
Fam Beiluo, what's holding you back?

34
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,957
If you don't go all out now,
you're gonna be ended here!

35
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,582
Where do you think you can go, bud?

36
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,040
Damn! It was almost done!

37
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,082
Guan Yu! Zhang Fei!

38
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,665
The road ahead leads out
of town. You guys go quickly!

39
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,220
Then... thank you for taking over the rest!

40
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,915
Generals,

41
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,957
Dian Wei... Dian Wei hasn't caught up yet.

42
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,707
Please save him!

43
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,249
Don't forget which side
we're on, Advisor Guo!

44
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,874
Yet...

45
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,707
I still want to see whether the
legendary "killer-with-no-rival"

46
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,582
falls or not!

47
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,915
Yixin's pills can help with the safe-zone.

48
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,457
But once it turns into soul,
the pills won't work anymore.

49
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,415
You have only 600 seconds!

50
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,874
Long enough!

51
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,249
No one can escape!

52
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm not your opponent!

53
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,999
Let him go!

54
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,950
I never kill no hame
warrior. Name yourself!

55
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,874
Qin Shubao!

56
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,207
Guan Yunchang!!

57
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,208
Great!!

58
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,832
Qin Qiong... was stopped?!

59
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,290
How could it be... him?

60
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,291
You know him?

61
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,624
Go ask Xiang Kunlun!

62
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,749
Shall we pursue?

63
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,580
No need! To go after
Cao Yanbing matters more!

64
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,790
Lv Bu's on his way!

65
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,790
How could he still be hanging in there?!

66
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,457
Freak... he's really a freak...

67
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:08,707
Master is in danger! Protect master!

68
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,874
Keep going on! He's almost blown!

69
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,457
I really overestimated you guys!

70
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,499
Who's there?!

71
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,624
Just someone under Lv Bu's pay, huh!

72
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,582
Stay away!

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,332
I'm Zhang Yide from the Yan tribe.

74
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,790
I can easily take off the general's head

75
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,832
among the armies.

76
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,124
Who dares stop me?

77
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,832
Though you're my enemy,

78
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,415
I really admire you.

79
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,915
You've indeed pinned me down here.

80
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,999
But it's all settled! You can stop now.

81
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Leave it to me.

82
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,915
Since you want an end,

83
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,749
then let me make this easy for you!

84
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,832
Good job, Wuxin!

85
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,749
You've beat everyone here down!

86
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,832
We're late.

87
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,832
Just keep still. It can
help hold a bit longer.

88
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,624
We know what you want to figure out now.

89
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,749
I tried to check on Cao
Yanbing with Sweeping Detection,

90
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,957
just listen!

91
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,665
The area's too big.

92
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,082
You can take our power.

93
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,082
Got it!

94
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,082
He's still alive!

95
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,790
The battle's still fierce!

96
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,249
Yanbing can still be in danger
even if getting out of town.

97
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,249
The Hall of Heroes can still pursue him.

98
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,999
Maybe it's time to try
relieving by diversion!

99
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,082
You should thank your lucky stars!

100
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,874
Now you're free

101
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,370
to do whatever you want!

102
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,957
It's too far!

103
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,624
It's Li Gucheng!

104
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,490
It will be one shot to death this time.

105
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,249
Who did it? Nice shot! Good grip!

106
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,249
What's in the way is found!

107
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,165
It looks that we're found!

108
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,165
Chan, get back!

109
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,415
It's also a cracked guy!

110
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,370
Can he do better in archery than you?

111
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,040
Let's see... if we can meet in fights!

112
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,374
You really think he can be
safe with me blocked here?

113
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,582
Someone else has been on the traill

114
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,450
Zilong, this guy's finally here!

115
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,290
Chan has told us,

116
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,374
just try to buy some time,
no time-wasting in battles!

117
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,582
Who's there?

118
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,082
Your nightmare's daddy!

119
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,957
If you don't get away, I'll
make you lose the other leg!

120
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,249
How can I let that happen!

121
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,832
Hey, bro, stop posturing.

122
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,290
You can't raise your hands now, right?

123
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,707
I'm not sure about why,

124
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:24,249
but apparently, you've
tried your best, am I right?

125
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,457
Little girl, don't think you're so mighty.

126
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,915
If it were not for the solo round,

127
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,832
you've already been controlled.

128
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,120
If you get in the game, then I
don't need to obey the rules anymore.

129
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,874
Tai-xu Light Condenser Shield!

130
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,790
Then just pray that you deserve this!

131
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,165
Tough guy... no matter how I provoke him,

132
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,415
he just wouldn't show his real strength.

133
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,124
Boring!

134
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,957
He's yours now!!

135
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,958
Yes, sir!

136
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,414
Even if I hold nothing back
to deal with the enemy ahead,

137
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,332
then what? What am I gonna do next...

138
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,999
will I really be ended here today?

139
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,332
Who are you?

140
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:55,124
So dispersed! It's really
not that easy to find you!

141
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,374
Why you?

142
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,665
Do you need help?

143
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,375
No need.

144
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,957
Cao Yanbing should be safe now.

145
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,707
You should also retreat now.

146
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,832
Leave the little girl to me!

147
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,915
This woman's not that easy
to deal with! Be careful!

148
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,200
Though you're a woman, I won't be merciful!

149
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,290
Me neither.
