1
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,666
Team One, go left! Team Two, head right!

2
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:04,957
Everyone else, go with me!

3
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,916
Where the hell can Cao Yanbing be?

4
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,957
Go search over there.

5
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,958
Yes, sir!

6
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:32,999
Knew it! Someone's there!

7
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,458
Take them down!

8
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,916
Don't attack my master!

9
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,708
Stop him!

10
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,457
Luckily, we have the two generals here.

11
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,874
As long as their signal's blocked,

12
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,749
we can be safe for now.

13
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,082
The Hall of Heroes' army is all out.

14
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,499
Don't hang around here.

15
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,874
As long as their chief general
has no idea of where the guy is,

16
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,957
they can just run around like crazy.

17
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,666
We don't have much time left.

18
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,957
The tunnel's destroyed. They can
only exit the city through four gates.

19
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,957
Outside the north gate is a cliff.
It's hard to get rid of the pursuers.

20
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,643
Definitely they wouldn't pick this one.

21
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,392
The west gate's the heavily guarded one.

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,957
But we still see no signals from there.

23
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,499
So they didn't pick the east gate...

24
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,747
could it be the south gate!

25
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,874
Wait! Gucheng,

26
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,124
why did you just skip the east gate?

27
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,124
They deliberately led me east before,

28
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,874
and back only after I saw it through.
The watch towers here have been destroyed.

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,124
They're trying to blind
me to other approaches.

30
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,540
Attention, Cao Yanbing must
have run towards the east gate.

31
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,916
East squad, push for backup now.

32
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,041
Be sure to get him down!

33
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,042
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:06,582
War is like deception. Mask weakness as
strength, disguise strength as weakness.

35
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,082
Truth and falsehood intertwine.

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,124
A general should be decisive.

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,082
Any step towards the wrong direction

38
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,666
may lead to walking the shadow

39
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,791
of my former errors.

40
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,725
Yes, sir, I will keep it firmly in mind.

41
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:22,999
Although they're the enemy,

42
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,207
I really admire their wits and guts.

43
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,207
To be true and false, to live from death.

44
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,166
Without your reminding,

45
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,416
I'd be walking right into their ambush!

46
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,897
They've really got something on them.

47
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,542
It's a pity!

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,416
Damn, it's been seen through so quickly.

49
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,332
These dudes are overpowered!
We're no match for them!

50
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,416
Shields up!

51
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,249
It's hard to take them down.
Then try our best to hold them off,

52
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
and wait for backup!

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Take the hits!

54
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,791
Hold on, don't retreat!

55
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,416
To attack our spearhead won't break us!

56
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,432
You're looking down on the wrong people!!

57
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,332
Go!!

58
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,833
Dian Wei!

59
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,430
The spearhead falls, the captain advances,

60
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,457
and then the soldiers...

61
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,291
here's indeed fear in their eyes,

62
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,916
but no one retreats.

63
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,302
So this is the spirit
of the Hall of Heroes!

64
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,035
Are you all right?
No worries!

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No slack here!

66
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,416
Kill!

67
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,916
Double legend! Generals,
you are truly overpowered!

68
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,309
This is the superior force of the Hall of
Heroes, scouts of the Iron Breaker Battalion.

69
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,957
They should be here soon.

70
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,416
Bro, get master onto
horseback now and leave!

71
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,999
Generals, please follow me.

72
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,207
Go!

73
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,166
Dian Wei? You wanna stay alone?

74
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,957
With no one in the rear guard,

75
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,934
the superior force of the Hall
of Heroes will reach master soon,

76
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,278
I shall also stay!
Absolutely not!

77
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:55,124
Other generals are unable to
move. Master gets badly injured.

78
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,374
Without you by his side,

79
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,957
master can be in grave danger.

80
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,916
General Dian, we're not free men.

81
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,166
Being guardian spirits, we
have to be close to our host

82
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,124
to maintain strength.

83
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,207
Go!

84
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:42,332
Kill!

85
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,082
Battle's coming at us, and
you're still on your damn bottle?

86
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,332
Fate is unknown,

87
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,124
then why not let the liquor lead the way?!

88
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,457
Come on! As a well-known terror,

89
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,791
fear should be your enemies' problem.

90
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,700
The liquor's from master, right?

91
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,874
Come on, slow down! I
won't fight you for it!

92
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,249
By the way, you're the
first one picked by master

93
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,666
to serve by his side.

94
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,707
Master really trusts you, huh?!
Light will surely be shone on you!

95
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,999
I'm just a rough guy, not
able to do great things,

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,332
like a useless stone.

97
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,666
But there's someone with great vision,

98
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,207
being able to see what's out of my sight.

99
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,541
When he stands on the stone,

100
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,374
he can see more and farther.

101
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,582
If I can be the
stepping-stone for such guys,

102
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,249
then

103
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,916
I will also be useful!

104
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,707
Sucker punch from Zhang Xiu! There's
a sucker punch! Put it out! Stop!

105
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,541
Don't attack my master!

106
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,458
Master, please leave! Let
me be in the rear guard!

107
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,540
It's no big deal if I die.

108
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:38,624
It's just that I won't be
able to guard your tent anymore.

109
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,166
I chose to be a guardian spirit

110
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,666
just for protecting the Cao Family.

111
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,541
But it allowed me to see master growing up.

112
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,832
When he decided to take over the world,

113
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,332
I saw who master Cao was.

114
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,624
I wanted to be master's stepping-stone,

115
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,874
watching him build his empire!

116
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:20,791
Sadly, history always rhymes!

117
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,041
I would never back the wrong person.

118
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:29,916
I shall fulfill my mission.

119
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,624
I'll become a bastion of iron.

120
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,207
Just let me get you firmly blocked here,

121
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:43,082
and leave the future to my king!

122
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:49,832
I'm Great General Dian Wei!
Step forth and meet your end!

123
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,499
Damn! Who can tell me whether
it's safe-zone for Dian Wei or not!

124
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,666
Xiaoyao, there's no time to hesitate.

125
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,416
If we waste the borrowed time by Dian Wei,

126
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,166
then we can be utterly damned!

127
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:27,291
There's a limit of the safe-zone
between the guardian spirit and the host.

128
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:32,416
Once the safe-zone's reached,
the guardian spirit can get weak,

129
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,041
till death.

130
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,249
Guardian spirits are born to guard.

131
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,999
They seldom leave the safe-zone.

132
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:44,832
But once they leave, it must
be for another kind of "guard".

133
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,740
Guardian spirits can only live out of
the safe-zone for at most 600 seconds,

134
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:56,666
which is bestowed with a holy name,

135
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,249
"600 seconds in Iron"!

136
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,624
Time's enough!

137
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,916
Just keep breathing

138
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,249
till master's out of the city!

139
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,583
Go for it!

140
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,832
Don't mind him.

141
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,291
Go after the Cao Yanbing ahead!

142
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:25,832
As long as I'm here, no one can pass!

143
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,291
I don't feel any pain.

144
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,499
Team One, stay here and finish him!

145
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,957
Everyone else, keep going after!

146
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,249
I said it, no one can pass!

147
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,916
Get your ass back

148
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,417
back here!

149
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,874
This is a real man!

150
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:53,874
What's a pity!

151
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,832
I thought you would
directly take his head down.

152
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,082
It's already dishonored
to attack from his back.

153
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,957
He deserves a warrior's end.

154
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:14,874
Let us chase, and leave him
to the Iron Breaker Battalion.

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,332
Someone's catching up.

156
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,666
Has Dian Wei already been...

157
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,207
It's not time to worry about this,

158
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,291
General Zhang.

159
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,957
Please get all wooden
pillars around cut off.

160
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,874
Qin Wanggong, how far is your
guardian spirit's safe-zong?

161
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,666
800 meters. Do you want to
send the guardian spirit in first?

162
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,667
Yeap!

163
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:03,037
It's both about 1000 meters to the
Radiant Street and the Petal-drifting Lane.

164
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,207
Let our guardian spirits go separately.

165
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,040
If Lv Bu fails to catch up,

166
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,665
then go around to meet Qin Qiong.

167
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,540
Go around to gank from both sides?

168
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,665
Seems that you have no worry about
your guardian spirit's safe-zone.

169
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,415
Of course. There's no man
able to be Lv Bu's rival.

170
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,582
The safe-zone of this pair is 1500 meters,

171
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,165
which can rank first.

172
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,332
Master...

173
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,999
master's in danger.

174
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,332
I want to... protect master.

175
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,166
His form's about to
fade. Everybody, go for it!

176
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,707
Archers, get ready!

177
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,582
Protect master.

178
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,625
Loose!

179
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,445
Brat!
Let me see where you can go!

180
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,999
Just get the guardian spirit out?

181
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,707
Is this guy's safe-zone so far?

182
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,499
What now?

183
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,332
General Zhang also seems to be exhausted.

184
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,249
Could we really be ended here today?

185
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,041
Let me claim your breath!

186
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,416
It's almost done!

187
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:36,790
Just some more joint
effort can make it completed!
