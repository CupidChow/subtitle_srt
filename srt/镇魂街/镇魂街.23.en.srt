1
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,915
Even if we make it into the Hall of Heroes

2
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,457
and find Cao Yanbing,

3
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,332
But it's just a few of us.

4
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,249
It can be hard for us to escape.

5
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,624
Luckily, you got calvary.

6
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,749
Tiger!

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,415
Hi! Xia Ling, it's been a long time, huh!

8
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,705
Wow! Right, it's been a
while. You've changed a lot!

9
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,124
Your involvement this time

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,749
can mean openly opposing Ghostdom.

11
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,915
It can be quite a price.

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,749
If it's for returning me the favor,

13
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,499
then that's way too much.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,749
You sure about that?

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,457
Whatever your decision is,

16
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,082
we appreciate it very much!

17
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,166
Since we're here,

18
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,582
it means we've thought everything through.

19
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,458
Zhantian,

20
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,207
they're Cao Yanbing's partners.

21
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm for friendship.

22
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,040
And you? What are you for?

23
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,124
Funny thing is, we're on opposing sides,

24
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,832
but not foes.

25
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,874
And the current situation

26
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,374
has already made us stuck together.

27
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,207
That's right!

28
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,749
Liu Yuchan will come to help, won't he?

29
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,582
Then just leave the most
important east gate to the guy!

30
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,790
What? What do you mean?

31
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,289
Are you saying Tiger's
weaker than Liu Yuchan?

32
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,249
Don't get me wrong!

33
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,082
It's all because the guy's special.

34
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,415
If we happen to meet Xiang Kunlun,

35
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,540
things may take a turn for the better.

36
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,707
Okay.

37
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,082
I'll tell Liu Yuchan.

38
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,332
Anyway, that was it.

39
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,499
Zhan Tian's team will smash
the four gates of the Hall,

40
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,999
clearing our way out,

41
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,790
and then come to aid us.

42
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,957
Outside the east gate is a
great river. I've got ready.

43
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,832
Everybody, gather around
there. Remember, be quick!

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,290
Be sure to retreat before
Xiang Kunlun comes back!

45
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,583
This rescue

46
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,582
fails with loss of anyone here.

47
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,790
Good luck to everyone!

48
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,999
The guardian spirit's power is palpable,

49
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,620
yet invisible.

50
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,017
Your spear technique can even
match the Human-Spirit Technique.

51
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,499
What's the real catch?

52
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,832
Guardian spirits and spirit
hosts battle in many ways.

53
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,124
The only elastic warfare strategy
is the hardest one to master.

54
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,457
My guardian spirit and I can
make flexible and unbreakable

55
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,290
attack-and-defense!

56
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,023
Wow, you really told it that easily?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,374
Where's your guardian spirit?

58
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,540
Not coming out yet?

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,415
He only wants to fight
with your guardian spirit.

60
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,832
Just let him out!

61
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,957
Tring to irritate me?

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,082
I won't make things go your way.

63
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,207
Never mind.

64
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,332
I have more than one way to
battle with guardian spirit.

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,082
Let me show you my battle ways!

66
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,415
She's changing the Armor's
form? Now's the time!

67
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,749
Good spear technique!

68
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,582
Crossbow boly?

69
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,158
A weapon with changeable forms

70
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,374
and battle-ways are rarely seen.

71
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:02,165
You do fight with surprising ways, but
once there's distance, it's no big deal.

72
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,665
Friendly reminder,

73
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,540
for the following attack,
trying your best is enough.

74
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,999
You dropped your weapon!

75
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,040
I've got spear.

76
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,923
How can things be settled
with it tucked away?

77
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,660
She can weave deftly through the
forest of spears, like a shadow.

78
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,781
It's really hard to land a hit.

79
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,124
Crap!

80
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,832
Your electric is so powerful!

81
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,124
I can't use my hands for now...

82
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,684
Then there's no need to battle anymore.

83
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,165
Shall we both leave?

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,040
I can still fight without using my hands!

85
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,457
Oh? Then let's try!

86
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,999
See how great my spear is!

87
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,624
How about joining my team?

88
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,957
Defeat me first!

89
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,374
Well then, if you insist...

90
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,707
Hair can help block thunder,

91
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,707
you're unable to stop me anymore!

92
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,457
You wanna change into gloves?

93
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,666
Perfect!

94
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,999
Some years later, with richer experience,

95
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,207
you should be able to deal with

96
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,790
any of my weapons.

97
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,290
So what?

98
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,415
I'm here to save someone.

99
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,915
I have no time for you.

100
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,665
I just used three weapons to restrain you.

101
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,332
Neither of us wins this time.

102
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,665
Next time, let's duel it
out with guardian spirits.

103
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,582
Why?

104
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:36,164
Why! Why! How can this
guy still not fall down!

105
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,999
Go die!

106
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,333
No retreating!

107
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,915
Or General Lv won't spare us!

108
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,540
Step aside! We'll handle this!!

109
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,957
What's the matter?! How
could this guy be here!

110
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,582
It's serpent? No, not right.

111
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,207
Get out of my way!

112
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,415
Another one here! Ice that guy!

113
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,749
Haha, right! Let's go for it together!

114
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,165
No need to waste time! Hahaha!

115
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,499
Who on earth is this guy?

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,457
It's truly exhausting.

117
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,707
But I just like this rude way!

118
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,790
The top warrior in Cao's side,

119
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,374
Dian Wei,

120
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,040
right?

121
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,665
Enemy!

122
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,583
Kill!

123
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,749
I'm not your enemy now.

124
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:20,290
Take your own weapon,
go protect your master!

125
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,915
Protect... m... master...

126
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,082
He looks not making any sense.

127
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,707
Did he come this far
solely to guard his master?

128
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:40,249
This can cost all his
spirits, making him fade!

129
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:48,330
Hey! Wake up, or you're
truly gonna die here!

130
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,665
As long as we get them blocked...

131
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,624
as long as master's safe...

132
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,874
I'd rather die!!!

133
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,330
Dian Wei...

134
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,832
Someone's calling me...

135
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,582
Come back!

136
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,250
It's master!

137
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,957
Master's calling me!

138
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,707
Shall we fight our way out, General Dian?

139
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,415
Killer-with-no-rival, Zhang Fei?

140
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,790
What?

141
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,082
I'm not the only killer-with-no-rival here.

142
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,249
It'll really be a pity if you die.

143
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,665
I can't be that easily killed!

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,624
I still have to guard master

145
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,374
and send him to the throne!

146
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:15,332
I... I must go back to his side!

147
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,415
I've long heard about the Twin Warlords.

148
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,874
Now Xu Chu's not here,

149
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:27,832
I can also be a good
partner for you, right?

150
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,707
Go away!

151
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,406
Your nightmare's daddy is here!

152
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,476
Don't ever think about getting through!

153
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,716
So great the "Five
Tiger Generals" truly are!

154
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,332
Cao Yanbing,

155
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,540
you're really lucky that
Liu Yuchan's not our enemy.

156
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,915
Yanbing has left the Hall
of Heroes from the east gate.

157
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,665
There's a river, with a forest across it.

158
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,415
Across the river can be
the place out of reach.

159
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,582
This kid truly made
some dependable friends!

160
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:06,165
But... what are you thinking
about? Scout Jail Guardian

161
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,290
You could have targeted us,

162
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,499
but the killing intent suddenly flashed by.

163
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,582
Why?

164
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,207
Kill me!

165
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:27,458
It's impossible for me to
be back to the Buddha's side.

166
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,624
That's your matter.

167
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,332
It's none of my business.

168
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,790
If you don't do it now,

169
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,999
once my strength returns,

170
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,707
I'll surely leave here,

171
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,665
and grind the guy's bones to ashes!

172
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,582
I'm totally free in mind.

173
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,832
No one can touch me!

174
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:59,457
I will, turn the world upside down!

175
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,332
Do it!

176
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,874
Wuxin's wish has been fulfilled.

177
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,874
Wuxin, you're here.

178
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,415
Is Yanbing doing well?

179
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,790
Please don't worry, master.

180
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I've

181
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,915
made Yanbing well-guarded.

182
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,332
Someone has stayed in the past,

183
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,040
because his lifeblood
shall become the ink of hope.

184
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,665
When someone falls down,

185
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,374
there will surely be
someone else rising up.

186
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,749
Those falling down became history,

187
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,040
and those rising up
will keep going forward.

188
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,040
Their legend
