1
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,748
Lv Bu

2
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,457
that's all you got!

3
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,874
Do not blaspheme, you miserable little worm.

4
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,540
Release the Netherlord's Force, and you're all dead men!

5
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,290
Lv Bu! The main hall is under attack!

6
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,749
Fall back now!

7
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,665
You gotta be kidding me.

8
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,540
Qin Qiong! Code Red!

9
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,374
Retreat now!

10
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,374
Looks like we have to end here.

11
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,082
Somebody's master is in trouble.

12
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,790
Look what you've done!

13
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,374
Qin Shubao,

14
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,749
you're rather good!

15
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,290
I know you're angry!

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,749
So am I!

17
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,790
But you need to fall back now!

18
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,165
I'll let you live for now!

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,540
You traitorous dog, running away again?

20
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,707
Call it what you want!

21
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,457
We haven't settled this yet.

22
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,790
Based on his last move,

23
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,374
how confident are you?

24
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,915
I don't know.

25
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,457
This main hall stands for everything we are.

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,582
It must not fall!

27
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,707
I know!

28
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,249
A deserter

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,915
can be punished.

30
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,707
But if we lose the main hall,

31
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,624
we lose everything.

32
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,665
The main hall's loss

33
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,124
must upset the constable

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,124
and our cause will be questioned!

35
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,957
Those troublemakers

36
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,415
are Dark Inferno deserters.

37
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,415
Even Lv Xiangong can't stop them.

38
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,124
Who the hell are they?

39
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,957
All the generals have rallied!

40
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,915
What now? Are we gonna fight?

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,749
The generals have turned back.

42
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,874
They'll make it out clean.

43
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,665
Let's move!

44
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,915
This pyre burns our ties to this place,

45
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,665
I also paid tribute to Xiaoxiao, Wuxin.

46
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,624
and lights the way for those we've lost.

47
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,457
Right.

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,665
They're not the real enemy.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,957
We still need to settle accounts with that person.

50
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,540
Ten years.

51
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,165
That bastard could be anywhere by now.

52
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,874
No one hides from me.

53
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,374
Huangfu Longdou,

54
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,999
enjoy your last sunrise!

55
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,124
Fengzha!

56
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,749
You good? Anybody hurt?

57
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,374
Minor delays.

58
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,290
Dispatched some pests along the way.

59
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,790
We got them out. Finally.

60
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,290
Too soon to tell.

61
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,332
Beiluo Shimen's not out yet.

62
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,290
Relax, that guy's a damn one-man army.

63
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,124
You mean this guy?

64
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,207
What happened to him?

65
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,665
This snoring sack of meat wasn't gonna walk himself out,

66
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,249
and every two-bit thug would've bagged him already!

67
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,832
Face it, I saved his sorry ass.

68
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:50,290
Yay you! Oh wow, amazing!

69
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,832
He controls that giant ape?

70
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,165
Damn impressive. We could use someone like him on our side.

71
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,290
Master Cao will never forgive you.

72
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,290
Perhaps we should trade you instead?

73
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,415
Piss off! You'd be first in the wish list!

74
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,457
Everyone's in. Let's roll.

75
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,707
Should we wait for Liu Yuchan?

76
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,290
Leave him.

77
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,790
He's got his own playbook.

78
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,240
There's one more.

79
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,665
Cao Yanbing.

80
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,249
Oh, you're awake.

81
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,707
Hold position.

82
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,160
Dian Wei is coming.

83
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,082
I just know.

84
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,957
Everybody moves!

85
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,749
Since when do you walk point?!

86
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,499
The master expects me!

87
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,490
Stand clear or be disintegrated!

88
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,082
Get your ass up!

89
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:37,582
Move! The gate is there.

90
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,665
These grunts actually like pain.

91
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,290
You old man!

92
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,457
General Dian Wei. It's been some time.

93
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,790
Does my master live?

94
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,915
Don't worry, general.

95
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,707
Cao's out.

96
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,457
Right now, he's waiting for you

97
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,290
to finish what you started.

98
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,957
Dian Wei,

99
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,249
come on!

100
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,124
I'll be waiting!

101
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,957
Back then, I was a sickly kid,

102
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,165
easy target,

103
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,249
and every asshole's punching bag.

104
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,700
Then one day, somebody beat the hell of them for me.

105
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,499
Run, now.

106
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,499
Everyone calls him the bad guy,

107
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,957
but I respect him.

108
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,790
Good people and bad people are never absolute.

109
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,082
Morality isn't as simple as people think.

110
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:22,374
Same wind carries petals and dust.

111
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,249
One breeds life,

112
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,207
the other buries life.

113
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,040
Only the result

114
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,165
tells their nature.

115
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,874
Walk away now.

116
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,040
I seek no blood from Xiang's ranks,

117
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,832
but you advance,

118
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,582
you die.

119
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,915
This man is Liu Yuchan?

120
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,540
He's King Xiang's brother!

121
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,582
What... what do we do now?

122
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,165
Do we hold for the King's call?

123
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,374
But the general's orders are clear:

124
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,457
Leave no survivors.

125
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,665
Kill him!

126
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,040
Kill anything that moves!

127
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,749
We are the Hall of Heroes!

128
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,374
The intruder die!

129
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,457
We are the military.

130
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,749
Act on orders only.

131
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,707
We hold until command says otherwise!

132
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,915
Move!

133
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,499
Won't change your mind.

134
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,540
But damn if I don't respect your discipline!

135
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,874
You bring an army.

136
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,374
I bring

137
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,624
my five guardian spirits!

138
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,457
Xiang Kunlun should be coming down.

139
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,332
Let's cross that river before it's too late.

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,915
If I were you, I'd wait too.

141
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,999
Guardians aren't just with us.

142
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,832
...they are partners.

143
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,165
Master, we go back in! We can still get our man!

144
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,290
I owe you all my life.

145
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,957
It must be paid off.

146
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,915
And I

147
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,415
trust Dian Wei!

148
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,957
We feel your grief.

149
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:32,870
But we missed the window.

150
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,457
No way he's going down before I do.

151
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,915
Dian Wei

152
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,374
has flesh of iron, blood of fire.

153
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,082
Stay away from my master.

154
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,915
Go, now.

155
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,665
Dian Wei

156
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,290
you're back!

157
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,457
Master has entrusted me with life.

158
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,990
And I will repay him with life and death.

159
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,290
Come home.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,749
It must be a long trip!

161
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:37,290
This I swear, Your blood won't lost in vain.

162
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,874
Hall of Heroes! Next time,

163
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,540
you'll have to pay!

164
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,915
How're you holding up?

165
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,915
Just a scratch. I've gone worse.

166
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,249
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

167
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,540
Who planted this goddamn rock? Just laugh it up!

168
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,457
Didn't expect to see you this banged up. You holding back or something?

169
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,290
Not this time.

170
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,874
The main hall.

171
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,707
Another minute

172
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,290
and the main hall would've been stardust.

173
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,124
You caught them yet?

174
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,249
We showed up and they were already gone.

175
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,540
The guards insist they didn't escape...

176
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,874
they just poof, snapped.

177
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,124
Impossible! They couldn't know about the tunnel!

178
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,957
The tunnel is known to ourselves. If not us...

179
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,749
There is only one possibility.

180
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,582
They are members of the previous generation.

181
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,707
They're fugitives from Dark Inferno.

182
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,332
Would it be...?

183
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,124
I guess so.

184
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,832
We couldn't go deeper in the Dark Inferno.

185
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,749
I wanted to see what was inside,

186
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,915
and the Scout Jail Guardian came down hard.

187
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,540
That bastard doesn't even go easy on his own.

188
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,999
Go ahead. Walk in like you own the place.

189
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,915
He won't be a problem anymore.

190
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:54,749
Oh? Guess not just me who got wrecked.

191
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,457
Luoqi, your hair?

192
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,165
Cut off by one of Cao's member.

193
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,665
She told me what it would cost to lose her hair.

194
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,749
Looks like Li Gucheng's still stuck up there on the tower.

195
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,999
Should we go get him?

196
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,457
It'll sort itself out.

197
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,915
Let's table that for now.

198
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,915
Here's what I'm thinking.

199
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:24,124
The constable has been locking up the old members

200
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,957
without us even knowing.

201
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,957
What if that's where we're headed too?

202
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,290
If the Ghostdom finds out, are we gonna take the fall for this?

203
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,790
Uh, duh. East Gate has sunk.

204
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,665
They say the whole army were wiped out by one man!

205
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,374
That man looks like...

206
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,457
...King Xiang.

207
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,957
Should we tell him?

208
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:09,957
Shush.

209
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,165
Lock down the city.

210
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,040
No one gets in or out. Effective immediately.

211
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,082
Aye.

212
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,874
Look what your brother's done!

213
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,415
Now how the hell are we gonna fix this?

214
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,874
Kill him if you want.

215
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,832
Liu is just an excuse.

216
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,582
It won't change the fact you let him get away.

217
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:50,040
Guess that's your best shot. General Lingyun.

218
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,874
I've had enough of your shit!

219
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,874
Let's settle this right here, right now!

220
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,249
Boss Lu, please endure for a moment.

221
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,915
Let me go!

222
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,874
When she goes nuclear, it ain't pretty.

223
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,790
I've been counting the days to wipe that smirk off your face.

224
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,790
What's the matter, huh? Come on!

225
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:06,832
Boss!
Come on! Xiang Kunlun.

226
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,457
Somebody help him!
Draw your steel if you've got the guts!

227
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,415
Aren't you very capable?

228
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,707
Look at you shaking.

229
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,665
Ooh, check Mr. Fancy Pants here!

230
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:22,457
I was the one who stood up for you when no one else would.

231
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,790
Funny how now you raise your hand against me.

232
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,290
Liu Yuchan, what is wrong with you?
