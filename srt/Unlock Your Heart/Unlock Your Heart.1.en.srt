00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,893
Hello

2
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:06,869
You once told me that people born in
March are often peculiar.

3
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,932
"Rockstar dies at the age of 27."

4
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:19,674
In this classroom, where everyone subconsciously believes

5
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,307
they'll die young anyway regardless,

6
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:30,869
I will live much longer than anyone else.

7
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,002
I have always thought it was the
foreboding that this disease would bring, but

8
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:54,229
Perhaps...

9
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:59,973
It's just because I was born in March...
Much later than anyone else.

10
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:42,836
Shindo?!

11
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,128
Shindo, can you hear me?

12
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,542
Juice...

13
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
What did you say?

14
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,661
Are you alright?

15
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,975
You should drink more.

16
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,115
I'm sorry.

17
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,099
I'm alright now.

18
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:09,396
Should I bring you to the infirmary?

19
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,521
Don't worry, I'm fine now!

20
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,365
Do you feel better?

21
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:58,834
Yes

22
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,631
Oh, can I ask you a favor?

23
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:02,779
Would you help me giving Nishimura an aid?

24
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:06,366
He tripped and fell. I was getting called just now.

25
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:08,834
Sorry, I'll leave it to you.

26
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:10,147
Yes

27
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:35,442
We will keep working on Masakazu Nakai's
"Extreme Awareness" that we started last week.

28
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:39,717
Page 103, second paragraph.

29
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:44,756
This too, "...the thing we should recall,..."
we have reached this part.

30
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,467
Do you remember?

31
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:51,436
I really like the third paragraph.

32
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:56,631
Alright, so... Nishimura?

33
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,335
Please read.

34
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,109
Yes

35
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,921
Nothing, without any knowledge of this universe,

36
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:19,067
Human's existence is capable of accomplishing
even the smallest things.

37
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,241
What humankind has accomplished,

38
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:25,342
These sole achievements could be
the greatest of the century.

39
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,178
No matter what mistakes has been made
during the five past millennials,

40
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,913
Comparing these to the stupefying
reality of our whole history,

41
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,913
It's like falling sick on the final day of a wonderful journey.

42
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,194
No matter how much we sniffle for a day,

43
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:47,866
We cannot hang our heads

44
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,796
..over the fact that we are snifflers.

45
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,843
The traces of these past victories,

46
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:57,749
Lie in every corner of our modern cities.

47
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,757
In every corner of our existences.

48
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,515
Thank you.

49
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:06,851
Let's see..

50
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:10,718
Then, to the last paragraph.

51
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,070
Sorry!

52
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,679
No, don't worry.

53
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,266
I'll do it.

54
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:17,445
"Tatoe".

55
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:18,750
Huh?

56
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,728
What a peculiar name.

57
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
Ah, yeah.

58
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,120
What does it mean?

59
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,820
I don't know.

60
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,296
Didn't you ask about it?

61
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,328
I didn't.

62
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,734
It's a good name.

63
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,008
Is that so?

64
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:52,680
At first, I thought the meaning was literal.

65
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,220
That means "example".

66
00:09:56,235 --> 00:10:00,102
But when I heard you reading.

67
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:03,969
I thought that maybe it was different.

68
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:06,210
Could it be any different?

69
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,414
Yeah, for example...

70
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,070
What was it?

71
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,181
Ah, it slipped my mind.

72
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,047
This is the first time someone
thinks that deeply about my name.

73
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,547
Thanks for taking the trash out.

74
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:30,753
Thank you too.

75
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:55,816
I'm here!

76
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,519
I haven't done any of these!

77
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,167
Let's go?

78
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:01,524
Yeah!

79
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,159
Ai, you are always in a hurry!

80
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,839
At least wake me up!

81
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,183
I tried, but you were deep asleep.

82
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:13,292
Did I snore?

83
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:14,918
Yeah!

84
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,417
For real?!

85
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:18,668
Just joking.

86
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,823
Should I give Tokyo a try?

87
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,181
Really?

88
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,159
You'll be miserable if you chase him
to Tokyo but don't end up dating.

89
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:39,620
But wouldn't it be great if we ended up dating?

90
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:42,277
I don't have a dream to pursue a collage degree,

91
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,066
and I'll end up working in a job I hate,
that'd be the end of me.

92
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,074
Like that'd be different if you come to Tokyo with no dream...

93
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,956
Ai, you should come with me.

94
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:01,051
Yo!

95
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,208
You're early!

96
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:03,301
Ah, yeah.

97
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,418
Yo!

98
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:08,809
Yo!

99
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,519
That's for you.

100
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:12,379
Thank you.

101
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:13,496
How nice.

102
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,973
Okay, talk to you later.

103
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:17,832
Dumbclass!

104
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:19,723
But I'm not a dumbass!

105
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:31,739
Eww.

106
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,145
What?

107
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:41,403
Wasn't that amazing?!

108
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,459
Wasn't it?!

109
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,617
Hey!

110
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:05,086
Yo.

111
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,672
Purikura? Show me!

112
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,192
Why?

113
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:11,826
Where were you?

114
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:15,076
Seems like those fellas from West High sneak into our school!

115
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
For what reason?

116
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,388
Those dumbasses!

117
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,037
And they asked if we wanted to tag along.

118
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,534
For what reason though?

119
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,159
Stealing answer sheets, maybe?

120
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,284
Let's go

121
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:26,440
Let's not.

122
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:27,425
Better not going, right?

123
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:28,425
We shouldn't.

124
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:29,167
I'm not going.

125
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,719
I'd like to go.

126
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:33,593
Seriously?

127
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:34,542
Let's go!

128
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,831
Stop it, what if we get caught?

129
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:37,815
I wanna go!

130
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,526
Okay, I'll let them know then.

131
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,104
- You're sure not going?
- Of course!

132
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,104
Hello?

133
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:44,034
Let's go!

134
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,503
Takeuchi and Kimura.

135
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:53,516
What did you just say? Can't hear it.

136
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:58,477
I'm sure!

137
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,553
There is no way that kind of thing exists!

138
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:01,607
I'm scared!

139
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,052
I'm looking forward to it.

140
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
Okay.

141
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,857
Let's go

142
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,641
Oh my god!

143
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,868
Ah, wait, wait!

144
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,868
Look at the road!

145
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,837
I am! Oh my god!

146
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Get this!

147
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:58,389
Nice!

148
00:14:58,819 --> 00:14:59,467
Hell yeah!

149
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:02,928
You good?

150
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:05,061
Miss, you good? Miss?

151
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:06,230
My underwear though

152
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:07,757
We can't see them!

153
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:21,743
Yeah!

154
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,243
Hey, was it the only window that was open?

155
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:26,439
Yeah, it's the only one.

156
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:43,993
Anyone here?

157
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,145
There you are.

158
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:50,971
Forgot something?

159
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,170
Did you manage to steal the answer sheet?

160
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,819
I didn't, the room is locked.

161
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:21,225
The corridor's door was unlocked, you know?

162
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,394
How did you get in here?

163
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,613
From that window.

164
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,574
After taking my shoes off, I opened it up.

165
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:34,522
Are you crazy? What if you fell?

166
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,343
I didn't.

167
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:45,908
I like you.

168
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:51,463
I know the entrance exam's coming up,
but be my girlfriend.

169
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,110
What made you fall for me?

170
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,084
How strong-willed you are.

171
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:02,578
What?

172
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm not that ego-centric.

173
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,944
But you are!

174
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:15,200
You shouldn't say this about a girl.

175
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,083
There are people at school who don't like you but,

176
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,168
I've always thought you were a nice person.

177
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:27,705
Do I have a bad reputation?

178
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:30,228
They're jealous.

179
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,666
Thank you.

180
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:36,046
I have feelings for someone else.

181
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:39,305
Mika?

182
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:45,624
I was so scared!

183
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,804
Aw, let's go back home.

184
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,796
We still haven't finished talking.

185
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,812
Tada, let's go back.

186
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:52,953
Let's.

187
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:59,061
Mika, why did you walk alone
when you're afraid of dark?

188
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,833
"To Tatoe, hello.

189
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,753
How was the university you visited?

190
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:25,694
You took a night bus for this and
I was afraid they didn't offer economy class.

191
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:30,985
I know you invited me but...
I'm sorry I couldn go with you.

192
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:35,071
Even when I feel fine,
my body won't keep up.

193
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:40,664
I should be fine if I take the Shinkansen though.

194
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:44,367
I can't wait to walk with you
around the cities of Tokyo.

195
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:50,437
The nights got colder, so please don't get sick.

196
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,435
I love how hardworking you are.

197
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:57,498
Miyuki"

198
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,578
Good morning

199
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:23,999
Sit!

200
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,045
Look!

201
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,248
I'll send that to your dad.

202
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:32,092
There's no way he could eat all of it.

203
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:33,725
Do you want a piece?

204
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:34,853
No, thank you.

205
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,804
Here.

206
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,132
Can you write something?

207
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,534
Done.

208
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,737
Only that?

209
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,666
I don't like how it smells!

210
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:26,086
We have the same nail shape!

211
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:27,946
Look!

212
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:31,412
Yeah.

213
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:44,550
Let's gather!

214
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,034
Where is Shindo?

215
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,417
I dunno.

216
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,917
Where is Shindo?

217
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,776
Miyuki quit.

218
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:52,784
Why?

219
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:57,180
I don't know.
Apparently she decided to quit.

220
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,288
Everyone, come here.

221
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,180
She is diabetic, right?

222
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:04,140
Not like that she is overweight or anything...

223
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:06,454
Are you friends with her?

224
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,271
Not really.

225
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:09,740
I know right.

226
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:28,786
Thank you.

227
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:53,694
Here.

228
00:28:53,772 --> 00:28:54,710
Thanks.

229
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:56,616
Here.

230
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:08,576
That's yours.

231
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,879
Thank you.

232
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,846
Ah, you got this?

233
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,455
Yeah, sort of.

234
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:17,643
Could you explain it to me?
When you have time.

235
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,463
Yeah, sure.

236
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,164
Thank you.

237
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,554
I understood 'til that point.

238
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:31,796
Right, then..

239
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:34,749
You put the value of sin to this formula.

240
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,601
Oh, this formula!

241
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:40,007
Up to this point, we need cosine value,

242
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:42,890
but since this has a condition

243
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,710
the answer will be 25/7.

244
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,742
That's how it was.

245
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,249
Yes.

246
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:52,427
That teacher is always making it tricky
on the question two from the last, don't they?

247
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,856
I thought the same.

248
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,576
They have a twisted mind.

249
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,294
Yeah.

250
00:29:57,427 --> 00:30:00,825
But I have the feeling they actually don't.

251
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:04,732
Did you get it?

252
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,969
Yes, thank you.

253
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:22,466
Ai...

254
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,769
Do you like someone?

255
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,622
What? I don't!

256
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Why?

257
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:31,427
Nothing...

258
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,376
If you do, tell me!

259
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:41,064
Of course I would!

260
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,958
"To Tatoe, hello.

261
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,856
A month has passed.
How do you feel at school?

262
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:31,521
We're in the same class, though.

263
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:35,229
Since we can't talk to each others at school,

264
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,332
I wrote this letter with the pen I got from you.

265
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:44,744
I really like how the ink looks like.

266
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:50,828
I'll come early to put the letter in your locker.

267
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,761
I'm really happy you seem to
have picked a hobby!

268
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:57,046
I 'll write to you again.

269
00:33:58,242 --> 00:33:59,242
Miyuki."

270
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,009
Miyuki!

271
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,500
Which one is good?

272
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:31,677
What?

273
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:32,904
The one still ongoing

274
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,579
Is there any good?

275
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,178
Yes.

276
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,365
Chainsaw Man is really interesting

277
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,702
Especially that demon...

278
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,775
Maybe you don't understand.

279
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,326
Really...

280
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,529
Do you feel any better?

281
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,974
Yes, don't worry.

282
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,633
You quit the club activities though?

283
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,745
Even though I finally could join.

284
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:03,171
Something came in the way..

285
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:06,175
Don't mind me, just take your insulin shot.

286
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:09,113
You used to do it in front of us, didn't you?

287
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:14,321
It sounds like I'm a suspicious person.

288
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:18,462
Diabetes has nothing to do with eating habits, right?

289
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,485
You know about it?

290
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,615
Some of my relatives have it too.

291
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,530
Hey...

292
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:34,889
How does it feel like?

293
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:36,933
I'd like to try one day.

294
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:39,996
Why?

295
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,058
I'm just curious.

296
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:43,582
No?

297
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,258
It's not that but..

298
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:49,277
You're healthy so why...

299
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,349
I'm just curious!

300
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:52,393
Does it hurt?

301
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,524
It doesn't hurt that much.

302
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:01,676
Did you eat lunch?

303
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:02,751
Yeah.

304
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:04,741
Okay.

305
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:10,545
I'll give you the lowest dose.

306
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:12,748
Is it fine to inject it anywhere?

307
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,035
Around the navel.

308
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,441
Keep going.

309
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,095
Push the button.

310
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:38,259
Just like this.

311
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:46,264
How do you feel?

312
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,350
Well...

313
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,319
I feel full.

314
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:53,436
What? It's not that kind of medicine!

315
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,301
I could press the button
without being too scared.

316
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,770
It must be like drinking water to you.

317
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:04,957
Yeah, sort of...

318
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,213
Tell me your LINE ID!

319
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:11,298
Yes.

320
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:25,744
How does it work?

321
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:27,064
You don't know?!

322
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,385
Here.

323
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,273
People usually don't buy movie pamphlet!

324
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:40,359
What?

325
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,116
Most of the time I always buy them.

326
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,679
Not that I often go to the cinema though.

327
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:45,438
Do you read that thing?

328
00:38:45,484 --> 00:38:47,164
Once the movie's over.

329
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,425
Is it here?

330
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,647
You're cute.

331
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,381
What... I'm not cute at all.

332
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,712
If that's the case you wouldn't've
received that offer to be part of the group.

333
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:14,017
No way...

334
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,150
You're much cuter.

335
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:20,103
Do you have a boyfriend?

336
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,369
You got one, right?

337
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,416
Tell me.

338
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:28,556
How about you?

339
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:29,310
I don't.

340
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:30,443
Really?

341
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:33,015
You're super popular so I thought...

342
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,584
Enough talking about me.

343
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:38,402
What kind of person are you dating?

344
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,245
Someone from school.

345
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,495
Really? Who?

346
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,850
Tatoe Nishimura.

347
00:39:57,014 --> 00:39:58,326
Is there anything wrong?

348
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:02,217
Nishimura? From our class?

349
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:04,470
Yes, I know...

350
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,187
Did you find one?

351
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,148
Not yet.

352
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:51,351
You're so good at singing.

353
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,406
Do you think so?

354
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:56,381
It's the first time i've been to karaoke with
someone else other than my family.

355
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:57,772
Seriously?

356
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:58,796
Yeah.

357
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:02,783
I don't really know nowadays songs though.

358
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:07,163
Judy and Mary? I like them!

359
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:08,635
Really?!

360
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,330
So...

361
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:32,848
Hey, about Nishimura..

362
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:35,097
We've been in the same class since our first year.

363
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,370
Were you dating back then?

364
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:39,855
You're bringing that back?

365
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:41,832
Of course!

366
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:47,371
We were going to the same cram school.

367
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,769
Ever since 9th grade..

368
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,883
Really! It's been a while then!

369
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:52,884
Nobody found out.

370
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,962
We're not talking at school so.

371
00:42:57,298 --> 00:42:59,806
We don't really hang out either...

372
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,470
Why?

373
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:08,139
Tatoe's parents don't really like the idea...

374
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:09,773
Your parents?

375
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:12,014
No, Tatoe's.

376
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,054
Why?

377
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:23,176
I see...

378
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:28,090
I bet you do dirty stuff together.

379
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:30,691
We don't!

380
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,744
Not even dirty jokes?! I'm sure you do!

381
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,861
We don't!

382
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:35,877
Seriously?!

383
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:37,783
It's the truth!

384
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,783
Can we change the subject?

385
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:58,259
Say, how far did you go?

386
00:43:58,815 --> 00:43:59,815
Nothing...

387
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:01,838
Not even kissing?

388
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:05,111
We held hands in the street though.

389
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:08,982
Dang, you're not into that kind of things?

390
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Well...

391
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,387
I do but..

392
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,332
Tatoe won't do anything.

393
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:18,832
Wow...

394
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:21,634
He cares about you.

395
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:29,154
If you haven't ever kissed Nishimura...

396
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:31,311
So, was it your first kiss then?

397
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:36,572
Oh that... Yes, it was.

398
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,953
Should we do it properly?

399
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:58,328
What?

400
00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:20,346
Hello?

401
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,839
Yes...

402
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:26,682
It's alright, thanks.

403
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:34,382
I'm going this way.

404
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:36,859
Thanks for today.

405
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:13,047
There are some drops in credit score..

406
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:16,205
But still safe for receiving recommendation.

407
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:17,219
Oh...

408
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:20,359
She also volunteered to be a
member of the festival committee,

409
00:46:20,422 --> 00:46:22,889
And does a lot for the class as well.

410
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Is that so?

411
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,318
Looks like she's taking things seriously.

412
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,161
In general, I think she should aim for better deal.

413
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:31,990
It's fine.

414
00:46:32,014 --> 00:46:34,577
It would be troubling if I couldn't
follow after joining.

415
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,578
What a serious girl!

416
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,829
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

417
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,692
Nice to meet you.

418
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,184
Hello.

419
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,528
Ah, here! For you.

420
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:15,575
The kamaboko I produce!

421
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:17,622
Here, here!

422
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:19,684
Is it alright?

423
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:20,989
Yes.

424
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:23,997
You two are very beautiful!

425
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:26,877
If you'll excuse me.

426
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:28,948
I'll be taking these!

427
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:33,143
Do you know him?

428
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:34,167
I don't.

429
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,567
How about a family restaurant?

430
00:47:54,927 --> 00:47:57,871
Well, I'll go back because I forgot something.

431
00:47:58,263 --> 00:47:59,520
What?

432
00:48:00,685 --> 00:48:02,864
I'll be downstairs!

433
00:48:15,214 --> 00:48:16,268
Thank you very much.

434
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,555
Well, playing around Tokyo is
going to be a real-world experience for you.

435
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:20,211
Yes...

436
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:24,945
I think this is a great thing to let
you do whatever you want for now (four years, at very least).

437
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:28,453
I've got plenty of experience
playing around myself too.

438
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:32,534
I told you to be wary of weird girls.

439
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:36,581
If he keeps going like this,
there won't be any problem.

440
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,831
But yeah?

441
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:41,480
You want to see your mum, don't you?

442
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:46,170
Seems like they've been in touch behind my back.

443
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:48,108
I don't.

444
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,918
Thanks for your work today!

445
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:10,908
Good job!

446
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:13,751
Now that you have gathered here,

447
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:16,486
Why don't we put our heart into a prayer,

448
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:19,033
be it for exam, or for love

449
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:20,517
even for world's peace!

450
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,892
Okay!

451
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:53,325
Hey.

452
00:49:54,419 --> 00:49:55,419
Say.

453
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:56,356
Yeah?

454
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,504
Can we go home?

455
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:01,325
But you're not done painting yet.

456
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:03,791
Nobody will come check on it.

457
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:05,892
But you've been painting it as whole!

458
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,900
That will make it look like it's the same color.

459
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,978
Why can't we paint it with similar color?

460
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:11,916
Got it.

461
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:14,049
I'll do the rest.

462
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:16,286
Will it be okay?

463
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:19,091
Nishimura..

464
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,606
You should go back home too.

465
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:23,435
Well...

466
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:25,396
Do you mind helping me?

467
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:29,661
I don't.

468
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,504
Really? Thank you.

469
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:37,090
Okay so... Thanks for today.

470
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,418
Sorry but we're counting on you.

471
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:40,832
Leaving you the rest!

472
00:50:41,528 --> 00:50:42,642
We did great.

473
00:50:46,955 --> 00:50:49,502
I'm sorry for making you stay here.

474
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:51,963
Don't worry, I kind of enjoy doing this.

475
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,525
Really? You're just trying to be nice.

476
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,874
I'm not. Let's continue.

477
00:50:56,906 --> 00:50:57,906
Yeah.

478
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:13,547
What?

479
00:51:32,818 --> 00:51:35,083
Ah, sorry!

480
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:38,699
Wait!

481
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:39,715
Let's leave!

482
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:42,535
They got away!

483
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:45,254
Please wait!

484
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:47,105
Oh, dang!

485
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:59,439
You know, Miyuki told me.

486
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:02,642
Excuse me?

487
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:05,041
She didn't tell you?

488
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:09,580
We've been getting along these days.

489
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:13,603
Is that so...

490
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:17,655
When I heard you two were dating.

491
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:20,007
I was so surprised.

492
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:27,804
Was it supposed to stay secret?

493
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:31,234
It's not much of a big deal

494
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,825
When she told me you were her boyfriend.

495
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:42,927
I was very surprised.

496
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,239
Because I've always had feelings for you.

497
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:57,830
Ever since we started high school
but I couldn't bring myself to talk to you.

498
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,279
I was happy to be
in the same class as you again.

499
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:20,304
I know I told you first..

500
00:53:20,578 --> 00:53:22,716
I'll definitely tell Miyuki.

501
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:25,966
Ah, I see.

502
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:52,315
Am I that bad?

503
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:00,802
I really like you though!

504
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:05,224
I feel like you're turning a blind eye.

505
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:07,818
What?

506
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:10,216
Sorry.

507
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,834
I'm sorry I don't get it.

508
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:18,280
I don't know how to put it into words...

509
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:21,225
It looks like you're lying.

510
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,569
That I like you?!

511
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:32,577
Not really... About who you are.

512
00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:37,939
I finally gathered courage and you're
being mean to me?!

513
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:40,111
I'm sorry.

514
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,818
Nishimura...

515
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,978
You hate people as much as you don't reject them.

516
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,365
And despite that hatred,
you take a good care of your woman.

517
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:15,740
I get why you like Miyuki.

518
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:19,013
She's kind, fragile and is in her own world.

519
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:23,737
Pretending that you belong in the same world
as her to overlook her for a sense of comfort.

520
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,136
Then why don't you two just curl up in your world forever?

521
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:31,515
To Tatoe, it's finally spring again.

522
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:37,552
I got worried because you seemed to
have lost weight last time.

523
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:43,607
You used to say that success is
the only way to prove yourself right.

524
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,604
You will definitely pass your exams.

525
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:50,995
The day you will be free from
your father will surely come.

526
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,573
I know you hate this city but...

527
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:58,448
I'm attached to it.

528
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:05,906
But I will follow you as soon as you decide to leave the city.

529
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,922
I'd like to stay with you forever."

530
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,673
Stop.

531
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:08,818
Ai, sorry but where's your motivation?

532
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:12,639
Sorry.

533
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,760
Do you mind changing position with Yukako?

534
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,723
We'll start again then.

535
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:38,197
Ai.

536
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:41,235
I came to see you!

537
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,243
You look like the goddess of cuteness.

538
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:46,288
This is still rehearsal, you know?

539
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:49,584
It's gonna be crowded when the performance
starts, so I came in advance.

540
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:51,413
Ah, yeah.

541
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:54,366
Have you seen my LINE message?

542
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:56,483
I'm sorry, which one?

543
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,948
The one saying I wanted to hang out again.

544
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:00,916
Are you busy?

545
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:02,948
Yeah, when?

546
00:59:03,636 --> 00:59:04,830
Anytime.

547
00:59:05,464 --> 00:59:06,940
How about...

548
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,916
Now?

549
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:11,222
What?

550
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:14,624
Okay, let's start.

551
00:59:48,227 --> 00:59:50,073
Hey, Kimura Ai!

552
00:59:50,527 --> 00:59:51,237
What?

553
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:53,151
Why are you asking?

554
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:58,487
Wait, wait, wait!

555
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:03,121
Here, for you.

556
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:04,606
I don't want it.

557
01:00:04,653 --> 01:00:06,692
Are you for real?

558
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:12,082
By the way, why do you stop coming to cram school?

559
01:00:12,106 --> 01:00:15,228
I don't have a reason to attend one anyway.

560
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:17,783
-You've got a recommendation, don't you?
- How do you know?

561
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,267
Where are you going?

562
01:00:24,908 --> 01:00:26,806
Are you alright?

563
01:00:29,937 --> 01:00:31,179
That was something...

564
01:01:03,823 --> 01:01:06,023
I guess you needed to talk to me?

565
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:09,702
Not really, why?

566
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:13,202
You looked like you had something in mind.

567
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:17,874
Well...

568
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,367
I do have one thing though.

569
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,497
I don't want things to be awkward between us...

570
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:30,512
You might know it but.

571
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:34,877
Ever since I got into high school, I never had
any friends...

572
01:01:35,745 --> 01:01:39,213
It was super nice to be able to
hang out with you...

573
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,174
I was thinking that maybe we could forget that...

574
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:45,440
And go back to be just friends.

575
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:49,617
Forget it?

576
01:01:50,797 --> 01:01:53,597
I really don't want to hear that from you.

577
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:56,258
I'm sorry.

578
01:01:57,602 --> 01:02:00,335
Do you have any idea how much I like you?

579
01:02:01,474 --> 01:02:02,294
What?

580
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:05,349
I thought you were just joking...

581
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:07,771
Joking?!

582
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,107
I was being all desperate and
you thought that it was a joke?

583
01:02:15,144 --> 01:02:17,151
What did Nishimura tell you?

584
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,307
What?

585
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,682
Ah, sorry...

586
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:27,672
I didn't tell Tatoe that we kissed.

587
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,204
Huh?

588
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:33,376
I'm sorry...

589
01:02:57,728 --> 01:02:59,259
Hum...

590
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,303
Do you want me to leave you alone?

591
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:10,624
Not really...

592
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:15,382
We finally became friends so I don't
really want to loose you now...

593
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,288
I've never considered you my friend though.

594
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:21,020
Because I've always had feelings for you.

595
01:03:25,825 --> 01:03:27,567
But..

596
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:29,707
You must find me disgusting.

597
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:35,017
Because you're a girl? No way!

598
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:38,455
But you only like boys, don't you?

599
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:42,111
Rather than liking men or women.

600
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,132
I just fall for people as they are.

601
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:46,230
In terms of physiology, though?

602
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:51,796
I don't really get it but I'm content with
the time we spent together,

603
01:03:51,836 --> 01:03:53,874
even when we're not touching each other...

604
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:58,337
You and Nishimura might be okay with that but...

605
01:03:59,638 --> 01:04:01,122
I'm different.

606
01:06:48,764 --> 01:06:51,365
If you want me to stop, say it.

607
01:07:16,322 --> 01:07:17,891
Don't worry.

608
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:20,540
I was like that for my first time too.

609
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:00,345
Miyuki?

610
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,126
You have someone over?

611
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:10,506
Yes! A friend!

612
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:17,014
Didn't we have sweets or something?

613
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:35,048
From school?

614
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,142
The girl I went to the cinema with.

615
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:42,241
Didn't we have plum-flavered jelly?

616
01:08:42,908 --> 01:08:45,275
You ate them all!

617
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:47,225
I didn't-!

618
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:49,155
You did!

619
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:50,436
When did I?

620
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:52,366
The day before yesterday...

621
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,733
Oh, I ate them all!

622
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:20,697
That's amazing.

623
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,528
The way you go
back to your daughter role after that.

624
01:09:25,713 --> 01:09:27,513
It's because I love my mum.

625
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:35,815
Can I sleep for a while?

626
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:37,549
Sure.

627
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:47,851
Sleepy?

628
01:09:48,398 --> 01:09:49,773
Yes.

629
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:53,679
I can't really sleep at night these days.

630
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,930
What are you going to do after graduation?

631
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:09,807
I guess I'll try to get a university...

632
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:12,338
Same.

633
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:14,407
Yes...

634
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,757
I'm not sure I want to keep going to school
for another four months...

635
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:23,656
Is that so?

636
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:26,666
Is there something you'd like to do?

637
01:10:27,508 --> 01:10:28,836
Not really.

638
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:32,247
But...

639
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:38,591
I would like to be useful to people.

640
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,340
What are you saying?

641
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:45,813
Which month were you born on?

642
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:48,876
March.

643
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:51,243
Oh...

644
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:54,723
Lots of people born in march are peculiar.

645
01:10:56,462 --> 01:11:00,149
I've the feeling a friend from
middle school who was peculiar too.

646
01:11:09,616 --> 01:11:10,616
Ai...

647
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,811
I'm a terrible person.

648
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:17,808
In middle school...

649
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:22,074
My blood sugar had not gone down,
even though I was already home.

650
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:26,457
I was very tired and hungry but...

651
01:11:27,403 --> 01:11:30,129
I went to the bathroom to lower it.

652
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:34,960
And then..

653
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:38,280
My mum opened the door.

654
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:45,452
She asked me if it was okay to take a bath
with such a blood sugar level.

655
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:49,636
Hearing it, I got unreasonably mad.

656
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:53,060
So I hit the bathroom's door using all my strength.

657
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:55,083
The glass shattered.

658
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:57,208
And my hand was covered in blood.

659
01:11:59,769 --> 01:12:03,721
My mum brought me to the hospital.

660
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:08,057
I thought I would get yelled at
when we got back home...

661
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:15,545
My father didn't say anything and cleaned the mess.

662
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:18,201
One minute left!

663
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:22,724
At that time, I made a decision.

664
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,853
I decided not to live for my sake but...

665
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:30,907
For the sake of someone I cared about.

666
01:12:33,736 --> 01:12:37,598
I've lived too much for myself.

667
01:12:51,374 --> 01:12:53,054
The test is over now.

668
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:01,463
Please gather the answer sheets from the back.

669
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:28,016
About the last test.

670
01:13:32,118 --> 01:13:34,227
Can you explain this?

671
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,993
I'm sorry.

672
01:13:38,587 --> 01:13:42,233
I didn't know what to write.

673
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:46,561
You were doing great last semester.

674
01:13:47,717 --> 01:13:48,717
Yes...

675
01:13:52,264 --> 01:13:54,386
Ah, Kimura!

676
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,149
Let's take a picture!

677
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,259
But I...

678
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:16,603
Doesn't look that flashy on presentation,

679
01:14:16,642 --> 01:14:18,746
but still, you've won an award after all.

680
01:14:18,794 --> 01:14:19,794
Here.

681
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,160
Nishimura, get in!

682
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:26,910
There.

683
01:14:26,926 --> 01:14:29,112
I didn't do anything though.

684
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:32,141
You two stayed late to finish it, didn't you?

685
01:14:32,165 --> 01:14:33,946
Right? Then go!

686
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:38,813
Please hold it together.

687
01:14:38,845 --> 01:14:42,204
Okay? Say Cheese!

688
01:14:43,735 --> 01:14:45,115
One more!

689
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:48,099
Cheese!

690
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:50,904
It looks like you just got a marriage certificate.

691
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:54,889
Any of you can keep the paper.

692
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:58,045
Seems like this will be kept here until spring.

693
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,652
It came out nice.

694
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,358
Yeah.

695
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,545
Do you want it?

696
01:15:16,616 --> 01:15:18,428
Besides, I left halfway through.

697
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:20,609
If you want it, you can have it.

698
01:15:22,015 --> 01:15:25,519
Is it okay? You worked super hard on it.

699
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,217
I'll take it then.

700
01:15:35,207 --> 01:15:36,569
You want it?

701
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,600
Yeah, as a souvenir.

702
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:51,239
Thank you.

703
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:41,565
Sorry, there's nobody here.

704
01:19:03,707 --> 01:19:04,987
Are you alright?

705
01:20:18,168 --> 01:20:19,918
Miyuki?

706
01:20:59,325 --> 01:21:01,246
What is it?

707
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:04,908
I had something to do here.

708
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,350
She won't come.

709
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,700
I was the one who sent you that message.

710
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:18,789
I see.

711
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,530
I had sex with Miyuki, you know?

712
01:21:29,226 --> 01:21:30,226
Twice.

713
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:33,106
She was very into it.

714
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,090
Did you hear me?

715
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,791
I did.

716
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,478
Do you think I'm lying?

717
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:49,377
No, you're telling the truth.

718
01:22:25,646 --> 01:22:27,622
Please be mine.

719
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,545
Put your clothes back on.

720
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,057
Go dress.

721
01:23:18,792 --> 01:23:21,354
I hate people like you!

722
01:23:22,925 --> 01:23:26,620
Aggressive, doing whatever they want.

723
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:30,761
Without thinking about hurting other people.

724
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:35,112
Stealing whatever they want.

725
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,930
Do you even know how
I felt when I found Miyuki?

726
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:54,261
I know!

727
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,410
Cause I've always watched you!

728
01:23:59,332 --> 01:24:01,207
Hate me all you want!

729
01:24:01,512 --> 01:24:04,503
If you can't be mine then please hate me

730
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:09,806
I can't bear being only your classmate!

731
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:17,619
Your simple gestures I caught in tranquility...

732
01:24:18,765 --> 01:24:21,327
and the words we exchanged from time to time...

733
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,577
That won't satisfy me!

734
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:31,622
Even in this moment,

735
01:24:31,693 --> 01:24:34,044
I'm happy I get to talk with you.

736
01:24:34,912 --> 01:24:37,622
I'm happy I could get closer to you.

737
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,107
Let me go.

738
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:43,791
I don't want to.

739
01:24:43,831 --> 01:24:45,306
I won't!

740
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:53,650
Please be mine!

741
01:24:56,931 --> 01:24:59,345
How could I be yours?

742
01:25:03,142 --> 01:25:04,415
Hold me.

743
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,431
And kiss me.

744
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:36,669
Satisfied?

745
01:25:41,893 --> 01:25:42,893
Yes...

746
01:25:46,268 --> 01:25:48,353
If you are then show me.

747
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:58,358
What a fake smile.

748
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,710
Much more hideous than your usual fake smile.

749
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,862
It's beyond compare.

750
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:07,862
Your eyes are dark.

751
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,955
That's the smile of someone who
only likes themselves.

752
01:26:13,893 --> 01:26:15,914
That would be nice if for once

753
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:18,704
For other people or for me..

754
01:26:20,212 --> 01:26:22,414
You could be true to yourself.

755
01:26:45,043 --> 01:26:46,933
When I woke up in the morning...

756
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:52,831
Even though this is not the season,
there was a mosquito in my room.

757
01:26:54,829 --> 01:26:57,229
I crushed one within my palms but...

758
01:26:58,189 --> 01:27:02,962
The mosquito didn't take any of my blood.

759
01:28:11,879 --> 01:28:12,879
Ai...

760
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:16,681
How was your day?

761
01:28:21,017 --> 01:28:22,377
Where did you go?

762
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:24,454
What did you eat?

763
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:27,054
Who did you talk to?

764
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:39,256
James I was originally Scotland's King.

765
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:41,762
However, he inherited the throne of England.

766
01:28:45,872 --> 01:28:49,668
England and Scotland.

767
01:28:49,762 --> 01:28:52,429
These two regions were brought together.

768
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,437
However...

769
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:55,999
James I.

770
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:00,382
Tatoe!

771
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:20,761
Thank you.

772
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:23,480
Also...

773
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:26,947
I brought this one on the way home.

774
01:29:28,191 --> 01:29:30,214
but there are a lot of them.

775
01:29:32,673 --> 01:29:34,353
Maybe a bit too much?

776
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:37,478
Please give me two of them then.

777
01:29:37,509 --> 01:29:38,509
Sure.

778
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:42,376
Thank you.

779
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:49,084
I might pass the test so.

780
01:29:50,257 --> 01:29:51,428
When I do.

781
01:29:51,476 --> 01:29:53,409
I'd like you to come with me.

782
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,140
Yes.

783
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:01,988
This royalist and parliamentary faction...

784
01:30:02,013 --> 01:30:06,707
The Puritan Revolution finally broke out
due to these two conflicts.

785
01:30:07,817 --> 01:30:12,806
But in a word, they were bound to be
factions despite being parliamentary.

786
01:30:14,244 --> 01:30:19,150
I think it could be easier for you to understand if
you compared it to the Japanese diet.

787
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,493
Kimura, wait!

788
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:25,007
Kimura!

789
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:43,926
Say, Ai?

790
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,926
This is really bad!

791
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:48,590
People found and are gossiping!

792
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:51,619
Right?

793
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,439
Well, yeah.

794
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:57,112
Are you okay?

795
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,856
What are you guys?

796
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,294
Dating? Sex friends?

797
01:31:07,216 --> 01:31:09,153
I don't even get what you're saying.

798
01:31:14,224 --> 01:31:15,694
If we were sex friends..

799
01:31:17,475 --> 01:31:19,342
Would you think it's stupid?

800
01:31:27,522 --> 01:31:29,121
I wouldn't.

801
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:34,036
Sorry.

802
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:29,984
Tatoe passed the entrance exam.

803
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:34,031
Is that so?

804
01:32:34,172 --> 01:32:35,172
Yes...

805
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:38,349
Wasn't it a rumor in the class?

806
01:32:40,091 --> 01:32:41,325
I don't really know.

807
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:43,294
I see...

808
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:51,541
I've been thinking of following him there.

809
01:32:52,987 --> 01:32:55,174
Have you passed an entrance exam too?

810
01:32:56,026 --> 01:32:57,026
I didn't.

811
01:32:58,081 --> 01:33:02,713
I passed one here but,
I only took the exam on behalf of my parents.

812
01:33:06,313 --> 01:33:12,867
I've always promised I would follow him as
soon as he is finally free from here.

813
01:33:17,529 --> 01:33:20,872
What's your plan there? Preparing for entrance exam next year?

814
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:25,974
What if he finds another girl, what will you do?

815
01:33:27,428 --> 01:33:29,544
I'll find a job I can do.

816
01:33:31,394 --> 01:33:32,434
If one day...

817
01:33:32,769 --> 01:33:35,276
Tatoe ever meets someone else...

818
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:37,250
I would understand.

819
01:33:45,962 --> 01:33:47,446
What a nice girl.

820
01:33:56,751 --> 01:33:58,352
Ai, wait!

821
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,391
Wait!

822
01:34:05,657 --> 01:34:06,868
What?

823
01:34:07,563 --> 01:34:09,008
Let's talk?

824
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:12,443
It's fine, forget about me.

825
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:15,185
There's no way I could.

826
01:34:18,373 --> 01:34:19,560
Besides..

827
01:34:19,866 --> 01:34:23,050
I want to talk to Tatoe about you!

828
01:34:23,863 --> 01:34:25,496
Why would you even?

829
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:27,949
It's fine, it was just a game.

830
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,090
It wasn't!

831
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,377
You know, I had feelings for Nishimura.

832
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:13,745
What?

833
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:17,265
I had feelings for Nishimura.

834
01:35:18,976 --> 01:35:22,062
I came into the classroom and read your letters...

835
01:35:22,469 --> 01:35:24,593
I found out about your relationship.

836
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:27,043
This is why I approached you.

837
01:35:30,263 --> 01:35:34,817
Nishimura rejected me when I confessed to him.

838
01:35:39,638 --> 01:35:41,487
Sorry for being a bitch to you.

839
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:45,354
So you don't have to tell him.

840
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:47,783
That would only hurt him if he knew.

841
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:53,127
You're such a nice girl,
you'll definitely find friends in Tokyo.

842
01:35:54,797 --> 01:35:57,765
I know it might be tough with your health conditions but...

843
01:35:57,797 --> 01:35:59,703
Please be safe.

844
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:09,797
You're scary.

845
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:12,820
I know I am.

846
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:13,860
Sorry.

847
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:16,086
I didn't mean it like this.

848
01:36:17,289 --> 01:36:19,390
That whole thing was a lie..

849
01:36:20,779 --> 01:36:24,036
About liking Nishimura?

850
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:26,380
Not that...

851
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:30,521
You haven't reflected on anything, have you?

852
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:34,440
What? Of course I did!

853
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:36,432
You didn't.

854
01:36:37,331 --> 01:36:38,698
Why?

855
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,737
The way you look at me.

856
01:36:43,175 --> 01:36:45,042
That dark deep gaze.

857
01:37:36,524 --> 01:37:38,670
Dad is having a drinking party tonight.

858
01:37:38,748 --> 01:37:40,357
We're having a hot pot though...

859
01:37:40,412 --> 01:37:43,622
I know right? If only he told me earlier...

860
01:37:43,647 --> 01:37:45,639
I love hot pots though.

861
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,607
Nice!

862
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:12,118
Tatoe passed the entrance test for
a university in Tokyo.

863
01:38:12,509 --> 01:38:15,696
Really? What a nice thing to hear!

864
01:38:16,236 --> 01:38:17,598
So...

865
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,319
I've been thinking of following him there.

866
01:38:24,234 --> 01:38:26,632
Let's talk about this when Dad comes back.

867
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:36,184
You still have a long way to go.

868
01:38:36,747 --> 01:38:38,817
But Sir...

869
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,200
Once a failure always a failure.

870
01:38:50,143 --> 01:38:52,815
Leaving the classroom in the middle of a lesson.

871
01:38:52,839 --> 01:38:55,039
Everyone around you is surprised.

872
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:58,771
You only think about yourself!

873
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:03,568
Kimura!

874
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,600
Hey!

875
01:39:08,437 --> 01:39:09,741
Kimura!

876
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,772
There!

877
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:18,451
Ai?

878
01:39:18,476 --> 01:39:19,756
What's going on?

879
01:40:18,104 --> 01:40:19,837
Let me go! I'm in a hurry.

880
01:40:20,885 --> 01:40:22,416
Where are you going?

881
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:27,462
There's some stuff going on at Tatoe's place..

882
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:30,117
His house? What happened?

883
01:40:30,648 --> 01:40:33,374
I think his father found out about everything.

884
01:40:33,836 --> 01:40:35,265
How?

885
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:38,152
Are you going to take this bus?

886
01:40:42,044 --> 01:40:44,161
Can I come with you?

887
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:04,846
Next stop is Ishigaki.

888
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,125
Ai...

889
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,410
Why are you coming with me?

890
01:42:23,259 --> 01:42:24,939
Are you Tatoe's friends?

891
01:42:37,366 --> 01:42:38,972
Please come in!

892
01:42:39,496 --> 01:42:40,152
Excuse me

893
01:42:40,168 --> 01:42:41,878
Here, here!

894
01:42:42,285 --> 01:42:43,777
It's cold outside, isn't it?

895
01:42:44,371 --> 01:42:45,081
Excus-

896
01:42:45,113 --> 01:42:47,027
You can come in!

897
01:43:11,069 --> 01:43:12,311
I'm sorry.

898
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:15,342
It's usually not that messy.

899
01:43:40,212 --> 01:43:41,212
Tatoe...

900
01:43:52,515 --> 01:43:53,515
Take a seat!

901
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:57,681
Here, take a seat!

902
01:44:09,384 --> 01:44:12,274
Please let Tatoe leave the house.

903
01:44:17,595 --> 01:44:18,907
Tatoe...

904
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:23,385
How smart of you to have passed that exam.

905
01:44:26,272 --> 01:44:27,787
You're just like your mother.

906
01:44:27,827 --> 01:44:30,427
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer...

907
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:34,464
Must've been tough.

908
01:44:37,582 --> 01:44:38,582
But, yeah?

909
01:44:41,621 --> 01:44:45,996
You understand nothing about life.

910
01:44:51,962 --> 01:44:54,296
This is why I'm not letting you go.

911
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:04,194
Please, try these!

912
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:06,342
Here, here!

913
01:45:21,067 --> 01:45:22,267
Soft, isn't it?

914
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:29,017
Texture is the most important thing to make
kamaboko good.

915
01:45:33,408 --> 01:45:35,845
Say, which one is it?

916
01:45:39,742 --> 01:45:40,742
Which one?

917
01:45:44,507 --> 01:45:47,241
That girl who wrote you the letters.

918
01:45:50,179 --> 01:45:53,684
To think you did that in secret... Disgusting.

919
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,832
Tatoe!

920
01:46:16,408 --> 01:46:20,684
The two of you are pitiful.

921
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:30,321
Hey, look at me!

922
01:46:48,157 --> 01:46:50,609
Why are you guys so dumb?

923
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:56,247
There's no point in studying hard to
get away from that guy.

924
01:46:57,553 --> 01:46:58,388
But..

925
01:46:58,428 --> 01:47:01,948
Do you really think he would accept
if you ever passed?

926
01:47:04,053 --> 01:47:05,576
I think the same.

927
01:47:17,136 --> 01:47:18,776
Tatoe...

928
01:47:22,743 --> 01:47:26,399
I know we've been dating for a long time but...

929
01:47:27,282 --> 01:47:29,579
There always was distance between us.

930
01:47:49,894 --> 01:47:51,449
How cold...

931
01:47:53,808 --> 01:47:55,628
Are you okay?

932
01:49:23,525 --> 01:49:24,884
Want one?

933
01:49:26,267 --> 01:49:27,267
Yes.

934
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:58,740
Here, write something for your father.

935
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:01,659
What's the occasion?

936
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:03,692
Nothing special.

937
01:50:20,205 --> 01:50:23,064
You only got the nail shape from me..

938
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:27,656
I could recognize you even if
your face disappeared.

939
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:17,659
You once said that I like Miyuki
because we share the same world.

940
01:52:20,261 --> 01:52:21,964
Did I?

941
01:52:22,425 --> 01:52:24,381
Some time ago, I guess.

942
01:52:25,879 --> 01:52:27,559
That wasn't the reason.

943
01:52:29,332 --> 01:52:30,372
Is that so...

944
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:36,301
I can't even remember.

945
01:52:37,473 --> 01:52:38,473
However...

946
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:42,157
I like her because she's not like me.

947
01:52:42,634 --> 01:52:47,626
Being with her sometimes makes me think that
I have to share her suffering.

948
01:52:50,103 --> 01:52:53,053
But I don't know for sure.

949
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:57,197
Coming at me for love advice is a bit...

950
01:53:04,288 --> 01:53:09,301
I could put my eyes out for your sake.

951
01:53:10,379 --> 01:53:13,660
S© please stay with me until I lose my eyesight.

952
01:53:17,854 --> 01:53:19,938
How about this?

953
01:53:19,963 --> 01:53:22,830
Will you finally fall in love with me?

954
01:53:31,398 --> 01:53:32,398
Will you?

955
01:53:36,023 --> 01:53:38,288
Please stop.

956
01:53:41,281 --> 01:53:42,881
You won't, will you?

957
01:53:44,034 --> 01:53:47,299
You don't have to worry about me then.

958
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:15,155
Here is the exit, then you'll be
in line according to your class.

959
01:54:15,178 --> 01:54:19,233
The upperclassmen will come from here,
and place a flower to your pocket.

960
01:54:20,632 --> 01:54:24,160
This will be assigned by attendance
number, so please be in line accordingly.

961
01:54:24,324 --> 01:54:26,675
It'll become a great mess, if we have you to choose

962
01:54:26,856 --> 01:54:30,965
..who you want to receive the flower from. That
will be yet another event you have afterward.

963
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,410
What's with those gloomy faces?

964
01:54:33,457 --> 01:54:35,657
Not that I have any other choice.

965
01:54:38,213 --> 01:54:41,212
Then, you will enter from here...

966
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,658
"Hello,

967
01:55:38,307 --> 01:55:42,624
You once told me that people born
in March are often peculiar.

968
01:55:44,656 --> 01:55:48,929
'Rockstar dies at the age of 27.'

969
01:55:49,741 --> 01:55:52,460
In this classroom, where everyone subconsciously believes...

970
01:55:52,484 --> 01:55:58,622
they'll die young anyway regardless...

971
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:03,801
I will live much longer than anyone else.

972
01:56:17,052 --> 01:56:20,254
The day I was born, my illness...

973
01:56:21,065 --> 01:56:24,861
They're both like wrinkles craved on my palm.

974
01:56:26,831 --> 01:56:30,713
Thank you for teaching me
how it feels like to be touched.

975
01:56:39,656 --> 01:56:41,632
Ai, who is selfish

976
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:43,648
and knows no patience...

977
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:47,208
If only you could be patient with me,

978
01:56:48,263 --> 01:56:51,372
Even if it's out of self-regard....

979
01:56:53,474 --> 01:56:55,154
Even for a split second.

980
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:58,091
If that means you're opening your heart to me...

981
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:07,174
I'll cherish that moment forever."

982
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:05,149
Let's sleep together again?
