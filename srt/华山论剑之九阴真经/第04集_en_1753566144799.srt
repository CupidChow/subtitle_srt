The Long Ballad

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 15

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Wow, fireworks!

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,000
So beautiful!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Slow down, Ruohua.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,400
Wow, beautiful!

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm here to take care of you.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I brought you a car of

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
fake fireworks

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and a pot of fireworks.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
I love you, dad!

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're getting older.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
May we, Ruohua,

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
have a long and happy life.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What color is that?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Blue.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And?

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yellow and red.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Long Ballad

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Long Ballad

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can feel that

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
your coldness

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
seems to be getting weaker.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I also feel

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that I'm completely fine.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's great.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
More importantly,

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you don't need to

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
urge me to practice the Heart-wrenching Technique

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and take the risk of being under the influence of the fire.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm relieved.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If so,

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
let's go to the beach.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's go out

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and leave the Peach Blossom Island.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dad,

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you're too tired.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The autumn weather on the island

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and the four seasons

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
are better than those outside.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go out and take a walk.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If it weren't for the wind,

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
we would still be in the land of Qilu.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
As long as it's possible,

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
take you to go through

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
every inch of this world

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and taste all the delicacies

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and see all the scenery.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Use everything

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and use nothing.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Chase everything

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and chase nothing.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Life is long.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's so good to have you.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your teacher and I

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
are going out.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When I'm not here,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
practice your skills.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Ling Feng.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Take care of them.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Master,

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to leave the island, too.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Leave the island?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What for?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What for?

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've learned martial arts.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want to go to the martial arts world.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're right.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We've learned martial arts from you.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a pity that we can't go to the martial arts world.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Master,

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
can you take us with you?

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, master.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In this way,

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
we can take care of you and your teacher.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No need.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Actually, when I was young,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was like you.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When I saw a mountain,

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I wanted to know

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what was behind it.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When I saw the sea,

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I wanted to know

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what was on the other side of the sea.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But when I really got there,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I found out

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that the sea was far away.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was afraid that I would be lost.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Actually, this is better.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But you won't believe

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
what I said.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're too young.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can't really

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
try something.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How can you be satisfied?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When you really get around,

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and go back to the starting point,

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I hope you can still find

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
your way to the next life.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Senior,

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
what do you mean?

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You don't understand.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Master promised you.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He asked you to go with him.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Really?

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Of course.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go back and practice.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Should I go or not?

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The End

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mother.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Father.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mother.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mother.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mother.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mother.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mother.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Lv Han.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll kill you!

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Husband! Husband! Husband!

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We took you to the capital.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You... You're a loser!

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Madam! Madam!

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mother!

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mother!

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Mother!

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mother!

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ruohua! Ruohua!

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Mother!

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mother! Mother!

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Stop!

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Father! Father!

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He's crazy!

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let go of me!

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is your most beloved baby.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Father!

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How can I let him kill her?

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll sell her to the lowest level of the palace.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let her live a life of misery.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're so stubborn!

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Father! Father!

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Father!

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Father!

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Father!

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Father!

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Father!

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Senior, why are you here?

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're really going to make a debut.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You dare not listen to me.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have to go.

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Where?

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have to go to the capital.

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll wait for you there.

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Revenge.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Have you ever thought about

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
what if you fail?

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Senior, don't be lazy.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can only live once in your life.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Instead of being stubborn,

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
why don't you give it a try?

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I won't even try to hit Nanqiang.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then hit him hard.

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll accompany you.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's go.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Come here.

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Come here.

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I won't let you.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Crying.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Does crying work?

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll let you get your memory back.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll let you run again.

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Go.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You really dare not.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You still torture women.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Mei Ruohua?

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're still alive?

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mei Ruohua is dead.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm Mei Chaofeng now.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What Chaofeng?

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Go to hell.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Take her down.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Senior, let me do it.

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Get down.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How many people have you hurt?

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm not a

191
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
hero.

192
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
He's not a hero either.

193
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
I didn't say that.

194
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Everyone says that.

195
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,020
They say he's the hero of the justice book.

196
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
That's right.

197
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Master Qiu is the hero of the justice book.

198
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
Don't say you don't dare to say it.

199
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
At least in our territory,

200
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
he's the second.

201
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,020
No one dares to go to the first.

202
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
Master.

203
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
Yunhai Villa is a wave of clouds.

204
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
For the heroes of the world,

205
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
the first step is to calculate the gold.

206
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
Qiu Yunhai is the master.

207
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,020
Yunhai Villa.

208
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
It's 50 miles away.

209
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
50 miles.

210
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Blue sugar and sweet potatoes.

211
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
Blue sugar and sweet potatoes.

212
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
Blue sugar and sweet potatoes.

213
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Bye.

214
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
There's a horse shop ahead.

215
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
We'll buy two horses and a bag of cloth.

216
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,020
It'll take more than an hour

217
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
to get to Yunhai Villa.

218
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020
Senior.

219
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
What's wrong?

220
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
You go and get some food.

221
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
I'll go to the horse shop.

222
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Let's split up.

223
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
You want to get rid of me

224
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
and go to Yunhai Villa alone?

225
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
I didn't expect

226
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,020
Qiu Yunhai would be so powerful now.

227
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
It's dangerous.

228
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
I don't want to get you involved.

229
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
I won't stop you.

230
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
But I can't let you go alone.

231
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Either you go with me

232
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
or I'll go with you.

233
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
I'll go with you.

234
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Let's go to the horse shop.

235
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Don't worry.

236
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
We'll kill Qiu Yunhai together.

237
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
You'll have a long life.

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
After you take revenge,

239
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
you have to go back to Peach Blossom Island with me.

240
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
You have to let Master...

241
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Senior.

242
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
Do we have to compete?

243
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Let's see who goes to Yunhai Villa first.

244
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
You chose the right person.

245
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
I can ride at six.

246
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
I can ride at nine.

247
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
No one in my family can beat me.

248
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
You're so good at riding.

249
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm not a good rider.

250
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
No one can beat me.

251
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Junior.

252
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Go.

253
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Junior.

254
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
What did you do to my horse?

255
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Master Qiu

256
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,020
was so good at riding the Meijia Village.

257
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
I admire him.

258
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
You've been developing

259
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,020
in this place for a few days.

260
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Master is very impressed

261
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
with your ability.

262
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
First, the door is passed on to me

263
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
and I have the power.

264
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Then, I'll have more people

265
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
to increase my power.

266
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Everything is given by the door.

267
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
How is it going to be

268
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
to help the people of the Jianghu

269
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
in the case of the Dragon Fall?

270
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Don't worry.

271
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I've been supporting the door

272
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
to connect with the people of the Jianghu

273
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
and the people of the Jianghu.

274
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
I've already informed the entire official field

275
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
and established reliable information.

276
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Good.

277
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Continue to gather people of the Jianghu

278
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
to collect information

279
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
and wait for the order from the door

280
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
to take action.

281
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Yes, I will obey your order.

282
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Qiu Yunhai.

283
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Get out of here.

284
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
It's you.

285
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
You're still alive.

286
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
I dare not die

287
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
without killing you.

288
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
You're the master of Dongxie.

289
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
You don't need to know

290
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
who will die.

291
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
I want you to see

292
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
who will die.

293
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
I won't lose

294
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
to you

295
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
even if you have to fight with me.

296
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
Hey.

297
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Look at your palm.

298
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
I can tell you

299
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
that the more you are poisoned,

300
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
the more you will die.

301
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
The deeper the poison is,

302
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
the faster you will die.

303
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
You're despicable.

304
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
You've never been in the Jianghu.

305
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
You don't have any experience.

306
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
Now you've cut your golden veins.

307
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
You're a useless person.

308
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,020
You're like a poor bug.

309
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
I can step on you with one foot.

310
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
Qiao Si.

312
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Go after them.

313
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
Everyone in the Mei family

314
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
must be killed.

315
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Yes.

316
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
Go.

317
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
Qiao Si.

318
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Senior.

319
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Qiao Si.

321
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
Don't be afraid.

322
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
I'll use the Jiu Hua Jade Pill

323
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
to cure the poison.

324
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
I was too reckless.

325
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,020
I made you take the risk with me.

326
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
You're afraid of getting me involved

327
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
and you'll get yourself into trouble.

328
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
But you think

329
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm afraid of getting you involved?

330
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Do you regret it?

331
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
He killed my whole family

332
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
and made me lose everything.

333
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I've been working hard

334
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
day and night

335
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
to

336
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
avenge my family.

337
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I lost everything.

338
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
But

339
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
I don't regret it.

340
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I won't give up.

341
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
Senior.

342
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
Qiu Yun He

343
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
killed my family.

344
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Now,

345
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
am I

346
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
a useless person?

347
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
I have limited medical skills.

348
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
But I'm sure I can do something.

349
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,020
Let's go.

350
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
I'll take you back to the village.

351
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Let's go.

352
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Yao Shi.

353
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Do you like

354
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
boys or girls?

355
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Do you want a boy

356
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
or a girl?

357
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I like both.

358
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
I want a little boy.

359
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
Why?

360
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Because

361
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
I want to see

362
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
you when you were a kid.

363
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
I want a little girl.

364
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Why?

365
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,020
Because I want to see

366
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
you when you were a kid.

367
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,020
What name do you want to give

368
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
to our child?

369
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I don't know.

370
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
What do you think?

371
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
If it's a boy,

372
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
I want to call him Chao Sheng.

373
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Chao Sheng?

374
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
What if it's a girl?

375
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
If it's a girl,

376
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
I hope he can be independent

377
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,020
and open-minded.

378
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
What about

379
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
we call him Rong Er?

380
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Rong Er?

381
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,020
Han Dan Fu Rong

382
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
is a good name.

383
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Yao Shi.

384
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
In the future,

385
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I want to sew clothes

386
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
for Rong Er.

387
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
I want to take him to the sunset

388
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
and play kite with him.

389
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
We have to make him

390
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
a delicious snack.

391
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Give him

392
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
all the dishes you can make.

393
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Come on.

394
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
Come on.

395
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
Come on.

396
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Come on.

397
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
It's fun.

398
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Zhou Botong,

399
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
I'll cut off my way

400
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
from your road.

401
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
It's none of your business.

402
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Why did you break into my mountain?

403
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
What are you?

404
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
How dare you speak like that?

405
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
You shoot the officials and rob the passersby.

406
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Today,

407
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
if I don't let you kneel down,

408
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
and kowtow to call me grandpa,

409
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
I won't call you Zhou Botong.

410
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Come on.

411
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Come on.

412
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Come on.

413
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Mr. Huang, who told you to shoot?

414
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
If I had to rely on you,

415
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,020
I would have won them.

416
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
How could I let them

417
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,020
call me grandpa?

418
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
If you like to shoot,

419
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
let's fight first.

420
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
What's wrong with you?

421
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
You're so domineering.

422
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I...

423
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
This skill doesn't suit you.

424
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
It will change your personality

425
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
and make you a demon.

426
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
This skill

427
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
is different from the previous skill.

428
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
You...

429
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
You must use

430
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
another skill to control it.

431
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
I...

432
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
I know what new skills

433
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
can control it.

434
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Do you want to know?

435
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
You.

436
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
What's wrong with your hand?

437
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
I...

438
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm hurt.

439
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
They hit you.

440
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
They hit me.

441
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
They hit me.

442
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
They hit me.

443
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
They hit me.

444
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,020
They hit me.

445
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
They...

446
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Their skills are below mine.

447
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,020
I got hurt

448
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
by peeing and mud a few days ago.

449
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Peeing and mud?

450
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,020
You don't pee and mud.

451
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,020
You don't mud.

452
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
To be honest,

453
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
the Nine Yin Manual

454
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
is the best way

455
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
to control the heart.

456
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
But I can't give it to you.

457
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,020
Who asked you to ask?

458
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
I can't give it to you

459
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
whether you want it or not.

460
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,020
I'm here

461
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
because my senior

462
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,020
asked me to hide

463
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
the nine Yin Manual.

464
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Where are the four grandchildren?

465
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
They ran away.

466
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
The wife you married

467
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,780
in the previous

468
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,020
Mountain of Paintings.

469
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
It's her, right?

470
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
So pretty.

471
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
Peach Blossom Island.

472
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,020
If I had your

473
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Soft-flavored Armor,

474
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I would have beaten them

475
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
to death

476
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
if I was afraid of their hidden weapons.

477
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
If they are really capable,

478
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
they are not

479
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
Brother Zhou's opponents.

480
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
If they are really capable,

481
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020
none of them are my opponents.

482
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Old devil, I'm busy.

483
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm leaving.

484
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Where are you going?

485
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
We are going to Peizhou.

486
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Not far from here,

487
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
there is a hotel in Hupan.

488
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
It's the best hotel in this place.

489
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
I'm staying here.

490
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
I'm going back to pack up.

491
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
I'm going to Yandang Mountain.

492
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
I'm busy for a few days.

493
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
If you are not in a hurry,

494
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
wait for me at the hotel.

495
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
I'll be back

496
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
and fight for you.

497
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Let's go.

498
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Master,

499
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
is Zhou Botong telling the truth?

500
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
Can the Nine Yin Manual

501
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
really control the heart?

502
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Maybe.

503
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
I don't care.

504
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Let's go to Hupan Inn.

505
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Let's go.

506
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
It's not fun.

507
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Nine Yin Manual.

508
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
I'm the best.

509
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Brother Zhou is so good.

510
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
How about

511
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
we make a bet?

512
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
What?

513
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Let's bet

514
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
who can solve the Nine Yin Manual

515
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
in half a moment.

516
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Half a moment?

517
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
What if I win?

518
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,020
There is a treasure in the whole world.

519
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
We don't have it in Peach Blossom Island.

520
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
It's all yours.

521
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
I'll take it.

522
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
I'll take it.

523
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
It's a soft armor.

524
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Do you want it?

525
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Yes.

526
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
If I win,

527
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I'll wear it

528
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
and beat it

529
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
outside the clothes.

530
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
I'll let all the heroes in the world know

531
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
that Peach Blossom Island

532
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
is in Zhou Botong's hands again.

533
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Let's start the game.

534
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Come on.

535
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Let's start.

536
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
What's the hurry?

537
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
I haven't finished yet.

538
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Come on.

539
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
If you lose,

540
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
what should I do?

541
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
I don't have a treasure

542
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
that is as good as the sword.

543
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
No need.

544
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
I'm like Brother Zhou.

545
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
I only like fresh things.

546
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
I heard that you have a manual

547
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
called Nine Yin Manual.

548
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
It's very good.

549
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
If I win,

550
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
why don't you lend it to me?

551
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
No.

552
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
I don't know martial arts.

553
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
I'm just curious.

554
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
I don't know the martial arts.

555
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
I'm sorry.

556
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
I'm just worried.

557
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
So Brother Zhou doesn't dare to compete.

558
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
Competing with martial arts.

559
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
You lost to my husband, Hou Yaoshi.

560
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,020
You're so smart.

561
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
You're afraid of his wife.

562
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Who's afraid?

563
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Then let's compete.

564
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm sure you'll win.

565
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Come on.

566
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
You say start.

567
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Let's start.

568
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
Don't peek.

569
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
You're cheating.

570
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
I lost.

571
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
I lost.

572
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
I lost.

573
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Look.

574
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Look.

575
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
Didn't you just look at me?

576
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
You should be faster.

577
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
If I didn't hurt my hand,

578
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
I would definitely win.

579
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Wait for me to say it.

580
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Let's compete again.

581
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Don't look at me this time, okay?

582
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm telling you.

583
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Don't look at me.

584
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
If my brother knows that

585
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
someone has seen my Jiuyin Manual,

586
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
he will be angry.

587
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
He will ignore me

588
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
and waste my martial arts.

589
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
What should I do?

590
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Come on.

591
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Brother Zhou.

592
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Are you fooled by Xiduo?

593
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
This book

594
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
doesn't look like Jiuyin Manual.

595
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
It looks like

596
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
a comb that doesn't need a fortune-teller.

597
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
I won't cheat you.

598
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
You and Mr. Huang

599
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
are so weird.

600
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
You're so stupid.

601
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
I played with this kind of book

602
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
when I was five years old.

603
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Children in Jiangnan

604
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
can recite all kinds of poems.

605
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
If you don't believe me,

606
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
I'll recite it for you.

607
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Go ahead.

608
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
The heaven knows that

609
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
death has a fish, but it can't be caught.

610
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
When the accident is necessary,

611
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
there is a fish in the fish.

612
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Its wings are thin, its face is proud,

613
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
its body is gone.

614
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
The heaven and earth are separated,

615
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
the shadow is thick,

616
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
the change is only seen,

617
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,020
the child is born, the child is born.

618
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Ask me which page you draw from it.

619
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
As long as you raise your head,

620
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
I will be able to recite it.

621
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
I can't forget

622
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,020
such a book

623
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
that I've read since I was a child.

624
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Here.

625
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,020
Recite.

626
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
The cause and the effect are in six,

627
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
how can it be said to be nine?

628
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
The Taiji is two,

629
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
the heaven and earth are different,

630
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,020
the heaven and earth are separated,

631
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,020
the child is born, the child is born.

632
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
The Taiji is two, the heaven and earth are different,

633
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
the nine-spirit crystal is broken.

634
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
My senior

635
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,020
used his last breath

636
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
to protect the crystal.

637
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
I didn't expect

638
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
it would still be broken.

639
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
Brother Zhou,

640
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
why did you destroy it?

641
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
What's the use of keeping it?

642
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
I'm going to the Western Regions

643
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,020
to get the real nine-spirit crystal back.

644
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Brother Zhou.

645
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Brother Zhou.

646
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
He,

647
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020
why did you come here?

648
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Are you okay?

649
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
This is the soft-cured nail polish.

650
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
I wanted to show it to Zhou Botong,

651
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
but I accidentally said something wrong.

652
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
He got angry and left.

653
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
He's just a child.

654
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
You don't have to care about him.

655
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
The key.

656
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
The familiar feeling is back.

657
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Am I sick again?

658
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
The key.

659
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
I'm fine.

660
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
I'm already fine.

661
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
The fire melt,

662
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
the needle,

663
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
and the brush.

664
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I'm not stupid.

665
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
I'm not stupid.

666
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
I'm not stupid.

667
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
I'm not stupid.

668
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
I'm not stupid.

669
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
I'm not stupid.

670
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
I'm not stupid.

671
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
I'm not stupid.

672
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,020
You knew it.

673
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
The fetus in your womb

674
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
is fighting with you for the foreign gas.

675
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
The food is cold.

676
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
In the future,

677
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,020
the illness will only get more and more frequent.

678
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
This child,

679
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
we can't keep it.

680
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
No.

681
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
God is so kind.

682
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
I actually have the chance to be a mother.

683
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I can't bear to leave.

684
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
The key.

685
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Didn't you say

686
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,020
you wanted a little girl like me?

687
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
Let's teach her how to read and write.

688
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,020
Let's play the kite with her on Peach Blossom Island.

689
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Or

690
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,020
it can be a little boy like you

691
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
who can teach her how to practice swordplay.

692
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
How nice.

693
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
If

694
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
we take another risk,

695
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
maybe

696
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
the father and the child can get through it.

697
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,020
If I don't keep this child,

698
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,020
I will regret it.

699
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Guizhou

700
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
is not going.

701
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Let's

702
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
go home.

703
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Master.

704
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Master.

705
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Master.

706
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
What's wrong with the maid?

707
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Her cold is back.

708
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,020
Mianfeng, go prepare the medicine.

709
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Lin Feng, prepare the charcoal.

710
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
Where is Chaofeng?

711
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

712
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

713
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

714
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

715
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

716
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,020
Where is Xuan Feng?

717
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
Second Brother and Third Sister

718
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
are gone.

719
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
How come?

720
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Since Master and Maid Li left,

721
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Senior Brother and Senior Sister have been gone.

722
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,020
We searched the whole Peach Blossom Island

723
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,020
but couldn't find them.

724
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
Get out.

725
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Who is it?

726
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,020
Master.

727
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Master.

728
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Senior Sister.

729
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Junior Sister.

730
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
Senior Sister.

731
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Master, please save Junior Sister.

732
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Please save Junior Sister.

733
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
Miao Shen,

734
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
I'm fine.

735
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Please save Chaofeng first.

736
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
Senior Brother,

737
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Maid's cold is back.

738
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
I'm fine.

739
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Please save Chaofeng first.

740
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
Let's go.

741
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Let's go.

742
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Master.

743
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Master.

744
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,020
Master.

745
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Master.

746
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Miao Shen,

747
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,020
are you okay?

748
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
I'm fine.

749
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
What about Chaofeng?

750
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,020
He's alive.

751
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
He's back.

752
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Rest well.

753
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I'm going to the Green-Hair Cave.

754
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,020
Master,

755
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
how is Junior Sister?

756
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Take her back.

757
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
Rest well.

758
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,020
The Green-Hair Cave

759
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,020
Green-Hair Cave

760
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Green-Hair Cave

761
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,020
Green-Hair Cave

762
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,020
Green-Hair Cave
