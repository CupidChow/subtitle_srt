00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Everyone,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it's time for us to cooperate.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Show your position

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and kill her.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Who will teach me the white-haired whip?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Miss,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
let me teach you the acupuncture.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're looking for death.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Little girl,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
let me, Liu Yun Fu,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
teach you the white-haired whip.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today, I, Chen Ying Chuan,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
will also kill the martial arts.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're full of moral integrity.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're actually greedy for falsehood.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll kill you.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Uncanny Counter

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Uncanny Counter.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's go together

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and kill this evil demon.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're small and heavy.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You deserve to be heroes.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Everyone deserves to be killed by the evil demon.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Kill them.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Uncanny Counter

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Uncanny Counter

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The Uncanny Counter

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Uncanny Counter

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Junior sister,

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
go find Xiu Yun Han

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and leave this to me.

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, be careful.

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Uncanny Counter

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The Uncanny Counter

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The Uncanny Counter

38
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're so arrogant.

39
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You want to be humiliated?

40
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is not my decision.

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hundreds of years have passed.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Chen family

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is no longer

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the Chen family

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
who has been the most powerful in the world.

46
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't you want this?

47
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll give you the power of the Chen family.

48
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
From now on, you're not going back to the Chen family.

49
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And the Chen family

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
can no longer be involved with us.

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The Chen family

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is no longer the Chen family.

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Chen family

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is no longer the Chen family.

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The Chen family

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is no longer the Chen family.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The Chen family

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is no longer the Chen family.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The Chen family

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is no longer the Chen family.

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The Chen family

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is no longer the Chen family.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The Chen family

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is no longer the Chen family.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The Chen family

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
is no longer the Chen family.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The Chen family

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is no longer the Chen family.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The Chen family

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is no longer the Chen family.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In the world of fighting,

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,280
��

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You think

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you'll get revenge

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
just by killing me?

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kill me.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's just the beginning that you hate me.

78
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,400
Demon Lord Qiu!

79
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,000
If no one wants to surrender,

80
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,400
we're here for a battle!

81
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,740
Let's go!

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,640
Go.

83
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Senior Disciple,

84
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
why are you here?

85
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,080
We were going to take Jinyan to the market

86
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,480
and go back to Peach Blossom Island together.

87
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
What happened to your legs?

88
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,760
Who hurt you?

89
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,600
You stabbed us

90
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
with our legs.

91
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,400
You used my poison to trick Master

92
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:41,840
and let that blood-stained

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Yi have a chance to survive.

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
How could this happen?

95
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,240
I didn't know it was you.

97
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,560
What's the point of saying sorry

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
so easily?

99
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,560
Because you two stole the scriptures,

100
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,720
I had to suffer a hard time

101
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
to save Master.

102
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,960
You're dead?

103
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,880
It's impossible.

104
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,480
It's impossible.

105
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
It's impossible.

106
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Senior Disciple,

107
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800
Shiniang is really dead.

108
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,280
You risked your life

109
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,680
to save our sect.

110
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,040
Are you worthy of Master and Shiniang?

111
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Shiniang,

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
Today,

115
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,520
I gave birth to the elder brother of Peach Blossom Island

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,280
to clear the sect's name.

117
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
Elder brother,

118
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
please kill me.

119
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,680
Elder brother,

120
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
I broke the formation of Qingyun Cave.

121
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,280
I stole the scriptures, too.

122
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,520
It has nothing to do with the sect.

123
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
Kill me if you want to.

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,240
But...

125
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,560
Elder brother.

126
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Elder brother.

127
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,040
Elder brother.

128
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,960
Elder brother.

129
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,480
Second brother, he's not your brother.

130
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Elder brother.

131
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
He's seriously injured.

132
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,840
If he doesn't get treated,

133
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm afraid...

134
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
But what can we do to save him?

135
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,160
Master's Wuchang Pill

136
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,320
is a healing medicine.

137
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
But I don't have it now.

138
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
Elder brother,

139
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880
I know I'm a sinner.

140
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,200
I deserve to die.

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,600
But second brother is seriously injured.

142
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,200
I can't help him.

143
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll take him back to Peach Blossom Island now.

144
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,120
I'll let you

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,960
take care of his injury.

146
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,800
Chen Xuan Feng,

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Mei Chaofeng,

148
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,960
you betrayed the sect

149
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,840
and forgot your kindness.

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,560
No matter how I punish you,

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,040
today,

152
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,760
we four brothers

153
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
will be cut off from your kindness.

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
We can't do anything about it.

155
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Put up bars and kill people around me!

156
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,200
Eldest brother.

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Eldest brother.

158
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,880
쉬 현재

159
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,160
Brother Qinglian, stay here for me for a while.

160
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll do it myself.

161
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,500
I won't be late anymore.

162
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,860
Okay, Okay.

163
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Senior Brother, wait for me here.

164
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
I'll go find Teacher now.

165
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I'll go with you to find Teacher.

166
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,860
No matter what the case is,

167
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,860
I'll be with you.

168
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,860
I'll go with you.

169
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,860
Teacher.

170
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
Teacher.

171
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Teacher.

172
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,860
Teacher.

173
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Teacher.

174
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Sorry.

175
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,860
It's all my fault.

176
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
You once told me

177
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
that in this world,

178
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,860
not only family and friends,

179
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Love.

180
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
I've found

181
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
the person

182
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
who can help me.

183
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Madam,

184
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
but to avenge myself,

185
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
I hurt so many people

186
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,860
who care about me

187
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
and love me.

188
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
If I could be the one

189
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
who can help me,

190
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
I wouldn't have stolen the wine and wine.

191
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
I've committed

192
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
a grave sin.

193
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Even if I die

194
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
in Master's hands,

195
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
I should do it.

196
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
But...

197
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
I want you to know

198
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
that I'm not the one

199
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
who can help you.

200
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
A person

201
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
wants to

202
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
have something

203
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,860
but he doesn't cherish it.

204
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Only when he understands

205
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
can he get back what he lost.

206
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
The person who loves you is gone.

207
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
It's not the longest.

208
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
The longest

209
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
is when you find

210
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
the person you love

211
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
will never come back.

212
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
It's like

213
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
there's a hole

214
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
in your heart.

215
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Listen.

216
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
The sun is bright

217
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
and the wind is warm.

218
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
But it's not enough.

219
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
The darkness

220
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
is cold.

221
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Go.

222
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Don't let me see you again.

223
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Don't let me see you again.

224
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Don't let me see you again.

225
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Did you see Master?

226
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Master

227
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
has been buried.

228
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Madam

229
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
I finally understand

230
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
that the mountain

231
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
is still the mountain.

232
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
If I can come back,

233
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
I hope

234
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
you'll never see me again.

235
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Master

236
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I met you.

237
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
You are the blood of my life.

238
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Master, I'll show you my sword.

239
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Master.

240
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Master.

241
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
It's them.

242
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Go.

243
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
What's next?

244
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't know.

245
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
All the time

246
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
I only think about revenge.

247
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
But I never thought

248
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
about what will happen after revenge.

249
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
Master said

250
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
he was a tired person.

251
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
A person who was absent-minded.

252
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
A person who didn't want to change like the moon.

253
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
But in fact

254
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
he has changed me completely.

255
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
They are there.

256
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
Yes.

257
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
In front of us.

258
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Go.

259
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
It's them.

260
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
Yes, it's them.

261
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Black Wind and Double Kill.

262
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
You dig a grave and use the corpse to make a mistake.

263
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Black Wind and Double Kill.

264
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
It's hard to tolerate.

265
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
Yes, it's them.

266
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
They killed our Master Qiu

267
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
in the mountain around the city.

268
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
Black Wind and Double Kill.

269
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
You seven teachers are all dead.

270
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
You killed the people of the righteous sect.

271
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Everyone in the world is killed.

272
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
I know you are badly injured.

273
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
We two brothers

274
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
are not the bad guys.

275
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
You can kill yourself.

276
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
It's you.

277
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
You are the righteous sect.

278
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
You are full of righteous morals.

279
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
But you can't even tell right from wrong.

280
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Today we Black Wind and Double Kill

281
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
will do justice for the heaven.

282
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
And send you back to your home.

283
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Nian Chu.

284
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
I am Flying Heaven Dragon, Ke Bixie.

285
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
And my brother, Flying Heaven Bathe, Ke Zhen'e.

286
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Today we brothers will take you back.

287
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
And kill you for the sake of the people.

288
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
The evil sect is out of line.

289
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
God will take care of us.

290
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
Kill them.

291
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Kill them.

292
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
Kill them.

293
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Kill them.

294
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Kill them.

295
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Kill them.

296
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Kill them.

297
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Kill them.

298
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Kill them.

299
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Kill them.

300
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Kill them.

301
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,860
Kill them.

302
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Kill them.

303
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Kill them.

304
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Kill them.

305
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Kill them.

306
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Kill them.

307
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
Kill them.

308
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Kill them.

309
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Kill them.

310
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Kill them.

311
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
Kill them.

312
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
Kill them.

313
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Kill them.

314
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Kill them.

315
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Kill them.

316
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Kill them.

317
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Kill them.

318
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Kill them.

319
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Kill them.

320
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Kill them.

321
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Kill them.

322
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Kill them.

323
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Kill them.

324
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
Kill them.

325
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Kill them.

326
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
Kill them.

327
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Kill them.

328
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Kill them.

329
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Kill them.

330
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Kill them.

331
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
Brother.

332
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
My baby.

333
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
My baby.

334
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Senior.

335
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
Are you okay?

336
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
I'll avenge you.

337
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
I'm sure

338
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,140
Senior.

339
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,820
Junior.

340
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,780
I'm fine.

341
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,620
He didn't come to my door.

342
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,060
Senior.

343
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,420
Let's go.

344
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,260
Where?

345
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,340
Leave here.

346
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,580
The farther the better.

347
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,660
Okay.

348
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
I like here.

349
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,420
The grasslands here

350
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,060
are like the sea.

351
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Then let's live here

352
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,860
for a lifetime.

353
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,780
No clue were the signs given to him.

354
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,820
Maybe that's a trick.

355
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,140
Or unbelievable.

356
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,020
You two need to leave.

357
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,140
Ipings can't go to Mo Ke's wedding.

358
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,300
Okay.

359
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,700
What do you think?

360
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,860
Who's your partner?

361
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,260
Stop it.

362
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,460
Give it to Mo Ke.

363
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,340
Molani?

364
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,060
Welcome!

365
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,100
Welcome!

366
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,900
Welcome!

367
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,340
Welcome!

368
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,340
Welcome!

369
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Welcome!

370
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
Welcome!

371
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Welcome!

372
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
Welcome!

373
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Welcome, friends from afar!

374
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Welcome!

375
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Welcome!

376
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Today is my wedding.

377
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
I am very happy that you are here.

378
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
With your blessings, we will be even happier.

379
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Miss, let's dance together.

380
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Come on.

381
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Miss, your dance is very good.

382
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
This hat is for you.

383
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
They said

384
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
this is a wedding dress for Qiu Qing.

385
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
They said this is a wedding dress for Qiu Qing.

386
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
They said this is a wedding dress for Qiu Qing.

387
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
This is a wedding dress for Qiu Qing.

388
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
I will give it to my lover.

389
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
If he is willing to marry me,

390
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
he will wear it.

391
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
Chen Xuan Feng,

392
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
will you wear the wedding dress I gave you?

393
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Thank you, my love.

394
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Heaven above and earth above

395
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
will be made the witnesses.

396
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
I, Chen Xuan Feng,

397
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
I, Mei Chao Feng,

398
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
will always love you,

399
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
forever.

400
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
We are a couple,

401
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
and we will live and die together.

402
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,340
We will never leave each other.

403
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
There are so many buildings

404
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,660
My heart aches

405
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,260
There are so many people

406
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:46,220
There are so many people

407
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,060
Qiao Feng,

408
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,380
is this a dream?

409
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,260
It hurts.

410
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,860
Why is there someone?

411
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,260
It's right that it hurts.

412
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,660
It proves that you're not dreaming.

413
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,300
Xuan Feng,

414
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,260
thank you for giving me a home.

415
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,780
My parents died.

416
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,980
I did something wrong again.

417
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,420
I lost my family on Peach Blossom Island.

418
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,380
I only have you.

419
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,500
You're enough for me.

420
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,460
From now on,

421
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,220
I'm your lover,

422
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,260
and also your family and friends.

423
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,980
We'll have a home,

424
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,940
and lots of children.

425
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,340
Then we'll have more family.

426
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,900
We'll be together forever,

427
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,060
and never be apart.

428
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,380
But I did so many wrong things,

429
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,500
and hurt so many people.

430
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,140
I'll get my retribution sooner or later.

431
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,780
Then I'll tell God

432
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,980
that if I want to punish,

433
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,820
I'll punish myself.

434
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,460
I'm willing to bear everything for you.

435
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,380
I can't live without you.

436
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,140
Cheng Feng, it's the fifteenth today.

437
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,660
Let's go to the mountain to enjoy the moon tonight.

438
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,580
Why hasn't he come yet?

439
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,660
I wonder if Guo Jing

440
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,420
has the courage to go to the mountain alone.

441
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,340
Second Brother,

442
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,740
although Jing'er

443
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,980
looks like a fool,

444
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
I can see that

445
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,100
he really wants to learn something.

446
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Qi Mei is right.

447
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,780
Let's wait and see.

448
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,860
What happened?

449
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,700
There are a bunch of skulls here.

450
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,780
There are five holes on each skull's head.

451
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,420
It's like a finger insert.

452
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,140
It's like a finger insert.

453
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,420
Are there three layers?

454
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,660
Five on the lower layer,

455
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,820
three on the middle layer,

456
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,980
and one on the upper layer?

457
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,020
Yes.

458
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,060
Brother, how do you know?

459
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,780
Hurry up.

460
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,620
Go to the northeast, northwest,

461
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,340
and look around.

462
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,260
See what else is there.

463
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,340
There's more here.

464
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,620
Brother, there's more here.

465
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
There's more here.

466
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,340
There's more here.

467
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,140
The old cause is the old cause.

468
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,020
Listen to me.

469
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,620
It's the time of life and death.

470
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,260
My eyes

471
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,180
are pierced by them.

472
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,300
Who are they?

473
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,500
Put this skull back

474
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,100
carefully.

475
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,300
Don't let them

476
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,220
see the traces of being moved.

477
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,700
Brother,

478
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,380
who are they?

479
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,100
It's me.

480
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,460
They

481
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,540
are Black Wind Be겠어요.

482
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,180
The Black Wind Be不好意思.

483
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,980
Yes.

484
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,980
In these years,

485
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,100
nobody has seen them.

486
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,020
All we know is

487
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,260
they've been dead

488
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,020
since they then.

489
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,700
What a surprise

490
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,940
these two men didn't die

491
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,860
and hid in this place

492
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,940
that's in a dire state.

493
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,460
How about this?

494
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,180
Brothers,

495
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,820
hurry and go fashion a emotional telegram

496
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,020
to the far south forget us

497
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,980
Wait for me for ten days after you eat out of the thousand miles.

498
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,580
If I don't come back in ten days,

499
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,060
you don't have to wait anymore.

500
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,220
Brother, what are you talking about?

501
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,460
We drank blood wine

502
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,140
and worked together to die together.

503
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,660
Now you want to drive us away?

504
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,340
We can't defeat the Seven Devils of Jiangnan.

505
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,900
We just have to leave seven lives.

506
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,260
How can we escape?

507
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,900
Yes, brother.

508
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,660
Yes, brother.

509
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,940
You don't know that

510
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,540
they are both very good at martial arts.

511
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Now they are trained to be the Nine Yin White Bone Palm.

512
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,220
We are not their opponents at all.

513
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
Why bother to stay here and die for nothing?

514
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,900
Brother, we should leave together.

515
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Yes, we should leave together.

516
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,220
No.

517
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,060
They have made me suffer all my life.

518
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,660
It's fine.

519
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,220
But I can't let them off.

520
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,420
Brother,

521
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,980
we have the blessing to share.

522
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,260
We should share it.

523
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,100
Yes, we should share it.

524
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Good.

525
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,980
Tonight,

526
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,620
we will kill the Black Wind and the Double Kill

527
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,820
for the martial arts.

528
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,940
Okay.

529
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,460
It is so powerful.

530
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,220
Why Don't I find where the twentai belongs?

531
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,320
Who are you?

532
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,980
Behind the back road!

533
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,060
Do your best!

534
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,340
Mo Fei.

535
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,900
Xu Feng.

536
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,540
Have you 140 years since the fight?

537
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,780
Have you ever?

538
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,200
has blood

539
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,240
capture

540
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,020
Candy

541
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,940
See him

542
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,540
You

543
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,000
Come to me

544
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,940
Go!

545
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,020
Chuan Feng.

546
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,100
Xuan Feng.

547
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,180
What happened to your eyes?

548
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,100
I can't see.

549
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
There's poison on the secret weapon.

550
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,580
Who hurt you?

551
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,580
Wu Ge.

552
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,980
Wu Ge.

553
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,580
Wu Ge.

554
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,380
It's you.

555
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,340
The batsman of the sky.

556
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,060
Yes.

557
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,380
It's me.

558
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,180
I'll pay for my brother's life.

559
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,700
You killed my brother.

560
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
I'll fight for you.

561
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,060
Let go of me.

562
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,300
Let go of me.

563
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,660
Let go of me.

564
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:30,280
Leading لي

565
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,240
The

566
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,840
Chang'an Prefecture.

567
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,360
Let's go.

568
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,200
Go!

569
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,920
Xiaofeng.

570
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,640
What's wrong?

571
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,720
Xiaofeng.

572
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,440
Xiaofeng.

573
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,540
construction.

574
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,640
Go.

575
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,920
They caused this.

576
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm going to kill them!

577
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,120
He's...

578
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,680
Xian Feng! Xian Feng!

579
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,520
Xian Feng!

581
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm sorry.

582
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm afraid

583
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,520
I have to break my promise.

584
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,840
Xian Feng.

585
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,680
I can't be with you anymore.

586
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,840
I don't want you to say that.

587
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,080
Zhao Feng.

588
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,640
Listen to me.

589
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,840
The one who took the iron barrier

590
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,160
was Fei Tian, the batsman.

591
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,640
I killed his brother

592
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,320
when I was young.

593
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,240
I want to help him.

594
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,160
I...

595
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,760
I don't want you

596
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,600
to spend the rest of your life

597
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,080
in the building.

598
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,360
It's all my fault.

599
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,400
If I hadn't asked the props to save Yichen Qing,

600
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,760
I wouldn't have met the batsman.

601
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
Zhao Feng.

602
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,880
Xian Feng.

603
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,280
Listen to me.

604
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,880
The second thing

605
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,400
is to save Yichen Qing.

606
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,840
Just put it on my chest.

607
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,640
You have to keep practicing.

608
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,320
From now on,

609
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,720
I will definitely

610
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,120
like you.

611
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,560
I don't want to save Yichen Qing.

612
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,880
I can't practice martial arts anymore.

613
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm sorry.

614
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,800
I want you to live.

615
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,240
Xian Feng.

616
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,000
Don't leave me.

617
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,120
I want you to live.

618
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,960
Zhao Feng.

619
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,200
Zhao Feng.

620
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,960
Zhao Feng.

621
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Zhao Feng.

622
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,280
Zhao Feng.

623
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
This is our second brother,

624
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,080
Chen Xian Feng.

625
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,240
There are thousands of beautiful things in the world.

626
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,200
Spring has flowers, autumn has moon.

627
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,160
Summer has cool breeze, winter has snow.

628
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,600
If you only care about practicing martial arts

629
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,240
and neglect the beautiful scenery,

630
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,640
you won't be able to thank me.

631
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm sorry.

633
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
I'm sorry.

634
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm sorry.

635
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
I'm sorry.

636
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm sorry.

637
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm sorry.

638
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,200
orada

639
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,520
Chen Hao Si,

640
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,480
are you afraid you will precisely reflect on

641
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,000
your true thoughts?

642
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,800
I'm afraid

643
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,520
that I will end

644
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,160
Then I'll tell God

645
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,360
if I want to punish,

646
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,800
I'll punish myself.

647
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,320
I'm willing to bear everything for you.

648
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,040
I'm Chen Quan Feng.

649
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,200
I'm Mei Chang Feng.

650
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,600
I love you with all my heart.

651
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,120
I'll never leave you.

652
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,720
I'll never leave you

653
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,240
even if I have to die.

654
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,880
I'll never leave you.

655
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,360
I'll never leave you

656
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,160
even if I have to die.

657
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,280
The series of protagonists

658
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,440
has ended.

659
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,040
Please tell me

660
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,920
that you love me again.

661
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,240
I may have read your letter,

662
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,280
but I merely listened to it.

663
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,720
I'm beautiful, I'm not black

664
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,240
I give myself to you

665
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,680
Time to go back

666
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,680
You are me, I'm willing

667
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,640
The road ahead is my obsession

668
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,520
You are me, I can't cross the mountain pass

669
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,880
Even if the world is wrong

670
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,240
Please forgive me, I can't escape

671
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,240
I don't want to escape, but I have to leave you
