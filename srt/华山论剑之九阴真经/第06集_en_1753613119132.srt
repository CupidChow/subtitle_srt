Left, right, right, left, right, left, right.

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,920
The main key of the martial arts is the wine and the medicine.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,120
Brother, are you okay?

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
Master's formation is so powerful.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,160
But we don't have much time.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
I'll figure it out.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,080

Master.

26
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600

What's wrong?

33
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
Someone put the sleeping pill in the wine.

34
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,640
Madam.

35
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Madam is fine.

36
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
She was just given sleeping pills.

37
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
Help Madam to go back to her room and rest.

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes.

41
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,640
If anything happens,

42
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,960
I'll be killed by the wind before I faint.

43
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
Send Madam back to her room.

44
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,920
Master.

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
Ning Feng.

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
Take them

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,720
to help you two get out of here.

48
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
Senior brother.

49
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,800
I gave the sleeping pill to senior sister.

50
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
What do you mean?

51
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,280
You mean the sleeping pill

52
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
was given by sister.

53
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,160
Impossible.

54
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,640
I don't know.

55
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,520
Senior sister can't do such a thing.

56
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
Now

57
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,360
we have to find Xuan Feng

58
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
and Chao Feng quickly.

59
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
N Nadu

60
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
Just relax.

61
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Why diligently.

62
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
G siguiente.

63
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,520

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Senior.

66
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Did you find them?

67
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
I looked for them everywhere on Taobao.

68
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Master said she would take Shun Mei

69
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,480
to the Three Stars.

70
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Why is the broken map in your hand?

71
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
I already gave it to Shijie.

72
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,080
Let's go.

73
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,280
Aunt Hong.

74
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,760
I've been feeling uneasy

75
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
since just now.

76
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
I feel something big is about to happen.

77
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
Let's go and have a look.

78
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
The map you gave me

79
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,440
and the medicine you gave me

80
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,120
were all sent to me.

81
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
How can we explain it to Master?

82
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Master.

83
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,160
Master.

84
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,880
What?

85
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Master.

86
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Master.

87
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
Master.

88
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,200
Master.

89
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Master.

90
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
Master.

91
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Master.

92
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Master.

93
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Master.

94
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Master.

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Master.

96
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Master.

97
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Master.

98
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Master.

99
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Master.

100
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Master.

101
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Master.

102
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,560
Xue Qingyi.

103
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
Honggu, what are you doing?

104
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Xue Qingyi.

105
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,960
You're not dead.

106
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm not only alive,

107
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
but I also saw

108
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
the two thieves on Peach Blossom Island.

109
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Let her go.

110
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Honggu is controlled.

111
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Huo Xiaoshi.

112
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Your disciples ruined my plan.

113
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
It's time to make it up to them.

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Let her go.

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Let her go.

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
You ruined my efforts.

117
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I want you to see

118
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
how it feels like to kill yourself.

119
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Why is the map in your hand?

120
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I've already given it to Senior.

121
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,560
Let's go.

122
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Let's go.

123
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Yao Shi.

124
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Get up.

125
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Huang Yao Shi.

126
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Kill your wife now.

from Heng Shuang Water Чем Фитнклз.

128
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,580
Besides...

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,860
if I've never read them.

140
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,860
You can've read them for sure.

141
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,520

You barely come running

149
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
to force your Education seeking

150
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,260
Brandon

151
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,860
Aren't you afraid of being possessed by the devil?

152
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,060
What's the difference?

153
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
Master.

154
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
You killed Feng Yaoshi.

155
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,460
Master.

156
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,260
Master.

157
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Master.

158
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Master.

159
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Master.

160
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,260
You treat them as your disciples.

161
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,460
You don't want to hurt them.

162
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,260
Do they treat you as their master?

163
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,260
They joined hands with Mei Chao Feng

164
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,860
and stole the Nine Yin Manual.

165
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,260
They are afraid of you.

166
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,460
They are afraid that you will be punished for your misdeeds.

167
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,260
They chose to join hands with me

168
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,860
and let me go to the Taoist School

169
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,860
just to kill you.

170
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,460
No matter how good your martial arts are,

171
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,860
I still ended up

172
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
in a state of being abandoned by the public.

173
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Huang Yaoshi,

174
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
you are so smart.

175
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,860
It's impossible that you don't know.

176
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,460
The secret medicine in the nine-ingredient

177
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,260
and the ship that broke the map

178
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,060
are all given to Mei Chao Feng by your good disciple.

179
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
They have betrayed us.

180
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,060
They want to harm you

181
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,660
and your wife.

182
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
They want to harm the child in her womb.

183
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Yaoshi.

184
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Huang Yaoshi,

185
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,860
they betrayed you.

186
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
They shouldn't have been alive.

187
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,860
No.

188
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,260
Kill them.

189
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,060
No.

190
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,460
No.

191
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,660
Ha ha ha.

192
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,860
What about martial arts in the world?

193
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Yaoshi.

194
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,460
What about martial arts in the world?

195
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Ha ha ha.

196
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,260
In the end,

197
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,840
I will take the器 and be blated by my sister!

198
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,280
That button...

199
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,460
That button.

200
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,380
Bow trench to death

201
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,020
I...

202
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,860
Don't kill me. Please spare me.

203
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,580
I'll give you the antidote.

204
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,340
I'll give you the antidote.

205
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,540
Please spare me.

206
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,540
I'll give you the antidote.

207
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,020
I...

208
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,860
Sir.

209
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,820
Sir.

210
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,820
Sir.

211
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Your 130,000 taels was kingdom,

212
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,860
How could he break it?

213
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,780
It was聽我說的,

214
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
tämä.

215
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,580
It isn't true.

216
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,900
It wasn't true.

217
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,060
How could he do so?

218
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,420
He was the hero!

219
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,580
I...

220
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,540
He was the hero!!

221
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Master.

222
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Master.

223
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Master.

224
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Master.

225
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Senior.

226
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
It hurts.

227
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I didn't expect

228
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,580
the Qixing Powder could control people's heart in a short time.

229
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Luckily, Xue Qingyi is dead.

230
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
If the Qixing Powder were to flow out,

231
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,580
the emperor would cause a

232
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
great disaster.

233
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
As a senior,

234
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
I dare to hurt my master.

235
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
How can I live in this world with shame?

236
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Senior.

237
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
Let me go.

238
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Senior.

239
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Senior.

240
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
It's not your fault.

241
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
It's not your fault.

242
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
It's not your fault.

243
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
It's all because of Mei Chengfeng.

244
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
He was lucky

245
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
to have put the secret medicine

246
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
into his house

247
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,580
and stole the Qiong Yun Manual

248
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,580
from Master's house.

249
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
He let Xue Qingyi

250
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
into the Peach Blossom Island

251
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
and killed Master here.

252
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
It's all because of Mei Chengfeng.

253
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
It's all because of Mei Chengfeng.

254
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Youshi.

255
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Madam.

256
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
How is Youshi?

257
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Master is taking care of the children.

258
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
What about the children?

259
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
They are safe.

260
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Master.

261
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
Madam is stable.

262
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Lin Feng and the others...

263
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
This time,

264
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,580
it's all because of Mei Chengfeng.

265
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Although the others have help,

266
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
they are not on their own.

267
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
How about

268
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
we just let them go

269
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
and let them go?

270
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
Yes.

271
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
Let them

272
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
leave the Peach Blossom Island.

273
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Hongguo.

274
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Master.

275
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
How are Master and Shiniang?

276
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
They are stable now.

277
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Madam is worried about you.

278
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
She asked me to come and see you.

279
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Hongguo.

280
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Master...

281
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Will Master

282
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,580
kill us?

283
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Master.

284
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
Master.

285
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,580
Will Master kill us?

286
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
All along,

287
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
she has been forcing her mind

288
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
to use the Heart-Glowing Technique

289
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
to save her life.

290
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
When she fell from the cliff,

291
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,580
her bone was broken.

292
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,580
The Yin Wheel Pill saved her life.

293
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
After taking it,

294
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
she could only live for one or two years.

295
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
But she could only live for three or five years.

296
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
But after taking it,

297
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
it's been so many years.

298
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
She tried so hard

299
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,580
to use the Heart-Glowing Technique

300
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
to heal Master.

301
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Unexpectedly,

302
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,580
Mei Chengfeng and Chen Xuanfeng

303
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,580
stole the two traitors.

304
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Master has been

305
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
trying to find a way

306
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
to cure her for so many days.

307
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
What else

308
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
can we do now?

309
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
You're injured.

310
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
You need to recover first.

311
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Now you're in such a state of panic.

312
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
I really can't take care of you.

313
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
How about

314
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
you go back to the road

315
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
and recover first?

316
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I'll talk about

317
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
the future

318
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
later.

319
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
I have an uncle

320
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,580
who is in the 72nd Station of Taihu.

321
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
I can go to his place.

322
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
I'd better go back to my home.

323
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
My parents died there.

324
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
The uncles in the army

325
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
should take me in.

326
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Xiaomengfeng,

327
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
where are you going?

328
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,580
I don't know.

329
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Then come with me.

330
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Although my father is dead,

331
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
he has been poor for his whole life.

332
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
The people he helped

333
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
should take us in.

334
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
We must heal our wounds

335
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
and go back to Taohua Island soon.

336
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Senior,

337
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
you mean

338
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
we can come back?

339
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Sir, please have a seat.

340
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Waiter, I'd like a bun.

341
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Okay, please wait a moment.

342
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,580
I don't know how Taohua Island is

343
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,580
now.

344
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Don't worry.

345
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
When your wound recovers

346
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
and you report the grudge,

347
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
we'll go back to apologize

348
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
to our masters and brothers.

349
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,580
I hope General Zhang, who was punished this time,

350
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
can be free and free.

351
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
General Zhang is a man of the mind.

352
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
He can definitely recover He Shan.

353
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
This time, General Zhang

354
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
is ready to fight.

355
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Your bun.

356
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
General Zhang is really moving

357
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
for the safety of the people.

358
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
Please.

359
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Here are the orders from the gate.

360
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
You must gather the local martial arts forces

361
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
and eliminate the martial arts people

362
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
and participate in the Northern Punishment.

363
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
I understand.

364
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Although the Northern Punishment

365
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
is a big deal,

366
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
it's hard to make it happen.

367
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
Please tell the gatekeeper

368
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
that at least the relevant people

369
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
in the local area

370
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
are under the control of Yunhai Villa.

371
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Okay.

372
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
By the way,

373
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
the second son of Chen family will come in a few days.

374
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Please take care of him for me.

375
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Don't worry.

376
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
Chief,

377
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
our spy

378
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
found the traces of Mei Chaofeng.

379
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
He's coming to kill him.

380
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Mei Chaofeng?

381
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
Mei Ruohua.

382
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
He was beaten to the bone.

383
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Why is he still alive?

384
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
Not only is he alive,

385
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
but he's also acting as usual.

386
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Could it be that I didn't do it right?

387
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
I'm afraid that

388
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
he's not the only one who's alive.

389
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Could it be that I didn't do it right?

390
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
You're successful.

391
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
You're powerful.

392
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
Maybe it's because Mei Chaofeng

393
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
got help from Gao Ran.

394
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
He must have come for me this time.

395
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
We can't let him ruin our plan.

396
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
We can't let him ruin our plan.

397
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,580
How about...

398
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
It's not easy to kill him now.

399
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,580
How about this?

400
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,580
In the name of Yunhai Villa,

401
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,580
send out a reward order

402
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
that Mei Chaofeng broke into the villa

403
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
and killed people to take the treasure.

404
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Whoever can take it will get a reward of 100 taels.

405
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Yes.

406
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Let's go.

407
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Go.

408
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
There's such a good room.

409
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,580
This used to be a place

410
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,580
for the elders of the family to stay.

411
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Later, he went out for a long trip.

412
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
So he didn't come back.

413
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Junior sister.

414
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Don't worry.

415
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
It's quiet and remote here.

416
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
No one will disturb our practice.

417
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
What's wrong?

418
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,580
This scripture should have two steps.

419
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
The first step is the martial arts move.

420
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
The second step is the inner attack.

421
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
The one you have

422
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
is the second step.

423
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,580
But the key is the first step.

424
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
If it's true,

425
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
I'm afraid I can't practice the next step.

426
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
If there's no first step,

427
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
can you help me

428
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580
to fix my body?

429
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Can you help me

430
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
to fix my body?

431
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
The inner attack is the key

432
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
to the next step.

433
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
As long as you have enough inner heart

434
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
to move the next step,

435
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
it can help you to fix your body.

436
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Didn't we use the first step

437
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
in the qin qi?

438
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm afraid I can't help you

439
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
to fix your body.

440
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
I don't think you can

441
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
separate the qin and the book.

442
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
He only has one book.

443
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
Is it because

444
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
you don't have the first step?

445
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,580
So you don't want to

446
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
give me the qin and the book?

447
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
I don't think so.

448
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,580
I don't think so.

449
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
I don't think so.

450
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
I don't think so.

451
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
I don't think so.

452
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
I don't think so.

453
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
I don't think so.

454
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
I don't think so.

455
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
I don't think so.

456
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I don't think so.

457
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,580
I don't think so.

458
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
I don't think so.

459
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
I don't think so.

460
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
I don't think so.

461
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
I don't think so.

462
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
I don't think so.

463
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
I don't think so.

464
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
I don't think so.

465
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
I don't think so.

466
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
I don't think so.

467
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
I don't think so.

468
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
I don't think so.

469
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
I don't think so.

470
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
I don't think so.

471
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
I don't think so.

472
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,580
I don't think so.

473
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
I don't think so.

474
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
I don't think so.

475
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't think so.

476
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
I don't think so.

477
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,580
This...

478
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
My child.

479
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Please help me.

480
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
I don't have much time left.

481
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
Only when I have Yin Zhenqiang

482
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
can I...

483
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
can I save your father.

484
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,580
I don't think so.

485
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
I don't think so.

486
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
I don't think so.

487
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,580
I don't think so.

488
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
I don't think so.

489
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
I don't think so.

490
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,580
I don't think so.

491
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,580
I don't think so.

492
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
I don't think so.

493
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
I don't think so.

494
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,580
I don't think so.

495
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
I don't think so.

496
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I don't think so.

497
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
I don't think so.

498
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I don't think so.

499
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
I don't think so.

500
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Sister.

501
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Sister.

502
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,580
Sister.

503
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,580
Sister.

504
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Sister.

505
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Sister.

506
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,580
You're like a demon.

507
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
You believe in Kung Fu is the ultimate weapons of martial arts.

508
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
I'm glad I found this out.

509
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,580
Or you'll be dead.

510
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Why?

511
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
We made so many mistakes.

512
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,340
but I still can't take revenge.

513
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,060
Junior sister,

514
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,740
don't be discouraged.

515
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,700
You've done a lot this time.

516
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,820
I've figured out

517
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,180
how to cultivate the Nine-flame Gold.

518
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,260
Senior brother,

519
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,340
when shall we start to cultivate the Gold?

520
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,180
It's urgent.

521
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,220
Wait patiently.

522
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,180
I can train with you.

523
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,820
It's not good to have too many people.

524
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,940
Eat it.

525
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,620
Get in.

526
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,740
Senior.

527
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,420
Tao Hua Island's martial arts are all the same.

528
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,660
They're different from other schools in the world.

529
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm afraid it won't work.

530
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,900
You've been practicing alone for days.

531
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Have you found a way?

532
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,580
I'm still thinking of a way.

533
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,940
There must be a way.

534
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,980
Don't worry.

535
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,060
Senior.

536
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,260
Give me the Nine Yin Manual.

537
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,620
I'll figure it out.

538
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,460
No.

539
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,260
Why?

540
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,740
I don't know what you're thinking.

541
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,340
I don't want to know.

542
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,300
We've been through so much together.

543
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,700
What's the matter

544
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,580
that we can't face together?

545
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,540
Junior.

546
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,300
I...

547
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,860
Go.

548
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,060
It's not too late.

549
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,700
I'm leaving.

550
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,300
I'm sorry for finding Qiu Yunhai.

551
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,980
It has nothing to do with you.

552
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,340
I'll pay for my own loss.
