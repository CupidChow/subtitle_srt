1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Taobao Shankou invites you to watch the real deal of the nine-winged eagle.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,120
Cut.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,720
Kill the flag.

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,040
It's rare to kill the flag so quickly.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,080
But it's faster.

6
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,560
Come on.

7
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,440
The afternoon tea is here.

8
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,760
I'm Meng Ziyi.

9
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,320
I use Taobao Shankou to order takeout.

10
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,120
It's more advantageous.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Taobao Shankou

12
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Junior sister.

13
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
Master has

14
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,720
cut your meridians.

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,840
Don't be afraid.

16
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
My legs.

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,480
My legs.

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
My legs.

19
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
It's hard to move my legs for the time being.

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,040
But don't worry.

21
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
Master will find a way out.

22
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
I'll find a way for you.

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Chaofeng.

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,040
Junior sister.

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
Why are you here?

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,520
Chaofeng.

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,120
I know you're sad.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,880
Cry if you want to.

29
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Your injury is not hopeless.

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Your master...

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,720
Your master has been in seclusion for days.

32
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,280
He will find a way for you.

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,680
The most important thing is to calm down.

34
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,880
Junior sister.

35
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't comfort me.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm a loser.

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Okay.

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Junior sister, don't worry.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm dotsing a new set of

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,560
157-520 for you.

41
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,120
It'll be over soon.

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,240
Put it on.

43
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm sure you'll move around freely.

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
Aquí choasaki.

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I'll go to the second floor to work.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Senior Sister, take care.

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
As long as your Teacher is here,

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
everything will have hope.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Living is the most important thing.

50
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Madam, don't worry.

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Master will be fine.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
In order to save me and Chaofeng,

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
he was seriously injured.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
You are still in the middle of your illness.

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
You have a deep depression.

56
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Remember to take care of yourself.

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Madam, let's go back first.

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Hongguo,

59
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
go and prepare some ink and paper for me.

60
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Yes.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Yes.

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Drink the medicine.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
You'll get better faster after drinking it.

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Your pulse is weak.

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
If you don't drink the medicine, you'll get better.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
There's no use drinking the medicine.

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I can't report it.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Why do I need this face?

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
If you don't listen to me,

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll do it for you.

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Come on.

72
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Master is unable to do anything.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Can the medicine be cured?

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Master will find a way.

75
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
He's very weak now.

76
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
He'll find a way when he's out of the coffin.

77
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Master.

78
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
There must be a way.

79
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Let's go.

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Let's go.

81
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Let's go.

82
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Junior sister.

83
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,440
I'll go.

84
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,600
Junior,

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,240
I just thought of something.

86
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,520
Didn't Mo Feng say he wanted to make a play

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
that makes you feel at ease?

88
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
Why don't we go and see

89
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,640
how it's made?

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,400
Okay.

91
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
Not bad.

92
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,880
Not bad.

93
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
But it's a little big.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,520
Maybe we should cut the rope.

95
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
It'll be much better.

96
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
This side is better.

97
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,080
Senior.

98
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,480
Senior.

99
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Senior.

100
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
Why are you here?

101
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,800
How are you?

102
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
Feeling better?

103
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,280
Senior.

104
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
We'll help you.

105
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
You'll be fine.

106
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,680
Senior.

107
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,720
Let me help you with the wine.

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,720
It'll help you recover soon.

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay.

110
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,440
Senior.

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
This is the special tool I made for you.

112
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,240
Look.

113
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
It's just a few pieces of iron.

114
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
When it's done,

115
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,800
you'll be able to walk around in it.

116
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,480
Senior.

117
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,800
Don't think about anything these days.

118
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,280
Stay calm and calm.

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
That's how it works.

120
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Thank you.

121
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,720
Senior.

122
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,360
See how best my wine is?

123
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,400
You'll be better one day.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I'll surely be better.

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,800
Yes.

126
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
You...

127
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,560
Why did you come out alone?

128
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
Jiu Shi,

129
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,400
I want you to look at this.

130
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,680
You're pregnant,

131
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,600
you can't run around.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,760
It's the Nine Yin Manual.

133
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
I remember Zhou Botong said

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
I can control your heart and mind.

135
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
I tried to write this book.

136
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,160
See if it works.

137
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,920
After the mountain,

138
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,360
this book

139
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,760
has been sealed by Wang Chongyang.

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,160
I won't read it.

141
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
But Wang Chongyang has died.

142
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
I know you don't want to betray your family.

143
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
But I don't care about the martial arts.

144
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,880
I only know this book

145
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,480
can save my husband.

146
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,920
There's only a bookWhich can protect this world.

147
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,800
So it's difficult for him to take advantage of it.

148
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Well,

149
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
I have an idea for

150
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,560
the protection of

151
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,360
five effects.

152
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
I think

153
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,800
this book is excellent.

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
I can make money

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,840
for the poster board and the lockdown for five months

156
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,480
after these five actions.

157
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:48,240
The

158
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,640
9 Yin Formation of carding,

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,560
Fine.

160
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,800
Even if you can't rely on your own power,

161
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
what about Chaofeng?

162
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
We'll just watch him

163
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
as a bamboo in the wind.

164
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
I really

165
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
can't live without you.

166
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I...

167
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
Therefore many people know

168
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,520
us, the Yoyo brothers.

169
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,880
In the history,

170
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
you can't count

171
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,880
on the yoyo brothers

172
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
until you lack an edge,

173
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
and never reach

174
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
the yoyo temple once again.

175
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,540
I don't think because of you,

176
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,900
I can be worried about gaining some points.

177
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,760
As for the無 Away ultr дом,

178
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,060
one moment in between lessons can be tolerated as if going through a time trial.

179
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll fight last for you.

180
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,140
Sorry for éénün ciese.

181
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,000
Excuse me.

182
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Without the top-level mind, you can't practice.

183
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Even if the martial arts moves recorded above

184
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
can really be used to control the super wind's legs,

185
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,920
without the mind forcefully practicing,

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
it's easy to be angry and rebellious,

187
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
and heavy to be like fire.

188
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,920
This is a real lesson.

189
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I've known for a long time

190
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,920
that the Nine Yin Manual

191
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
can't be solved by your solitude.

192
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Otherwise, how could I

193
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
help Wang Chongyang

194
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
and make you lose your mind?

195
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
As for the Heart-to-Heart Technique,

196
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
it will hurt me.

197
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I know.

198
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,920
But you're pregnant now.

199
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
The injury of the poison is even more serious.

200
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
If it wasn't for you,

201
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
if it wasn't for that poison,

202
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,480
and the three other

203
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,920
external forces,

204
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I might not be able to

205
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
give up.

206
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Then you...

207
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
At least we have the lower body now.

208
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
No matter how amazing the Nine Yin Manual is,

209
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
it's created by people.

210
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
The top-level mind,

211
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
I, Huang Langxie,

212
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
might not be able to push it out.

213
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,920
It just takes time.

214
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
No wonder you don't want to use it to save Chaofeng.

215
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
With Chaofeng's mind,

216
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
if you knew about this,

217
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
you would have done everything to rest,

218
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,920
even if it was against the will of the heavens.

219
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Forcibly cultivating,

220
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
even if you're lucky,

221
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
it's also a knife of your sister.

222
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,920
You'll regret it.

223
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Senior, you really treat me like this?

224
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Who told you not to practice hard recently?

225
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Recently, there's a rumor that the Nine Yin Manual

226
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
was stolen by that poisonous Ouyang Feng.

227
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I heard that the Nine Yin Manual

228
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,920
is the top-level secret of martial arts.

229
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
The martial arts on Peach Blossom Island are also very good.

230
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
I think the Nine Yin Manual

231
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
is not that hard to press.

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
But why can't I practice it?

233
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
The martial arts on Peach Blossom Island

234
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
are not focused on the will of the heavens.

235
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Your Senior Xuan Feng

236
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
is the most famous teacher among us.

237
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Junior,

238
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
show it to Mo Feng.

239
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Second Senior Brother, come here.

240
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
You're so good, Master Luo Yin.

241
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
The Nine Yin Manual

242
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Why are you here?

243
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Master,

244
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
you'll help me,

245
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
right?

246
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm thinking of another way.

247
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Do you know what kind of martial arts

248
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
can be used in this world

249
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
to train my legs

250
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
and cure them quickly?

251
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
The Nine Yin Manual

252
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
can't be used.

253
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Why?

254
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I heard it.

255
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You said that the One-Sword Cut-Bones of the Nine Yin Manual

256
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
can cure my legs.

257
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'll say it again.

258
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
The Nine Yin Manual

259
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
can't cure your legs.

260
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
You know nothing about the Nine Yin Manual.

261
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Don't ever mention this again.

262
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Master,

263
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I'm just a useless person

264
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
in this state.

265
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
I don't want to live like this.

266
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Master,

267
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I beg you.

268
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Please help me.

269
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Go.

270
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,920
The Nine Yin Manual

271
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Brother,

272
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
did the news come back from the island?

273
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
What did you see?

274
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Look for yourself.

275
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
What?

276
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Qiu Yun Hai destroyed

277
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
the tomb of Senior Sister's parents.

278
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Qiu Yun Hai is a vicious villain.

279
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Senior Sister escaped from the place.

280
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
She must want to force Senior Sister to take the initiative.

281
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
But Senior Sister is better now.

282
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
If she knew this news,

283
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
she would be unable to stand it.

284
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
So we can't let Senior Sister know.

285
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Let's tell Senior Brother

286
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
about this.

287
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Let's see how he will react.

288
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Master.

289
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Master.

290
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Chao Feng,

291
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
he is too impatient.

292
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,920
He insisted that I teach him the Nine Yin Manual.

293
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
But if I really teach him,

294
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
it will only harm him.

295
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Chao Feng,

296
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
he is too pitiful.

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
If he didn't insist on seeking revenge,

298
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
how could he fall into this kind of situation?

299
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I understand.

300
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
You don't want to accept him at all.

301
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You accepted Mei Chao Feng as your disciple

302
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
because of me.

303
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Chao Feng

304
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
is really pitiful.

305
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Is there really no other way?

306
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Nine Yin Wheel Pill.

307
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Nine Yin Wheel Pill

308
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
has the effect of bringing back the dead

309
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
and bringing back the living.

310
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It's the medicine

311
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
that can bring back the dead.

312
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
It's the medicine

313
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
and the poison.

314
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
If he eats it,

315
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
he will be like me.

316
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
He will be unable to solve his problems.

317
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
But this is

318
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
the only way.

319
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Chong Ling,

320
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Nine Yin Wheel Pill.

321
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm coming in.

322
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Junior, time to eat.

323
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
The fish soup is very delicious today.

324
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Senior.

325
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
What's wrong?

326
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Do you know the Nine Yin Manual?

327
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
It's said that the one who has the Nine Yin Manual

328
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
is invincible.

329
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
In the past,

330
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
the heroes of the world

331
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
were all the same.

332
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
But now,

333
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
the Nine Yin Manual

334
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
is the most powerful.

335
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
In the past,

336
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
the heroes of the world

337
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
were all the same.

338
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
It's because of it.

339
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Why do you ask about this?

340
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
The Nine Yin Manual

341
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
is the most powerful

342
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,920
and it can bring back the dead.

343
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
This manual

344
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
is in the hands of my master

345
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
and is hidden in the Green Yin Cave.

346
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
How do you know this?

347
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Senior,

348
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
do you know

349
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
how to break the formation of the Green Yin Cave?

350
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
I must get the manual

351
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
and restore the golden veins

352
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
to get rid of the blood.

353
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
The Nine Yin Manual

354
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
is really in my master's hands.

355
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Then you should ask my master

356
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
to give you the manual.

357
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
I tried it.

358
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
But he refused to give it to me.

359
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
The Nine Yin Manual

360
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
is the most powerful

361
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
and it can bring back the dead.

362
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
If my master does this,

363
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
he must have his own reason.

364
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Junior,

365
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
don't worry.

366
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
The most important thing for you

367
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
is to recover.

368
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
We can do other things.

369
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
But I can't wait.

370
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
When I was young,

371
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I saw Qiu Yunhai

372
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
kill my parents.

373
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
But he did nothing.

374
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
If I can't

375
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
avenge my parents,

376
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I have no reason to live.

377
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
As long as I get the Nine Yin Manual,

378
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
I can heal my wounds.

379
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Then I can kill Qiu Yunhai.

380
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
This is my only hope.

381
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Senior,

382
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
help me.

383
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Help you

384
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
betray your master?

385
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I never thought of betraying my master.

386
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't want to get the manual.

387
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I'll ask my master

388
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
for forgiveness when I get the manual.

389
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I'll accept

390
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
whatever he punishes me.

391
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Senior,

392
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I know it's a big mistake.

393
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
But I have no other choice.

394
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Junior,

395
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
what do you mean

396
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
by betraying your master?

397
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
You can't do anything

398
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
in this world.

399
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm wrong.

400
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

401
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Just go.

402
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Go.

403
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Ruohua,

404
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
is your mother here?

405
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
You're a year older.

406
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Wish Ruohua

407
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
a long life.

408
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
I'll sell her

409
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
to the lowest level of the orphanage

410
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
so that she can live a life of misery.

411
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
No matter if the manual

412
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
can save her or not,

413
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I'll never let her die.

414
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
I'll never let her die.

415
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
I'll never let her die.

416
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll never let her die.

417
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
I've already met her.

418
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Don't mention it again.

419
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I'll say it again.

420
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
The Nine Yin Manual

421
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
can't heal your leg.

422
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
What?

423
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Qiu Yun Kai destroyed

424
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
the tomb of her parents?

425
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Junior!

426
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I'll help you.

427
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Peach blossom beans

428
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
are the most important.

429
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Stealing the manual

430
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
is like betraying the master.

431
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
You can't do anything

432
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
to them.

433
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Stealing the manual

434
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
is like betraying the master.

435
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Master will never forgive us.

436
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
We have to escape from the truth.

437
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Have you thought it through?

438
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
I have.

439
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I've made my decision.

440
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
What's your plan?

441
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Besides the broken formation,

442
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
there are some things

443
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
we need to prepare in advance.

444
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
There's another thing.

445
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
The ship on the island

446
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
is being sealed by the wind.

447
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
It can't leave for now.

448
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
We need to repair it as soon as possible.

449
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
And the map of the Fourth Brother's formation.

450
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
With this map,

451
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
we can use it

452
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
when we first arrive.

453
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
The Fourth Brother always takes good care of me.

454
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
I'll ask him for it.

455
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
He should give it to me.

456
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
It's done.

457
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Senior, how do you feel recently?

458
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
You're really much better

459
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
after you've been working for me.

460
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
You're right.

461
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
It's good for you to cooperate with the treatment

462
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
and help you to recover.

463
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Can I recover?

464
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
We and Master and Madam

465
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
will do our best to help you.

466
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Junior.

467
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
You're working with the medicine day and night.

468
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Do you know

469
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
if there's any medicine

470
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
that can be used

471
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
even for the strong martial artists?

472
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Why do you ask this?

473
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
I want to prepare some protection

474
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
for the current situation.

475
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Senior, the medicine

476
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
that Senior said

477
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
has been made by Master.

478
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
This kind of medicine

479
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
is very good.

480
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
The stronger the martial arts are,

481
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
the faster the poison is.

482
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
It can be recovered

483
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
within an hour.

484
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
It can be recovered without any harm.

485
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Why haven't I heard of it before?

486
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Because Master thinks

487
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
the people who use the poison

488
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
are all evil.

489
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
So although it was developed,

490
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
it never used it.

491
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
But

492
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
I changed the prescription

493
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
and made some changes

494
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
to it.

495
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Wait for me.

496
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Senior.

497
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
You're injured.

498
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
You're in danger.

499
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
You can wear some medicine

500
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
and take it with you.

501
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Senior.

502
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Don't let Master know.

503
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Senior.

504
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
The bamboo qi shoes are ready.

505
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Come and try them.

506
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Let me.

507
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Senior.

508
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Let me help you to try them.

509
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Come.

510
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Slowly.

511
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Come.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Senior.

513
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Senior, are you okay?

514
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I'm fine.

515
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Thank you, Little Bee.

516
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I'm fine.

517
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
No matter what,

518
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
you've made a step closer.

519
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Senior.

520
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Junior.

521
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
What's up?

522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Junior is in a bad mood.

523
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
I want to take her to the sea to fish.

524
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
But the boat is not in good condition.

525
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Can you help me to fix it as soon as possible?

526
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
It's a small matter.

527
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll find someone to fix it as soon as possible.

528
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I also hope

529
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Junior's mood

530
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
can be better as soon as possible.

531
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Senior.

532
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Senior.

533
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
With this picture,

534
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
the organs on the island

535
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
won't hurt you anymore.

536
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Take it.

537
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Thank you, Junior.

538
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
You're welcome.

539
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I only have you.

540
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
I'm leaving.

541
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Changfeng.

542
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
The picture of Po Zhen.

543
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
No one saw it, right?

544
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
No.

545
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
No one saw it.

546
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Master.

547
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Changfeng.

548
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Senior.

549
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
You should go back first.

550
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Master.

551
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Are you feeling better?

552
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
You should let go

553
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
some obsession.

554
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Master.

555
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Have you never

556
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
really taught me kung fu?

557
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
I've taught you

558
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
some kung fu of the Peach Blossom Island.

559
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
But I'm too slow.

560
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Since I came here,

561
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
you've never

562
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
taught me any new medicine.

563
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Since you came here,

564
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I've never taught you any new medicine.

565
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
What did you teach me?

566
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
You bring tea.

567
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I drink it.

568
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
You bring food.

569
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I eat it.

570
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
You give me a gift.

571
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I give you a head.

572
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
I've been

573
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
teaching you new medicine all the time.

574
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Xiuwu.

575
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
The most important thing is

576
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
the sword.

577
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
The way of the sword.

578
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Master said to let go.

579
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
How can I let go?

580
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Follow your heart.

581
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Go with the flow.

582
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Follow all the outside world.

583
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Go with the flow.

584
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Follow your heart.

585
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Follow your heart.

586
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Don't be a fool.

587
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Where did you learn

588
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
your kung fu?

589
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
It's a long story.

590
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
At first,

591
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
it was a love story.

592
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Just like when I met you?

593
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Master's kung fu

594
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
is already unbeatable.

595
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Did you let go?

596
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
The best in the world

597
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
is never my pursuit.

598
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I'm not talking about this.

599
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Master.

600
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
You're worried about me.

601

It's today's your birthday.

646
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,280
We should celebrate it.

647
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,040
Make her happy.

648
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
We're just friends today.

649
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,520
Do you really want to do us like this?

650
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
There is no turning back starting beats.

651
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,520
I hope you won't regret

652
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
now and forever.

653
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,480
I won't.

654
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,080
and no One out totalizes her.

655
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,880
As tough as she is,

656
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
the more she has to practice,

657
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,760
her slipPrice has dropped.

658
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,800
Good.

659
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
She's worked hard.

660
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
I'm afraid

661
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,480
it's not as good as the one in Shenmei.

662
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,240
The flowers are blooming again.

663
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,760
The island is going to be lively.

664
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,240
How's your research on the Nine Yin Manual?

665
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Look at me.

666
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,520
I'm much better, right?

667
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,840
Master.

668
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Madam.

Madam.

671
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Master.

Madam.

673
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,240
Madam.

674
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Why don't I see Chaofeng and Xuanfeng?

675
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Master. Madam.

676
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,520
OK.

677
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
I went to get some wine with my junior.

678
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Sit down.

679
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840

Let me.

Let me.

Thank you.

698
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
It's OK.

Let's eat.

700
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
You've been working so hard.

701
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
You're not only my good disciples

702
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640

703
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,640

We are born on Peach Blossom Island.

We Peach Blossom Island people are connected.

We will never be apart.

726
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Second Brother.

727
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
You want to say something too.

728
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Second Brother.

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Okay.

You're good at talking.

Mo Feng.

746

Are you drinking wine?

747
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Madam, don't worry.

748
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm drinking water just like you.

749
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Come on.

750
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Come on.

This wine.

752
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Why does this wine feel...

753
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
It's here.

754
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Master.

755
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Master.

756
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Master.

You are my love.

758
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,640
We are like a red dust.

759
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,640
We are like the sky.

760
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I see the dream is flying.

761
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,640
I want to see you for the rest of my life.

762
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,640
How many years have passed since then?

763
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,640
The moon will disappear.

764
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,640
You are the face in my heart.

765
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,640
You will never leave me.

766
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,640
You are the thread in the wind.

767
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,640
You tie me up.

768
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,640
Since time has its end.

769
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,640
I will be the one to give up.

770
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
I will give up my love.

771
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,640
Time will go back.

772
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
You are my desire.

773
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,640
You are my obsession.

774
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,640
You are the mountain that I can't cross.

775
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Even if we are against each other.

776
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Love is irreversible.

777
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,640
You are the thread in the wind.

778
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,640
You tie me up.

779
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,640
The End
