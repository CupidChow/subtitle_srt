1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
This island is very strange.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
Not to mention the shadow,

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,960
even birds are missing.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Junior, you may not know that

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Liu Bo Island

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,760
is a rare volcano island in the East Sea.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,280
The lava erupted and there were no grass left.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,720
The master, Xue Qingyi,

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
behaved very low-key.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,560
There are few legends in the world.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,520
It's still you who have seen it.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,120
This place is very strange.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,840
Everyone should be careful.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
I feel like someone is following us.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
From the moment we went up the mountain,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,600
someone was following us.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Taoism Grandmaster

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Taoism Grandmaster

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Are you really

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,000
the master of the Taoist Taoist Island's

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Eastern Evil Huang Yaoshi?

27
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Master Xue,

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
we are from the Taoist Taoism Island.

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Master Huang,

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,560
I've admired you for a long time.

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,680
The Taoist Taoism Island is so famous.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
What's the purpose?

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,320
We heard that Liu Bo Island

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,040
is good at producing rare flowers and grass.

35
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
So we came to ask for a fire flower.

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Your information is very clear.

37
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,120
Only Liu Bo Island has the fire flower.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
But...

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
But since Master Huang asked for it,

40
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll give it to him.

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
Finally, we didn't come here for nothing.

42
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,440
The key to the fire flower

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
is to make the flower bloom at the night.

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Only when the flower blooms,

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,280
the night will be taken out immediately.

46
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,680
But the flower will bloom in two or three days.

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,640
Why don't you stay here

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
and wait for the flower to bloom?

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Thank you, Master Xue.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Then I'll leave you to it.

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Take a few of you to rest.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Yes.

53
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Wow.

54
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
The flower smells so good.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
I've never seen it before.

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
The island is full.

57
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,600
You must be tired.

58
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,960
You should rest.

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,080
Thank you, Master.

60
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
We'll leave you to it.

61
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,640
Please enjoy.

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Thank you, Master.

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,600
You're so kind.

64
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
You prepared so much food for us.

65
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,320
It's so...

66
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,600
Senior, what are you doing?

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
Don't you think it's strange?

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,480
Why did he give us the fire flower for nothing?

69
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,080
Isn't Xue Qingyi

70
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
the name of Master's idol

71
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,440
and wants to take over the Peach Blossom Island?

72
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,120
You can believe whatever he says.

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,080
Senior,

74
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm not a fan of you.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Senior,

76
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,560
it's just a flower.

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,320
Besides,

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
even if it's a mountain,

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
you can take it.

80
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Master Xue has been hiding from the Peach Blossom Island.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,520
There are rumors about him in the world.

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
But he's not a bad person.

83
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Senior,

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,320
you don't have to think of everyone

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
as a bad person.

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
There are many people

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
who are different in the world.

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,720
You're lucky that you didn't meet him.

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,200
Once you meet him, you'll be blessed.

90
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
Stop arguing.

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,760
It's strange here.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
Be careful.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Yinzhen tried it.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,880
It's not poisonous.

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,560
See?

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm right, right?

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,920
Junior.

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,720
Junior.

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Chen Peng,

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,640
how can you talk to your senior like that?

101
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm right.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,640
Yinzhen tried it.

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,680
I guess it's not poisonous.

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
But some poisons

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
are not tested by Yinzhen.

106
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,080
It's a long-lasting legend.

107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,120
Junior's suspicion is reasonable.

108
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll go and have a look.

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
You didn't ask me earlier.

111
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
I didn't expect that Junior's martial arts

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,120
has improved so much in a short time.

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Why are you here?

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Why don't you discuss with them

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
how to survive the evil?

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I agree with you.

117
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,280
I don't think Xue Qingyi is a good person.

118
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,880
If you want to marry someone, you must know it first.

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
If she really admires you,

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
why don't you go to visit her?

121
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,040
That's right.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,520
It's better to be cautious

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,840
when dealing with bad people

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
than to be blind and kind.

125
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
They grew up

126
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,840
on the Peach Blossom Island.

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
They are simple-minded.

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
They are not as good as you and me.

129
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,800
Since you were on the island,

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
you haven't eaten anything.

131
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm not hungry.

132
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
I'll treat this cake

133
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,760
as my apology to you

134
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,720
on behalf of my junior.

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Don't be angry.

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm leaving.

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,640
Sorry that I was nice.

138
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Harder.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,840
Take your time.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Don't choke.

141
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
He's so annoying.

142
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you going to eat or not?

143
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
Why not?

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Why don't we take some detoxification pills

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
before we eat?

146
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,000
We can't afford to lose anything.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,160
Come on, Zhaizhi.

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,520
Are you stupid?

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
We can't take detoxification pills before we take poison.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
I think

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
we should be bold and eat.

152
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,800
If they think

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
we're suspicious of them,

154
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
we won't do it.

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
If we're really poisoned after eating...

156
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Enough. Stop it.

157
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Let's use the wound.

158
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
If anything happens,

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
we should take care of it.

160
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,200
That's good.

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
I'll eat first.

162
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, you eat first.

163
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Just eat. Who's afraid of who?

164
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's eat.

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay.

166
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,640
I'll eat one too.

167
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,280
Okay.

168
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Why do you keep staring at me?

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
Run.

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
I told you to run.

171
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,200
I told you to run.

172
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,280
Where are you running?

173
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,360
You're a slave even if you die.

174
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,800
Who's there?

175
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
Two big ones bully one small one.

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
How dare you?

177
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,600
Thank you, Miss Guangguo.

178
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,080
Who are you?

179
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,680
My name is Feng Mofeng.

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Where's your family?

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,880
My family

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
was forced to be slaves in my family.

183
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Later,

184
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,360
they were all killed

185
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
because they were the drug addicts.

186
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,280
I tried to run away several times,

187
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,400
but the people who came with you

188
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,440
were caught and turned into drug addicts.

189
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
Go and save them.

190
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm here.

191
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
Where are the pirates?

192
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,040
Qingcui.

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,360
Nothing could go wrong.

194
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
Put your hands here.

195
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,320
Xue Qingyi.

196
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,200
Let us out.

197
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
Welcome to my demon kingdom.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
You're not a good person

199
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
after what you said.

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,920
You didn't poison the food.

201
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
How did you do that?

202
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,920
My master was appointed as the Ghost Doctor by the world.

203
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
Poisoning is not allowed.

204
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Poisoning in the food is a low-level method.

205
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
My master doesn't take it.

206
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,840
Right.

207
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
The key to your poisoning

208
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,640
is the flower seed of the Demon Hall.

209
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
The medicine is not poisonous.

210
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,280
But the combination with the fragrance of the Demon Hall

211
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
is the best medicine.

212
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
You are just

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
despicable people who use tricks.

214
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
My title of Ghost Doctor

215
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
is not obtained by the old man.

216
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
You have to pay for what you want.

217
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
What do you want?

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,640
The most famous poison is the heart.

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,040
I am developing the Seven-Legend Powder.

220
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,640
If you are poisoned,

221
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,960
even the best master

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,040
will be controlled by me.

223
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,720
This medicine has 49 poison.

224
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,880
It's just the first layer of seven-legged poison.

225
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I can't even stand the first layer.

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
Only the powerful martial arts can stand it.

227
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,800
Then I have the right to be my medicine.

228
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,720
Your Highness.

229
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,200
You three brothers

230
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
are the medicine in the medicine cabinet.

231
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,040
Little Demon,

232
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,640
we have to save them.

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,360
How can we get out of the medicine cabinet?

234
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,880
The door of the medicine cabinet is guarded by three eyes.

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,840
There are also poison traps inside.

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,400
In order to prevent people from entering and exiting,

237
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,400
only Xue Qingyi and Qing Peng can enter.

238
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,520
No one can enter Qing Peng.

239
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,760
Qing Hong and Qing Peng are not a threat.

240
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
We just need to lure Xue Qingyi out of the medicine cabinet.

241
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Then we have a chance to save them.

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,240
How can we lure Xue Qingyi out of the medicine cabinet?

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
I am in battle.

244
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,240
The enemy is very powerful.

245
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,920
He has to fight against me.

246
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Attack the place where he will be saved.

247
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,320
We will attack the place where he will be saved.

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,080
I thought you were just ordinary masters.

249
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
But I didn't expect

250
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,280
your Tao Hua Island martial arts are so unique.

251
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,800
You have become the best medicine man.

252
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,440
Go.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
How dare you do such a heinous thing?

254
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,840
You...

255
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,400
You don't deserve to be a doctor.

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
What are you doing?

257
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Senior Brother.

258
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,080
Senior Brother.

259
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,360
What are you doing?

260
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,560
What are you doing?

261
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
Senior Brother.

262
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,480
I haven't felt scared for a long time.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Besides the medicine cabinet,

264
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,000
where else can Xue Qingyi escape?

265
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,760
Besides the medicine cabinet,

266
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,640
there is the medicine cabinet.

267
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,840
There is also the most precious medicine and prescription.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
But the medicine cabinet is like a wall of iron.

269
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,080
It can't even carry a fly.

270
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,640
Practice the medicine.

271
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,440
One day,

272
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,680
I will make the most powerful poison in the world.

273
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
I will make the thing

274
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
sink into me.

275
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,440
Go.

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,320
Did you find it?

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,840
No.

278
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,880
Take her to see Master.

279
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,640
Yes.

280
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,520
Master, something happened to the medicine cabinet.

281
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
It must be the poison.

282
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,840
Master, I'll catch one.

283
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
The other one can't escape for long.

284
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,080
Take her in first.

285
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Keep an eye on the place.

286
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,440
Yes.

287
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,400
You guys, follow me to save the fire.

288
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,080
Yes.

289
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,880
You two stay here.

290
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,560
Yes.

291
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,080
Go.

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,360
Go.

293
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
My master's medicine cabinet

294
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
is the hardest place in the world.

295
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,240
You want to save people.

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,240
You are just being reckless.

297
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
So what if you see it?

298
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Do you think you can get out?

299
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,760
Don't move.

300
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
Are you okay?

301
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
What you did is really useful.

302
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
You don't need to work out.

303
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
The medicine cabinet exploded in a second.

304
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
It's so strange.

305
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,320
The sulfur and the fissure on the island

306
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,400
are just in the charcoal.

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,680
Let's go save them.

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,200
Yes.

309
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,840
Senior, are you there?

310
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,120
Junior, can you hear me?

311
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Senior.

312
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,480
Junior.

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,960
Senior.

314
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,600
Senior.

315
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Senior.

316
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Junior.

317
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,240
Junior.

318
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,120
Help me.

319
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,000
Junior.

320
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Junior.

321
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,280
Junior.

322
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,240
Wake up.

323
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Junior.

324
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,080
Senior.

325
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,040
Senior.

326
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Junior.

327
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,360
Wake up.

328
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,240
Junior.

329
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,160
Junior.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
Senior.

331
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
The medicine cabinet...

332
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,080
They will be back soon.

333
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,840
We have to leave here quickly.

334
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,840
Let's save them later.

335
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,240
Okay.

336
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Let's take the medicine away first.

337
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,120
There are still people here.

338
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Let's go.

339
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,480
Let's go.

340
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,480
Thank god that you two arrived in time.

341
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
If not, we would have...

342
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,240
Senior.

343
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,280
It was my fault.

345
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,260
I was

346
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,680
the reason for his breadcrumbs,

347
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,960
causing problems for Senior, Junior, and Senior.

348
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,600
Senior,

349
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,640
I met XieMen on the island.

350
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
XieMen is my senior.

351
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
and my junior brother.

352
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,320
But I don't remember

353
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,520
the past.

354
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
It's what we should do.

355
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,640
The head of the clan is like the chief.

356
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,080
It's our duty to help the chief.

357
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,080
Don't be so polite.

358
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,320
The rapists are so powerful.

359
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,680
What should we do?

360
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,880
We can't go back empty-handed.

361
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,680
We should eliminate the evil in the martial arts world.

362
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,040
Get the Fire Flower

363
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
and go back to Peach Blossom Island together.

364
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Among these people,

365
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,960
only Xue Qingyi is used to

366
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,560
prevent people from being careless.

367
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
As long as we can stop Xue Qingyi,

368
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,080
we can succeed.

369
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,480
Senior,

370
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
can you make a weapon

371
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,000
used to fight the enemy

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
with the fire medicine last time?

373
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,280
This...

374
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
Maybe my junior brother is better at it.

375
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,600
Master.

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Master.

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,960
Have you found them?

378
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
The people of Peach Blossom Island are very cunning.

379
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,760
We've searched the whole island.

380
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
We didn't see any people.

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
There are no ships on the shore.

382
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
They haven't left yet.

383
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,840
They're digging three feet deep.

384
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,080
Find them out!

385
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,000
art around the dreamy island

386
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Do it!

387
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,760
I bitten the Feedman.

388
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,820
My Moving

389
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,400
is a fully vital job.

390
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,520
This year,

391
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,880
I accepted the effect

392
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,340
of the

393
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,600
Fuck Final Brother Truc Kih��Great principles.

394
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
The

395
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
What did you do to them?

396
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,440
I used the poison I made

397
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,520
on them.

398
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,160
Now they are more powerful

399
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,200
and more dangerous.

400
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,360
They are the best

401
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
murder weapon.

402
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,680
They are your disciples.

403
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
It's their luck

404
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
to be able to poison Xue Qingyi.

405
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,040
You are really heartless.

406
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,840
You deserve to die.

407
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
I'll show you what I can do.

408
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,640
The

409
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,880
Shaoyin.

410
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
They are controlled by the God of Heart.

411
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
Mian Feng, fix the sword.

412
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,840
What's wrong?

413
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
Xue Qingyi ran away.

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,920
Luckily, we didn't fall asleep.

415
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,360
We

416
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,640
finally got rid of them.

417
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,000
Zanyi.

418
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,280
We have to find Xue Qingyi quickly.

419
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
The fire flower is about to bloom.

420
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,360
We have to get the flower as soon as possible.

421
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,800
Is this the fire flower?

422
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,440
Senior, let me do it.

423
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,560
Be careful.

424
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I received information

425
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,200
that the top of Mount Hua

426
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,600
respects the Huangyao Master as one of the five masters.

427
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,440
I think you

428
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
are just a few Huangyao Masters.

429
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,200
We, Tao Hua Island,

430
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
are really capable.

431
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
You don't need to

432
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,120
talk too much

433
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
about the evil people who only use poison.

434
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,360
You

435
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,720
came for the fire flower

436
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,400
but now you are full of good morals.

437
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
The fire flower is here.

438
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
You can take it yourself.

439
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
The lock

440
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,560
was made by Feng A'San with black iron.

441
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
If it's in my hand,

442
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
except me,

443
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,840
the only one who can open it

444
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,800
is Feng A'San.

445
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,160
He has already taken the throne.

446
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,240
You can never get in.

447
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,640
We can't get in.

448
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
You can't get out either.

449
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Let's see who can survive.

450
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,600
The fire flower is about to bloom.

451
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,600
They should bloom every 19 years!

452
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,540
We have to Technologies

453
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,640
Mulberry Flower,

454
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,320
in theem a night.

455
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,820
Their cuteMom and Dad

456
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,440
will probablyate these flowers.

457
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
We can get rid of the King of Sal prevalence

458
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,240
and have the King of Mifiques,

459
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
Regteokbokki relish

460
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,880
so as to recover his condition.

461
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,280
He did it.

462
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,260
This...

463
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,120
I ask Sympathy both get rid of him

464
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,200
so that he can never

465
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
That's because on my way,

466
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,960
the lava will only fluctuate once every 19 years.

467
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,960
Only in this salt river,

468
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
with the high temperature,

469
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
can the lava bloom.

470
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,440
The lava at the bottom

471
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,080
is about to erupt.

472
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,480
You

473
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,880
either give up the lava and leave right away,

474
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,560
or you'll just wait here to die.

475
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,360
Xu Qingyi,

476
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
open the door if you can.

477
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
Only this door is safe now.

478
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
Don't pull the door. I can do it.

479
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
Why do you have the key?

480
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,920
My grandpa gave it to me.

481
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,720
My grandpa is Feng A-san.

482
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,920
Grandpa knew you could kill people and kill people.

483
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,520
So he gave it to me secretly.

484
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,800
This fire lava is mine.

485
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,680
This...

486
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,200
Oh no!

487
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,600
The volcano is about to erupt!

488
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,080
The volcano is about to erupt.

489
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
This is the fire lava.

490
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,880
Give it to me.

491
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,640
Here.

492
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,840
Grandpa.

493
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,520
Mom and Dad.

494
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,080
I'll avenge you!

495
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,660
One of my

496
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,720
parents never

497
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:08,720
kept an eye on me.

498
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll save you.

499
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm just worried about you

500
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
what will happen to you

501
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
I hope what I think

502
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
will turn out

503
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,320
to be the practice of the senior та

504
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,040
Who has your idea?

505
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,560
Me

506
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,080
Master, I forced them to go to Liu Bo Island with me.

507
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,880
It's all...

508
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
It's all my fault.

509
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Master, I was the cause.

510
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,040
I peeked at your heart.

511
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,880
Don't argue, brothers.

512
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,160
Master, we all feel sorry for you.

513
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,880
I know in my letter that

514
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
the fire dragon flower has a strange effect.

515
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,960
So we all think that

516
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,400
we should pick this flower for you no matter what.

517
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,360
Master, I admit that

518
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,680
I have a selfish motive.

519
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,160
I think if I can pick this flower for you,

520
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,640
maybe I can help you

521
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,160
teach me martial arts.

522
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,800
Madam.

523
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm guilty.

524
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
Please punish me severely.

525
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
Master, it's a dangerous trip.

526
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,960
We almost died.

527
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
Thanks to Sister Chaofeng.

528
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,640
If she hadn't reminded us,

529
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,080
we would have been hit by Xue Qingyi's knife.

530
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes, Master.

531
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
If Sister Chaofeng hadn't woken up,

532
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,120
we would have been burned to ashes.

533
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,000
No one would have survived.

534
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,040
Master, Sister Chaofeng is a girl.

535
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,160
But she's so brave and admirable.

536
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,200
Really, Master.

537
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
Sister Chaofeng is amazing.

538
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,360
How did you find out that Xue Qingyi was in trouble?

539
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
You're much better than Brother Xuan Feng.

540
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,520
Don't talk nonsense.

541
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,040
You're holding a celebration party here.

542
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,720
Master.

543
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,800
Who are you?

544
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,680
I...

545
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,480
I...

546
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Master, he's Feng Mo Feng.

547
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,360
Thanks to him, we could go to the island.

548
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to come back.

549
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Feng Mo Feng

550
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,960
My name is Feng Mo Feng.

551
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
Please accept me as your disciple.

552
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,480
Master.

553
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,160
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

554
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,680
Master.

555
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,360
Master.

556
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,200
Master.

557
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,360
Madam is fine.

558
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,920
Master.

559
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,240
You said, your name was...

560
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,040
What was it again?

561
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,960
My name is Feng Mo Feng.

562
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,080
That's a good name.

563
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
That saves a new name.

564
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,400
You just let us go?

565
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,640
Master, have you forgiven us?

566
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Master said we don't need to change our names.

567
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,400
What do you mean?

568
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,000
We're accepted.

569
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,800
Accepted?

570
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Accepted.

571
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,680
Do we need to kneel?

572
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,240
Get up. It's okay.

573
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I'm a senior now.

574
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm a junior now.

575
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
Junior! Junior! Junior!

576
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,720
Junior!

577
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
Master took you as his disciple.

578
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,480
You're my sixth junior now.

579
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,240
Really?

580
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,160
I'm a junior now.

581
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,240
Master really took me as his disciple.

582
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm a junior now.

583
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,440
Master!

584
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,560
I'm a junior now!

585
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,520
I'm a master now!

586
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,560
Cheng Feng.

587
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,200
Thank you.

588
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,400
The fire flower really healed me.

589
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Tell me.

590
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
What have you been through

591
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,760
on Liu Bo Island?

592
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Nothing, Shiniang.

593
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,640
I never thought

594
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,480
I would be

595
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,200
so quiet

596
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,520
like now

597
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,800
and soak in the gentle spring water.

598
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,520
Meeting you

599
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,600
is a blessing I've never had in my life.

600
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,200
As long as I can repay your kindness,

601
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,080
even if it's a lie,

602
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,600
I, Mei Ruohua,

603
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
will never give up.

604
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,080
Mei Chaofeng.

605
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
Mei Chaofeng.

606
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,560
Chaofeng.

607
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,320
Let bygones be bygones.

608
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
The past winter

609
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
is no longer there.

610
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,240
Here,

611
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,840
you can allow yourself to be weak.

612
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,040
No matter where you go in the future,

613
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
remember that

614
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,120
everything in the past

615
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
is fake.

616
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,120
Memories

617
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,400
are a path that has no end.

618
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,640
I know

619
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,160
your old home no longer exists.

620
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
But in the future,

621
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,920
Peach Blossom Island

622
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,160
will be your home.

623
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,280
We

624
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,040
will be your family.

625
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,960
This dress really suits you.

626
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,840
You have a good eye.

627
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
It's even more eye-catching to dress like this.

628
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
In a daughter's home,

629
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
don't always dress up.

630
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,680
Sometimes, relax and dress up

631
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
to make yourself pretty.

632
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,720
Such days

633
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,040
are more fun.

634
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
Come on, cheers.

635
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,360
Come on, cheers.

636
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,360
Senior sister is here.

637
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,600
Junior sister.

638
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,240
Senior sister, come here.

639
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,240
Come on, come here.

640
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,040
Sit down, sit down.

641
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,560
Come on.

642
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,040
Senior sister.

643
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,920
You should smile more often.

644
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,960
You look good when you smile.

645
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Senior brother. Senior brother.

646
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm not good at it.

647
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,600
Junior sister.

648
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,080
Thanks to you, we went to the island.

649
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,280
Otherwise,

650
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
we might be lost.

651
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
If they did anything bad in the past,

652
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,880
I'll take them to apologize.

653
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,480
I'll drink it.

654
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
We did nothing bad.

655
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,760
If we did something bad,

656
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,880
we'll apologize ourselves.

657
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,720
Do we need you?

658
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,960
That's right.

659
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,480
Come on.

660
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,840
To celebrate our adventure,

661
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,760
we have no danger.

662
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,080
To celebrate that our teacher finally got the Fire Flower.

663
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,960
The key is

664
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
to be good.

665
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,200
And

666
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,840
we have a junior brother.

667
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,360
Thanks to Xiaomofeng.

668
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,760
Cheers.

669
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Yes.

670
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,400
Come on.

671
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,720
Cheers.

672
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,960
Children can't drink.

673
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,920
Senior sister, don't worry.

674
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,040
I can drink.

675
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,680
You can't drink that either.

676
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,360
No.

677
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,840
This...

678
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,600
This time, I'm not the only one

679
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
who got the Fire Flower.

680
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,240
Senior brother Xuan Feng also made a great contribution.

681
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,640
And senior brother Ling Feng.

682
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Senior brother Cheng Feng.

683
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
This trip to Liu Bo Island

684
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,880
is impossible without anyone.

685
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,200
Of course.

686
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,960
And Xiaomofeng.

687
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Thank you, senior sister.

688
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,080
You have to give a toast to Xiaomofeng.

689
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,240
You have to give a toast to her.

690
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,040
That's right.

691
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,880
Chen Xuan Feng.

692
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,000
What's wrong with men drinking?

693
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,440
Cheers.

694
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Okay.

695
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,120
Cheers.

696
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,040
Chen Xuan Feng.

697
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Water.

698
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,600
Enough.

699
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,040
It doesn't matter if he's drinking or not.

700
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,640
Senior brothers and sisters.

701
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,080
I'm happy to meet you.

702
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,200
You can drink as you like.

703
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,040
I'll drink anyway.

704
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,480
What do you mean?

705
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,720
Teacher.

706
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,480
Look.

707
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,960
After Cheng Feng came to the island,

708
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,280
these kids are so happy.

709
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,400
It's more uncomfortable for a man to drink.

710
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,040
He usually drinks

711
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,720
with a jar.

712
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,640
That's right.

713
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Second brother.

714
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,600
You have to drink with the elder brother.

715
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,480
Don't drink alone.

716
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
Or we won't drink with you two.

717
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,960
How about it?

718
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,560
Drink.

719
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,240
As long as you're happy,

720
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,640
that's enough.

721
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,680
Come on.

722
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,360
Cheers.

723
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,440
Drink.

724
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,840
Drink.

725
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,080
Come on.

726
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,520
Let's drink with you.

727
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,200
I really like this kind of life.

728
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,800
Don't be too concerned about the kids.

729
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,360
Fengfeng.

730
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,760
Come on.

731
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,440
Let's drink.

732
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,920
Cheers.

733
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,560
Come on.

734
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,040
Cheers.

735
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,440
Cheers.

736
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,240
No matter what,

737
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,960
they're all for your good.

738
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
Fengfeng.

739
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,680
The Peach Blossom Island is your home now.

740
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,120
If you need anything,

741
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
just come to me.

742
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,080
You can come to me.

743
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,640
You're a grown-up now.

744
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
You need to learn to take care of yourself.

745
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,920
Senior sister.

746
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,040
Don't worry.

747
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm very strong.

748
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
I don't know how to use the quilt.

749
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
That's good.

750
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Go to bed early.

751
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
Yummy.

752
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
Quiet.

753
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,440
Come in.

754
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,640
You freak.

755
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,000
You're a bitch

756
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,680
You can't escape from my reputation

757
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,240
I have a friend

758
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
No. BEAT

759
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,760

Help

770
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,220
Shut up!

771
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,340
Aren't you very strong?

772
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,880
You are a grown up.

773
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,220
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

774
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,840
Hush!

775
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,760
I have no nose.

776
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,480
Bye!

777
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,060
Senior.

778
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,960
Can you listen to my singing?

779
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,280
When I was a kid

780
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,320
Sister always sings to me.

781
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,160
I can't fall asleep.

782
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,840
Your sister can sing.

783
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,960
I can't.

784
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,600
I won't tell you about it.

785

Civil Vijja

787
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,440
We must share the money.

788
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,280
Small respond the small pavilion

789
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,320
Short connections

790
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,040
Don't disturb Xiaomofeng.

791
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,560
What are you doing here at night?

792
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm here to see Xiaomofeng.

793
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Are you worried that I can't take good care of Xiaomofeng?

794
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,520
I used to think so.

795
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,640
But now,

796
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,280
I realize my mistake.

797
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,040
Junior sister,

798
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,280
you're better than I thought.

799
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm leaving.

800
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,320
Rest early.

801
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,800
By the way,

802
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,160
your song is nice.

803
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,600
I like it.

804
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
She unjustly articles shut,

805
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,800
to save him.

806
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,680
He just...

807
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,400
As long as you can'tert it,

808
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,320
they all end.

809
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,840
If I can't,

810
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,640
I can't let you end it,

811
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,520
and then I could kill you.

812
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
But you're telling this to Pepper.

813
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,920
In a hurry.

814
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,760
Right?

815
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,280
Hey,

816
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,960
shall I kill you?

817
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,360
Alright.

818
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,640
And remember to

819
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:41,960
giving him candy.

820
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,960
But I was taught by the cold wind

821
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I only know that the heart is more precious than the ten years

822
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,960
In the last moment

823
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,960
It turns out that the most heart-wrenching is the past

824
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Each other's blood is like red dust

825
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Love can escape from heaven

826
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,960
I see the dream is like snow

827
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,960
In this moment, the sky is full of thorns

828
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,960
How many years have passed since then

829
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,960
The moon will fly away

830
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,960
You are the face that I want to see

831
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,960
I will not stop

832
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,960
You are the thread in the wind that holds me tight

833
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Since time has its own end

834
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Just say I'm crying

835
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,960
I will not give myself to you

836
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Give time to recall

837
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,960
You are the one I am willing to wait for all the way

838
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,960
My obsession

839
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,960
You are the one I can't cross this mountain pass

840
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Even if the world is wrong

841
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Please be honest

842
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I don't want to compromise

843
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Just for this moment
