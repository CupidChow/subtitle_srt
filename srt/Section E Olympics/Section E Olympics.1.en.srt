So did you see 1300?

196
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,455
Practice!

197
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,247
Like his height.

198
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,708
Okay, since Rory scored 1300...

199
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
Now, this is my boy.

200
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,129
Okay. We're gonna win this, right?

201
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,505
Am I right or not?

202
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,630
Yes.

203
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,091
So he said yes.

204
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,760
Now beat that!

205
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,555
Let's go!

206
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,474
Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

207
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,601
Do it for the girls, man!

208
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,935
[screaming]

209
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,019
Oh!

210
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,480
Let's go, Rory!

211
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,356
Come here, baby!

212
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,231
Game?

213
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,901
[chattering]

214
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Let's go.

215
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,532
Ooh!

216
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,078
Nice try.

217
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,912
Last turn.

218
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,663
What about you? How do you feel?

219
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,458
I was told to say that I was gonna beat 18.

220
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,965
Wow! He's building momentum!

221
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,926
Whoa!

222
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,553
It rings!

223
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,262
That's tough!

224
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
[makes ringing sounds]

225
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,556
There.

226
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,851
Twenty? We got 20.

227
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
[screaming]

228
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,479
Yey!

229
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,232
Jay-jay!

230
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,273
So Jay-jay...

231
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,483
You choose.

232
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,986
I want the same color as your hair.

233
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,613
Wow!

234
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,117
Okay. Now we're going to our last game.

235
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,786
We'll see if Keifer can catch up.

236
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,496
We'll see.

237
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,289
And for our last game...

238
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,375
Can Smash!

239
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
There you go.

240
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,294
[cheering]

241
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,897
So for the game mechanics...

242
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,631
We have two balls.

243
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,342
They just have to knock them down.

244
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,969
To win...

245
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,264
a huge prize!

246
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,347
[cheering]

247
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,523
I'll go first.

248
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:21,524
Yeah.

249
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,607
And yeah.

250
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,961
- This is Andres Muhlach.
- And yeah!

251
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,320
Hi, guys! This is Andres Muhlach.

252
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,281
Two tries to knock down...

253
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,448
Six cans.

254
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,490
Okay. Ready, guys?

255
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,326
Go! Go! Let's go, Keifer!

256
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,578
I'll go first.

257
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,744
Focus!

258
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,334
[laughing]

259
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,585
Okay.

260
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,504
Oh!

261
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,382
Focus!

262
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,926
Focus.

263
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,184
You thought.

264
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,312
Yeah!

265
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,146
Wow!

266
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,106
All one! All one!

267
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,608
- One-one.
- Tiebreaker.

268
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,150
One!

269
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:04,984
One-one!

270
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,735
Yes, Sir!

271
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,320
Yes, Red Rabin!

272
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,364
Four to go.

273
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,409
Wow!

274
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,451
We lost. We lost.

275
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,246
[cheering]

276
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,374
So you can hear the screams here in EK!

277
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,376
The winner for this round is...

278
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,378
Keifer!

279
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,838
[cheering]

280
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,134
Let's go!

281
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,762
Since Keifer won...

282
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,764
which stuffed toy do you want?

283
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,766
Ma'am, I want...

284
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,266
The whole stall?

285
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,561
Can I have that one?

286
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,022
Why pick the one hanging?

287
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,441
So how do we do this?

288
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,650
Can you reach it?

289
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,528
The pig one.

290
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,154
So here's your prize, Ma'am.

291
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,615
- 1, 500 only.
- Thank you!

292
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,493
That's 1, 500.

293
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,702
I don't have [money].

294
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,786
Alright, she has none.

295
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,080
Congratulations!

296
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,331
Congratulations to me!

297
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,457
I'm the winner!

298
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,375
Yes, Sir!

299
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,334
Yes, Sir!

300
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,293
What can you say, Ash?

301
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,044
What can you say?

302
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
I'm in tears!

303
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,213
Why?

304
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,798
Because I have so much to carry.

305
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,340
Because?

306
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,882
Because...

307
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,760
[stuttering]

308
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,929
You made me win.

309
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,346
And?

310
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,888
And...

311
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,641
I'm happy?

312
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,724
Because?

313
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,935
Because...

314
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,853
You made me win.

315
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,355
Ash, what's your favorite color?

316
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,856
Ash, what's your favorite color?

317
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,025
My favorite color is blue.

318
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,402
Whoa!

319
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,238
What is your favorite number?

320
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,949
My favorite number is 19.

321
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,492
Whoa!

00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:41,747
Yeah.

326
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,914
That's it. That's it.

327
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,584
I hope you guys enjoyed and...

328
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,834
