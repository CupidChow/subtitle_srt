1
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,150
 

2
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,110
I see.

3
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,330
I'll go see him that day and ask again.

4
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,900
Thank you, sir.

5
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,740
Bye now.

6
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,580
Who are you talking to so early?

7
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,280
It's the hospital.

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,550
It's time for my checkup.

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,850
Did you sleep well?

10
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,870
Why are you covering your face?

11
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,140
I feel so bare right now.

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,160
Get more sleep.

13
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,690
W-Where are you going?

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,150
I'm going to feed you.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
Did you set the rice yet?

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,940
Just wait. I'll make you breakfast.

17
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,530
Want me to do it?

18
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,690
I'm really good at measuring
the right amount of water.

19
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,670
Wait a second.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Dry your hair first.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,550
You'll catch a cold. Let's go.

22
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,280
But you're cooking.

23
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,900
I can do it myself.

24
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,170
I want to do it for you.

25
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,590
Stop being awkward. Just let me.

26
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,490
Okay.

27
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,240
You have a mole on the back of your neck.

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,050
Here. No, here.

29
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,550
It tickles!

30
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,360
You read the letter, didn't you? Traitor.

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,960
I told you to read it by accident.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,740
It was well written.

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,850
All the grammar was correct.

34
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,590
But the stationery paper seemed old.

35
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,650
The one who wrote the first part
and you are different people.

36
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,340
What are you doing today?

37
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,540
Practice making the bouquet.

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll write my remarks next to you, then.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,930
 Fighting! 

40
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,960
Take this.

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,390
- And...
- Thanks.

42
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,890
Nu Ri, let's do fighting.

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,100
Here.

44
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,520
One, two, three!

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,340
 Fighting! 

46
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,110
- Thank you.
- Go on in.

47
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,210
- Thank you!
- Good luck.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,010
I'll be back!

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,350
I'm nervous.

50
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,100
Should I go get some coffee?

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,470
You can have some alone time.
I'll drink mine there.

52
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,750
I'd like mine hot.

53
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,940
I'll have an English breakfast tea with milk,

54
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,210
without sugar, around 75 Â°F,
so I can drink it right away.

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,790
Please?

56
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,910
You never cease to amaze me.

57
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,280
Huh?

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,230
Noona.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,750
I got old, but I haven't grown up at all.

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,290
For most of my life, I have needed consolation.

61
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,590
You were someone who gave me that.

62
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,170
In the end, I'm by your side, anyway.

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,900
People probably think I'm pathetic.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,390
But I don't care what other people think.

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,230
As long as you don't see me that way.

66
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,420
Are you wearing the cologne I like?

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,190
Yeah.

68
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,250
I thought you'd like this scent
even if you're sick of me.

69
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,910
I am a little sick of you, that's true.

70
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,680
Liar!

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
You are so you,

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
and I am so me.

73
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm in a better mood now.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,020
Maybe this is why having kids is good.

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,010
You can make up quickly,
using the kid as an excuse.

76
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,880
Back then, we couldn't have done that.

77
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,920
Hey, I thought we were a real married couple now.

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,270
Are we? A real married couple?

79
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,100
What are you looking for?

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,670
I need materials for an English class.

81
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,000
Where's the foreign language section-

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,350
Oh, my! What the heck.

83
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,730
Gi Bbeum, why are you here?

84
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,070
I dropped by on the way to driving school.

85
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,940
I love that there's a bookstore near the office.

86
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,210
You must come here often,

87
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,690
instead of getting the driver's
license I asked for.

88
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,280
I keep failing the road test.

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,420
I'll get it soon, right?

90
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,630
The foreign language section is over there.

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,330
Gi Bbeum, what did you get?

92
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,720
Oh, well... what is it called-

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm here to get Tae Rin's magazine.

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,970
It's not out yet.

95
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,890
But that thoughtful attitude? Very delicious.

96
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,530
What did you get? Why are you hiding it?

97
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,730
Oh... actually...

98
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,800
I-I like cooking.

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,290
So, why are you hiding it? Are you embarrassed?

100
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,650
No, I'm proud, but...

101
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,800
older people say that a man cooking...

102
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,650
- will lose his manhood.
- I've never seen a study saying that.

103
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,510
Maybe I'm just uneducated.

104
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,160
I still can't find the materials, either.

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I said it's this way.

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,040
Director, you have no sense of direction.

107
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,540
Hey, you're here!

108
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,790
The security guard said

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,890
a man has been wandering about every night.

110
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,000
When you come and go, let me or Gi Bbeum know.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,700
- You never know.
- Okay.

112
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,060
Oh, when did you say the press conference was?

113
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,630
For "Famished for Love"?

114
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,950
In a few weeks-

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,220
Are you getting ready for the
promotional cycle already?

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,200
I should get ready in advance.

117
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I was so skinny during the shoot.
I can't look all puffy now.

118
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,490
- Looks good.
- What is?

119
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,250
When you glance like this.

120
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,910
Nu Ri!

121
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,590
Good job!

122
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,890
Say cheese!

123
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,190
Stand over there.

124
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,000
The background is nice. I'll take a picture.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,090
- Should we? Come over here.
- Goodness.

126
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,200
- Get ready.
- Okay.

127
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,570
One, two, three!

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,090
Good going.

129
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,860
They can't do milk tea without the sugar.

130
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,900
Just take out the sugar...

131
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,650
I'll take it. Thanks.

132
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
Isn't it heavy? Let me carry it for you.

133
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,120
- Thanks.
- I'm going to the restroom.

134
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,380
I'll drink the coffee afterward.

135
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,190
It's cooler now.

136
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,960
How did you do on the exam?

137
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Should I not ask?

138
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,450
Actually, I'm not sure.

139
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,410
My head was in a weird place the whole time.

140
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,490
Thinking about seeing my mom...

141
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,000
Art is born out of struggle.

142
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,400
So, you decided to see her.

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,910
I see.

144
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,370
Hae came to see me.

145
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,890
Wow, he was so mad.

146
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,710
Whoa. That's how he found out.

147
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,500
I got into a huge fight with him because of that.

148
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,110
What will you do now, Ahjussi?

149
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,100
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,800
I couldn't even hold onto the secret.
I hid it for no reason.

151
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,070
Your mom must be in a better place now.

152
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,460
That's when people start feeling the
longing that they've pushed away.

153
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,560
That's how I felt.

154
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:04,780
It would be too much to ask Hae
to forgive me, right?

155
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,700
Oh, well. If he's going to hate me anyway,

156
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,640
I'll just do everything I can for him.

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,220
While you're at it, be clever and strong.

158
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,310
Fight until the end, Ahjussi.

159
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,830
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,100
Should I have gone with preserved flowers?

161
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Real flowers wilt.

162
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,870
Esteemed guests...

163
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,830
Should I have gone with snowdrops?

164
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,790
If the ceremony is minimalist,
the bouquet should be simple.

165
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,620
Today's ceremony will be conducted
without an officiant...

166
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,280
No, no.

167
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,570
No.

168
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,550
Thank... Thank you for taking the time to come...

169
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,440
You don't care about me, Sung Je Yeon. Really...

170
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,580
Now, today's star.

171
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,620
Please welcome the bride with a round of applause.

172
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,160
Next, the groom will enter.

173
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,260
Groom, please enter!

174
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,690
Well, I'm making a bouquet,

175
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,590
and you're writing your remarks next to me.

176
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,540
I can't help but imagine this.

177
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,920
The groom enters first.

178
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,530
You made me mix up the order.

179
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,440
The bride is the star.

180
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,970
I guess you can focus even in moments like this.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,180
That's why you went to SNU.

182
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,700
Focus, focus.

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,810
Don't.

184
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,780
Just focus.

185
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,360
Be still.

186
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,620
Stop.

187
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,390
Stop.

188
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,220
Stop!

189
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,040
I said stop it!

190
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,540
All you want is my attention.

191
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,720
You don't want me to?

192
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,180
Just tell me. I will.

193
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,760
- Really?
- But what is this business card?

194
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,700
Did you get it at the chair delivery?

195
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,120
If you won't kiss me, just ignore me.

196
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,060
Okay.

197
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,840
Fine.

198
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,760
She wants to meet with me.

199
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,790
She asked about copyrights.

200
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,200
If you're okay with it,

201
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,560
it's better to sell it to her than scammers.

202
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,100
Also, she was famous in content production.

203
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,700
- When are you meeting her?
- I thought I'd meet her soon,

204
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,320
but you've made me reconsider.

205
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,900
Fine.

206
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,920
Sung Je Yeon.

207
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,510
Sung Je Yeon!

208
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,190
You're so annoying.

209
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,090
- You're so funny in a relationship.
- What's so funny?

210
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,250
What's so funny?

211
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,010
Wait. Who is that?

212
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,270
- I don't know.
- I thought your sister was coming home late.

213
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,280
I told her to hang out with that punk.

214
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,930
Stay here.

215
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,710
Hey, you're home.

216
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,670
Hyung, you can't just open my door
without letting me know.

217
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,470
I didn't want to come. Mom sent a package.

218
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,350
Take it and scram. This one goes in the fridge.

219
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,750
Hello.

220
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,000
Sorry. I came out of nowhere...

221
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,370
Hyung, I'm putting Nu Ri's stuff...

222
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,570
- here.
- What?

223
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,100
What?

224
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,140
- What is this?
- Hey, don't wag your finger at me.

225
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,940
What is going on?

226
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,570
You haven't seen each other in years!

227
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,640
Wow. Relationships are so...

228
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,620
Easy. So easy.

229
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,260
Easy?

230
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,170
We confessed our feelings a total of four times.

231
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,510
It took three rejections to finally date.

232
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,930
- Does that sound easy to you?
- I see.

233
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,050
Third time is a charm, huh?

234
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,470
Even Liu Bei only visited Zhuge Liang three times.

235
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,480
Really? Zhuge Liang?

236
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,500
What a fine man.

237
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,940
Hey, follow her.

238
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,270
She's just happy.

239
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,030
Wait a minute.

240
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,170
Seok Joo, want some tangerines?

241
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,350
You can eat all of Hae's, too.

242
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,690
Hyung, how have you been?

243
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,140
Is your restaurant still slow?

244
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,950
Does your company ever do staff dinners?

245
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,540
Groups are always welcome.

246
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,150
Sure.

247
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,570
That was nothing to brag about.

248
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,790
You told him about all the time we wasted?

249
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,180
I'm not as good as Zhuge Liang?

250
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,110
No, I just didn't like what Seok Joo was saying.

251
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,360
Was it easy for us to get together?

252
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,130
No.

253
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,930
I can't stay here any longer. I'm so embarrassed.

254
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
So...

255
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,340
how do I leave in a natural way?

256
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,500
 Okay. Then, let's pretend we fought. 

257
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,460
 But then Geon No will be concerned... 

258
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,500
 Let's say I had an emergency. 

259
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,530
 Why would you leave? They should leave. 

260
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,360
They don't know we can hear them, do they?

261
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,610
Gosh, he's smitten with her.

262
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,500
Something urgent came up.

263
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,520
I have to go.

264
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,340
See you later.

265
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,470
Hey. Are we having any more driving lessons?

266
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,500
I really have to pass this time. My mom found out.

267
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,490
Are you-

268
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,110
Are you blaming me for failing the test?

269
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,200
Do it yourself.

270
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,230
Sung Je Yeon!

271
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,460
- Are you okay going by yourself?
- Yeah. Sure.

272
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,070
Of course.

273
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,510
Bye.

274
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,050
See you later.

275
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,910
- Did you hear everything?
- So clearly.

276
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,010
I thought you wanted us to hear.

277
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,050
I want to be alone. Can you guys go?

278
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,140
We were planning on it, anyway. So lousy.

279
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,110
Hyung.

280
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,100
Can I have one of these supplements?

281
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,750
No! You have too much nutrition.

282
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,970
I might look good, but I'm an empty shell.

283
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,260
I told you, no!

284
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,650
It must be something really good.

285
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,550
Fine, have plenty.

286
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,370
Seok Joo doesn't know yet?

287
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,780
It's not good news. Why tell everyone?

288
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,930
I'll just scare him.

289
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,500
And you'll get caught like I caught you?

290
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,050
If you leave your meds like that,
he'll find out in no time.

291
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,070
I was going to take them earlier, and I forgot.

292
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,750
I have to go to the hospital, too.

293
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,360
Should I just go with Seok Joo?

294
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,960
Aigoo.

295
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,700
Long time no see!

296
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Long time no see!

297
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,800
- How have you been?
- Good.

298
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,930
I'm sorry to bug you on vacation.

299
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,370
It's for auditions for "A World Made of Ash 3."

300
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,220
You came in on a weekend, too. It's okay.

301
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,490
It's to pick high schoolers?

302
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,760
Yes. Your team has Sang Yeob

303
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,150
and some younger kids, so could you follow along?

304
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,090
Here's the audition script.

305
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,240
Got it.

306
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,570
Then, I'll need to rent a studio.

307
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,630
We'll do it the proper way.

308
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,010
Wow. I know I can count on you.

309
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,850
How have you been?

310
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,910
Have you been resting? You look happy.

311
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,520
Does it show?

312
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,360
I have some stuff I'm happy about.

313
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,570
Hey, how annoying. Come back soon. Here.

314
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,840
Got it.

315
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey.

316
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,210
Did you hear about Kongjwi and Patjwi?
It's a disaster.

317
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,170
The actress playing Patjwi suddenly quit.

318
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,440
Aigoo, weren't they already filming?

319
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,860
They're desperately trying to find a replacement.

320
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,140
Our company doesn't have someone who's right.

321
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,760
Sunbae, can I have the script for that?
You have it, right?

322
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,210
The female lead is a third-generation heiress

323
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,490
but in the beginning, she gives up
everything for love.

324
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,400
She'll go back and get her inheritance.

325
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,310
Part of her appeal is that she's rich.

326
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,430
Korean stories often feature chaebol,
which is a societal...

327
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,400
- Don't even think about critiquing society.
- Can I criticize?

328
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,000
My gosh! Let's just order lunch.

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,140
Tae Rin, salad?

330
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,640
I don't know!

331
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,040
Chicken feet.

332
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,940
Extra noodles.

333
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,090
Rice balls. No, fried in broth.

334
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,610
Wait! Wait.

335
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,640
I made these at home.

336
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,840
What? Gi Bbeum, are you a good cook?

337
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,270
Gosh, no. I just like to do it.

338
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,390
Tae Rin, yours is low-calorie.

339
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,040
Thank you, Gi Bbeum!

340
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,800
Looks so delicious!

341
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,650
Have this with it.

342
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,850
Amazing.

343
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,540
I wish the scripts we get were as amazing.

344
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,070
We'll get a good one again. At some point.

345
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,750
Again?

346
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,870
Thank you for the food, Gi Bbeum. So good.

347
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,620
So cold.

348
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,380
I finally bump into you.

349
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,730
What are you doing? Why-

350
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,710
Are you the peddler the security
guard was talking about?

351
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,700
Wow, I bought him three coffees.

352
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,320
- He made me into a peddler?
- You came three times?

353
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,690
This is the third time.

354
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,560
I got chewed out the first time
I was walking around.

355
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,360
I told him why I was here.

356
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,030
He even gave me some snacks.

357
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,840
Why didn't you just come in?

358
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,300
You know all of us.

359
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,650
That's why I couldn't.

360
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,400
Because this is about my personal life.

361
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,670
Give me your number.

362
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,530
I wanted to get it myself.

363
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,150
That's why you've been coming for days?

364
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,600
Weren't you cold?

365
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,340
Of course I was.

366
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,910
When are you free?

367
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,340
I'll check my calendar and let you know.

368
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Want a ride?

369
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,640
No. I have to get back to the office
to finish some stuff.

370
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,150
Bye.

371
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,690
What was that?

372
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,830
He's cute.

373
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,470
Sunbae, you know Kim An Min Books, right?

374
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,670
If you know the CEO's number...

375
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,000
Bankruptcy?

376
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Jail?

377
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,000
So, their publishing rights must be gone, right?

378
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,800
 What's the piece you want republished? 

379
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,350
 Let me look into it. 

380
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,560
There's a production company
that turns books into movies.

381
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,150
I think they probably dealt with the rights.

382
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,350
I'll handle it.

383
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,890
 

384
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
I know HR will process it.

385
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,380
But I wanted to see you and
give you a hand-written version.

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,440
That's from my trip.

387
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,890
You really wanted to get me a gift from a trip?

388
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,980
You don't hate me?

389
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,680
Six years at my first job.

390
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,340
There was much more joy than pain.

391
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,720
Including you.

392
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,050
I would have been sad if you had
just submitted it to HR.

393
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,950
I'll make sure to wrap up the last audition.

394
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,630
Je Yeon.

395
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,600
I really cared for you.

396
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,440
I know.

397
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,250
I hope you don't make yourself lonely.

398
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,750
 

399
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,290
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

400
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,600
Who am I supposed to learn from?

401
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,810
I emailed our team account
an updated employee manual.

402
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,070
Hello.

403
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,850
Hello.

404
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,710
Aigoo, hello. Here you go.

405
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,480
Have this and take good care of my noona.

406
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,560
Is that Hae's father?

407
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,640
I wanted to say hello.

408
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Yes, I am the CEO's boyfriend, no...

409
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,270
I mean, husband.

410
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,520
Nice to meet you.

411
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,370
It's okay.

412
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,030
There are more people in there, right?

413
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,100
Hello.

414
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,690
Oh, Hae's friend. Long time no see!

415
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,870
How have you been?

416
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,350
Have some bread.

417
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,970
Oh, thank you!

418
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,350
Why are you here?

419
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,460
What are you doing here? Who told you you could?

420
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,610
I told the receptionist I was your
husband, and they sent me right up.

421
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,540
You're even prettier at work!

422
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,280
Noona!

423
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,490
She's so pretty, isn't she?

424
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,480
Let's go inside.

425
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,320
Come on!

426
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,290
I want to say hello...

427
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,820
Everyone, fighting!

428
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,000
Fighting!

429
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,430
Hey! I still have these in my hands.

430
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,080
Am I supposed to find this cute or crazy?

431
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,040
Are you the publishing company CEO
coming by this afternoon?

432
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,980
I couldn't come empty-handed.

433
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,950
So, I just got some.

434
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,730
Noona, this one is quite good.

435
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,740
So, why are you here, CEO?

436
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,860
Oh, that...

437
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,730
Let's sit.

438
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,490
I heard the original book for the
movie you're producing is out of print.

439
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,270
We want to republish it.

440
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,690
Oh, your son's novel?

441
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,290
If we republish it when it gets
a theatrical release,

442
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,830
we can cross-promote it. It's not a bad idea.

443
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,710
But does he want to republish it?

444
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,300
I was going to prepare a proposal
before meeting with him.

445
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,470
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.
I wanted your permission first.

446
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,450
Why would I be uncomfortable? It's business.

447
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:59,000
I hope you can persuade the author.

448
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,160
I was prepared to persuade you!

449
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,700
That's why I brought snacks!

450
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,490
That had the opposite impact.

451
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,540
Don't ever do that again.

452
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,390
Oh, right.

453
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,370
I haven't passed around my handwritten letters.

454
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,850
- Let me go out for a sec.
- Hey.

455
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,280
Keep it close to your chest.
Don't pass them around. Please.

456
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,270
I stayed up all night...

457
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,040
Noona.

458
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,540
My goodness.

459
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,520
My noona...

460
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,980
Why are you studying so hard all of a sudden?

461
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,290
How did your exam go? Did you do well?

462
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,160
How would I know? The judges will decide.

463
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,630
What are you looking for?

464
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,640
Found it..

465
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,300
 

466
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,220
I want to give your mom some old photos.

467
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,030
You're so big now.

468
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,430
My goodness.

469
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,270
Cute.

470
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,140
You were so cute.

471
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,740
Stop it.

472
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,830
Do you know where she went?

473
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,500
- Stop it.
- I haven't seen her in forever.

474
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,390
- Really.
- Stop it.

475
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,690
Where is she? Nu Ri!

476
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,330
- Stop it!
- Nu Ri!

477
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,990
- What's wrong with you?
- Where are you? Nu Ri!

478
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,380
Nu Ri!

479
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,770
What? I didn't push you that hard.

480
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,930
Stop being so extra.

481
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,810
Wait.

482
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,550
Are you actually in pain?

483
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,020
Oppa.

484
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,660
What's wrong?

485
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,120
Who are you?

486
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,660
Excuse me. Have you seen Nu Ri?

487
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,080
She looks like this.

488
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,530
Seriously? Don't talk to me for a week.

489
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,690
What is wrong with you?

490
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,010
Excuse me, have you seen her?

491
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,910
Nu Ri! Time to come home!

492
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,990
Call me when you're done. I'll come get you.

493
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,190
- Nu Ri.
- Yeah?

494
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,530
Here.

495
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

496
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,370
You made it.

497
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,790
- Where's Sang Yeob?
- He's stuck in traffic.

498
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,680
Then, like I said in the group chat,

499
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,070
you'll be each other's scene partners today.

500
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,420
Each person will get an hour to rehearse.

501
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,030
Questions?

502
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,180
Team Leader, did you quit?

503
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,230
Yes. This is my last assignment.

504
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,850
I'll provide support for all your audition
schedules, so don't worry.

505
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,280
All right. Let's rehearse first.

506
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,050
It's me. What are you doing the
day after tomorrow?

507
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,810
What's up?

508
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,220
I'm not feeling well, so I have
to go to the hospital.

509
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,530
Can you go with me?

510
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,510
You're too old to need a guardian.

511
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,990
Are you going under anesthesia?

512
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,010
I can't drive anyway. You know that.

513
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,440
If I needed a ride, I wouldn't have called you.

514
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,510
Just come with me.

515
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,700
I have plans that day.

516
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,180
What time is your appointment?
I'll work around you.

517
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,710
I'll text it to you. Thanks.

518
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,230
Bye.

519
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,200
 

520
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,450
"Want to get in the vase instead of the roses?"

521
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,400
"And turn all red?"

522
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,130
 Director, when are you free? 

523
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,920
 I have something I'd like to discuss with you. 

524
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:19,130
Can I stay over with my mom today?

525
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,610
I just want to talk to her a little more.

526
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,250
Sure.

527
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,500
- Want a ride there?
- She brought her car.

528
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,730
Okay.

529
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,820
Eat something tasty with your mom.

530
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,660
I'll make sure to eat, too.

531
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,370
What are you doing? Go. She must be waiting.

532
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,700
- Bye.
- Eat something tasty.

533
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,650
 I even gave her a refund! 

534
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,660
 I'm the one who should be angry! 

535
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,250
She could do it.

536
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,650
 I should just! 

537
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,910
Who is it?

538
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,090
 Chicken feet delivery. 

539
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,360
What? I didn't...

540
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,830
Sunwoo Hae?

541
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,370
Delivery.

542
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,390
Oh, well...

543
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,650
Why are you... H-How did you get here?

544
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,230
I mean...

545
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,190
So, this is where you live.

546
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,390
Why did you come over without telling me?

547
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,480
You can't do that.

548
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
Here's your chicken feet.

549
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,090
I was debating what to get for
my first time coming over.

550
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,070
I guess you always need toilet paper. Thanks.

551
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,190
Seriously. What's going on? Out of the blue?

552
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,960
I missed you.

553
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,200
What? Don't make me get excited.

554
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,820
I need to finish watching something.

555
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,190
I won't take too much of your time.

556
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,310
I wanted to see your face before going home.

557
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,880
Nice. This just got delivered today.

558
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,060
I noticed you didn't have it at your place.

559
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,840
It's a necessity for modern life.

560
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,660
Take it while you're here.

561
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,280
What is it?

562
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,030
- A robot vacuum?
- Yup.

563
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,370
This is expensive...

564
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,530
No, I bought it for cheap on sale.

565
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,940
I can vacuum it myself.

566
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,280
Return it.

567
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,960
Really?

568
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,320
Come on.

569
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,290
I hear it makes cleaning really easy.

570
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,530
Sung Je Yeon, seriously...

571
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,250
I got this for you.

572
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,160
What?

573
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,470
What is this?

574
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,830
What is this? So pretty!

575
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,040
A spoon rest.

576
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,310
It's really cheap. Fifty thousand won.

577
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,190
What? This is 50,000 won?

578
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,900
Hey, you return this.

579
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,410
A spoon rest?

580
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,540
One second. I have to take this.

581
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,400
Hello.

582
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,720
I was just watching it.

583
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,080
Let's hop on a video call once I'm done.

584
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,840
Anyway, I know it's not luxurious, but sit.

585
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Want some coffee?

586
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,040
No.

587
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,560
Get back to work. I'll get going.

588
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,200
You know...

589
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,250
when is your doctor's appointment?

590
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,710
Want me to come with you?

591
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,810
I have a lot of time.

592
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,180
It doesn't look like it.

593
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,100
Don't worry. Seok Joo is going with me.

594
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,880
Then...

595
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,590
should we hang out afterward?

596
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,860
I'll buy you something delicious...

597
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,660
with the money I'll get once I return this.

598
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,700
Then, remember the restaurant I said I liked?

599
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,600
When I used to load packages?

600
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,100
Sounds good.

601
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,220
I'm really going now.

602
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,440
Bye.

603
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,600
Don't go.

604
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,100
- Hello!
- Hello.

605
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,320
Are you the only one here, Gi Bbeum?

606
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,900
They're smoking. Have a seat.

607
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,350
Hey.

608
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,590
You look great!

609
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,590
Really? I guess I'm kind of happy these days.

610
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,390
Why are you happy? I have an idea.

611
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,450
Come on.

612
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,710
Aigoo. One second. I'm getting a text.

613
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,250
 Forget about driving lessons. 

614
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,000
 I'll send you the stock info
I promised and be done with it. 

615
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,430
 See me after work. 

616
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,820
 Sounds good. 

617
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,810
Was that Kim Seok Joo?

618
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,710
Yeah, he owes me money.

619
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,030
Stop thinking about him.

620
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,600
He says he's my fan. How can I?

621
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,560
- He's your fan?
- Yes!

622
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,910
He was so shy to get a photo with you.

623
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,480
I'm done talking about Kim Seok Joo.

624
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,070
You heard about the Patjwi
actress who quit, right?

625
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,010
Can Tae Rin do it?

626
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,310
What do you think?

627
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,070
They already contacted me
to check Tae Rin's availability.

628
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,250
Kwon Do Eun plus Director Han Seok Won?

629
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,260
It would be sad to miss out on it.

630
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,440
It's a good script, so I wanted Tae Rin to do it.

631
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,740
Wow, we agree, for once.

632
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,820
But putting an actress in the middle of filming

633
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,840
is too much pressure for my actress.

634
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,850
But what if...

635
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,400
I want to do it?

636
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,080
What if she does?

637
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
Let's go.

638
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,260
Are you going to be okay?

639
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,090
I kept thinking about it, too.

640
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,750
If I meet with them and they don't like me,

641
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,960
I can't help it then.

642
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,350
Let's go.

643
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,850
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

644
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,810
Let's go!

645
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,100
You could've texted it to me.
Did we have to meet?

646
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,380
It's a conversation worth meeting for.

647
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,220
- It's good.
- Don't take such little bites!

648
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,900
Hey, watch and learn.

649
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,930
Put this on.

650
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,530
Dip this in the sauce,

651
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,150
with some bean powder...

652
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,260
When you're good at something,

653
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,040
you always show off, then cut yourself down.

654
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,890
Same with driving.

655
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,210
- So good.
- Geez.

656
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,150
Do you think I could work
in the entertainment industry?

657
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,580
You?

658
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,740
Don't even go there.

659
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,050
What? Are you serious?

660
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,310
If you're asking seriously...

661
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,080
Don't.

662
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,740
I know nothing is easy in this world,

663
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,050
but you don't have a thick skin
since you've been buried in books.

664
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,020
Just stick with staring at numbers.

665
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,970
Mom would never let me.

666
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,940
I shouldn't have run off that day.

667
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,710
Take back one move.

668
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,740
That won't cut it.

669
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,580
How many moves, exactly?

670
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,940
Hyung, I'm here!

671
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,800
Teacher! What are you doing here?

672
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,650
I wanted to eat Geon No's food.

673
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,200
I don't know when I'll get to.

674
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,200
- I'm going to Australia.
- Australia?

675
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,330
- What?
- Whatever!

676
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,400
I already booked my ticket.
Don't talk me out of it.

677
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,750
Goodbye, Korea!

678
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,200
Wait, y-you were serious about going?

679
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,730
- Huh?
- Teacher, don't go!

680
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,800
Don't go!

681
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,770
Oops. I spilled everything.

682
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,570
Geon No, what is wrong with you?

683
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,760
It's not like we see each other that often.

684
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,650
You came to drink makgeolli a few times.

685
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,180
I was proud and happy about it.

686
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,650
That's right. Just drink the makgeolli. Don't leave.

687
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,100
You can't even speak English!

688
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,840
Hey. Do you want the bookstore?

689
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,180
Go clean it up every once in a while.

690
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,800
I want to keep it since it was
my grandmother's dying wish.

691
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,350
No!

692
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,840
Gosh, that guy. Are you mad? Hey!

693
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,000
 You guys can come and visit Australia! 

694
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,740
 I'll become a surf master and wait for you! 

695
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,160
 - Geon No.
- Yes? 

696
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,710
 You spilled on purpose, didn't you? 

697
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,450
 Let's start over. 

698
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,860
Teacher!

699
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,190
Huh?

700
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,410
Can you make it alone?

701
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,840
You had way too much makgeolli.

702
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,010
You reek.

703
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,400
Let's go. I'll take you.

704
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,310
Gosh, come on! No! I'm so close.

705
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,340
Hey.

706
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,500
 

707
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,650
You kept telling me to clean out
the bookstore, so I did, and...

708
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,940
This is your work.

709
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,570
What if I miss you?

710
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,110
It's too far.

711
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,440
We can video chat.

712
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,160
Stop being so cheesy.

713
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,890
I'm leaving.

714
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,730
Let me take you.

715
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,460
Teacher!

716
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,900
 

717
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,210
 

718
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,610
How are you feeling these days?

719
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,930
Sensory abnormalities, dizziness?

720
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,130
It's a little frequent these days.

721
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,480
- You've been taking your medication, right?
- Yes.

722
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,810
You haven't thrown up after taking it?

723
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,910
No.

724
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:22,740
Here's information about a clinical trial.

725
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,000
It's not domestic.

726
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,010
Your case is quite rare.

727
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,250
A cure might be difficult,

728
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,470
but your symptoms could be managed.

729
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,150
Hey, Seok Joo.

730
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,570
Hey.

731
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,470
I thought it would be better to

732
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,980
hear it from a doctor than me trying to explain it.

733
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,320
Did that scare you?

734
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,170
Of course it did.

735
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,020
Does Nu Ri know that you're sick?

736
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,910
Nu Ri has her collegiate exam.

737
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,160
I can't disturb her studies.

738
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,160
It hasn't been long since it's progressed.

739
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,520
I've just known this day would come someday.

740
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,920
Just...

741
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,180
don't be too shocked if something happens.

742
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,420
Just because I know doesn't
mean I won't be shocked.

743
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,680
I'm just scared in advance. How could you-

744
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,560
Do you know why I liked you, Hyung?

745
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,850
Because you make my life more complicated.

746
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,420
Because you accept me as I am.

747
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,030
But...

748
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,520
if your life gets more complicated...

749
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,450
My life was rather simple at times.

750
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,520
Thanks to you.

751
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,500
Go.

752
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,910
I don't want you to see me like this.

753
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,520
Really?

754
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,830
Go, I said.

755
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:48,160
 The person you are calling is not available. 

756
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,140
 Are you sure this is the right address? 

757
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,790
 This is a hospital. 

758
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,450
Is he crying?

759
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,620
What do you want me to do?

760
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,690
 I have a lot of experience in crying. 

761
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,310
 Sometimes, I don't want someone to come up 

762
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,980
and ask me why I'm crying or comfort me.

763
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,070
I want them to leave me alone.

764
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,370
Then, I'll just do what I want.

765
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,360
It's cold. Your tears might freeze.

766
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,510
So cold.

767
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,960
So cold.

768
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,960
Do you...

769
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,100
drink?

770
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,870
Do you eat chicken feet?

771
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,240
Yes.

772
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,240
Real chicken feet?

773
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,960
 You have arrived at your destination. 

774
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,240
Are you sure this is it?

775
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,980
Yeah. GPS says it is.

776
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,140
It doesn't look like they expanded, does it?

777
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,130
Did it close?

778
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,050
I mean, it wasn't very good.

779
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,900
- You said it was!
- Let's just say it wasn't.

780
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,320
- What kind of place?
- Home-cooked meals.

781
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,470
What? That sounds so good.

782
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,170
What kind of side dishes? What was the entrÃ©e?

783
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,210
Calm down. Let's go inside.

784
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,190
You're hungry.

785
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,030
Thank you.

786
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,560
I got ice cream, too.

787
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,350
Good job.

788
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,010
So you had time, even on a weekday.

789
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:16,480
Yeah. I'm free, except for getting
ready for one audition.

790
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:22,040
Aren't you curious why I have free time?

791
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,590
I am.

792
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,670
If it's about you, I'm so curious.

793
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,230
I...

794
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,310
quit my job.

795
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:38,420
- What?
- I ended on a high note, so don't worry.

796
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,130
I am worried.

797
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,020
How will I feed you?

798
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,670
You eat so much.

799
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,300
Just don't let me starve.

800
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,850
I like white rice.

801
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,820
Can't believe that home-cooked meal place is gone.

802
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,990
They served white rice.

803
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,890
I thought if I quit,

804
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,300
I would feel lost again.

805
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,990
But for some reason, I feel...

806
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,910
You seem...

807
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,030
relieved.

808
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,560
Yeah.

809
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,830
I think so.

810
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:30,900
Of course, I don't know what's at the end
of my unemployment journey.

811
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,450
But...

812
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,500
I have you.

813
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:42,470
If I have one landmark,

814
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:45,780
that's not a bad milestone.

815
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm a landmark?

816
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,190
No, the Bulguksa Temple.

817
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,630
How can that be your milestone? Should be me.

818
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,250
Wait.

819
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,990
Who is it?

820
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,200
Sang Yeob. He's the real deal.

821
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,070
I feel grateful.

822
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,000
It's nothing.

823
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,300
"Noona, thank you for your hard work.

824
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,280
I'm going to get this part.

825
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,660
See you on the day, fighting!"

826
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,940
Did the "fighting" need a heart emoji?

827
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,670
He still hasn't gone to the military yet?

828
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,950
He should do one more project before he goes.

829
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,070
If that's "A World Made of Ash 3," all the better.

830
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,780
Can the original author be involved in casting?

831
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,120
No.

832
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,430
I should have put that in the contract.

833
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,280
Don't respond.

834
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,890
If you do, when he marches in the military,

835
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,700
he'll think about you. Don't.

836
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,870
You okay with that? It's not okay with me.

837
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,360
He's a kid!

838
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,850
It's business.

839
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,750
Fine, I'll reply while you watch.

840
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,970
"Sang Yeob, good job..."

841
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,250
It's fine. I'm not looking.

842
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,970
Where's our food?

843
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,280
Let me go check. Get it done before I come back.

844
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,410
Got it.

845
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,740
Also, no paragraphs.

846
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,560
Short answers only.

847
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,840
Aigoo, a military march?

848
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,820
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

849
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,120
What's wrong? Are you dizzy?

850
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,780
Yeah.

851
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,150
I think my blood sugar is low.

852
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,460
Go ahead and start eating.

853
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,920
I'm going to go wash my face.

854
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,200
I don't know if my blood sugar
is low or if I'm sleepy.

855
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,710
I'll feel better once I wash my face.

856
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,640
Do you need me to come with you?

857
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,010
Where? The men's room?

858
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,270
Yes. I've wanted to go since I was little.

859
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,700
Please stay here.

860
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,820
Don't wait outside, either.

861
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,750
I'll be right back.

862
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,900
 The restroom is out of order. 

863
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,770
 I have to go somewhere kind of far. 

864
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,810
It's not here?

865
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,000
Hello, how many restrooms are there here?

866
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,510
One on every floor. No key code.

867
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,840
Are any of them out of order?

868
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,150
No, they're all usable.

869
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,390
Thank you.

870
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,350
Thank you.

871
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,930
 â« Can we go back? â« 

872
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,980
 â« Everything was clumsy â« 

873
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,690
 â« But we were shining brightly â« 

874
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,820
 â« Our first season â« 

875
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:22,170
 â« If only we can go back â« 

876
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,100
 â« Let's not be so clumsy â« 

877
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:34,060
 â« I will tell you â« 

878
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,390
 â« And promise that I will stay
by your side for a long time â« 

879
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,100
Welcome back.

880
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:49,820
 â« A cool breeze on my cold heart â« 

881
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,610
Don't be mad.

882
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,850
Stay calm and listen to me.

883
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,030
Something actually happened.

884
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,840
It's too big here,

885
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:08,390
and I haven't been here before.

886
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,450
I was lost for a long time.

887
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,600
That's why I said I'd go with you.

888
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,330
You have no sense of direction, do you?

889
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,400
Yeah. That's right.

890
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,220
Next time, I'll do what you say.

891
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,370
But still, not the men's restroom.

892
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,840
I won't.

893
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,280
I'm not curious anymore.

894
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,090
It's snowing.

895
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,470
You're right.

896
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:48,030
 â« If I go back to the shadows â« 

897
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,800
Right.

898
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,500
It must be the first snow of the season.

899
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,340
Must be.

900
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,950
 â« Forever â« 

901
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,290
 Noona, it's snowing. 

902
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,320
 I recommend looking out the
window, not papers. 

903
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,310
It's snowing.

904
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,710
 Do you think it will pile up? 

905
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,270
 If it does, let's make a snowman together. 

906
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,730
 Sure. 

907
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,500
The whole world is turning white.

908
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,310
- Thank you.
- Enjoy. Thank you.

909
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,110
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

910
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,650
Kitty, let's eat.

911
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,660
Gi Bbeum, aren't you hungry?

912
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,530
I thought you were going to finish that today.

913
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,410
After I eat.

914
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,510
I'll finish it after I eat.

915
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,410
Have this while you're reading.

916
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:48,340
I brought a meal with balanced macros.

917
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:52,120
I'm so excited Tae Rin might
finally have a project.

918
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,180
You might think I won't get
annoyed at genuine goodwill.

919
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,540
But I'm not like that.

920
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,360
It's snowing!

921
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,010
Watch the snow and cheer up.

922
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,340
Just 10 minutes.

923
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,170
I'm not religious, but...

924
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,840
who makes snow come down?

925
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,100
I'd like to thank him.

926
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,790
Wow!

927
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,350
Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

928
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,010
One, two, three!

929
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,350
How did you eat that entire plate?

930
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,310
This is one serving.

931
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,990
I had a few bites, and it was gone.

932
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,300
Want anything from the menu?

933
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,670
If you do, I wish you would read it out loud.

934
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,510
Fish cake soup.

935
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,540
That's it?

936
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,920
I wish you would want to eat more.

937
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,090
Skewers, 12,000 won.

938
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,240
Rolled eggs, 8,000 won. Cheese is extra.

939
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,430
Pressed pork, chicken feet...

940
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,780
You just had chicken feet.

941
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,250
You're funny.

942
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,110
Why are you making me read these out loud?

943
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,050
You laughed.

944
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,320
You must be in a better mood.

945
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,720
Please pick out some dishes
while you're in good mood.

946
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,040
This isn't because I'm in a better mood.

947
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,670
I wanted to hold your hand today, no matter what.

948
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,050
Are we ready?

949
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,120
- Of course not.
- Then, what are we doing?

950
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,400
Cheers!

951
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,030
 â« I feel nervous, but I don't know why â« 

952
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,500
 â« Faint butterflies in my stomach â« 

953
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,890
 â« The edge of a familiar memory â« 

954
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,880
The snow is piling up tonight.

955
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,670
What if the roads freeze over?

956
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,600
I know.

957
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,900
Ho! Ho! Ho!

958
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,380
I remember.

959
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,530
You used to do that way back then, too.

960
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,600
So, I would get better soon.

961
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:14,230
 â« When I look at you blankly â« 

962
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,930
Do it like this.

963
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,170
With your breath, not your voice.

964
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:26,290
 â« The red sunset â« 

965
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:34,610
 â« Night and day meet briefly â« 

966
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,700
We look so stupid.

967
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,440
What? I'm not stupid.

968
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,770
That's what stupid people say.

969
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:54,140
I think I get it now.

970
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,950
When you're so happy...

971
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,750
it can feel scary.

972
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,450
No matter when or where I might have met you...

973
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,190
I wouldn't have done anything differently.

974
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:37,330
I couldn't have undone how I feel about you.

975
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:40,840
 â« Assuming it's you â« 

976
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,200
 â« Your light smile â« 

977
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:50,240
 â« Stain called you that I never erased â« 

978
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,670
 â« Some memories â« 

979
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:05,930
 â« I lean on them gladly â« 

980
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:12,590
 â« The horizon â« 

981
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:19,520
 â« The red sunset â« 

982
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,380
 â« Night and day meet briefly â« 

983
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:34,790
 â« Like us from back then â« 

984
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:40,390
 â« Like falling into it â« 

985
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:45,870
 â« Pretending not to know and embrace â« 

986
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,360
 What do we do? 

987
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,770
 You have to go, no matter what. 

988
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:53,820
 To get better, do you have to go far away? 

989
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,000
 What do I do? What do we do about Oppa? 

990
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,860
 Even if I die, I want to stay here. 

991
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,750
 With my people. 

992
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:08,110
 I don't want to say bye to Hae. 

993
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,700
 What if something happens to him there? 

994
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:17,210
 Some moments still feel and
perhaps will always feel 

995
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,430
 as if they are happening right now.
