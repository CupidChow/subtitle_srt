1
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:50,107
 

2
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,617
 The customer can't answer the call... 

3
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:24,727
Taxi!

4
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:41,917
Ahjussi, you dropped your phone.

5
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:44,797
Thank you.

6
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,417
 

7
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:03,317
I got a call from Sung Je Yeon
saying she's here.

8
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:06,867
I'll check. Please wait over there.

9
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,717
Are you patient Sung Je Yeon's
guardian? We spoke on the phone.

10
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:12,107
Yes, yes. How's Je Yeon?

11
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:14,267
She needs surgery right away
for acute appendicitis.

12
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,707
Follow me.

13
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:17,067
Okay.

14
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:51,007
I'm glad. So glad...

15
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:57,657
Go away. I don't want to see you.

16
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:00,677
Are you okay?

17
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:02,497
Want me to call the doctor?

18
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:05,797
I just took painkillers.

19
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:10,837
Why are you crying?

20
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,937
I'm sorry, Je Yeon.

21
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,717
It's all my fault...

22
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:29,427
I thought I was going crazy, worried
that something had happened to you.

23
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,177
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,957
Sorry for getting upset.

25
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:41,467
You fool, you let your imagination run.

26
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,167
I'm...

27
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:49,397
not the person you think I am.

28
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,267
And I can't be that person.

29
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:57,997
 Still, you wouldn't bet on misfortune. 

30
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,817
 If it's you that I know. 

31
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:05,047
I always bet on the losing side...

32
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,167
like an idiot.

33
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,047
I'm the one who can't be without you.

34
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:18,947
Then, why don't you become the
person that I think you are?

35
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:24,867
Be the person that I think you are.

36
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,737
Where are you, anyway?

37
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,467
Always all alone...

38
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:35,617
Leaving me behind.

39
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:41,017
Unless you're going to take me with you,

40
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,227
come back.

41
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:45,657
- And-
- I'll stay with you.

42
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,427
I'll stay with you...

43
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,767
Promise.

44
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:26,077
Seal.

45
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,397
Copy.

46
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:40,277
- I'll get the doctor.
- No, no. Don't go.

47
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:43,387
Don't go. Just stay here.

48
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,407
Stay with me...

49
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:50,497
 

50
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:53,347
Did the flower shop go bankrupt?

51
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:54,567
Do you know anything?

52
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:58,137
Instead of worrying about that, solve this again.

53
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,397
My practical exam for photography is coming up.

54
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,947
But it takes over two hours one-way on the bus.

55
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,087
I need to rent the camera and lenses
and carry them with me.

56
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,907
Ask your brother for a ride.

57
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,377
Keep the practical exam a secret
from Sunwoo Hae until I pass.

58
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:13,917
If these two numbers are the same...

59
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,867
You're in charge of my college admissions!

60
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,937
I'm doing what you said,
but my grades aren't improving!

61
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:22,017
Why are you blaming me for your stupidity?

62
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:27,457
Lucky you for inheriting a smart
brain from your mom.

63
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:31,297
How is your mom these days?

64
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,087
Is she doing well?

65
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:38,127
Why are you asking? You don't have
any fond memories of her.

66
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:08,657
Hey, don't touch those things.

67
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,387
It's a camera. For taking photos.

68
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,927
It's Chan's.

69
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,217
You're pretty.

70
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:24,667
You have great taste.

71
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,167
- Want to try snapping a photo?
- Yes, I do.

72
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,087
Okay.

73
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:41,547
Press the round button here.

74
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,017
Can you see?

75
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,597
 She gave me the camera I'm using now. 

76
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,057
 That's why I like her. 

77
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:05,237
We share our own special memories.

78
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,527
Daebak.

79
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,737
She stopped talking to me when I brought you home.

80
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:11,447
While you two were having fun.

81
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,957
How nice. Why don't you ask her for a ride?

82
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:16,047
Gosh, you're so petty.

83
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:20,567
I'm just asking for a ride
so I can do well on the exam.

84
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,067
Gosh, I got it.

85
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,037
I'll make sure to drive you there.

86
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,087
Don't- Don't worry.

87
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,007
- You're serious, right?
- I said I got it.

88
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:35,167
 

89
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:39,157
Hyung, when are you coming home? Hurry.

90
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:41,557
I can't come home today.

91
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,607
I'm dealing with something.

92
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,867
Let Nu Ri know.

93
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,777
And feed her.

94
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,567
For about two days.

95
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,227
- I'm hanging up.
- Hey-

96
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,967
Feed me? I'm all grown up. How embarrassing.

97
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,867
- I'm about to turn 20.
- That's what I'm saying.

98
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,297
He took care of himself ever since he was little,

99
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,997
and he treats us like we're
helpless babies. Right?

100
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,327
And he dares to spend the night away from home?

101
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,717
You went through a lot.

102
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:30,467
Yeah...

103
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:35,287
Don't you need to call the office?

104
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:38,027
Oh, right. The office...

105
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:41,237
 You have to quit being a manager. 

106
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:43,967
I'm on vacation, anyway...

107
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:47,187
Head back home before it gets too late.

108
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,647
Deliver the chairs, too.

109
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,957
I need to score some points with you.

110
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,927
Where would I go when you're sick?

111
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,817
I'll go back and forth, taking care
of you until you're discharged.

112
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:00,927
I'd feel so bad if you did that.

113
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,737
You really won't go?

114
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,977
Yeah. I'll stay by your side.

115
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:10,687
What will you do by my side?

116
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,817
What do you want me to do?

117
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,517
Stroke my hair like earlier.

118
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,477
Sleep.

119
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:57,027
What brings you here so late?

120
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,357
I fell asleep...

121
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:03,667
I'm glad you're here.

122
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:07,467
Is there anything you want? Or anything you need?

123
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:14,007
Turns out I tried to bring you in
without offering any real perks.

124
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,307
I'm trying to offer something to coddle you.

125
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:21,237
Just threaten me instead or issue an ultimatum.

126
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:22,967
That's your specialty.

127
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,567
Think about it as a recruiting offer.

128
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,897
You can even start from the bottom.

129
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,907
Why would you want me anyway?
How can you trust me?

130
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:35,507
If I can't trust you, that makes my life a failure.

131
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:41,467
You don't measure your life's
success by your child, though.

132
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,587
Oh, you caught me.

133
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,777
Maybe I drank too much.

134
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:55,507
I understand everything you said, CEO.

135
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,777
A CEO has to make decisions like that.

136
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:06,097
Do people in your generation
generally love to understand?

137
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:10,987
I wish you'd just do what I say.
So I can keep you close.

138
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:13,967
You have someone who listens to you.

139
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,197
Who? Chan?

140
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,237
Yeah, right.

141
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,517
Sure, he might listen to me,

142
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:22,867
but his heart is not in it.

143
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,517
Sounds like there's trouble.

144
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,557
 I needed comfort. 

145
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:30,257
 You're not someone like that. 

146
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,247
Am I really...

147
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,807
the problem?

148
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:43,467
I don't want anything. But I need your help.

149
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,957
A student is about to take a practical exam.

150
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:48,307
But it's a four-hour round trip by bus.

151
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:51,967
If you help me with this, I'll consider it.

152
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,047
Seriously.

153
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:55,507
- Wait-
- I don't have a driver's license.

154
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,577
Just give her a ride.

155
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,147
At your age?

156
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,677
Why did you buy a car, then?

157
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,937
- I thought I'd get it in no time.
- Gosh...

158
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:09,617
You are my son, but...

159
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:13,247
And what do you mean by a student?

160
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,487
- Your brother left home?
- Yeah.

161
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,307
I'm also going to run away as of now.

162
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:27,497
First, I'll sleep at Min Gyeong's.

163
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:28,937
I'll keep going to school and

164
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,487
I'll ignore all of Sunwoo Hae's phone calls.

165
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:33,987
Right. If your teacher calls your
brother, he'll find out you ran away.

166
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,367
But wait. Don't you need him to find out?

167
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,727
I've never even thought about living
with someone other than Oppa.

168
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,947
And he dares not come home?

169
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,237
Eat slowly.

170
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:47,857
Sa Rang.

171
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,977
Hey! Choi Gi Bbeum.

172
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,877
The house is a pig sty without you.

173
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:54,477
Clean up, then, you pig.

174
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,337
Did you bring the suit without Mom noticing?

175
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,507
Yeah.

176
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,657
- Hello.
- Hello.

177
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:00,817
- Choi Gi Bbeum.
- Yeah?

178
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,447
Lend me some money.

179
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:03,897
How could you...

180
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:06,327
I still live at a friend's place.

181
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,907
I took some cash out for you, anyway.

182
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,327
- Thank you.
- I'm here to run an errand for the CEO.

183
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,697
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

184
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,007
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

185
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,697
Hello. I'm here to pick up a to-go order.

186
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,927
Why was he kicked out?

187
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,517
He left the college he worked his ass off
to get into, and came back to Korea.

188
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,437
He says he's not cut out to study.

189
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,797
That's like my brother.

190
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,467
Bye.

191
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,527
 I don't have a driver's license, 

192
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,867
 so I asked that ahjumma you share memories with. 

193
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,597
 Please send the schedule. 

194
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,517
So, he doesn't have a license.

195
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,047
Ahjumma is so cool.

196
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,387
But I think it'd be awkward
if it's just me and her.

197
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:56,567
Ask Seok Joo to come with you.

198
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,827
Gosh, Choi Sa Rang. You're so smart.

199
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:03,317
Are you sure you left your passport here?

200
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,567
I don't see it.

201
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,697
 Gosh, where could it be? 

202
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,857
 Does Je Yeon have it? 

203
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:11,557
That makes sense.

204
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:15,677
She's holding onto it, so you can't go anywhere.

205
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,567
Excuse me. Anyone here?

206
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:19,977
Who is that?

207
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,227
Go work out.

208
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,077
Hello.

209
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,017
What's up with Je Yeon?

210
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,757
I can't believe she got appendicitis
while out of town.

211
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:34,967
Gosh, look at me. Let me give
you my business card.

212
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,577
I parked my truck where you said to park.

213
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,797
Do you want to move the chairs now?

214
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:40,957
Oh, yes.

215
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,397
Okay.

216
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,727
I enjoyed the show.

217
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,607
I read the article, too.

218
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:51,627
I heard you're the original author
of "A World Made of Ash," Bebop.

219
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:53,497
Yes.

220
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,477
I'm Bang Han Na.

221
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,517
Hello.

222
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,187
Mr. Jin Mu Yeong?

223
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:03,087
Hi.

224
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,167
I watched all the "A World Made of Ash" movies.

225
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,117
I've even transcribed your book.

226
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,887
The writing is cynical and pessimistic

227
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,387
but the outlook is actually warm at its core...

228
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:15,967
Did I do that?

229
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,747
I believe real works of fantasy must
reflect the worldview concept

230
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:22,127
instead of stopping at setting up the background.

231
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,207
C-Can I have a handshake?

232
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,967
Oh, sure.

233
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,827
Thank you for your kind words.

234
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,007
- Yes.
- But...

235
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,117
This is our employee, Choi Gi Bbeum.

236
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,987
- I see. Hello.
- Hi.

237
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,747
Should we move the chairs
if the fan meeting is over?

238
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,107
- Yes.
- Holding an ethical line

239
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:41,937
while revealing secular desire...

240
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:44,517
That exquisite setup...

241
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:47,117
Time to stop, Gi Bbeum.

242
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,437
Have you eaten?

243
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,017
We'll be eating soon. Would you like to join?

244
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:59,327
It's okay. I'll take off after helping
you move the chairs.

245
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,167
By chance...

246
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:04,617
do you have other copyrights to your other novels?

247
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:07,177
This market is all about owning
intellectual property.

248
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:10,847
Your work has been adapted for the screen.

249
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,377
And you have fans like him.

250
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:17,817
I'd like to discuss copyrights with you sometime.

251
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,017
But I don't know that area too well.

252
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:23,237
I know it well.

253
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:26,267
I'll visit your flower shop to pick up a plant.

254
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,507
I'd like a tea.

255
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,457
Yes, got it.

256
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,537
I'm home.

257
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,357
Hey.

258
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:46,507
Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:50,527
I told you so many times that perilla oil
tastes better than sesame oil for that.

260
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,967
 

261
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:58,827
Okay...

262
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,907
Give me some. Ah.

263
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,957
Hey...

264
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:17,647
I told you to put perilla oil in this dish.

265
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,567
Nu Ri prefers sesame oil.

266
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,877
Seriously.

267
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:22,677
Did you fight with Nu Ri?

268
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,927
She's quite upset.

269
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,667
Nu Ri's biological mother visited.

270
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,227
I...

271
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,347
told her to go live with her.

272
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,407
Why are you telling me something so crucial now?

273
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,677
You didn't even talk it over with me.

274
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:43,027
I was not in my right mind then.

275
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:44,167
I'll fix the situation.

276
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,787
I thought I had a hand in raising Nu Ri.

277
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,747
Aigoo. With grades like hers?

278
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,667
You had a hand?

279
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:56,777
Look at me now. Who took time off
to come and take care of her?

280
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,267
Me.

281
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,687
Anyway, you always act like
you're carrying all the burden.

282
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:04,557
Anyway, you always take all the credit.

283
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,627
I paid you for tutoring her. Didn't I?

284
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:10,547
You gave it to me to spend on transportation.

285
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,487
You're the one taking all the credit.

286
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,677
Just season it well.

287
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:15,987
It's salty!

288
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,397
Wow, he's so shameless.

289
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,447
 I'm busy! 

290
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,407
 Nice! 

291
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:36,057
Nu Ri, I've been thinking about this.

292
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,937
Why did you run away from home again?

293
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,827
You wanted to make a point.

294
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:41,457
That's right.

295
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:43,877
To show how upset and angry I am.

296
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,967
But Hyungnim is busy right now.

297
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,867
Wouldn't it be effective to do it when
he's less busy? So, he can notice you?

298
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:54,527
Go home today, and show him
after the college entrance exam.

299
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,497
Nu Ri, what do you think?

300
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,477
Huh? Huh?

301
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,467
What is that?

302
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,737
Hey, you're so...

303
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,107
Thank you, Sa Rang.

304
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,617
Let's get back to studying.

305
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,127
I'll take you home after the online lecture.

306
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:16,957
Got it. Let me run to the restroom.

307
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,347
A chance to score some points with Hyungnim.

308
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:29,237
 

309
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,857
 

310
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:39,407
 

311
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:46,397
Aren't you getting notifications on your phone?

312
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,807
Huh? Is it mine?

313
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,947
I think so.

314
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:00,217
It's the flower shop's SNS.

315
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,707
I said we're closed, but I keep getting messages.

316
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:03,477
Let me check real quick.

317
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:06,987
 Hyungnim, I'm Nu Ri's friend,
Choi Sa Rang. We met last time. 

318
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:09,677
 Nu Ri is with me right now, so don't worry. 

319
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:11,227
 I'll get her home not too late. 

320
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,027
These kids...

321
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:14,507
What's wrong?

322
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:17,347
 

323
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:19,777
Oh, the tall kid?

324
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:23,487
Yeah, he is very tall.

325
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:24,877
Yeah.

326
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,317
But how do you know him?

327
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,467
Oh, in front of your house...

328
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,607
In front of my house?

329
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:39,407
I meant, far away from your house.
I bumped into him.

330
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,597
You kept him a secret from me?

331
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:49,307
Well, it's your sister's personal life...

332
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,587
- Geez.
- You're getting comfortable with me.

333
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:58,237
No, since it's my sister's personal life.

334
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:06,767
Aren't you hungry?

335
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,497
- Should we order ramen?
- Let's break up.

336
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:10,857
What?

337
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:14,787
You didn't know I manage the
flower shop account with him, did you?

338
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:17,087
I hate guys who do things behind my back.

339
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,017
No, it's not that... Nu Ri...

340
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,487
Nu Ri, I'm sorry.

341
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,527
I didn't want your brother to worry.

342
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:25,367
Nu Ri. Nu Ri, I'm sorry.

343
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:29,927
Can't believe you didn't even
watch the first episode.

344
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,717
Can't believe it's the last episode already.

345
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:37,327
How come you don't monitor a show you're on?

346
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:40,687
The show itself wasn't that important to me.

347
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:43,557
Aren't you curious how you look on the show?

348
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:44,947
How can you not watch it?

349
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,987
I told you.

350
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:49,997
It was enough that I got to
see you a few more times.

351
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:53,837
 I went on the show because 

352
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,617
 I thought I'd be able to see you more. 

353
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,757
Did you really mean that?

354
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,177
Who do you think I am?

355
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,197
Sweet talk knows no bounds.

356
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:10,407
Come on. But you didn't give in to my sweet talk.

357
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:13,667
You rejected me right off the bat.
What are you saying?

358
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:18,267
Let's stop arguing against ourselves
and focus on the show.

359
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,777
Thank you.

360
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,257
Huh?

361
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:41,137
For reminding me that

362
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,247
at this very moment, I'm doing all right

363
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,297
and doing my best

364
00:23:52,337 --> 00:23:55,927
with good people, regardless
of what I was like in the past.

365
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:13,187
I wish there were a TV where your mom is.

366
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,547
That'd be nice.

367
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:21,597
There's a letter-writing scene.

368
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:24,367
Did you write to your mom?

369
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,817
Huh?

370
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,827
What, what, what?

371
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,297
You.

372
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:37,217
I wrote it to myself.

373
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,547
You weren't focusing, then, huh?

374
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:42,837
I was focusing on the present.

375
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:46,227
I see. Is that so?

376
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,477
Sung Je Yeon.

377
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:03,887
What?

378
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:10,727
 ♫ Thoughts of you spill out ♫ 

379
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:13,867
 ♫ I try to swallow it back ♫ 

380
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:18,917
I keep thinking if a guy like me is right for you.

381
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,727
I admit that I do have those foolish thoughts.

382
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:29,237
 ♫ Hiding in the time that's slipping away ♫ 

383
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,777
But I don't think I can part ways with you

384
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:35,577
for the second time.

385
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,567
I want to do everything with you.

386
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,727
I have no idea...

387
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:52,757
what will happen going forward,

388
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:55,207
how much we'll hurt, and

389
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:59,397
how upset we'll be.

390
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:07,527
 ♫ A piece of my heart falls off
just by taking a deep breath ♫ 

391
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:11,657
But still, let's do it all together.

392
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,907
Okay.

393
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:17,937
 ♫ In the end, I'd sweep up all the pieces of you ♫ 

394
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:20,287
I'll try to be

395
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,967
the person you think I am.

396
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,527
Sounds good.

397
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:37,637
 ♫ I'm running away once again in your memories ♫ 

398
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,107
 ♫ Alone ♫ 

399
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:43,057
Get excited.

400
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:44,697
Don't be surprised.

401
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,177
Okay.

402
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:20,267
Noona, isn't this fun?

403
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,617
You suggested it.

404
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,957
I did...

405
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:30,277
And your bubbles are way bigger and better, too.

406
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:35,777
No. I'm having fun.

407
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:38,747
Should we do it again? Let's do it one more time.

408
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:40,467
Okay, let's go again.

409
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:41,917
Okay.

410
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,737
Wow!

411
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,507
It's been a while.

412
00:27:58,747 --> 00:28:03,727
I need to work on the guitar riff
at the studio today for the new album.

413
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,437
But the members won't listen to me.

414
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:10,337
Aigoo, must've been tough for my Min Kyu. Oh, no.

415
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:13,687
It's okay. I'm glad I got to see you.

416
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:18,707
Oh, right. You mentioned you're
looking for an accountant.

417
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:21,467
Our engineer's brother is an accountant.

418
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:25,067
- Want me to introduce you?
- I already found one.

419
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:27,917
I did, but...

420
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:31,647
Well, something happened.

421
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:36,677
Wait, maybe not? Maybe nothing happened.

422
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:41,057
What's up, all of a sudden?
Why so serious? That's no fun.

423
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,917
What's going on, all of a sudden?

424
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:50,907
I thought we said we'd just be friends.

425
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:54,877
Well, can't we just go for it?

426
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,677
Let's leave. I'm tired.

427
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,887
 Just blow bubbles together? No ulterior motive? 

428
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:05,167
All right. Nice.

429
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,257
Look.

430
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,597
Hold the glasses lightly.

431
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:11,297
There we go. Good.

432
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:14,717
Good. Love the vibes. Good.

433
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:16,357
Good, love it.

434
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,277
One, two.

435
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,687
Love it.

436
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,347
Chief.

437
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,507
- Returning to work now?
- Seok Joo.

438
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:31,487
I couldn't miss this on my way
to work. Heading home?

439
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:33,567
I lied that I had to go work off-site.

440
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,427
Our manager seemed to be in a bad mood, so...

441
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:38,517
Good.

442
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:40,967
Love it. A little lower.

443
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,597
All right.

444
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,797
You said Mo Tae Rin is your client, right?

445
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:46,997
What's she like in real life?

446
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:49,267
She's cute on TV.

447
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,697
How can she enjoy it when
everyone's watching her?

448
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:55,097
Gosh, I could never.

449
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:56,717
Me neither.

450
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,137
How can anyone bear that?

451
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:02,257
Let's take a break. Good job.

452
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:03,487
So beautiful.

453
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,027
Really?

454
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:13,527
 Unni! 

455
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:24,157
Kim... Kim Seok Joo?

456
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:26,677
Gosh. She's looking toward us!

457
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,087
She must've recognized you!

458
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:33,187
Thank you.

459
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:35,467
How do you know him?

460
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:36,867
Huh?

461
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,057
Hello!

462
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,017
Have you been well?

463
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,237
What?

464
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,907
Why is he there?

465
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:47,357
Whoa!

466
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:50,897
Were you at the office then?

467
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,227
When he came by?

468
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:56,457
No, we're driving school classmates. Wow.

469
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,667
Why is he happy to see me?

470
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,067
Can you get me a photo with Mo Tae Rin?

471
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,437
Chief, please. I can't.

472
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:07,687
Please. My daughter loves her so much.

473
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:10,127
No. I can't.

474
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:12,757
I see.

475
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,447
I'm such a terrible mom...

476
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:18,167
Why are you going there?

477
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:26,637
I can ask her.

478
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:28,467
Really?

479
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:40,887
 Check the camera positions. 

480
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,757
 Turn the angle a bit. 

481
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:44,657
 This way. 

482
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,957
Mr. Accountant?

483
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:50,547
Oh, yes. Hello.

484
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:53,167
I work in the area. I spotted
you while passing by.

485
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:56,577
You know him? I know him, too.

486
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,067
How do you know him, Gi Bbeum?

487
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,867
We go to the same driving school.

488
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,097
I haven't seen you lately.

489
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,427
By chance, did you get your license?

490
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:06,007
No.

491
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:09,987
Tae Rin.

492
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,497
- Hello.
- Hello.

493
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:16,097
I was wondering...

494
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,367
Do you mind snapping a photo?

495
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,937
With me? Why, all of a sudden?

496
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:25,717
Well...

497
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:27,947
 - Hello? 
- My chief-

498
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:30,467
You're Tae Rin's fan!

499
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:35,997
You were a fan?

500
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,647
Wow.

501
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,287
But why...

502
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:41,667
Why...

503
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,757
You should've said so sooner.

504
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:46,257
You must've been shy when you visited the office.

505
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,487
Stand closer.

506
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:49,837
Gi Bbeum, get papers for autographs.

507
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:51,347
Oh, okay.

508
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:54,207
N-Not me. Over there...

509
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:56,927
- I'll be right there.
- Chief.

510
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,327
Chief, where are you going?

511
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,277
Is this okay?

512
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:02,737
- I mean...
- Okay.

513
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:05,117
One, two, three.

514
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:07,067
One more time. Great.

515
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:10,007
One, two, three.

516
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,727
Look at you, spending a night away from home?

517
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,057
What?

518
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:38,127
Not picking up my calls?

519
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:41,157
Did you tell him I was here?

520
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:44,887
I told him to bring you here. You like pizza.

521
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,777
I knew you wouldn't pick up my calls.

522
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:50,407
Hyungnim, Nu Ri didn't run away
with bad intentions.

523
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:51,807
Run away?

524
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:53,697
You ruined everything.

525
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:56,217
Why suggest pizza when we broke up already?

526
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:59,877
Nu Ri, I don't like that you
habitually say to break up.

527
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:03,157
- Ever since we were in 10th grade.
- Come on now.

528
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:05,757
Since 10th grade?

529
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:08,127
You guys must be nearing 1,000 days together.

530
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,677
Can I go get a Coke?

531
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:29,977
Why don't you have a slice?

532
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,207
Since you'll be paying for it.

533
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,477
It's good.

534
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,007
I'm looking for a photography prep class.

535
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,227
If you cram now-

536
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:54,097
I'm taking the practical entrance exam.

537
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:56,127
Practical exam? When?

538
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,157
I asked Seok Joo because I fought with you.

539
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,967
His mom will give me a ride.

540
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:03,137
Kim Seok Joo doesn't have a driver's
license. I thought all adults had it.

541
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:07,337
So, get mad at Kim Seok Joo.

542
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:11,507
Sure.

543
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,017
Do that.

544
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,687
Aren't you mad?

545
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:18,917
If you're okay with it, go ahead.

546
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:20,297
Tell me the schedule.

547
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:22,377
So, you don't go empty-handed.

548
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:26,537
Okay.

549
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:35,597
Nu Ri, let me ask you for a favor.

550
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:39,247
I think you're making

551
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:43,717
your mom wait too long.

552
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:50,667
As for hurting you with my words,

553
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,757
I'll make up for it, so-

554
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:55,177
I also...

555
00:36:55,177 --> 00:37:00,197
deceived you by staying in touch
with Chan behind your back.

556
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,077
I'll meet my mom.

557
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:05,757
I've been thinking about it, too.

558
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,257
Apart from the fact that I was mad at you.

559
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:11,437
All right.

560
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:15,737
Come back at 7 p.m. after dinner.

561
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:17,177
- Okay.
- Yes.

562
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:20,797
We'll go get a quick dinner.

563
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:22,367
I'll take one.

564
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,067
See you soon.

565
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,357
What name should I make this out to?

566
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:37,227
Accountant Kim Seok Joo?

567
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:39,167
Mr. Seok Joo?

568
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,867
Seok Joo?

569
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:43,167
Seok Joo?

570
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,697
Seok Joo. Okay.

571
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,247
I didn't know you were a fan.

572
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:52,397
I thought you had other feelings...

573
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:55,697
- I'm not a fan.
- So, what's with you?

574
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:59,157
I was caught off guard earlier with my coworkers.

575
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:02,937
Should I have said "We've blown bubbles together"?

576
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,777
No way.

577
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:08,747
That's my personal life, and we're at work.

578
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:18,487
I see, I can't.

579
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,227
Why are you smiling?

580
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,817
For including me in your personal life.

581
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,937
Do you still dislike me?

582
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,687
You said you didn't like me.

583
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:38,057
You made a big deal, saying you
had no ulterior motives.

584
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:40,717
Why are you asking me that now?

585
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:45,157
You needed me to blow bubbles with
you because you couldn't do it alone.

586
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,687
What's the deal...

587
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:53,187
I was just speaking off the cuff.

588
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:55,737
You still remember that...

589
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:01,717
I don't dislike you.

590
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:32,367
Y-You said you didn't have an ulterior motive.

591
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:36,097
Maybe I do now.

592
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:11,467
When do you want to blow bubbles again?

593
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,117
Very soon.

594
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:19,587
 

595
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,067
 

596
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,567
 

597
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:46,567
 

598
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,377
Yes, Sunbae.

599
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:54,447
You got your wedding invitations?

600
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:55,927
How could I not have known?

601
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:57,837
- I never could've imagined.
- Me, neither.

602
00:40:57,837 --> 00:41:00,517
- It didn't show.
- Have some of this.

603
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,237
Thank you.

604
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:04,167
What did you think of the final episode?

605
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:06,397
The editing was crazy, right? I cried.

606
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,657
Watching your own work?

607
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:11,047
He would've missed the final episode
if it weren't for me.

608
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:14,587
Why? Never mind. I don't want to know.

609
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:17,717
Here...

610
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,977
Wedding invitation.

611
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:23,237
Congratulations.

612
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:24,617
Congratulations.

613
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:28,377
How did you end up marrying
a writer you work with every day?

614
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:30,557
I must be out of my mind.

615
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:33,637
We're just renting a small restaurant.
It's a humble wedding.

616
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,557
- So, come comfortably.
- Okay.

617
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:40,757
And Bebop, please make me
a bouquet and a boutonniere.

618
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:44,987
Will do. This is how I'll pay back the debt.

619
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:50,867
What do you have to pay me back for?

620
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:57,667
Because you kept looking for me,

621
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:01,307
I got to reunite with Je Yeon.

622
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:04,477
Hey!

623
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:08,117
You're driving me crazy.

624
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:10,297
I see.

625
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:12,357
That's how it worked out.

626
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:19,037
Congratulations on reuniting. My gosh!

627
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,937
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

628
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:24,627
Excuse me.

629
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:26,567
 

630
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,627
- Yes, Nu Ri.
 - Oppa. 

631
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,477
I rented the camera,

632
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:33,767
and the exam schedule is out, and it's too early.

633
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,437
So, I'll spend the night near the school.

634
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:38,287
Okay, got it.

635
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:41,937
You prepared everything the exam requires, right?

636
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,717
Gosh, stop nagging. I'm all grown up.

637
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:45,757
 I'm not nagging. 

638
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:48,247
I'm hanging up.

639
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:50,317
Nu Ri...

640
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,237
Nu Ri? Eun Nu Ri?

641
00:42:53,157 --> 00:42:54,957
Do you have a 12th-grader at home?

642
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:58,067
My little sister is applying for photography.

643
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:05,797
According to her teacher,

644
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:08,337
she seems to be talented.

645
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:13,717
She was always a good artist.

646
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:19,687
Your sister is so amazing for knowing
what she wants to do already.

647
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:23,227
At that age, I thought it'd all work out
once I got to college.

648
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:24,457
Not me.

649
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:26,047
You're drawing a line.

650
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:31,517
Wait, it doesn't all work out
once you go to college?

651
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:33,807
I was just talking about myself.

652
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:37,817
Je Yeon, could you please be the MC?

653
00:43:39,037 --> 00:43:40,617
Me?

654
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,087
Well...

655
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:48,207
won't people from school be there?

656
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,027
Yes, right.

657
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:58,387
In that case, well...

658
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:07,097
I need to clean up back there.

659
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:08,527
Take your time and talk.

660
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:10,147
Excuse me for a moment.

661
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:18,823
Did you lie to Bebop about your degree?

662
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,847
What?

663
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:22,127
Why are you walking on eggshells?

664
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:27,647
I just don't want him to ask me
why I dropped out of school.

665
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:29,217
Could you tell?

666
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:31,697
 I thought you were trying to
get him out of the room. 

667
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:33,397
 Sunbae! 

668
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:37,717
 So, you'll be the MC, right? 

669
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,297
Well...

670
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,407
Let me think about it.

671
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:46,957
So, did you say yes to being the MC?

672
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:50,467
It's none other than Jin So Rah's wedding.

673
00:44:51,777 --> 00:44:55,357
I want to do it. I do, but...

674
00:44:55,357 --> 00:45:00,157
I just need to think it over.

675
00:45:01,997 --> 00:45:03,417
That's it?

676
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:09,687
What's the point of bringing up the past?

677
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,447
I'm not proud of dropping out.

678
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:14,997
It's interesting. It's your story.

679
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:17,907
The most interesting story in the world.

680
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:32,027
 ♫ Walking side by side in lockstep
with you on this street ♫ 

681
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:35,677
Je Yeon.

682
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:41,777
I wouldn't even mind it

683
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:46,444
- if you talked about guys you dated in the past.
- Huh?

684
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:51,151
That's the only thing you'd feel
guilty about in front of me.

685
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:55,857
Gosh, it's okay. It's all in the past.

686
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:59,487
As long as you're not in touch with them now.

687
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:02,387
Yeah. It's all okay. It's all in the past.

688
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,107
Stay in touch, sure.

689
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:07,027
- Just don't meet up alone.
- Okay.

690
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,997
But do you get it, though?

691
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:14,197
Why stay in touch with someone
you're no longer connected to?

692
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:17,747
Well, you know. It's...

693
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:20,397
Stop, stop.

694
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:22,887
Where are you going? Stop it.

695
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:24,927
Stay here with me.

696
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,247
Stay here.

697
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,607
- How come you're not answering me?
- Huh?

698
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:33,937
You're not still in touch, right?

699
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:35,457
It's all in the past, right?

700
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:39,267
Seriously. Hey! Who do you think I am?

701
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:40,517
 You idiot. 

702
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:42,477
 It could happen. 

703
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:44,677
 That's stupider. 

704
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,607
 Isn't that a dog? Let's go. 

705
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:49,927
 No way. 

706
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:51,977
 Yes way. Come. 

707
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:54,427
 Come. Hurry. 

708
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:56,347
 Why did you abandon me? 

709
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,537
 Dad. 

710
00:46:59,537 --> 00:47:02,377
 Was I that big of a burden? 

711
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:05,717
 So, what am I to you? 

712
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:08,377
 What kind of person am I? 

713
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:10,577
 Do you even love me? 

714
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:25,647
Oh, my gosh!

715
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:28,047
I'm sorry.

716
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:29,957
I spoke too harshly.

717
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:34,437
You think that was the only thing?

718
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,137
Leaving home was harsh, too.

719
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:40,437
It was also harsh to ghost you
and make you chase me.

720
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:49,197
Wow, this place is exactly the same as it was.

721
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:51,837
Ahjussi?

722
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:53,847
Hi, Nu Ri.

723
00:47:53,847 --> 00:47:56,207
What's this?

724
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,857
Want us to give you some privacy?

725
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:02,887
No, let's go. Don't worry about it.

726
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,507
Where are you going?

727
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,527
I said I'm sorry.

728
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,017
Nu Ri doesn't know anything.

729
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,817
You don't know anything.

730
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:11,507
Did you even know she's taking
a college entrance exam?

731
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:14,497
She's taking a practical exam
early in the morning.

732
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:16,257
You brought your toiletries, right?

733
00:48:16,257 --> 00:48:18,097
- Yes.
- Yeah.

734
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:19,727
- Let's go.
- Why are you coming?

735
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:23,577
Nu Ri said it's awkward to go with you alone.

736
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:26,297
You weren't supposed to say that, Oppa.

737
00:48:29,627 --> 00:48:32,847
My brother says thank you.

738
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:34,717
It's tea bags.

739
00:48:34,717 --> 00:48:37,727
He wasn't sure if you'd like it...

740
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:39,187
Oh, my.

741
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:44,297
Tell him thank you.

742
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:49,827
I'll forgive you, thanks to your son.

743
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,327
Oh, okay. Have a nice trip, Noona.

744
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:54,537
Eun Nu Ri, fighting!

745
00:48:54,537 --> 00:48:55,927
Aren't you coming?

746
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:57,717
I have a hard time driving at night.

747
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:58,817
You'd better drive.

748
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:01,147
Seok Joo doesn't have a license.

749
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,197
Sure. Yes, I'm coming.

750
00:49:04,197 --> 00:49:06,807
If he's coming,

751
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:10,007
do I share a room with him? I don't want to.

752
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:12,137
You should've gotten your license, then.

753
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:15,007
Suck it up. Don't give my husband a hard time.

754
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,037
"My husband."

755
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,357
"My husband."

756
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:20,147
- Noona.
- My gosh.

757
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:22,347
Wait, wait, wait.

758
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,327
We're in front of the kids.

759
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:27,667
Look away. You'll get unlucky.

760
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,337
Mo Tae Rin!

761
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:34,627
What?

762
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:37,527
I told you I'm coming to the office.
What's this all of a sudden?

763
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:40,787
You gave me so many rides.

764
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:45,647
I mean, I couldn't wait to give this to you.

765
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:47,377
What is it?

766
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:51,167
Ta-da!

767
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:56,047
I couldn't visit you at the hospital
because I was busy making money.

768
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:57,447
Your discharge gift!

769
00:49:57,447 --> 00:50:00,587
You're... you're so...

770
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:01,917
Here.

771
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:06,077
Thank you.

772
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,107
So pretty...

773
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:12,177
Make sure you brag to Bebop.

774
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:13,277
Show it off.

775
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,717
Okay, I'll show it off!

776
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:19,267
Oh, well...

777
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:26,157
Did I tell you we're dating?

778
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,037
You just did.

779
00:50:28,037 --> 00:50:29,767
So, you're really dating?

780
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,267
It's all thanks to me.

781
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:34,127
I told you I hired the Truck oppa.

782
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:36,847
I really didn't want to tell you, to be honest.

783
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:40,347
Hae had his reasons.

784
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:41,817
Don't be too mean.

785
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:44,487
Tell him I won't sit back and watch

786
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:46,527
if he dares to make you cry again.

787
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:47,957
Okay.

788
00:50:51,577 --> 00:50:52,847
Get in.

789
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:56,407
What? You're picking me up?

790
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,737
This is the exact same car you used to drive.

791
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:05,117
I got used to this car, so the
Director got me the same model.

792
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:09,267
Wow, she's so cool.

793
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:11,507
Oh, this.

794
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,767
The Director asked me about this.

795
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,557
This.

796
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:19,057
I looked for it so I can give it to you.

797
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:24,857
I should run away overseas.

798
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:28,527
So, what do you want me to help with today?

799
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,247
Interview prep.

800
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:33,977
The photo shoot went well,
but we haven't done an interview yet.

801
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:36,107
I want to do well.

802
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:37,907
All right.

803
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:42,417
You recently starred in a show
about reflecting on the past.

804
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:43,947
How do you feel?

805
00:51:43,947 --> 00:51:47,767
Wow, you were so natural.

806
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:49,807
If viewers were able to

807
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:54,367
bring up fond memories
through my past, that's great.

808
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:57,197
Will people criticize me?
That I'm pretending to be nice, and that I'm fake?

809
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,867
What's wrong with that?

810
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:02,977
Tell people to pretend and be fake.

811
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:08,907
I don't remember the past very well,
to tell you the truth.

812
00:52:08,907 --> 00:52:12,787
I was like a wild animal.

813
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:14,757
I don't know why I was that way.

814
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,867
That's why I struggle with
variety shows and interviews.

815
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:21,767
It leaves a record of me.
A record of embarrassment.

816
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:27,237
Well, your frontal lobe was still growing, then.

817
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:29,787
Everyone is ashamed of our past.

818
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:33,757
It must be fully formed by now...

819
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:40,307
Gosh, no!

820
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,617
No.

821
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:48,577
Now, I know how to act cool.

822
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:50,167
I'm all grown up.

823
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,197
All right, next question.

824
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:54,127
What loser did you get caught up with this time?

825
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,917
If...

826
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,957
Mo Tae Rin didn't become an actress,
what would she have become?

827
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:01,957
This was really hard.

828
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:05,597
I got stuck on this for a few days.

829
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:07,707
What about you, Sunbae?

830
00:53:07,707 --> 00:53:09,847
What would you have become, if not a manager?

831
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:11,517
Not sure.

832
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:15,387
How am I supposed to answer this immediately

833
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:18,137
when you couldn't for days?

834
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:21,327
People used to say this all the time.

835
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:24,777
That they've never met a manager who went to SNU.

836
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:28,587
People love to qualify others.

837
00:53:28,587 --> 00:53:31,397
I still carry around my child actor title...

838
00:53:31,397 --> 00:53:34,677
Should we strip it all away?

839
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:37,487
You just be Mo Tae Rin.

840
00:53:37,487 --> 00:53:40,197
I'll just be Sung Je Yeon.

841
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:43,957
I'm glad we're doing this.

842
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:46,197
I'm grateful for this conversation.

843
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:47,647
Yeah?

844
00:53:49,087 --> 00:53:53,367
At least, interviews have questions.

845
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,137
To actually talk about myself is...

846
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:01,287
When and how to tell my story.

847
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,427
I have no idea.

848
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:09,577
If you didn't become a manager,

849
00:54:09,577 --> 00:54:13,837
I think you would've lived how
Sung Je Yeon was meant to live.

850
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:17,647
Just as Sung Je Yeon.

851
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:24,037
I realized it once we were apart.

852
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:27,217
You are always figuring things out
and reading the room.

853
00:54:27,217 --> 00:54:29,607
Trying to solve problems...

854
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,927
You took such great care of me.

855
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:34,007
You were a good listener, too.

856
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:39,287
But I hope you do that only when you're working.

857
00:54:39,287 --> 00:54:43,527
I'm sure I contributed to that, but...

858
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:52,297
Am I digging my own grave right now?

859
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:56,237
Yeah. So, it was you who turned me this way.

860
00:54:56,237 --> 00:54:59,247
Yes! I'm the culprit!

861
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,837
Right. Next.

862
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:03,177
Next one is...

863
00:55:03,177 --> 00:55:05,997
 While you're portraying the character, 

864
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:09,327
 I want to know how you develop... 

865
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:35,497
 Sung Je Yeon. 

866
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:39,907
 You still want me to pretend I don't know you? 

867
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,817
 Did you want to see it, too? 

868
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:47,917
 How I've grown up? 

869
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,507
 I was curious, too. 

870
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:53,667
 Whether you'd be in college. 

871
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:59,097
 I wondered if we'd see each other again,
no matter what you became. 

872
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:00,757
 Stuff like that. 

873
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,807
 

874
00:56:27,577 --> 00:56:30,177
 

875
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:32,677
 

876
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,010
 

877
00:56:52,907 --> 00:56:55,937
 From Sung Je Yeon to Sunwoo Hae. 

878
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,907
 I like you. 

879
00:57:02,907 --> 00:57:04,987
 How about you? 

880
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:06,907
Who is this?

881
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:33,327
Yes.

882
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:35,427
 Where are you? 

883
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:36,687
What are you up to?

884
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:39,817
Me? Practicing making bouquets at home.

885
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:41,677
Why?

886
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:43,747
I miss you.

887
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:52,047
- Hello?
- Want me to come?

888
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:54,217
Open your door.

889
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:56,607
I'm here.

890
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:02,777
Wow, you're working hard.

891
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:06,727
You can't just show up unannounced.

892
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:09,727
I look like a bum. Seriously.

893
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:11,767
I have something to give you.

894
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,317
Just a moment.

895
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:20,367
Here.

896
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:23,357
I made this while thinking about you.

897
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,417
What is this?

898
00:58:29,537 --> 00:58:30,857
It's a penguin.

899
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:33,807
I knew it.

900
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,737
I almost didn't recognize it, but...

901
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:38,017
- Oh, also...
- It is a penguin.

902
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:39,547
Cute.

903
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:43,337
This got mixed up in my stuff.

904
00:58:43,337 --> 00:58:44,937
 

905
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:47,557
That's where it was.

906
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:48,847
I've been looking everywhere for it.

907
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:51,417
- Thank you.
- No, no.

908
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,247
Look after I leave.

909
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:57,307
- Why?
- Look only when it accidentally drops out.

910
00:58:57,307 --> 00:59:01,027
- What is it?
- No, no, no.

911
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:03,897
Okay. Aigoo...

912
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:06,967
Wait a second.

913
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,657
- Je Yeon.
- Huh?

914
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:11,067
You're warm.

915
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:13,167
You need to catch it early.

916
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,607
Let's have some porridge and medicine.

917
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:16,587
I make good porridge.

918
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,407
Don't. Let's eat something tasty.

919
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:22,677
Something salty and sweet... something like that.

920
00:59:22,677 --> 00:59:25,067
Salty and sweet...

921
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:28,087
- Want me to make you galbijjim?
- Yes!

922
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:30,407
But that takes a long time.

923
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:34,117
Yeah. I'll marinate it now and
serve it tomorrow morning.

924
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:43,387
What a delicious way to invite me

925
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:47,247
to spend the night. Salty and sweet.

926
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,997
You'll have to do with porridge tonight.

927
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,847
What if I get you sick?

928
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,287
Let me take it all from you.

929
01:00:04,697 --> 01:00:06,487
Wait a minute.

930
01:00:56,187 --> 01:00:59,247
 

931
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:04,257
Since you said to look later...

932
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:06,537
If only you didn't say that.

933
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:27,397
 From Sung Je Yeon to Sunwoo Hae. 

934
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:40,377
 

935
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,567
 You said you were curious if I went to college 

936
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:54,167
 or which of the things my mom
wrote down I had become. 

937
01:01:58,117 --> 01:02:01,017
Oh, right. Gosh, seriously...

938
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:07,057
 You've been asking about me 

939
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,237
 from the moment we met again. 

940
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:32,287
 Where do I start? 

941
01:02:33,477 --> 01:02:37,667
 First of all, college was no fun. 

942
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:42,507
 Going to classes was overwhelming 

943
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:45,087
 and things were tight for me. 

944
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:48,727
 I doubted whether this was my path. 

945
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:53,507
 And even that dilemma felt like a luxury to me. 

946
01:02:57,207 --> 01:03:00,867
 

947
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:04,757
 I dropped out of school when
my family went bankrupt, 

948
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:06,947
 but life went on. 

949
01:03:06,947 --> 01:03:08,917
- Thank you.
- That girl...

950
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:10,917
Sorry.

951
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:12,827
What's with you!

952
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:16,707
You said you were a TA!

953
01:03:16,707 --> 01:03:19,667
I switched because it wasn't for me.

954
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:22,147
What if I can't teach well?

955
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:23,867
Is this why you took a leave of absence?

956
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,737
Your major and transferring aren't for you...

957
01:03:25,737 --> 01:03:28,427
Why are you going through adolescence now?

958
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:31,607
Do you want to see me keel over?

959
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:35,607
I'm sorry...

960
01:03:46,347 --> 01:03:48,997
 

961
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:15,997
 When my pond froze over, 

962
01:04:15,997 --> 01:04:19,337
 I guess I didn't know where I was supposed to go. 

963
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:21,947
 

964
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,997
Aigoo, why can't I open this?

965
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:47,197
 In those moments, I thought
of someone who was so inefficient. 

966
01:04:48,377 --> 01:04:51,577
 Sleeping during class hours 

967
01:04:51,577 --> 01:04:56,277
 and working during sleeping hours. You. 

968
01:04:56,277 --> 01:04:59,957
 You used to eat bread alone on campus. 

969
01:04:59,957 --> 01:05:03,317
 You asked me what I used
to dream of becoming. 

970
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:08,537
 I'm curious about what kind
of dreams shining ones like you dream. 

971
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,997
 When you weren't around, 

972
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:14,307
 I missed you. 

973
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:23,137
 I must've been lonely. 

974
01:05:45,327 --> 01:05:47,007
Je Yeon.

975
01:05:52,537 --> 01:05:54,237
I love you.

976
01:06:23,157 --> 01:06:28,857
 ♫ Like the horizon ♫ 

977
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:35,817
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

978
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:42,667
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

979
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:49,547
 ♫ Like us from back then ♫ 

980
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,757
 A heart for my long-lost friend. 

981
01:06:53,757 --> 01:06:58,227
 Around the time when the tree blooms, 

982
01:06:59,347 --> 01:07:01,737
 let's go see it together. 

983
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:15,487
 ♫ Like the horizon where day and night meet ♫ 

984
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:48,567
 ♫ Assuming it's you ♫ 

985
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:51,887
 ♫ Your light smile ♫ 

986
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:55,926
 ♫ Stain called you that I never erased ♫
