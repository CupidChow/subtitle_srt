(Pearl Hotel)

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Mom.

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,700
Bao!

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,750
Bao! Bao!

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Bao!

6
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,850
Bao!

7
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,020
Mom!

8
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,660
Bao!

9
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,750
Bao!

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,850
Bao!

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,090
Bao!

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,250
Don't touch Bao!

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,660
Bao is my son!

14
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,230
Bao is my son! My son!

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,390
I'll kill you!

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Go to hell!

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Stop dreaming!

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,540
Don't move.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,550
It's my favorite smell.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,150
What are you doing?

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,770
We're divorced!

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,390
I'm here to see Bao.

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,430
I'm here to see you

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,150
and take some money.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,580
No money!

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,650
No money?

27
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,860
No money?

28
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,010
I have no money!

29
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,130
No money?

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,190
You vicious woman.
You like pain, don't you?

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,870
Give me money!

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,270
I have no money!

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,790
I want money.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,150
Even if I do,
I won't give it to you!

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,310
Give me the money.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,710
Where is it?

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,230
Tell me. Tell me!

38
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,870
Give it to me,
or I'll beat you to death!

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,950
No money!

=Episode 10=

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,590
- Get out!
- Who the hell are you?

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,590
Get out!

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
This isn't over!

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Get out!

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,670
Are you okay?

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm fine.

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,830
Thank you.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
Okay then.

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,790
Your guitar is broken.

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,470
How much? I'll pay you.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,070
A scum gave it to me.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,150
I wanted to use it to hit him,

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,910
but I just met a worse one.

55
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,910
At that point, girls should help girls.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,430
Have some water.

57
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,040
Thanks.

58
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,190
Did you come here to look for someone?

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm a music artist.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,190
I came to this haunted place

61
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,950
for inspiration.

62
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
Any inspiration?

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,790
Yes.

64
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,430
I met two idiots last night,

65
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,190
and I saw you today. What a story.

66
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,310
By the way,
why didn't you call the police?

67
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
I did.

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,510
I didn't work.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,630
They'd lock him up for a few days,

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,310
a few months at most,

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
and he'd be released.

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,830
What about the guard?

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,950
Isn't it his duty to protect you?

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,190
There's a security guard.

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
However,

76
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,230
he went too far,

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,190
so I told him
to stay away from our business.

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Xiaodao.

79
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,430
You've finally learned the first lesson.

80
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,370
Listen,

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,870
the most important thing

82
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,510
for a guard is stay in the guard room.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,030
Please let me patrol the building.

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,470
No patrols tonight.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,350
Don't make trouble.

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,550
Bro, I promise

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
if anything happens,
I'll report immediately.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,190
I won't take the liberty.

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,390
Please give me a chance.

90
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,310
Fine, let's go.

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,230
Come on.

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,670
What are you doing?
Why are you wearing these?

93
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,110
It's pointless.

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,910
You know nothing.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,190
It's full protection.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,470
I'll work.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,590
Full protection?

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,510
Stop it. You're going to hurt yourself.

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,670
Don't scream. It's Tiezui.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Ghost!

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,430
Let me show you.

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,190
Why don't you believe me?

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,670
I told you it was Tiezui.

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,630
Tiezui, stop acting like a ghost.

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,510
Didn't you say it's him?

106
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,110
Why is it a woman?

107
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,550
You'd dragged me away before I saw it!

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,550
How should I know?

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,550
There's nothing else, right?

110
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,180
Oh, lord.

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,360
Duan!

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,190
What happened?

113
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,840
God!
