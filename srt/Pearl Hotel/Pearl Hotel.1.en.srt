(Tianfu Bank)

00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,780
(Pearl Road in Yangzhou)

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,020
(Pearl Road)

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,750
(was once an execution ground
in the late Qing Dynasty.)

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,940
(It's not a place for people
who are still alive.)

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,610
(Pearl Road)
After the founding of the PRC,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,810
(Hostel)
(several Soviet-style)

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,450
(Pearl Road)
(workers' hostels were built.)

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,800
(A pregnant worker was abandoned,)

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,640
(and she jumped off Hostel No. 4.)

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,730
(However, her head was missing.)

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,370
(The haunted Hostel No. 4 on Pearl Road)

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,320
Help! Help!

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,350
(caused a stir in Yangzhou)

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,050
(in the early years of the PRC.)

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
Immobilize!

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,750
There are so many

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,230
resentful spirits.

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,390
I've used my heirloom peach-wood sword

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,350
to seal all of them.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,910
From now on, you must do good deeds

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,260
and restrain your desires

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,070
for long-lasting safety.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,360
Thanks, Master.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,270
Thanks, Master.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,470
(A bunch of idiots.)

28

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,580

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,780
(Pearl Road)

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,620
(Pearl Hotel)

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
The tenants

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,510
couldn't find the peach-wood sword,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,950
but they followed his instructions

35
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,630
to do good deeds

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,070
and restrain their desires.

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,950
As a result,

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,990
the strange things never happened again,

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,990
and it became Pearl Hotel.

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,550
It's a horror story.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,750
You're not responding.

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,350
Is that enough? I really can't do it.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,110
I'm an atheist.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,750
I only believe in science.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,760
College student?

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,110
My family is poor.
I didn't even finish primary school.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,750
Then why do you believe in science?

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,030
Science?

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,470
Do you know science?

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,910
You almost got me.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,990
Besides, didn't your parents
teach you manners?

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,750
When I'm speaking,
look at me, not my clothes!

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,910
So stupid.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Bro,

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,910
you look so cool in this uniform.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,630
I want to come home in this outfit
during the Spring Festival

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,390
and show my mother I'm successful now.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,110
I'll give it to you when I resign.

59
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,920
Bro, when will you resign?

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,190
What's wrong with you?

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,270
No, it's not like that.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,470
By the way,

63
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,750
why did they move out?

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,190
You tell me.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,550
No water, no power, only ghosts,

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,700
would you stay?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
I wouldn't.

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
I...

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
Bao!

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,190
Stop running! You scared me!

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,470
Are you scared of me?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
I...

73
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,350
No. Why would I be scared?

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,470
Then why were you trembling

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,270
when I turned around?

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,670
Because you looked cool.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,910
You must've spent

78
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,270
a lot of money

79
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,810
whitening your hair and skin.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,390
Do you know why they moved out?

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,270
As Mr. Duan said,

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,030
no water, no power, so...

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,780
It's haunted.

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,110
Haunted?

85
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,450
Stop running!

86
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,390
Don't you understand?

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,030
He's an albino.

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,190
I know.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,230
He speaks Chinese, not Albinese.

90
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,470
Even if he does, I can still understand.

91
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Absolutely.

92
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,070
Something's wrong with you.

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,550
Hurry! What are you doing?

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,470
Which room?

95
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,500
Room 206.

96
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,950
Room 206.

97
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Room 206.

98
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,330
Anyone else?

99
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,230
Only the three toughest ones.

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,510
Which room?

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,390
Room 405.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
- Mr. Tang.
- 405.

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,470
- Go.
- Okay.

104
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,590
Hurry!

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,630
Did you see an old lady?

106
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,520
(Pearl Hotel)

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,470
Old lady?

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,230
She lived in Room 404 last year.

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,470
Never mind. Forget it.

110
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,220
