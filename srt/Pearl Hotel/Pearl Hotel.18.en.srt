=Episode 18=

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,910
Tang Yuanbao, you're disgusting!

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,470
Do you have to be so nasty

6
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,510
and play dirty tricks?

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,190
Well done.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,630
Do you have to be ghosts?

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,510
What? Don't touch me!

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,310
Are you kidding me?
How can you blame me?

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,030
You asked them

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,350
to pose as ghosts for the apartments!

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,670
Listen,

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,070
if cheating was a crime,

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,630
you'd be sentenced to life imprisonment!

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,030
Boss, since we're exposed,

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,430
can you pay us now?

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,870
Mr. Tang,

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,510
take your time.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,590
I'll pay their salaries.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,470
Hurry up. Come on.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,950
Little kid, it's over. Stop acting.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,150
He's my son.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,310
Your son?
That's great. I don't need to pay him.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
Over here.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,030
Good job.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,470
Ghost!

28
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,790
Ghost!

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Come on.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,200
He's moving so slowly.
Did you pay him too little?

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,790
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,670
This big show cost me a lot of money.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,150
He must be someone you hired!

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,310
How could he afford to hire anyone?

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,350
He even paid me buns instead of money.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,670
Then who is he?

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,030
Xiaodao?

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,910
What are you doing?

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,590
It's none of your business!

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,070
You're making it worse!

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,950
You got nothing to do?

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,510
If I can't get the apartment,
will you support me?

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,590
Do you know how hard I've tried
to make money

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,950
to go back to my hometown?

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,230
Can't you just be
an obedient security guard?

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,030
Do you understand?

47
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,670
- Answer me!
- Say something!

48
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Xiaodao!

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,230
Xiaodao!

50
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
Xiaodao!

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,800
I didn't do it! It wasn't me!

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,670
You're doomed.

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,620
This...

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,910
Xiaodao!

55
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,050
Xiaodao!

56
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,340
Xiaodao!

57
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,330
Xiaodao!

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,710
Brother Xiaodao!

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,560
Brother Xiaodao!

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Brother Xiaodao!

61
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,470
Brother Xiaodao!

62
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,640
Brother Xiaodao!

63
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,970
- Brother Xiaodao!
- Xiaodao!

64
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,030
Tang Yuanbao, you're over.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,310
He's dead.

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,190
How are you going to pay compensation?

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,310
What compensation?

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,470
I didn't...

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
I didn't push him.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,510
We all saw you

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,270
push him like this at the last moment!

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,390
It was you!

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,910
Didn't you push him?

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,750
I saw it! You pushed him hard!

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,830
I only touched him lightly.

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,510
Anyway,

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,430
he's dead now.

78
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,030
Give us money and apartments,

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,430
or we won't go easy on you!

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280
Nonsense!

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,230
Shut up, both of you!

82
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,830
Why are you so heartless?

83
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,510
Mr... Mr. Tang.

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,280
Why are you here?

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,790
- Ghost!
- There's a ghost!

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,470
Enough, Frank.

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,750
You've done your job, okay?

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,470
It's real!
Her head can shrink into her body!

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,710
What's that?

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,890
Ghost!

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,030
It's me!

92
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,920
You freaked me out!

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,910
So terrifying.

94
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
What should we do?

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,430
What should we do?

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
I remember

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,830
there's a rubbish chute in Room 404
that hasn't been used for many years.

98
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,550
It's connected to the basement.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,180
Is there any other way?

100
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,220
Yes. What else can we do?

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,460
Let's go to Room 404.

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,750
Let's go!

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,750
- Come on.
- Let's go.

104
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,230
Duan?
