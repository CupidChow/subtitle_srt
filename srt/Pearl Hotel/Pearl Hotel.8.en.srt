Xiaodao...

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,630
Give it back...

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,610
What are you doing?

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,670
I saw something! Something's there!

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,670
- I just saw something!
- I didn't see it.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,110
It's there!

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,590
Stop. I'll check it out.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,390
No! Stop!

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,670
Please send me downstairs! Please!

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,670
Please!

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,670
Listen,

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,790
a priest here often acts like a ghost.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,670
He freaked me out a while ago.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,230
I think it's him.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,990
Ghost!

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,030
What are you doing?

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,430
I saw it!

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,550
There's nothing.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,240
There is.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,510
You look more suspicious.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,350
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,350
You're really suspicious.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,390
Go to the guard room with me.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Let's go.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,370
Get down! Hands up!

29
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,480
Hands up!

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,150
Are you insane?

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Bro.

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,110
You've watched too many cop movies!

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,230
Oh, no! I lost her!

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,590
Let's go upstairs. She's missing!

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
What?

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Who's missing?

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,510
That guitar girl?

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,070
No, Landi.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
What?

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,510
Did you hear anything?

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,590
The guitar girl is singing.

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,270
It's the whistle register.

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,430
No. It's something different.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,460
(Believe in Science)

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,030
Believe in science.

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,190
You're wasting my time.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Landi.

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,940
Landi?

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,060
Landi?

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Landi?

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,910
Landi?

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,430
Did you see a woman?

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,670
He's desperate for women.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,990
Make it clear.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,470
If it's not the guitar girl,

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
who else is it?

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,950
Tang Yuanbao's secretary.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,150
By the way,

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,350
do we have surveillance?

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Yes.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's go.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,670
Come on!

63
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,110
Let's go.

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,200
Come on.

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,710
Only the ends of the hallways
have cameras.

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
Check it out.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,920
Where's the woman?

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,670
I know who you are.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,550
You work for the guy
who made a scene, right?

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,550
Where's the woman?

71
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,990
- You failed last time,
- Who were you talking to?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,550
so you're here to scare us, right?

73
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,990
Who were you talking to?

74
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,910
- You saw a ghost.
- What are you doing?

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,550
You...

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,670
Don't cry!

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Are you okay?

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,670
He has a bad temper.

79
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,200
Where's the woman?

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,670
Xiaodao...

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,340
Help...

82
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,920
Help...

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,020
Landi?

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,670
Xiaodao...

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,230
Give it back...

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
You're awake.

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,150
Are you feeling better?

88
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,150
Duan said you were shaking

89
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,470
and screaming last night.

90
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,110
He couldn't wake you up.

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,550
He was worried and asked me
to take care of you.

92
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,910
Dabao. It's okay. I can help myself.

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,910
I made pork haslet soup.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,150
Duan will bring it to you.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm supposed to protect you,

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,510
and now you're taking care of me.

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,430
Tiezui told me everything.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,310
You must've seen a ghost.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,630
Luckily, Duan repaired the sword

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,030
and kept stabbing your palm,

101
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,190
or you'd still be in a coma.

102
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,150
I was wondering
who was stabbing my hand.

103
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,950
Here's the soup.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,670
Come on. Have some soup.

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,350
Well, you're awake.

106
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,270
What? It's just some scratches.

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,190
If I hadn't done it, you would've died.

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,400
Where's my sword?

109
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,670
Jian took it.

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,150
He'll put it back.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,670
Weren't you so proud yesterday?

112
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,750
Weren't you so tough?

113
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,670
Why are you weak now?

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,670
All your men are here.
You can't be weak, okay?

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
What are you doing?

116
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
Put it down.

117
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,590
Stop! Stop!

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
Put it down!

119
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,030
- Put it down!
- Get off it!

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,990
Put it down!

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,270
I'll stab you!

122
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,510
- Come on!
- I'm serious!

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,680
Come on!

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,870
- Come on!
- Get off it!

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,670
It's him again!

126
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,830
I'll kill him!

127
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,430
Don't move!

128
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,870
Stay where you are.

129
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,670
Get off it!

130
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,670
I'll kill you!
