00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,990
Guys, did you see Duan?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,990
Didn't he quit the job and leave?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,750
I haven't seen him all day.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,700
Who's broken?

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Dabao!

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,550
Dabao, don't go. I love you.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,190
Kiss me.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,950
Dabao, you smell so good.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,590
Dabao, I love you.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,030
Dabao...

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,830
Dabao, don't go...

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,030
Dabao...

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,390
Hurry up.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,030
Over here.

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
This way.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,270
Mom.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,390
Go! Go!

21
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,030
Mom.

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,550
Over here.

23
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,750
Hurry up!

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,830
Is it done?

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,870
Hurry!

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,790
Press it.

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,710
Okay. Okay.

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,630
Whose feet smell so bad?

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,270
Hurry!

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,470

Where are my buns?

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,030
Jian, did you call Tang Yuanbao?

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,230
Didn't Dabao call him?

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440
Where are my buns?

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Shut up.

39
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,030
Bao went missing.

40
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,310
I was looking for him
and forgot to call.

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,710
If it was Tiezui,

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,710
I'd beat him up.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,030
But since it's you,

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,310
I won't blame you.

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,590
- My buns...
- Call him now.

46
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,050
My buns!

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Guys,

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,350
did you see Duan?

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,030
Who's broken?
[*Duan: Homophone of Broken]

50
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,030
Didn't he quit the job and leave?

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
But his stuff is in the guard room.

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,420
My buns!

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,030
Speaking of which,
I haven't seen him all day.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,590
Jian!

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,230
Didn't he say goodbye to you
in the morning?

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,470
Didn't you see him?

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,030
You reminded me.

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,830
I think I saw him go upstairs,

59
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,690
but

60
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,910
I didn't know
whether he went down or not.

61
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,550
Well, tell me if you see him.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,750
I'll be in the guard room.

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,830
Don't worry. He's an adult.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,070
He won't get lost.

65
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,270
Let's stick with our plan.

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,270
Let's go back.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,750
If you have something else to do,
just do it first.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
However...

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,710
I can help you with anything.

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,790
I'm a responsible man.

Psychopath.

73
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,490
Psychopath.

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,390
Let's go back.
