4
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,830
Brother Xiaodao.

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
Bro,

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,030
why are you here?

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,310
They said you died.

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,470
Nezha can be revived.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,350
However, some people

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,430
don't deserve to live.

11
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,030
I wish I could leave you here to die.

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,830
However, when I went down,

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,220
I saw the gas valve was turned on.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,390
You must've touched it
when you went down.

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,470
I said I didn't do it!

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,710
Do you believe me now?

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Move.

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Move!

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,030
Wait! Wait!

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,110
How dense is the gas in there?

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,390
It's bad. Can't you smell it?

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,830
In that case,

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,670
the iron gate is well-sealed.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,850
So?

25
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,100
So...

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,310
If the door opens, the air will go in...

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
And?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,950
You need to be prepared.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,790
When you open the door, it will explode.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,950
We're running out of time!

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Go!

32
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,190
Hurry!

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,380
- Let's go.
- Go!

34
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,830
Bro!

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
You...

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Go to the hospital.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,430
I'll save her.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,030
Don't leave her behind this time.

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,630
Get her out.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Hurry!

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,720
Xiaodao!

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,670
Brother Xiaodao!

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
He's alive!

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,390
- Xiaodao is alive!
- He's alive!

(Real-life Escape Room)

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
Show me your Health Code.

49
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,230
You can read the flyer.

50

Next.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
Here, take a look.

52
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,710
Hello, hello.

53
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,030
Can you please show me your Health Code?

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,590
- Okay.
- Thanks.

55
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,030
Show me your ticket.

56
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,980
No problem.

57
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,540
- The number is 151517.
- How many?

58
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
- Two.
- Two tickets.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,670
- Okay.
- Read this.

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
You should go this way.

61
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,350
Okay. Have a good time.

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Welcome.

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,270
- Come on.
- Excuse me, what is...?

64
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,610
How many tickets?

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,990
Can I jump the queue? Take this.

66
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,310
Can I jump the queue?

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,070
Can I jump the queue?

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,990
Hey! No cutting, man.

69
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
What are you doing?

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,390
Stop, don't cut in.

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,470
Do you have a VVVVIP membership?

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,950
What VIP?

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,590
A lot of money.

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,550
No IP. You can get an Annual Pass.

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,780
3888, do you want it?

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,590
38 million yuan?

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,660
3888 yuan.

78
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,190
Oh, no!

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,990
I spend tens of millions of yuan
every day.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,150
It's too cheap.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Are you crazy?

82
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,870
I'm not crazy.

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,750
I have to spend all my money.

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,590
I have to spend it all
to become a billionaire.

85
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,340
And this is...

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,070
Xiaodao, do you hear me?

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Copy that.

88
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,310
Xiaodao,

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,430
there's a psychopath.
Repeat, there's a psychopath.

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,140
I'm not a psycho.

91
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,190
We've found the target.

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,510
Take him away right now.

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,830
Do you accept oil?

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Over.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
- Over.
- Over.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,670
- Do you accept oil? I have oil.
- Go!

97
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,950
I'll give you a can of oil.
Please let me spend money!

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,710
Help!

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,390
What IP? Psycho.

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,870
I want your lollipop!
