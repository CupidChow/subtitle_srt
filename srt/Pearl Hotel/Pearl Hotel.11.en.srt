00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,500
=Episode 11=

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,510
Come on.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,390
What are you doing?

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,750
No one can stop me now.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,310
I'll make this place so terrifying

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,030
that Tang Yuanbao will be freaked out
and agree to anything.

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,590
What are you doing?

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,230
Next time.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,670
It's okay. It's okay.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,030
Shouldn't you be scaring them?

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,110
I've been waiting for you.

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,030
If you weren't upstairs,

15
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,030
who else could it be?

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,350
Is there a ghost?

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Yes.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,550
It's late. Let's go back.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,430
Did you hear footsteps?

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,150
What the hell?

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,550
Do you want to scare me to death?

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,070
Tiezui, didn't I tell you
to take care of Bao?

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,190
Why are you here?

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm scared.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,630
Someone left a bowl of noodles
at your door.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,390
There was a finger!

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,990
And someone was chopping things
in Room 404.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,550
You're not the target.
Why are you so scared?

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,670
The point is everyone is here,

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,310
so who's chopping things?

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,390
Bro, don't scare me!

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,430
Stop!

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,910
- Bro!
- Stop hitting me!

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,270
You're finally awake!

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,710
You hit me so hard!

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,710
I'm so glad you're fine.

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,630
I thought you were killed by the zombie.

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,950
You nearly killed me!

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,030
Tell me if it's already a mess.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,630
I only met two guards.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
They passed out.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,390
Great.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,910
We'll scare the rest of them
on the Ghost Festival.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,030
Come here.

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,630
Landi,

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,030
- it's a brilliant idea.
- Well done.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,550
You did a good job.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Thanks, boss.

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,030
As you can see, it was a great show.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,710
Shall we talk about the price?

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,430
No rush, okay?

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,270
Duan and Xiaodao aren't here. Tiezui,

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,710
did you really see them downstairs?

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,070
I did. Duan was lying on the floor,

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,310
and Xiaodao was crying
and hitting his chest.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,270
Did we go too far?

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,630
Of course.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,510
I asked you to the movies several times,

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,590
but you bailed on me.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,950
You should care about me
instead of them.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,110
What's wrong with you?

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,710
He's a good guy.

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,270
If he hadn't saved Bao,

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,270
our plan wouldn't have worked.

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,550
Have you found it?

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,830
There's no peach-wood sword.

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,750
Maybe the former tenants were deceived.

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,950
What should we do?

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,270
Actually,

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,990
we don't have to find
the original sword.

71
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,390
They won't find out this one is fake.

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,670
Push it like this.

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,270
Do the same thing at the stairs.

74
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,110
Do you understand your mission?

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,110
I won't let you fall.

76
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,130
Go home!

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,110
Bao, go home!

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,310
We can't have mercy at this point.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,550
When this is over,

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,870
we'll get the apartments
and the compensation,

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,630
and you and Bao will be able to
get rid of your ex-husband.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,910
But I'm worried about him.

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,030
He was freaked out.

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,030
He had a fever of 38.7 degrees
this morning.

85
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,030
It's none of my business.

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,030
I didn't know
until I heard it from Tiezui.

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,390
Nothing happened last night.

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,470
Tang Yuanbao's secretary did come.

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,030
Duan asked me to deceive Xiaodao.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,750
- Duan?
- Duan?

91
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,230
It hurts!

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,350
Why did you hit me so hard?

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,270
I'm fragile, okay?

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Bro.

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,710
You know something, right?

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
I do.

97
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,710
Of course I do.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,390
I know you're ungrateful.

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,710
Look what you've done!

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,390
Made in China.

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,830
A pendant from a mummy
from the Qing Dynasty,

102
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,390
made in China?

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,030
Nothing wrong with that.

104
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,030
The Qing Dynasty...

105
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,350
The Qing Dynasty is also China.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Bro.

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,470
Did you know

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,910
they'd pose as ghosts yesterday?

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,990
I...

110
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,750
I want to sleep.

111
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,230
You knew Landi was here, right?

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,030
Here's 300 thousand yuan.

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,310
If you help me
kick the remaining tenants out,

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,430
I'll tell you the password.

115
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,950
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,110
300 thousand yuan.
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

117
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,510
I'll see what I can do.

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,350
It was you who tampered with
the footage, right?

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,710
Tiezui didn't see me on the 3rd floor
because of you.

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,310
That's right.

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,550
The broken sword too?

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,670
Yes.

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,030
I have nothing to do with it.

124
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,750
I took a fragment,
so you couldn't find it.

125
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,310
But it was they
who planned the first accident.

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,510
How do you know?

127
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,230
Tiezui told me.

128
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,470
Do you know how hard it was

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,110
to get him to talk?

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,030
What are you thinking?
I made a bowl of instant noodles.

131
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,030
You snitch.

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,030
How could you tell him?

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,030
I was starving last night.

134
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,790
But I didn't tell them
you'd pose as ghosts.

135
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,590
Here we are!

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,310
No one is here.

137
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,030
- Exactly.
- Stop fussing.

138
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,550
Let's go.

139
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,540
(Dabao, Auntie Mei, Jian)

140
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,220
This is disgusting.
