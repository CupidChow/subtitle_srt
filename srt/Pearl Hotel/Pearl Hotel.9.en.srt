00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,270
Move.

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,470
Mr. Tang, it's time for the meeting.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,000
Landi?

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,710
Who are you?

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,310
I'm Xiaodao.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,310
What Xiaodao?

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,550
Last night, we...

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,400
Wait!

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Last night?

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,790
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,310
What last night?

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,910
I've never seen you.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,950
Is she the girl you talked about?

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,310
Yes.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,510
Maybe not.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,310
What? Yes or not?

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,510
She hasn't seen you before.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
No way.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,390
I did see her.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,270
Anyway, I've never seen you.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,990
Did you see a ghost?

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,470
Impossible! There are no ghosts!

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,880
Enough.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,310
The peach-wood sword is broken.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
Game over, right?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,990
Let's have a meeting.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,510
Last night? Let's go.

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,510
Mr. Tang, see you next time!

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,950
I did see her last night.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,770
What should we do?

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,510
It's really gone.

(Believe in Science)

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,150
I believe in you.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
How can you do this to me?

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,630
What happened last night
is not scientific at all.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Xiaodao!

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,870
Let me in.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,030
Dabao.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,910
I'm fine.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,990
Just go back and take care of Bao.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,550
I made pork haslet soup.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,710
It'll get cold.

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,310
Okay, I'll drink it.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,030
Dabao, I'm drinking it right now.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,550
I'm Duan.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,630
Just drink your soup.
Why don't you let me in?

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,910
It's my room.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Bro.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,150
I haven't quit my job.

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,510
What are you doing?

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,030
Oh, no. A fragment is missing.

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,310
Tang Yuanbao took it
when we weren't looking.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Bro.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,230
I want to apologize to the tenants.

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,310
I didn't know the sword
was so important to them.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
Never mind.

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Let me do it.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,230
They're mad at you. No one will
talk to you except for Bao and Dabao.

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,150
Hey. I haven't finished.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,760
It's me.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,200
It's over now.

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,870
I'll pretend to be sick.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,670
I want to apologize for the sword.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm an atheist.

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,270
I don't believe in ghosts.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,670
However, I ignored your feelings.

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,750
I'll patrol the building on time

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,430
and ensure your safety.

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,430
The sword is broken,

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,030
but I won't let anything bad happen.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,590
The peach-wood sword
can chase away ghosts.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,590
Can you?

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,830
There are no ghosts in this world but

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,510
people who pretend to be ghosts.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,160
Look.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,270
Even Little Jian

83
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,670
doesn't believe your nonsense.

84
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,470
Think about it.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Auntie Mei.

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,790
Auntie Mei?

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,870
How dare you steal my things?

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,830
I want to apologize
for the peach-wood sword.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,030
It's gone!

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Hey, stop.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
Go away!

92
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,750
Calm down!

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,750
Go away! Go away!

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,230
Auntie Mei, calm down.

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,680
What did you tell her?

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,430
I wanted to apologize for

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,310
the broken sword.

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,380
Don't mention
the peach-wood sword again.

99
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,990
Auntie Mei can't accept

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,110
the fact that it's broken.

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,590
Isn't it just a sword?

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,310
It can't make any difference.

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,230
I'll buy another sword in the market

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,350
and hang it, okay?

105
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,030
You're the only one who thinks
it's useless.

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,230
How old are you?

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,710
How long have you lived here?

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,830
She's been here for decades.

109
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,390
She saw the exorcist dispel evil

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,190
and hang the sword here.

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,030
Maybe it's useless,

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,270
but it's

113
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,390
Auntie Mei's faith.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,510
You destroyed something
she has believed in

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,790
for decades,

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,270
and you think it's not a big deal.

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,510
All you do is apologize.

118
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,350
If you were her, would you accept it?

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,510
I swear I'll fulfill my duty

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,430
and protect everyone.

121
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,800
Dabao!

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,240
Let me help you.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
No need.

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,510
I know the broken sword
is not your fault.

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,630
But what you've done lately

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,630
has made me uncomfortable.

127
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,030
Can you ignore us and stay in

128
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,030
the guard room like Duan did?

129
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,950
It's good for everyone.

130
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,910
But... But I want to...

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,990
You were also uncomfortable

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,990
when I took care of you this morning,
weren't you?
