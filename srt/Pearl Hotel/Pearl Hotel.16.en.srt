00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,540
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Hurry!

5
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,770
Hello?

6
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,030
Boss, everything's going as planned.

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,910
Okay. Okay.

8
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
(Pearl Hotel)

9
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,550
Come on.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,710
Mr. Tang, have a seat.

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay.

12
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,350
Just tell me what you want.

13
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,990
We've always wanted

14
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,240
the same thing.

15
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Move back.

16
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,310
Actually, Mr. Tang
talked to them about it,

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,310
but the other shareholders

18
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
wouldn't agree.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,390
Then there's nothing to talk about.

20
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,550
I'm also

21
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,430
responsible for

22
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,510
the broken sword,

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,510
so I made a new peach-wood sword.

24
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,150
Today is the Ghost Festival.

25
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,790
I hope this sword

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,790
and help you get through

27
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,990
the long night.

28
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Let's go.

29
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,270
Ghost! Ghost!

30
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,490
Ghost!

31
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,660
Ghost!

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,310
Ghost!

33
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,550
What the hell?
Who turned off the lights?

34
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,270
Boss, it wasn't me.

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,990
Maybe the power is cut off.

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,470
Are the 1st and 2nd floors ready?

37
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,390
3rd floor is ready,
2nd floor underway,

38
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,870
1st floor not ready.

39
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,510
Hurry up!

40
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,350
Little Jian, time to work.

41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Let's go.

42
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,730
Come on.

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,550
Ghost!

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,030
Stop screaming!

45
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,950
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,310
Listen, when the music
and the smoke start,

47
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,510
show up and dance,

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,590
understand?

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,870
Do your best. Now go!

50
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,310
Dabao.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,510
Did you see something terrifying?

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,870
Aren't you scared?

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,230
Am I supposed to be scared?

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,030
Look how scared they are.

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,470
Shouldn't you pretend it too?

56
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Frankie.

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,070
What's going on?

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,550
This is so awkward.

59
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,470
Stop yelling!

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,030
The power was cut off too early.

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,190
The 1st floor is not ready.

62
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,070
We have to lure them to the 2nd floor.

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,550
What are we waiting for?

64
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,150
Little Jian and Tiezui!

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Tiezui?

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,030
Come on. Let's lure them
to the 2nd floor.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,110
They're in my room.

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,790
It's on the 2nd floor,
and this is the 1st floor.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,430
Exactly.

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,030
Let's go. Come on.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,830
Mr. Tang, it's too dangerous.

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,030
Maybe we should go upstairs.

73
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,030
Yes.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,030
It's safer. Come on. Let's go.

75
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,310
Come on.

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,470
The light is on without electricity!

77
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,870
It's so scary!

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,310
Oh my god! It's terrifying!

79
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,150
So terrifying!

80
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,390
It's so scary!

81
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,450
