2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,550
After the old lady died a year ago,

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,590
the tenants said
they often saw her spirit.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,910
There are no ghosts in the world.
You need to believe in science.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,710
You don't understand.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,550
Let me introduce him.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,350
This is our new security guard.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,430
If you need anything, just ask him.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,030
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ma Xiaodao, the new...

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,030

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,550
All the lights

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,230
are powered by the batteries
Auntie Mei picked up.

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,470
Where did she find them?
I'll go tomorrow.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,590
They were all deceived
by the real estate developer.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,470
He said they'd get the room

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,950
after paying rent for 20 years.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,290
Auntie Mei has rented it for 19 years,

18
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,850
and Jian has lived here for 17 years.

19
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,190
Dabao is even worse.

20
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,190
He paid 20 years of rent at a time,

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,150
but they never fulfilled
their commitment.

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,070
Now they've sold the place

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,430
and run away,

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,590
and the tenants have no place to go.

That's your bed.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,910
You'll sleep there.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,470
I'm going to sleep.

Xiaodao!

Get up!

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,830
Where is it?

41
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,510
What?

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,750
Where is my treasure?

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,390
Come here! Where is my treasure?

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
My treasure...

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
What treasures?

46
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,670
My treasure...

47
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,070
Buddha statues and tablets!

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,670
Bro, I threw them all away.

49
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
They're too big.

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
Threw them away?

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,510
It's so superstitious. Look.

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,190
Believe in science. Isn't it great?

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Threw them?

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Yes.

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,270
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for them?

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,630
It doesn't matter.
Bro, you have to believe in science.

57
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,280
Did you post this?

58
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,120
Well,

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,510
you look so fresh.

60
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,270
I can help you freshen up.

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,510
I'm feeling good.

62
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,670
I'll help you freshen up!

63
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Bro!

64
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,820
Bro!

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Bro!

66
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,350
Time to work!

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,110
Who's this?

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,470
He's a thief.

69
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,070
He sneaked into our room last night.

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Thief?

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,350
He's a priest,

72
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,350
not a thief.

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,870
How could you beat a noble priest?

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,630
I didn't beat him.

75
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,580
Wait. Bro...

76
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,630
- Come on.
- Don't blame me.

77
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,830
You were snoring so loud,

78
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,030
and I didn't know what to do.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,230
I could only tie him up.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
I'm so sorry.

82
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,350
Sorry, he's new here. I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,510
Come on.

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,070
It's okay. Here you are.

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,110
Master, here's the thing.

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,510
We only have a few tenants.

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,390
If you're staying temporarily,
you can go to the 4th floor.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,790
Room 403 or Room 404.

89
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,890
Room 403 is better.

90
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,510
Someone died in Room 404.

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,030
You don't need to pay rent, but...

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,510
But you can't sneak into
the guard room again,

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,510
or I'll tie you up every time.

94
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,950
Did I ask you to speak?

95
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,190
Can't you just shut up?

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,630
Did I allow you to speak?

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,510
Where were we, Master?

98
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,230
Stay away from us.

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,270
Read the security manual. Go!

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,270
He's just a kid.

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Please don't mind.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,810
Thank you, sir.

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
It's okay.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,350
Sir,

105
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,950
you don't look well.

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,070
May I read your fortune?

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,070
Master, no, I don't believe in this.

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,550
It's free.

109
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,040
Please.

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
You'll die!

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,120
What?

112
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,350
You'll die!

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,630
What?

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
You're going to die!
