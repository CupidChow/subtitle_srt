(Pearl Hotel)

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,220
=Episode 20=

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,230
Xiaodao was right.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,190
There are no ghosts.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,110
Humans are much worse than ghosts.

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,790
Xiaodao just wanted to fulfill his duty
as a security guard.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,990
He shouldn't have ended up like this.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,550
I thought I found the love of my life,

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,830
but he beat me every day.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,910
Bao was supposed to have a brother.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,310
However,

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,390
my ex-husband hit me so hard
and killed the baby.

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,410
I just want to give Bao a better life!

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,190
This is my only chance
to make it happen!

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,430
I just want to make money

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,990
and find a place to live.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,950
I'm poor,

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,070
so I've never got what I want.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,110
If I kick you out,
I'll be able to change my life.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,020
Am I wrong?

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,430
Am I wrong?

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,760
I've lived here

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,230
my entire life.

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,710
Do you know

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,950
what it's like to be old and alone?

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
The bank...

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,030
is urging me to pay the loans.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,190
My employees need their salaries.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,350
I even borrowed money

31
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,430
to pay this useless man.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,710
Pearl Hotel is my last chance.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,470
What else can I do?

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,750
Why don't you kill me?

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,990
I'm useless?

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
You...

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,680
You!

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,810
All of you.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,610
Have you ever been

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,190
starved for three days?

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,110
I was so hungry that I had to
go through the garbage

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,390
and eat other people's leftovers!

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,670
So, I told myself...

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,630
I told myself

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,630
I had to

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,470
get rid of that life!

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,010
I...

49
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,410
I...

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,670
Are you going to talk or not?

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
I...

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,990
I love you, Dabao!

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,310
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,710
I... I love you!

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,310
Stop saying that!

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,630
My mom will only slap you for that!

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,240
I remember you told me

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,150
that priest left the sword

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,360
and told you something.

60
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,470
He said, "From now on,

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,430
you must

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,750
do good deeds

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,990
and restrain your desires

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,990
for long-lasting safety."

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,910
Guys, listen,

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
if...

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,870
if I can get out alive,

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,310
I'll hire all of you.

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,390
I'll build a hostel for you,

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,670
and we'll live together!

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Okay!

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,350
You promised us.

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,030
When I get out,
I'll be the first to support you, okay?

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,790
It's a deal.

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Are you okay?

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,430
I heard your confession.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
Hu...

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,870
Hu, listen to me,

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,020
murder is a capital crime.
Hu, it's not worth it.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,030
Who wants to murder you?

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,750
Didn't you come back for revenge?

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,550
Yes, I did,

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,640
but I just wanted to scare you.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,910
I was going to lock you up
for a few days,

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,030
and you'd eat the spoiled meat.

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,030
I didn't expect you
to confess your sins so soon.

87
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,470
You released gas.

88
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,030
How can we live for that long?

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,230
I didn't release gas.

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,310
Then please release us, okay?

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,910
Otherwise, we're all going to die here.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,230
I threw the key.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,030
But someone has called the police.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,030
They'll be here in a minute.
