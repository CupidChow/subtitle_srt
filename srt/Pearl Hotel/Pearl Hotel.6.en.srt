(Dabao, Auntie Mei, Jian)

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,150
I'm speechless.

=Episode 6=

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,310
What exactly do you want?

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,790
I want to kill you!

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,440
Stay back!

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,270
Release Mr. Tang.

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,430
It's a crime!

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,270
Crime? He brought them here
to threaten us!

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,270
He cut off our water and power
to force us to leave! Is it legal?

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,880
There's no evidence!

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,260
There's no evidence!

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,590
If anything happens to my boss,
I'll kill you!

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,710
Shut up!

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,270
What did you say?

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,270
If anything happens to him?

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,270
I'm going to beat the hell out of him!

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,270
What can you do?

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Let's go!

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,310
Calm down!

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,510
Bao, watch out!

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,390
Oh, no! The peach-wood sword dropped!

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,550
Bao!

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,230
Bao, are you okay?

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,590
Come on. Get up.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,590
Stay with your mom.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,340
Bao, let's go!

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,590
What happened?

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,630
How could you break that?

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,390
Run!

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,550
Run, or you'll be killed by the ghosts!

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,030
Why are they so scared?

35
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,270
It's just the wind. It's not a big deal.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,230
Do you have any idea what you've done?

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,770
What have I done?

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,190
I had to save Bao.

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,650
I don't know what to say.

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,450
How did you grow up?

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,210
Grow up?

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,070
I grew up with everyone treating me like

43
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,070
Nezha's reincarnation!

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
What?

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,150
I dream of Nezha calling me mother.

46
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,920
You must my little Nezha.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,030
Since then,

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,390
all the villagers treated me like Nezha.

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,030
When bad things happened,

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,710
they'd ask me to stay for a while.

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,030
After I was born,

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,030
my dad quit his job

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,030
and started to drink and gamble all day.

54
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,190
If I was Nezha's reincarnation,

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,150
my dad wouldn't do that.

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,590
He's the reincarnation of
the Third Lotus Prince Nezha.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,830
Ghosts can't hurt him.

58
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,110
What are you doing?

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Tell me,

61
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,230
are you Nezha's reincarnation?

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,030
So, you shouldn't fear ghosts.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
That's right.

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,550
Enough.

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,230
It's patrol time.

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
My head...

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,270
I'm so dizzy!

68
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,070
It's so cold!

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,470
Xiaodao, I'm cold! Aren't you cold?

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,680
What?

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,040
You can wear

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,950
my uniform tonight.

73
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,260
(Security)

74
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,110
This one?

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,910
The uniform?

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,030
Are you serious?

77
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,270
Do you want it?

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,440
Thank you so much.

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,630
Did you see the key to Room 404?

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,800
No.

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,990
Just look for it.
