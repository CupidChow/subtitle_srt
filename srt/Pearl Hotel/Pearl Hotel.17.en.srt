4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,750
Boss, I'm ready.

5
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,250
I'll find a place to hide.

6
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,400
I was freaked out.

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,350
It looks good.

8
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,030
Mr. Tang, do you like it?

9
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,750
Did you do this?

10
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,110
It's good.

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,120
It's not my stuff.

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,610
Not your stuff?

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,590
The effect...

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,230
It's amazing.

15
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,730
And the

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
colorful lights.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,190
Is this your...?

18
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,790
No! It's not!

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
What about this?

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
Not my stuff.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,070
Did you arrange this?

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,510
No, we didn't!

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,510
Did you?

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,310
No!

25
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,770
Hurry up!

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,670
Tiezui, it's all your fault!

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,030
Why didn't you tell me
about the Ghost Festival?

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,190
How can you blame me?

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,270
I wanted to check the calendar!
You threw it!

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,440
Did I?

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,590
Hey, you were screaming a minute ago.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Why are you smiling?

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
What's going on?

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,030
They're kids.

35
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,580
Kids?

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,630
They're kids?

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,350
It's my turn now.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Don't go.

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,990
The real ghost is here.
It won't make a difference.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
No!

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,590
It's just like collecting trash.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,390
I can't waste it!

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Why are they scared?

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,070
They're not real ghosts.

45
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
That's right.

46
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,030
It's great.

47
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,030
It looks cool.

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
Mr. Tang.

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,870
It's real.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,470
I know. You did a good job.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,480
It's amazing!

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,030
No! Mr. Tang, it's a real ghost!

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,030
Real ghost!

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
It's real?

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,790
It's Little Jian.

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,030
Well done, Little Jian!

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,110
It did it.

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,390
Zombies and messengers from hell.

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,750
They're on our side.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,230
Our people.

61
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,350
What about this?

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,830
- We arranged it.
- It's arranged.

63
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,350
Arranged.

64
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,830
It stinks!

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,390
That one is real! It's a ghost!

66
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,550
Little Jian, I knew it was you.

67
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,670
Ghost!

68
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,390
Tang Yuanbao, you're disgusting!

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,030
Do you have to be so nasty

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,030
and play dirty tricks?

71
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,660
Well done.

72
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,350
Do you have to be ghosts?

73
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,510
