00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,620
(Pearl Hotel)

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,350
You have to kick out
the remaining three households!

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,550
If you fail, you'll be fired!

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,430
Boss, do we need weapons?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,230
No, no need.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,270
Just scare them.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,430
I don't want to see anyone die.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,110
Come on.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,110
Landi,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,430
you don't need to go.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,400
Talk to the filmmaker.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,070
Boss, I've got this.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,100
=Pearl Hotel=

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,140
=Episode 5=

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
Bao!

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,550
Are you okay?

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,270
Why are you here alone?

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,190
Come at me! Don't hurt the kid!

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,790
Bao, come on.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,510
Sorry, I heard Bao screaming.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,430
I thought Tang Yuanbao's people
came here again.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,790
Are you okay?

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm fine.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,980
Bao, are you okay?

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,860
Brother, I'm fine.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,300
Miss, why is the light
so dim on this floor?

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,660
Because the secret of Pearl Hotel
is hidden here.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,300
What secret?

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,740
Pearl Hotel used to be
a workers' hostel.

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,020
Too many people committed suicide,

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,100
and strange things happened
all the time,

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,700
so they hired a priest

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,820
from Hong Kong for exorcism.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,020
Why would they do that?
It must be fake. He's a charlatan.

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,820
This hotel...

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,540
Who are you?

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
It's a haunted place

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,660
occupied by resentful spirits.

39
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,820
It's said a peach-wood sword
was placed here

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,900
to suppress the spirits.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,660
How do you know about the sword?

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,300
I'm a priest.

43
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,780
Dark smoke

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,180
is hanging over the hotel.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,820
I can feel the resentment.

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
And this

47
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,380
is going viral on the internet.

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,020
Tang Yuanbao did this!

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,300
He's a criminal!

50
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,540
When we moved in,

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
they told us we could
buy it by paying rent,

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,460
so we paid 20 years of rent at a time.

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,460
They promised we'd get the apartment,

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,100
now they're asking us to leave.

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,940
Where can we go?

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,660
We have no place to go!

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,300
How could he force us to move?

58
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,460
Miss, calm down.

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,100
We can figure it out.

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,540
You mentioned Tang Yuanbao a lot.

61
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,940
Tang Yuanbao!

62
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,180
Who is he?

63
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,660
Empty the building!

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,540
Nasty rat!

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,300
Take care of Bao.

66
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,460
Follow this brother.

67
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,100
Dabao!

68
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,100
Take care of Bao.

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,620
I'm worried about her.

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,220
What are you doing?

71
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,300
Your duty is to take care of me
instead of going downstairs.

72
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,940
I'm warning you.

73
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,180
Stop thinking about my mom.

74
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,100
I can't stand how you look at her.

75
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,540
Don't you dare touch my mom.

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,940
Ask your beast to shut up!

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,580
It's not a beast.

78
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,940
Its name is Little Jian.

79
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,460
It's your father!

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,900
I can smell trash!

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,740
What did you say?

82
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Who's trash? I'll kill you!

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,770
Come on!

84
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,650
Bring it on!

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,410
Come on!

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,100
Calm down!

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,680
Calm down!

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,620
Move!

89
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,780
Boss.

90
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
Guys,

91
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,090
I've heard the water and electricity

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,670
are often cut off.

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,190
As a local developer,

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,950
I'm here to see

95
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,550
if there's anything I can do to help.

96
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,790
Great. Can I have a uniform?

97
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,190
What? Uniform?

98
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,350
Who are you?

99
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,070
The new security guard.

100
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,670
Are you kidding me?

101
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,230
Why does he only care about
the uniform at this point?

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Exactly.

103
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,190
Listen,

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,350
if you promise that we can move back,

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,790
I'll leave immediately.

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,790
Stop dreaming.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,980
Old woman!

108
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,340
Listen,

109
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,630
you won't even get a bed!

110
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,390
You should be grateful

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,230
that I'll return your rent.

112
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,830
We agreed to buy the rooms
by paying rent,

113
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,630
so we've lived here
for more than 10 years.

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,950
We're about to get the apartments,
and you're kicking us out!

115
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,550
Did you sign the contracts with me?

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,950
Did you pay me rent?

117
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,490
The developer deceived you.
Why do I have to pay for this?

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,790
What exactly do you want?

119
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,280
I want to kill you!

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,550
Stay back!

121
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,130
