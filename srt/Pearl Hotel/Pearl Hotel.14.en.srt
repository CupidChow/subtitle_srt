Grandma!

Grandma!

Xiaodao!

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,170
Bao is missing.

15
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,190
Can you hear me?

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,420
Did you tell them?

17
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
No.

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,870
Then tell them now.

19
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,460
Wouldn't it be better if they helped us?

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,230
They're exhausted.
I don't want to bother them.

21
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,510
It's not a big place.

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,750
Let's look for him.

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,030
You can call the police.

24
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,030
I'll look around.

25
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,890
Okay, I'll call the police.

26
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,030
Please look for him!

27
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,270
Hu, listen to me.

28
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,550
Please calm down.

29
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,470
Did you jump off the building

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,390
because of your grandma?

31
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,350
I didn't want to jump.

32
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,030
I went to the roof to get some air

33
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,270
and clear my head.

34
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,630
Grandma!

35
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,030
Give me the phone.

36
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
What?

37
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,230
What took the police so long?

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,150
Stop.

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,630
Don't use my phone to call the police.

40
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,270
It'll be broken.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,510
You're broken.

42
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,550
Just go home. I've called the police.

43
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,070
Just go! I'm here!

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,590
I'll go back to call the police!

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,950
She won't jump. Just go back.

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,790
She won't jump. Leave!

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
She really jumped.

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,500
She really jumped.

49
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,510
She really jumped.

50
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,750
She's dead.

51
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,480
Is she dead?

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,630
Hu...

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,150
The girl from Room 404...

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,030
Call a doctor!

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,870
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,590
She's alive! Stop shooting! Hurry!

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,790
Open the door!

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,110
I didn't want to jump.

59
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,030
I went to the roof to get some air

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,030
and clear my head.

61
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,340
I needed to think about my future.

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,190
The power was cut off,

63
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,670
I couldn't see anything and slipped.

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,030
Hu.

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,910
I saved your life.

66
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,390
Why did you kidnap me?

67
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,630
How dare you say this?

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,470
If you hadn't stalled for time

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,030
but helped me carry my grandma,

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,390
she wouldn't have died!

71
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,550
No one is innocent!

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,030
If they'd had a little sympathy,

73
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,030
she would still be alive!

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,510
Hu!

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,630
The kid... The kid is innocent.
Please let him go.

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Innocent?

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,750
My grandma and I were also innocent!

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
What are you doing?

79
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
He's innocent.

80
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,750
What are you doing?

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Listen,

82
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,390
I'm not a monster.

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,030
I know he's innocent.

84
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,550
The police said...

85
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
I found him.

86
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
He's sleeping.

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,520
You found him?

88
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,910
Really?

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
See for yourself.
