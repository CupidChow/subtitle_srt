(Pearl Hotel)

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,980
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,990
It's up to you.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,750
We're about to get Pearl Hotel.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,990
By the way,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,990
I've been wondering

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,470
why you're so obsessed with Pearl Hotel.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,510
I'm not obsessed with the hotel

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,710
but the money.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,150
Have you ever heard of the saying

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,550
Preventing others from making money
is like murder.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,550
What they're doing is murder.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,710
Hello,

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm Duan.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,710
I'm leaving tomorrow.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,390
By the way, take your card back
when you have time.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,430
I can't do it.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,430
Thanks, bye.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,550
I don't need this.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,150
I'll give it to Auntie Mei.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,720
From now on,

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,440
it's yours.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,850
Take it!

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,140
- I...
- Hurry!

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,710
Listen,

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
my principle is always

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,510
turn a blind eye.

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,950
I could run and hide.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,430
Sometimes I passed out, right?

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,430
Everything was fine.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,470
But since you came,

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,270
I've realized

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,350
I've been

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,430
lying to myself.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,030
Don't do that, okay?

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
Bro.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
I...

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
I...

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,230
Just speak.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,630
You can tell me anything.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,710
Did you wash the uniform?

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,150
Wash it yourself!

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,690
Bro.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,230
I want to take the morning off.

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
For what?

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll do something

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,470
as a real security guard.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,550
Time to work. Come on.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
What work?

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,590
We need to arrange this place.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Am I part of this?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Three meals.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
And late-night snacks.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Deal.

56
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,860
(Guard Room)

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,950
Tiezui, can I borrow your robe?

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,370
I'll pay you two buns.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,110
It's in Room 403.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,990
Thanks, boss.

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,870
Wait a minute.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,310
Did you see the key to Room 404?

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
No.

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,270
Look for it later.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Tiezui,

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,710
did you go to Room 404?

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,070
No. What's wrong with Room 404?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,270
Nothing. It's cool, right?

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,820
Excuse me.

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,630
Is it yours?

71
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,430
Thank you for picking it up,

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,110
or they'll fine me.

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,390
Not a big deal.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,150
Do you want to sign up for an extra?

75
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,630
What do you think of

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,480
my outfit?

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,270
It's great. Come with me.

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Thanks.

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Move a bit.

80
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,630
To the left.

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,710
What are you doing?

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,550
We're arranging...

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,540
Eight-trigram circle!

84
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,120
It's an Eight-trigram circle.

85
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,450
Eight-trigram circle?

86
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,150
The peach-wood sword is broken,

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,670
so we want to arrange
an Eight-trigram circle

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,770
to guard this place.

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,630
Okay.

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,380
Oh, it's my last day.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

91
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,920
Do you need help?

92
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,930
No, no need.

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,350
It's your first day.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,990
You have many things to do.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,580
- Just do your things.
- Fine.

96
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,870
Eight-trigram circle...

97
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,690
Go on with your work, okay?

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Auntie Mei.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,860
Auntie Mei.
