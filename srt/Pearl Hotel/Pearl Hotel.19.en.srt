00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,980
=Episode 19=

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,470
- Let's go.
- Duan?

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Duan.

6
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,230
What happened to Duan?

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,350
It's enough!

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,550
Go to hell.

9
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,190
Auntie Mei, hurry up!

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,350
Find the chute!

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,310
Hurry up! Come in!

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,030
Hold the door!

13
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,410
Come on!

14
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,270
Let's go!

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,110
Hurry!

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,360
Let's go!

17
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,980
Hurry up!

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,940
Hurry up! Come on!

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,390
Hurry!

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,750
Hurry!

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,150
Hold this!

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,670
You should be responsible.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,830
You kissed me. I want another apartment.

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,030
What are you doing?

25
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,150
What's wrong with you?

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
What?

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,480
Are you okay?

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,630
Where are we? It stinks!

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,630
This is the garbage room!

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,110
How can it smell good?

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,030
Where are we?

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,990
The basement.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The basement?

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,270
I've never been here before.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,470
We didn't know this place until now.

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,030
Go away.

37
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,370
Where's Xiaodao?

38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
Where's Xiaodao?

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,000
Xiaodao...

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Xiaodao?

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Xiaodao is lying on the floor.

42
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,000
He can't move.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What do you mean?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What does he mean?

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,290
It stinks. Let's get out first.

46
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,000
Something's wrong.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,940
It smells like

48
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,000
corpse.

49
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,300
Corpse!

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,140
Corpse!

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190
That's what spoiled pork smells like.

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,030
I knew it.

53
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,990
I saw someone chopping things in Room 404.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,660
So, it was pork, wasn't it?

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,640
Oh, no.

56
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,310
At that time, Jian was on the 2nd floor,
and Xiaodao and Duan

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,710
were on the 3rd floor.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,590
Who was chopping pork?

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,390
I got it. It was Hu.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
She knew we'd go down,

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,030
so she wanted to make us sick.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
- Hu?
- Hu?

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Yes.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,790
The girl who jumped?

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,470
Didn't she die?

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
No.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,870
She didn't die.
It was she who kidnapped me and Bao!

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,670
I don't remember.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She must've drugged Bao.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He forgot everything.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Forgot it?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mom!

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's get out. Don't stay here.

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,670
Why are you still collecting trash?

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,160
Wait!

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,630
I remember now.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Before I passed out,

78
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
in Room 404,

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
I...

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,030
I saw a woman in white,

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
and she...

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,750
tucked her head. I saw it!

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,310
Yes, yes.

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,070
That ghost forced us to come here.

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,310
Hu is that ghost!

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,270
That's right.
A real ghost wouldn't smash the door.

87
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,190
So, it's also a human.

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,590
On the Ghost Festival,

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,430
four groups of people

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,550
posed as ghosts in Pearl Hotel.

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,470
So ridiculous.

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,870
It means Xiaodao was right.

93
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,590
There are no ghosts in this world.

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,150
When I get out,

95
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,310
I won't go easy on Hu!

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,390
Stop saying that!

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,150
Shouldn't we get out first?

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,030
She wants to kill us.

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,390
Listen,

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,710
she believes

101
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,270
we killed her grandma.

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,550
What? I don't even know her!
How can she blame me?

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,550
You cut off the power,
and she fell from the roof!

104
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,560
How's that possible?

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,330
- She'll kill you first, understand?
- Stop!

106
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,280
You'll be the first to die, understand?

107
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,430
Stop! Stop!

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,670
Can't you smell it now?

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,270
Let's get out first!

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,710
Let's go.

111
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,630
The door is locked.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,350
Open the door!

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,030
- She really wants to kill us all.
- What?

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,630
She'll kill us all.

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,590
What's the smell?

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,530
It's gas.

117
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,030
Gas...

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,150
Where's Xiaodao?

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,590
Where is Xiaodao?

120
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,070
How could he leave

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,930
at this point?

122
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,830
We pushed him down.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,670
We didn't mean to do that.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,590
Xiaodao was right.

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,190
There are no ghosts.

126
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,110
Humans are much worse than ghosts.
