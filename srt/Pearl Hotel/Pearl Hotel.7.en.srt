(Pearl Hotel)

00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,060
(Intern)

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,060
=Episode 7=

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,020
There are no ghosts.

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,790
Why are you acting like a ghost?

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,590
You broke the seal
of the peach-wood sword.

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,190
The ghosts upstairs are powerful.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,790
Nonsense!
There are no ghosts in this world.

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,390
You're so stubborn. The ghost scratched
the wall and knocked on my door.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,470
It even left "Death" at my door
with charms.

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,510
Are you an idiot?

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,230
If the ghost wanted to hurt you,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,030
why would it leave a character?

15
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,190
Did you hear that?

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,830
How can you say there are no ghosts?

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,390
What's wrong with singing?

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,030
You can't sing?

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,150
Dabao is the only woman here.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,030
She's on the 4th floor.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,710
We're on the 2nd floor.

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,750
If it wasn't a ghost,

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,950
who else could sing?

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,110
I'll prove

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,510
there are no ghosts, okay?

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,030
Go away. Don't touch me.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,030
Come on. Let me

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,180
- show you.
- No!

30
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,180
- You...
- No way!

31
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,000
No!

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Wait!

33
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,910
- Come on!
- Help!

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,130
Come on!

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,110
Help!

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,270
The guard is hitting me!

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,550
- Help!
- I'll prove there are no ghosts!

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,380
He's hitting me! Help!

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,130
He's hitting me!

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,000
Go!

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,240
Somebody!

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,020
Help!

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,470
I've told you it's not a ghost. Come on.

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Who are you?

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,030
I should be asking you.

46
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,390
This is my room!

47
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,190
I'm the security guard.

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,030
Stop looking!

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,270
You're so rude to a lady!

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,350
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,830
I'll sue you for sexual harassment!

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,830
Please don't!

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Apologize!

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,830
- Get out!
- Okay!

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,030
Apologize!

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Get out!

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,470
Let's go.

58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,700
(Intern)

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,190
What's wrong with you?

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,990
Sorry. I thought you were a thief.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,350
Why would a thief come here?

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,470
To steal trash?

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Then why are you here?

64
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,610
I'm Landi, the secretary
to the president of Yuanbao Property.

65
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,830
I know who you are.

66
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,230
You work for the guy
who made a scene today, right?

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,350
You failed last time,

68
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,470
so you're here to scare us
by posing as a ghost, right?

69
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,070
We heard an idiot

70
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,670
broke the peach-wood sword,

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,310
so Tang Yuanbao forced me
to check on the building tonight.

72
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,160
However, it was so dark,
and I couldn't see anything.

73
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,510
I got lost in this place

74
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,950
and couldn't find the way out.

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,750
When I finally saw you and wanted

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,350
to ask you for directions,

77
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,390
you thought I was a ghost
and wanted to hit me.

78
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,190
I didn't mean to hurt you.

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,950
My apology.

81
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,630
Do you think

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,510
it was a ghost knocking on the wall?

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,510
No way. Trust me.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,030
There are no ghosts in this world.

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Who?

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,470
It's me. I'm Tiezui.

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,070
What's the matter?

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,900
A woman with a guitar

89
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,950
is hiding in the hotel.

90
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,630
She was the one who sang.

91
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
What do you want?

92
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm hungry,

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,030
and I don't want to go back to Room 403.

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,070
Do you have food?

95
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Yes.

96
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,070
I have a slap.

97
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,910
Enjoy it!

98
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,800
Stop.

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,190
Tang Yuanbao is short and ugly,

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,510
but he really paid for this place.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,670
Maybe he paid money,

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,550
but he can't cut off the water and power
and brought them here to make trouble.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,190
We talked to them many times,
but they wouldn't move.

104
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,950
We had no other way.

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,030
Can you help us persuade them?

106
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,270
I'm just a security guard.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,630
What can I do?
