00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,710
Tang Yuanbao hired them to pose
as ghosts yesterday.

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,710
Who posed as ghosts?

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,350
What are you talking about?
Do you have proof?

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,870
No, I saw it with my own eyes!

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,020
(Yuanbao Property)

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,150
You saw what? It was you

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,190
who broke the sword
and released the ghosts.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,270
They're real ghosts!

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,230
Ghost! Ghost!

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,510
Shut up. Let him finish, okay?

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,150
What are you arranging?

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,640
Here's the thing.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,590
I'm teaching them to
set up an Eight-trigram circle.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,590
You broke the peach-wood sword,

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,710
so we had to spend money
making this circle.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,800
Or what?

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,830
Who knows what will happen
on the Ghost Festival?

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,390
They're collecting heads!

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,470
I saw ghosts!

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,830
See? Do you understand now?

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Go away!

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,030
Auntie Mei is old. She's freaked out.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,270
It's okay. It's okay.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,830
Why don't we fire him?

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,710
Since he came,
so many bad things have happened.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,110
Didn't you break the sword
and put it back?

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,710
Thanks for your glasses.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,990
It seems Duan told him about it.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,470
Xiaodao.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,350
Why are you packing?

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,590
Aren't you going to fire me?

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,910
They were just kidding.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,690
I'll ask them to apologize.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Never mind.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,830
After all, this building
will be demolished soon.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
I can't stay for long.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
You're right.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,150
Good people don't belong here.

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,680
What are you doing?

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,390
What's wrong?

45
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,840
What?

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,830
What are you saying?

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,710
Go! Go!

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
What are you doing?

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,830
I've done all the work.

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,350
Why can't I get a share?

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,190
Don't ask for too much.

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,550
When this is over,

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,150
you'll never run out of
buns and instant noodles.

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,870
Come on. Nail this up.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,390
What's this for?

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,790
When the wind gets in,

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,430
it'll make a "woo" sound.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,550
Just like that.

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,630
Are you sure?

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,710
Dabao.

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,470
You're already here.

62
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,360
Well,

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,110
I want to tell you something.

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,270
I haven't finished the soup.
Take a seat.

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,270
Sit down and wait, okay?

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,710
It's almost ready.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,590
Where's Bao?

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,790
He should be somewhere playing.
I don't know.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
It'll be quick.

70
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Wait a minute, okay?

71
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,230
It's almost done.

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,590
Bro, you look so cool in this uniform.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,310
I want to come home in this outfit
during the Spring Festival.

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,990
I'll give it to you when I resign.

It doesn't matter.
Bro, you have to believe in science.

78
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,590
Did you post this?

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,710
Well, you look so fresh.

80

Do you mean this?

86

Hurry up, and you'll get your buns.
