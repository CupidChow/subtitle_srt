1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,620
(Pearl Hotel)

2
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,820
=Pearl Hotel=

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,860
=Episode 4=

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,710
You'll die!

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

6
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,270
You'll die!

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,550
What?

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,150
You're going to die!

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
I...

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,630
Master... Master...

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,590
What should I do?

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,510
There is a way.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,390
Tell me. Tell me.

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,590
He's the reincarnation of
the Third Lotus Prince Nezha.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,510
Ghosts can't hurt him.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,390
Stay close to him when it's haunted.

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,190
Then silently read

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,370
"Jiao,

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,590
Kang,

20
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,150
Shi, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji"

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,750
for three times.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,270
How can I tell if it's haunted?

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,510
You'll know

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,790
when you see it.

25
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,830
Jiao, Kang,

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,280
Shi,

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,310
Fang, Xin...

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Master...

29
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,670
Xiaodao. Come here, Xiaodao.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,320
What?

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,100
Stay with me.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Stay with me.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,630
What are you doing?

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
I must stay with you.

35
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,030
He said I'd die without you.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,030
Let's go. Let's go.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,470
Everyone dies, bro.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,030
Are you insane?

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,780
Slow down.

40
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,070
Slow down.

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,310
Bro, you said the old lady in Room 404
die a year ago.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,470
Where's her granddaughter?

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,270
She fell from the building.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,910
Fell?

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,750
It was the day of the Ghost Festival.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,270
The power suddenly went off,

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,140
and she fell from the rooftop.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,020
(Pearl)

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,550
Grandma! What am I supposed to do?

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,040
It's okay.

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,390
She won't jump. Just go home.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,190
She won't jump. Just go!

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,630
Leave here! Go!

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,910
She won't jump. Just...

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
What...?

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
She jumped!

57
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,250
She jumped!

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
She'd dead.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,910
Hu?

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,270
The girl in Room 404.

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,670
Slow down.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,190
Bro, he said...

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,350
You can stay with me,
but you don't have to hold me.

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,750
I want to hold you.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
Jian.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Jian, good morning.

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,830
Your dog is cute

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,910
and smart.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,190
Smarter than you.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,830
This is Xiaodao. You saw him last night.

71
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,040
Hello, Jian.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,470
This building is a mess.

73
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,750
Why do we need a new guard?

74
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,470
I know what you're up to.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,110
Stop, Little Jian.

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,510
It's gone. Stop barking.

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,390
Jian, Jian.

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,550
What's gone? What do you mean?

79
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,630
Can't you see it?

80
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,110
Jian, we're leaving.

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,830
Uncle Jian, goodbye.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,950
Jian, see you.

83
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
Bro,

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,950
is he really blind?

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,510
He can see things we can't see.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,460
Come on. You go first.

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,120
Bro, I'm here...

88
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,810
Auntie Mei.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Auntie Mei.

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,230
Auntie Mei, I've told you many times

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,190
don't pile them up here.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,230
It might cause a fire, understand?

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,230
It's on fire! On fire! Run!

94
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,230
Where's the fire?

95
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,270
Where's my whistle?

96
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,510
Are you looking for this?

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,590
It's too late!

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,030
What's too late?

99
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,790
The garbage truck is coming!
I need to collect bottles,

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,790
or it'll be too late!

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,390
I have to go!

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Wait!

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,670
What's wrong with her?

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,070
Bro, how did Auntie Mei
get your whistle?

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,230
How should I know?

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,670
Come on, let's go upstairs.

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
4th floor.

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
You go.

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,510
I'll ask her about my whistle.

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,360
Just go.

111
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,670
Everyone is so weird.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,580
(Intern)

113
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,800
Bao!

114
