1
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:15,791
<i>The sun competes with the shining moon</i>

2
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:35,666
<i>Stars approaching the moon</i>
<i>lose their lights</i>

3
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:52,166
<i>Fireflies are shining</i>

4
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,791
<i>Beetles</i>

5
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>Fly into the jungle</i>

6
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:33,458
<i>Oh, beautiful flower</i>

7
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,000
<i>I'm falling</i>

8
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,833
<i>In love now</i>

9
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,000
Rawee!

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,500
Rawee! Saengrawee!

11
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,250
Reverend uncle!

12
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,291
Reverend uncle?

13
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,750
Yes, reverend uncle.

14
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,833
Hey! Wait for me.
I haven't finished speaking yet.

15
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,833
Wait a minute.

16
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,375
How are you?

17
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:07,625
Reverend uncle!

18
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,833
What's wrong?

19
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,625
I'm fine.

20
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,125
Anyway, how old are you?

21
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,583
Running loudly
like a three-year-old child.

22
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,208
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,708
Danai…

24
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,333
He rushed to call me here.

25
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,625
I was afraid you might be
in danger, so I hurried over.

26
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,250
I called you

27
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,541
because I need to tell you something.

28
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,208
This is Parit Sittikornkan.

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,291
He is my old friend.

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,291
Say hello to him.

31
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,208
Hello.

32
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,666
I will let you go to stay with
Parit in Phra Nakhon.

33
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,875
He will take care of you
and give you advice

34
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,708
to make your life better.

35
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,083
Staying there will be more comfortable.

36
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,833
Do you understand?

37
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,250
I don't want to go.

38
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,708
I am worried about you.

39
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,083
Treat it as my order.

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,083
Rawee,

41
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,958
I don't want you to live a hard life.

42
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,333
I already have Danai taking care of me.

43
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,958
-But…
-Are you afraid of me?

44
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,208
No, I'm not.

45
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
How old are you?

46
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,458
Twenty-one years old.

47
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,333
Not much different from my grandson.

48
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,916
Come stay with me.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
I'll take care of you.

50
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,833
Come here.

51
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,833
Carry it with you all the time.

52
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,375
It will protect you.

53
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,750
Parit,

54
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,750
I entrust you to take care of Saengrawee.

55
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,708
Bless you.

57
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,875
When Praphloeng comes back this time,

58
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,875
he will stay in Thailand forever, right?

59
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,375
He will be 25 years old.

60
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,375
If there's no auspicious event,

61
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,875
he will have misfortune
and be alone for life.

62
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,666
An auspicious event?

63
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,833
But Praphloeng still
doesn't have a betrothed.

64
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,375
If he's not married,

65
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,666
what should we do?

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,250
Have you got a solution?

67
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,500
No need to get married.

68
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,416
Just binding destiny together.

69
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,125
The prophecy said that

70
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,500
Praphloeng's destiny

71
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,250
has an odd number in age.

72
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,500
Not older than 25.

73
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,583
Not from Phra Nakhon.

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,125
Don't waste time looking for them.

75
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,833
They will come to you.

76
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,458
We are here, Rawee.

77
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
Mr. Lee,

78
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,458
long time no see.

79
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,416
That's right. Long time no see
but I have to go back.

80
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,291
This is Rawee, Chantakorn's grandson.

81
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,583
I said I'd bring him to stay with me.

82
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,000
Hello.

83
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,208
I'm Saengrawee.

84
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,833
Hello.

85
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,750
So let's go inside first.

86
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,083
I'll walk Mr. Lee to his car.

87
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,125
-Let's go, Rawee.
-Please come in.

88
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,125
Yes.

89
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>Stay out of it!</i>

90
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,500
<i>Don't let him mess with my grandchild.</i>

91
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,541
What's wrong?

92
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,625
Mr. Lee?

93
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,166
Things I warned you about,
don't delay or bad things will happen.

94
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,125
Right. I will tell my father.

95
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,625
Get out!

96
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,625
Mr. Lee said that

97
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,958
Let Praphloeng
bind his destiny with his destiny.

98
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,958
Their age must be an odd number.

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,708
And not be from Phra Nakhon.

100
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,333
Rawee.

101
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,875
Saengrawee is 21 years old,

102
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,375
from Ayutthaya.

103
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,958
Savant predictions match Rawee.

104
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:20,333
Will Rawee be willing to bind
his destiny with Praphloeng?

105
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,875
With Rawee,

106
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,083
I can talk to him.

107
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,458
But with Praphloeng…

108
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,833
If it's Praphloeng, I'll talk to him.

109
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,958
And you guys don't mind
that they're both men?

110
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,750
If Rawee can save
Praphloeng from misfortune,

111
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,666
I don't mind.

112
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,583
Me either.

113
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,708
If Praphloeng is safe,

114
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,458
I have no objection.

115
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:05,791
Then we must explain this to Praphloeng.

116
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,750
Auntie, I heard Mr. Patchara
and Mrs. Pimpila say that

117
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,833
Mr. Praphloeng will be back today.

118
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,125
Everyone knows,

119
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,500
except you.

120
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,458
Come help me cook.

121
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,083
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,500
I have finished preparing the syrup.

123
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,000
Where are the pandan leaves?

124
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,791
They make the syrup fragrant.

125
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,958
They're here. Get them yourself.

126
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,166
Is there anything I can do to help?

127
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,625
You don't have to.

128
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,208
Please wait at the dining table.

129
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,916
It's hot in here.

130
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,583
You are in the way.

131
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,500
Aunt Hom Toei,

132
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,833
we are out of garlic.

133
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,208
You can go buy some.

134
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,416
Pudsorn, go buy some for me.

135
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,333
I'm busy.

136
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,625
I need to make Marian plum in ice
for Mr. Praphloeng.

137
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,791
Ask someone else.

138
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,708
I can go.

139
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,583
I'll hurry back.

140
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,083
Mr. Rawee is really nice.

141
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,375
It's true.

142
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,333
Very nice and well-behaved too.

143
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,125
Pudsorn!

144
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,583
What is wrong with you?

145
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,833
A jealous ghost possessed him.

146
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,625
He saw that everyone loves Mr. Rawee.

147
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,666
Mr. Rawee, are you okay?

148
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,208
Just a scratch.

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm fine.

150
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,583
Let me take you to see the doctor?

151
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,458
Don't worry.

152
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,166
This wound is nothing.

153
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,375
It was my bad.

154
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,750
I wasn't careful either.

155
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,833
Many apologies.

156
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,166
I'm sorry too.

157
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,416
Hey!

158
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,041
Do you want to die,
cutting in front of the car?

159
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,500
Your driver knows how to apologize.

160
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,333
You don't.

161
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,875
You cut in front of the car
and waste my time.

162
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,250
Who has to apologize?

163
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,208
Mister,

164
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
driving fast in a narrow alley

165
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,250
is considered negligent
and very dangerous.

166
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,500
This is not a playground for children.

167
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,958
-Or do you need money?
-You!

168
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,208
You are insulting me.

169
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
If you don't want it, fine.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,666
Kraipop, let's go back.

171
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,291
Asshole!

172
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,291
Grandpa, you told me to come back.
What's the matter?

173
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,500
I told you to come back

174
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,208
because I have
something important to tell you.

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,583
Important matter?

176
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,666
What's the matter, Grandpa?

177
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,958
This year you are 25 years old.

178
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,625
Savant Lee has predicted that

179
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,791
you will suffer a great misfortune.

180
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,583
So I want you
binding your destiny to your soulmate.

181
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,083
What does it mean?

182
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,250
Who do I have to bind my fate to?

183
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't worry about it, Praphloeng.

184
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,625
The person who will bind your destiny

185
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,958
is the grandson of Grandpa's friend.

186
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,500
Mother, would you let me bind my fate
with a stranger?

187
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,625
I don't believe in this

188
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
and I won't bind my fate to anyone.

189
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,833
Praphloeng,

190
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,375
I don't want anything to happen to you.

191
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,208
You will face misfortune
if you don't do this.

192
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,208
Can you do this for my sake?

193
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,958
It's just binding my fate, right?

194
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,833
I'm willing to bind my fate.

195
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,416
But I will stay home for six months only.

196
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,083
That's more than enough.

197
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,000
Thank you, my grandson,

198
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,833
for doing this for me.

199
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,208
Rawee.

200
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,250
Mr. Parit,

201
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,916
the maids asked me
to bring you butterfly pea juice.

202
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,541
Thank you very much.

203
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,083
Have you decided what you want to study?

204
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,333
I've looked at some, Mr. Parit.

205
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,958
Why do you still call me mister?

206
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,833
Call me Grandpa.

207
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,583
Yes, Grandpa.

208
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,208
Rawee

209
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,958
Can I request something from you?

210
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,875
What is it?

211
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,458
Do you remember Mr. Lee?

212
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,500
The person who met you
on the first day you came here.

213
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,583
Yes, I do.

214
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,125
According to the prophecy from Mr. Lee,

215
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:35,333
my grandson, Praphloeng,
is 25 years old this year.

216
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,708
He will suffer a big misfortune.

217
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,208
But there is a solution.

218
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,833
He needs to bind his fate.

219
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,208
If not,

220
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,625
Praphloeng's life will be in danger.

221
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,875
His destiny happens to be you.

222
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,500
Rawee.

223
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,000
Can you help Praphloeng?

224
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,000
Is this the one, Grandpa?

225
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,708
My destiny.

226
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,583
This is Saengrawee.

227
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,208
Get to know each other.

228
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,500
Grandpa, about your request…

229
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,083
I know.

230
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,750
My request might be too much for you.

231
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,333
But I want to make sure,

232
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,583
if something happens to me,

233
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:46,166
both of you will have someone
to take care of each other.

234
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,333
And one more thing,

235
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:55,875
I want Rawee to be a member of our family.

236
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,625
As you wish, Grandpa.

237
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,833
But let me talk to Rawee first.

238
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,333
What are you doing?

239
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,125
Why did you bring me to this room?

240
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,541
Quit becoming my destiny partner.

241
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,416
Have you asked me
if I want to be your destiny?

242
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,083
If you don't want to, why stay here?

243
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,083
It's money you want.

244
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
How much?

245
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,333
You only know
how to buy people with money.

246
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,250
That's what you want. How much?

247
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,250
For refusing my grandfather's request.

248
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,333
About binding destiny,

249
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,083
I just found out today.

250
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,583
And about your money,

251
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,083
I don't want any.

252
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,958
If you don't need money,

253
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,208
What do you want?

254
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,958
If I needed money,

255
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,666
wouldn't it be easier
to ask your grandpa for it?

256
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,750
He probably has a lot more.

257
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,750
You got a bad mouth.

258
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,625
If you want to
bind destiny with me, try it.

259
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,750
At first I wanted to say no.

260
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,000
But now I've changed my mind.

261
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,625
Is it beautiful?

262
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,333
Yes, it's beautiful, Mom.

263
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,375
Aunt Hom Toei brought it for you.

264
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,000
Thank you.

265
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,666
Oh, and what happened to your finger?

266
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,833
I got pricked by a little stick.

267
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,458
I wasn't careful.

268
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,458
Oh, does it hurt?

269
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,875
No, ma'am.

270
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:49,958
Thank you.

271
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,375
Clumsy.

272
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,666
Praphloeng,

273
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,250
why are you talking to him like that?

274
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,791
-It's true, Mom.
-Come on, Praphloeng.

275
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,083
Rawee, come and sit here.

276
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,875
Yes.

277
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,791
Mr. Lee had told me
the date of the fate-binding ceremony.

278
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,375
The date of the fate-binding ceremony

279
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,208
is scheduled to be held on
Saturday the 19th.

280
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,333
The auspicious time is 9.09 a.m.

281
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,208
Pimpila,

282
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,625
I entrust you to take care
of the arrangements.

283
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,833
Yes, Dad.

284
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,666
-Mom, but I'm--
-That's it.

285
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,583
Please excuse me.

286
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, dear.

287
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,208
Isn't it beautiful?

288
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:26,333
To bind a destiny is to
support each other's luck.

289
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,500
If you two are not together,

290
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,541
you can lose your life.

291
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,250
When the sun is down,

292
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,333
you both have to live under the same roof.

293
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,750
Do we have to do that, Mr. Lee?

294
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,833
Give me your hands.

295
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,250
From now on,

296
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:03,625
you will be safe from all dangers.

297
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,833
From now on, you will be safe.

298
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,250
Only good things happen.

299
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,833
Free from all dangers.

300
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,541
All is well.

301
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,666
Go back to your bedroom.

302
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
No.

303
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,083
If you are in danger,

304
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,250
I can't be held responsible.

305
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,333
I don't allow it.

306
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,958
You can't sleep here.

307
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,208
I can.

308
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,083
Mr. Lee said so.

309
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,708
Bringing a pillow
to sleep with me like this.

310
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,166
-Or do you want--
-You!

311
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,708
Stop right there.

312
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,708
If I want to sleep with someone,

313
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,416
it won't be you.

314
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,666
What are you doing?

315
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,833
Well, I have no space to sleep.

316
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,375
If we are to be together,

317
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,000
let's make a deal.

318
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,666
We'll only be
in the same room for a while.

319
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,250
Be good to each other
when we are in front of others.

320
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,583
And this will be over in six months.

321
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,333
Then we part.

322
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,375
Okay.

323
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,208
But who knows?

324
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:06,208
In the future, you may ask me
to come sleep with you.

325
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,958
Because you get used to sleeping with me.

326
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,833
Nonsense.

327
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,416
Nonsense.

328
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,458
I am going to sleep.

329
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,958
Please don't let me see the ghost.

330
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,708
Come here. Let's eat together.

331
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,958
I'd better go eat in the kitchen.

332
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,708
Just obey your elders.

333
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,208
Don't be stubborn.

334
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,833
Hom Toei,

335
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,083
go get some tea for Rawee.

336
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,416
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,250
How are you, Rawee?

338
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,333
Did you sleep well in his room?

339
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:06,250
<i>Since I started sleeping on his bed,</i>
<i>I don't have nightmares at all.</i>

340
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,916
I slept very well, Grandpa.

341
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,458
Okay, let's eat.

342
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,708
Thank you.

343
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,750
-Delicious.
-Yes.

344
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,000
Very delicious.

345
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,625
If it's delicious, have some more.

346
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,958
Yes, Grandpa.

347
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,833
Praphloeng,

348
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,250
about the business talk this week,

349
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,916
I want to postpone it.

350
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,833
Yes, Father.

351
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,333
I'll park the car for you.

352
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,666
Okay.

353
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,000
Mr. Rawee!

354
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,500
Are you all right?

355
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,041
-I'm hurt.
-What happened?

356
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,166
Does it hurt a lot?

357
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,750
Yes.

358
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,458
Let me help you.

359
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,416
Hey!

360
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,666
It was you, wasn't it?

361
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,500
Rawee

362
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,750
Rawee.

363
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,083
Saengrawee.

364
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,708
Mr. Praphloeng.

365
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,250
Help me!

366
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,458
I'm…

367
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,750
I'm scared.

368
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,500
-Help me.
-Rawee, calm down.

369
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,458
-Help me.
-Tell me what's wrong.

370
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:46,375
Please.

371
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,875
Please take me back to the room.

372
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,250
Does it hurt a lot?

373
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,208
-Let me see.
-Mister.

374
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,833
I'm okay.

375
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,458
Don't be stubborn.

376
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,333
Just stay still.

377
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,958
And don't wriggle.

378
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,333
This mark,

379
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,250
were you born with it?

380
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,125
Yes, I've had it since birth.

381
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,083
And this scar,

382
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,375
I got it when I was a kid.

383
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:23,416
Have you seen this necklace?

384
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,291
You.

385
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,083
Why do you have it?

386
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,083
When I was a child, someone gave it to me.

387
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,083
Done.

388
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,333
I bless you.

389
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,083
Get well soon.

390
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,250
Where did you get the wound?

391
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,000
They hid my shoes.

392
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,000
They wanted to see my foot.

393
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,916
So I stepped on a broken glass.

394
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,625
Why would they want to see it?

395
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,208
My foot is ugly.

396
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,333
This birthmark?

397
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,208
I think it's pretty…

398
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,083
like a petal.

399
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,791
Next time, if someone hurts you,

400
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,875
let's fight back, you know? Like this.

401
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,041
Praphloeng, let's go back home.

402
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,083
Yes.

403
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,541
I have to go.

404
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,666
Wait.

405
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,958
This is for you.

406
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,250
Thank you.

407
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,833
I will treat it as a contract between us.

408
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,708
Don't let anyone bully you.

409
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,125
I promise.

410
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,166
Are you that child?

411
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,125
Yes.

412
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,958
You're all grown up now.

413
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,791
I didn't think we'd see each other again.

414
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,583
I didn't think so either.

415
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,708
Nice to see you again.

416
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,166
And…

417
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:58,833
Thank you for teaching me how to fight.

418
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,333
Now I can.

419
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,125
Your punch looks funny.

420
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,708
Well, who taught me?

421
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,458
Very good.

422
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,333
What are you doing?

423
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,083
You have to go to work today.

424
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,916
So I prepared your clothes for you.

425
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,708
Come sit here.

426
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,333
Has your leg healed?

427
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,333
It still hurts.

428
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,750
Don't walk too much.

429
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,291
It will get worse.

430
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,625
Thank you for wanting to help me.

431
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,875
But you still can't take care of yourself.

432
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,041
How can you take care of me?

433
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,916
I'm going to get ready for work now.
I'll be right back.

434
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,875
This is a land lease agreement.

435
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,291
You can read it first.

436
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,250
What are you doing?

437
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,625
Mr. Rawee.

438
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,208
You've woken up early.

439
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,375
Not really.

440
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,208
I just got bored,

441
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,500
so I thought I'd come to the kitchen.

442
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,458
Marian plum,

443
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,333
it looks so delicious.

444
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,458
Pudsorn is making
Marian Plum dessert for Mr. Praphloeng.

445
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,958
You can have it first.

446
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,458
Marian Plum dessert,

447
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,750
will you let me help you?

448
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:22,833
Yes, of course.

449
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:26,583
-By the way, do you know how to make it?
-Yes.

450
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,583
Reverend uncle used to teach me.

451
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,458
It's my duty.

452
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,333
Don't get in the way.

453
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,041
Pudsorn,

454
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,500
why are talking to Mr. Rawee like that?

455
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,958
Go help Prik in the big building.

456
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,125
I want to make the dessert.

457
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:45,208
Pudsorn! That's an order, so you must go.

458
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,083
Such a suck up!

459
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:57,958
Ass-kisser.

460
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,125
Please serve it on the table this evening.

461
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,000
And share it with the others too.

462
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,250
Right.

463
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,166
As for this small bowl,

464
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,583
please keep it specially for Praphloeng.

465
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:05,333
I heard he likes it a lot.

466
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,208
In case he wants some more.

467
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,083
Oh, right! Aunt Hom Toei,

468
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,458
I'd like to take this small bowl.

469
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,375
I'll take it to Grandpa.

470
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,666
Yes, of course.

471
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:24,708
Mr. Parit is probably reading a book
at the pavilion now.

472
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,458
Okay.

473
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,958
You made it yourself?

474
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,458
Yes.

475
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,708
Don't you like it?

476
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:17,833
I can make it better.

477
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,333
I like it very much.

478
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:23,208
It's a familiar taste.

479
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,500
Easy to eat.

480
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,750
Not too sweet.

481
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,333
Really delicious.

482
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,708
Thank you, Grandpa.

483
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,583
Is it really delicious?

484
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,333
Of course.

485
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,708
Chantakorn taught you, right?

486
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,833
Your dessert tastes the same as his.

487
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,541
Yes.

488
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,250
He was very strict.

489
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,750
I had to pay attention to what he taught.

490
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,083
Is he that strict?

491
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,583
Very much.

492
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,125
Not just the dessert.

493
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:05,000
He's very strict about everything.

494
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,708
He always forced me to pray.

495
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,083
Rawee,

496
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,333
has anyone ever told you

497
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:16,500
that your face
is very similar to Chantakorn?

498
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,375
The way you talk,

499
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,125
your smile,

500
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,125
just like Chantakorn when he was young.

501
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:27,875
Are you and Reverend uncle really close?

502
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,416
Yes, I…

503
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,833
It's okay, Grandpa.

504
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,958
I'll clean it up.

505
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,208
-Be careful.
-Yes.

506
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,958
Are you all right?

507
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:51,458
Watch out, Grandpa.

508
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,958
I'm okay.

509
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:55,625
Wait here.

510
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,208
I'm going to call someone
to tend to the wound.

511
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,208
Grandpa.

512
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,000
Would you like some water?

513
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,250
No, thanks.

514
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,333
Where is Rawee?

515
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:19,833
He is in the garden.

516
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,833
Mr. Saengrawee!

517
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,208
What happened?

518
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:37,833
I was clumsy. It was my fault.

519
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,875
A piece of broken glass cut my hand.

520
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,333
Let me see the wound.

521
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:52,000
Take this and press on the wound.
It's new.

522
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,250
I have not used it.

523
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,333
But it will get dirty.

524
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:01,208
-Thank you, Kraipop.
-Yes.

525
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,083
What are you doing?

526
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:09,916
Mr. Praphloeng,

527
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,250
Mr. Rawee got cut
by a piece of broken glass.

528
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,458
He is mine.

529
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,583
I can take care of him.

530
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,541
You can go.

531
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:21,750
Yes, sir.

532
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:30,833
Mr. Praphloeng,

533
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,625
that was rude.

534
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,708
He was helping me.

535
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,041
If you don't want to do it,

536
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,958
you don't have to.

537
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,583
Why?

538
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,083
Do you prefer his help?

539
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,083
Rawee, Praphloeng.

540
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,208
What happened?

541
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,125
Nothing, Grandpa.

542
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,333
I'm just got hurt.

543
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,333
Hom Toei, put a bandage on Rawee.

544
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:19,416
Yes, sir.

545
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,833
I will go dress my wound inside.

546
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,083
Let's go, Hom Toei.

547
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,708
I don't know what you guys
are arguing about.

548
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,708
But he wasn't unruly at all.

549
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,708
He was with me.

550
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,083
He stayed in the kitchen,

551
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:47,958
doing his best
to make your favorite dessert all day.

552
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,500
Oh, right!

553
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,125
Grandpa, Mom and I

554
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:10,458
have to go on business
to Chanthaburi for five to six days.

555
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,125
I got it.

556
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:15,041
While I'm away, take good care of Rawee.

557
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,958
Very delicious.

558
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,833
-Did Rawee make this?
-Yes, dear.

559
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,791
He was in the kitchen
from morning till evening.

560
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,208
This is Praphloeng's favorite.

561
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,458
I made it for everyone.

562
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,333
Aunt Hom Toei,

563
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:44,250
could you share the rest with the others?

564
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,625
Including that extra bowl.

565
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,208
All of it?

566
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,791
-What about the bowl you kept for…
-Share it all.

567
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:41,125
May all beings be free from…

568
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,125
Don't give your merit on me.

569
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,208
I don't accept.

570
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,708
Saengrawee.

571
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:11,375
I hate you!

572
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,500
Damn you, Chantakorn. I hate you!

573
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,583
Rawee.

574
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:18,583
Rawee!

575
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,291
Rawee, are you okay?

576
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,125
Rawee.

577
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:32,958
I'm scared.

578
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:35,875
Don't be scared.

579
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,708
I'm here now.

580
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,916
Let's go back to our room.

581
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,583
A moment ago,

582
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,958
you said you were scared.

583
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:21,833
Yes.

584
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:27,041
I think I had a nightmare.

585
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,208
Nightmare?

586
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,791
Yes.

587
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,333
I've had it many times.

588
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,541
-Maybe you're stressed.
-Never mind.

589
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:51,458
I think I just didn't get enough rest.

590
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,041
I should go to sleep.

591
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,208
Rawee,

592
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,708
about my behavior for this,

593
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,458
I'm sorry.

594
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,333
Well,

595
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,666
I'm not angry anymore.

596
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,125
Sleep well.

597
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:45,500
Don't be scared.

598
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,750
I'm right here.

599
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,666
You lost your amulet necklace?

600
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,708
Next time, you should keep it safe.

601
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,333
You are wasting his time.

602
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:09,833
That's fine, sir. I don't mind.

603
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:15,875
Thank you for taking care of Rawee.

604
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:24,375
I hope he didn't cause
any trouble at your place.

605
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,083
Come on, Reverend uncle.

606
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:30,666
Reverend uncle…

607
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:31,875
It's time.

608
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:37,333
I have to go.

609
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:43,708
Both of you give me your right hand.

610
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:57,958
Please be safe from all dangers.

611
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:04,208
Be successful in everything you do.

612
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:10,041
From now on,
please take care of yourselves.

613
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,208
Want to try it?

614
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:30,708
Can I?

615
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,458
Come over here.

616
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:35,708
I will teach you.

617
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,083
A poem?

618
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:24,458
I praise and ask thee.

619
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,375
But receive none of thy response.

620
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,625
Have thou lost thy tongue?

621
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,458
Did I make thee diffident?

622
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,708
Do you understand all this?

623
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,916
You don't answer my question.

624
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,166
Are you shy?

625
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,875
I'm hungry.

626
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,375
I'm hungry.

627
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,708
I'm going to get some food.

628
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,208
Are you scared?

629
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,125
Stay right here.

630
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,541
Don't go anywhere.

631
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,083
I'll go with you.

632
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,250
Mr. Praphloeng,

633
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,125
I brought you a lantern.

634
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,625
Thank you.

635
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,875
Everyone is in their room, right?

636
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,583
Yes, sir.

637
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:31,958
Thank you.

638
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,000
Don't be scared.

639
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,500
The electricity will come back soon.

640
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,583
I'm here.

641
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,333
Sometimes…

642
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,375
I have this nightmare.

643
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,583
But I'm sure…

644
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:26,333
it's not just a nightmare.

645
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:33,083
I can feel that
all the bad things that happen…

646
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,583
are not the work of a human.

647
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,250
Don't worry.

648
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,791
Tomorrow,

649
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,416
I'll have someone bring
Mr. Lee to meet you here.

650
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,583
You really believe me?

651
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,541
Yes, I do.

652
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:20,708
I believe you.

653
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,833
From now on,

654
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,083
can you call me Phloeng?

655
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:23,833
Yes.

656
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,583
Phloeng.

657
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,041
When will it be ready?

658
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:47,958
I haven't started yet.

659
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,875
I need to pound chili peppers finely.

660
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:53,750
What can I do to help?

661
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,458
It's okay.

662
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:57,708
This is easy.

663
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,833
Please wait for me there.

664
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,833
Let's make Ranjuan curry together.

665
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,208
We are together.

666
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,708
We must help each other.

667
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,833
Don't tease me like that.

668
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,208
Who's teasing?

669
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:27,458
I mean what I say.

670
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,583
Why did you do that?

671
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:13,958
Such a pity.

672
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,458
I will do whatever I want.

673
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,291
Mr. Praphloeng loves all his plants.

674
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,416
Did I say something wrong?

675
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,708
Why are you crying?

676
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:48,166
What you said is not wrong.

677
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:53,375
I already knew he'd never choose me.

678
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,375
But when I see it with my own eyes,

679
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,625
it still hurts.

680
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:17,333
It's useless to feel hurt.

681
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,125
If you're not the one,

682
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,708
no matter what you do,

683
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:24,541
you'll never be the one.

684
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:56,666
Is it any good?

685
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,583
It's delicious.

686
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:02,875
So delicious that I don't want
to share it with anyone.

687
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,833
Will you eat the whole pot yourself?

688
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,833
You have to take good care of yourself.

689
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:30,208
If I happen to go…

690
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,708
Don't say that.

691
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,208
I just…

692
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,833
I won't allow anything to happen to you.

693
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,625
I've washed it.

694
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:19,916
Thank you.

695
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,375
Thank you?

696
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:34,833
Just take it.

697
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,083
Are you kidding me?

698
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,833
Step away.

699
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,833
You guys, we need help now.

700
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,500
There's a fire, please help.

701
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:34,833
Phloeng,

702
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,958
something's going on down there.

703
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,166
Everyone's running around.

704
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,708
Burning smell.

705
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,750
Phloeng, let's go.

706
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,375
Rawee…

707
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:13,875
I will go and check.

708
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,875
You should stay in the house.
Don't go anywhere.

709
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:20,458
If you want to help,
call the fire department.

710
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,666
I'll be right back.

711
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:24,750
Okay.

712
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,166
Be careful, Phloeng.

713
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,625
<i>You can't run away from me.</i>

714
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,500
<i>You will die today.</i>

715
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,708
Hurry up, Kraipop.

716
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,333
Rawee.

717
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:16,333
Hey, what's wrong with you?

718
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:22,500
It's not your business.

719
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,375
Are you insane?

720
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,833
Leave me alone.

721
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,208
Everyone can rest now.

722
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,333
How did it happen?

723
01:16:58,375 --> 01:16:59,708
Mr. Praphloeng.

724
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,333
What's wrong?

725
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:05,083
A moment ago,
Rawee pulled a knife on Pudsorn.

726
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:07,625
I don't understand.

727
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:09,958
I don't understand either.

728
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,458
But Rawee looks very strange.

729
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:18,333
Where is Rawee now?

730
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:21,833
I saw…

731
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,083
Rawee.

732
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:40,916
<i>Chantakorn is responsible for my death.</i>

733
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,833
<i>You must pay for his sin.</i>

734
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:00,583
<i>You are his nephew. I hate you.</i>

735
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:03,208
<i>Chantakorn is responsible for my death.</i>

736
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,083
<i>I hate you.</i>

737
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:57,166
How can you do this to me?

738
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,500
You talk about him,

739
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:01,500
even though we are husband and wife.

740
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,500
You made my father force me to marry you.

741
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,875
You should be satisfied.

742
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:08,250
But I have the right

743
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,083
as the mother of your son.

744
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,833
You know it in your heart.

745
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:15,750
Must I repeat that? He isn't my son.

746
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,875
But I love only you.

747
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,833
Always.

748
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:24,666
I never cared about anyone but you.

749
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:29,583
I did everything to be with you.

750
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:33,458
Do I need to repeat myself?

751
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,833
Who I actually love?

752
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:42,083
You must love only me.

753
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,541
Parit!

754
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:07,458
You must love me.

755
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,375
You must love only me.

756
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:13,166
I'm his lawfully wedded wife.

757
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,666
You must love me.

758
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,875
You must love only me.

759
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:22,958
You must love only me.

760
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:32,208
If you can't finish planting,
you can't go to sleep.

761
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,500
Dig it well, you thief.

762
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,333
I'm not a thief.

763
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,791
Don't you dare argue with me.

764
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,583
If you aren't a thief,

765
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,666
why did you go upstairs?

766
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,666
Kannika! Kannika!

767
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:50,541
What are you doing?

768
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:51,916
What's the reason for this?

769
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:53,583
Parit,

770
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,250
he was stealing something.

771
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,708
I just punished him.

772
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,625
He's not a thief.

773
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,791
He's not that kind of person.

774
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,750
Even if he didn't do it,

775
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,708
I have the right to order him.

776
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:12,291
Order him

777
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:13,500
or bully him,

778
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:15,708
they are different.

779
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm warning you.

780
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,541
Don't mess with my people.

781
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,708
Don't make me lose my patience with you.

782
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,000
Please let me go, Parit.

783
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:49,125
If anyone sees us,
they might misunderstand.

784
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,541
Just me being up here

785
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,250
is suspicious enough.

786
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,083
Trust me, Chan.

787
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,375
I know the whole thing,

788
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,958
who makes you sad.

789
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:06,958
But I stand my ground.

790
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:12,000
I love you and have always been
faithful to you alone.

791
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:13,958
Never cheated on you.

792
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:17,583
How could you say that?

793
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,333
If not for my sake,

794
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:25,500
then do it for our son.

795
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:34,458
Chan! Chan!

796
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:36,875
Chan!

797
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,250
Damn you, Chan!

798
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,250
If you didn't exist,

799
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,500
he'd have loved me.

800
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:50,333
Chan!

801
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,958
Come with me to meet Mrs. Kannika.

802
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,458
And I will ask her to spare your life.

803
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:08,666
Kannika.

804
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:12,083
I've loved him for a long time.

805
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,333
If you don't exist,

806
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,125
he will belong to me.

807
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,958
Since you and him
have a deep relationship,

808
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,708
Parit and I have parted ways.

809
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,583
You're stupid

810
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:30,666
for believing everything,
but not believing in him.

811
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:38,916
Is the rumor about your son true?

812
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:44,458
I'll let you know before you die.

813
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,333
That child is not his.

814
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:52,250
He never has sex with me
because he loves you.

815
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:58,625
But even if you find out the truth,

816
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,875
it's a pity
that the truth will die with you.

817
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,458
<i>Do I have to remind you again?</i>

818
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,833
<i>Who I actually love?</i>

819
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:26,875
Rawee!

820
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:31,458
Rawee!

821
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,833
Rawee!

822
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:31,833
Rawee!

823
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:40,125
Rawee!

824
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:46,083
Rawee!

825
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:47,666
Rawee!

826
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,125
Rawee!

827
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,958
Rawee!

828
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,708
Rawee was stabbed.

829
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,791
I'll rush him to the hospital.

830
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:08,250
Stay calm,

831
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,333
Mr. Praphloeng.

832
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,333
I'll talk to her.

833
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,375
Kannika,

834
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:19,208
stop hurting other people.

835
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,666
Your grudges in the past

836
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,250
didn't have anything to do with my nephew.

837
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:29,333
I died because of you.

838
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,083
I can't harm you.

839
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:34,291
Your nephew must suffer instead.

840
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,375
It's my fault.

841
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:41,916
I don't know…

842
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,708
You have always been
in the Sittikornkan house.

843
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,875
I want you to know

844
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,125
I feel guilty all the time.

845
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,875
I think about you.

846
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,083
I want to say that

847
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:02,458
I am sad that jealousy took your life.

848
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,833
Mother, please stop now.

849
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:11,416
Don't hold grudges.

850
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:15,000
I'm begging you.

851
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:19,333
Although I may not be able
to understand your reasons…

852
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,000
However,

853
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,208
I do love you, Mother.

854
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,833
Rawee isn't involved in this tragedy.

855
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:31,333
Let Rawee go, Mother.

856
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:37,291
Was it Grandma

857
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:41,125
who did all of this, Grandpa?

858
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,125
Don't blame Grandma.

859
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:46,250
It's my fault.

860
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,708
Kannika is like my sister.

861
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:53,083
I can't be angry with her.

862
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,083
Parit,

863
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,291
aren't you angry

864
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:01,083
and hate me?

865
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,208
I love you, Grandma.

866
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,458
Please don't do this, Grandma.

867
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,958
Rawee did nothing wrong.

868
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,208
Rawee is my love.

869
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,958
Can you bring Rawee back?

870
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,458
I'm begging you.

871
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:33,208
Rawee, come back to me, Rawee.

872
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:40,500
Please tell them

873
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,083
that I'm sorry.

874
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,875
I forgive you.

875
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:49,250
For both things in the past

876
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,875
and in the present.

877
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:56,708
Kannika, please don't be sad anymore.

878
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:04,791
I'm sorry, Chantakorn.

879
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,750
Rawee!

880
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,375
Rawee! Rawee!

881
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,250
I'm here.

882
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,458
Rawee!

883
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:21,833
Rawee!

884
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Phloeng.

885
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:39,250
Does it hurt a lot?

886
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,708
A little.

887
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:51,416
Rawee's awake.

888
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:57,666
Reverend uncle…

889
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:01,708
No more suffering,

890
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,458
Rawee.

891
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:05,416
Yes.

892
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:09,333
Rawee has recovered.

893
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:11,833
You can stop worrying now, Praphloeng.

894
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,875
Yes, Grandpa.

895
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:17,541
From now on,
I will take good care of Rawee.

896
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,208
Thank you.

897
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:26,208
Thank you for coming back to me.

898
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,625
I promised you.

899
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,083
<i>Parit,</i>

900
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,041
<i>I love you.</i>

901
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,208
I've never believed in supernatural things

902
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:10,250
until I met you.

903
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:13,666
It makes me understand
that though I can't see them,

904
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,708
it doesn't mean they're not real.

905
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,666
But thanks to everything that happened,

906
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,666
we met each other.

907
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,583
It's dirty.

908
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:59,708
But even though this flower is dirty,

909
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,583
it's still pretty.

910
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,416
It reminds me of myself.

911
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,208
Rawee,

912
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:26,250
I won't cause you any more trouble.

913
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,708
It's okay even if it's difficult.

914
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:16,958
I love you, Rawee.

915
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,125
This ring is a family heirloom.

916
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,458
I'm giving it to you as my life partner.

917
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:26,083
Will you take it?

918
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:37,916
Yes.

919
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:45,625
I love you.

920
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:54,000
I love you too.

921
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,291
The sun is about to go down.

922
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:55,333
It doesn't matter if the sun goes down.

923
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:59,791
I have my light right here.
