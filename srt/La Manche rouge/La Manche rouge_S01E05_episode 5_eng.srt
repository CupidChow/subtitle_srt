1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,740

2
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,440

3
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,970

4
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,720

5
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:00,865
- Sir! 
 - Hello!

6
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,731
Let's go drink until we drop.

7
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,287
Now, who is this?

8
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,838
Are you new here, Girl?

9
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:21,629
Just making deliveries, Sir.

10
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,253
Sir, stay a bit longer. Why are you leaving so early?

11
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:28,616
Oh, just a bit then?

12
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:31,038
Do come inside.

13
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,971
Sir Preceptor?

14
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,963
Where is His Highness the Crown Prince?

15
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,011
Who are these people?

16
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:16,109
You don't know anything, yet you came all the way here?

17
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,310
Pardon?

18
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,731
Whether you do or not,

19
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,142
you leave me no choice.

20
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,405
Kill her.

21
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:31,838
 Yes, Sir.

22
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,967
Stand down!

23
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,509
Were you...

24
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,065
without my permission...

25
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,368
about to take the life of a palace maid of my court?

26
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:22,267
Is she truly a maid of the Crown Prince?

27
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:26,315
Forgive me, Your Highness.

28
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:30,794
I would have given no such order without your permission

29
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,624
had I known, Your Highness.

30
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,859
You did recognize me, though, didn't you?

31
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,122
- You recognized me but still gave that order— 
 - Be silent!

32
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:43,948
You must have crossed paths in court. Have you truly no recollection?

33
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:48,026
I failed to see outside the usual court attire.

34
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,920
Come with me.

35
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,301
I came all the way here under

36
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,924
Princess Hyebin's command.

37
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,703
Have you...

38
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,952
gathered what sort of place this is,

39
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:32,595
what I am doing here,

40
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,814
and why?

41
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:42,329
All I know is that you're attending to work of importance.

42
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,159
I failed you, Your Highness.

43
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,113
I shall not make the same mistake twice—

44
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,336
Since when have you relied on my mother's patronage?

45
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,478
I believed you were under mine.

46
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,891
When Princess Hwawan was going to do away with you,

47
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:00,545
I stood in her way.

48
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:03,917
Were you,

49
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,927
even then,

50
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,845
serving my mother?

51
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:16,518
It was a mistake for you to come here today.

52
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,377
Your death

53
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,822
would surely silence you.

54
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,427
Why are you not afraid?

55
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:37,032
I can cut your life short this very minute.

56
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:41,546
I know. You hold my life in your hands.

57
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:45,176
I should be scared and afraid, but

58
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,834
I do not know why I am not fearful.

59
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:02,883
You're no longer a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace.

60
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,289
Pardon?

61
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,000
Leave the Palace tomorrow.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,925
Truly, Your Highness? Please forgive me.

63
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:15,357
It was only on my firm belief that you would save me from my fate.

64
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:20,420
After giving a thought, I came to a solid conclusion that Your Highness does not wish to see me die, but...

65
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,754
if I were I to forsake the wishes of Princess Hyebin, I could die.

66
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,711
I did not want to die.

67
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,202
Why did you not inform me of this in the first place?

68
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,942
You ended up following my mother's commands while turning your back on me.

69
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:38,030
But I falsely believed that you have been visiting the Courtesan House.

70
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,089
I thought you might have grown fond of some courtesan and made your visits, Your Highness.

71
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,524
I, too, shared the concerns of Princess Hyebin.

72
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:48,392
I went as far as telling myself that

73
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,480
doing Her Highness a favor is for Your Highness's sake.

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,130
Did I ever strike you

75
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,437
as a prodigal son who would seek the pleasure of courtesans?

76
00:06:56,437 --> 00:07:00,246
Of course not, but Your Highness, too, is a man, and

77
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:03,825
not many men follow the principles of fidelity in their lives.

78
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:06,845
Who do you think I am?

79
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:09,645
I will become the king of this nation one day.

80
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,759
What sort of example would I be setting then

81
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,160
were I to recklessly carry on for all to see?

82
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,910
For I

83
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,506
have forsworn any deed that may be deemed shameful before the eyes of my subjects.

84
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,219
Amongst young men,

85
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,995
how many would there be with such honor as Your Highness?

86
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,781
When fidelity and chastity are principles not for women alone,

87
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:33,290
when they are virtues that apply equally to men…

88
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,746
You are glorious, Your Highness.

89
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,710
That should go without saying.

90
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,896
That I may serve such a man as my master

91
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,620
is an honor that knows no end.

92
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,783
Your Highness will be a wise and benevolent king.

93
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:58,587
The thought of the long peace that awaits Your Highness's reign

94
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,608
already has my heart racing.

95
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,672
- You. 
 - Yes?

96
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,217
You're sucking up to me, aren't you?

97
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,663
No, Your Highness.

98
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:21,411
I speak in all sincerity.

99
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,900
Your Highness.

100
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,970
Are you less upset with me?

101
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:54,845
Henceforth, hold your tongue.

102
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,075
Hold still even if you are frightened.

103
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,589
 Kill her.

104
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,489
This is an attendant maiden of my court.

105
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:17,696
I called on her myself because I would like someone to do errands for me.

106
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,920
A misunderstanding caused a disturbance.

107
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,561
Yes, Your Highness.

108
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:26,000
Did you call on that maid yourself, Your Highness?

109
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,417
You would surely have told me then.

110
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,564
But I cannot seem to remember.

111
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:37,477
Head Guardsman, your memory is dull as usual.

112
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,299
Forgive me, Your Highness. My memory has failed me once again.

113
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,289
It's fine. Just don't let it happen again.

114
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,432
Thank you, Your Highness.

115
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:56,289
Are you not Princess Cheong Seon's favorite?

116
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,304
The one who transcribed the books with the princesses.

117
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,423
I introduce myself to both the King's sons-in-law.

118
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,110
 (T/N: Husbands of Princess Cheong Seon and Princess Cheong Yeon)

119
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:15,546
 "Dong" meaning group, "Deok" meaning big.

120
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:17,860
 Then...

121
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,649
The Dongdeok Order. 
  (T/N: A secret organization of the Crown Prince)

122
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:24,630
I'm glad to welcome a new member of the Dongdeok Order.

123
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,810
She will only be running my errands.

124
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,640
It is excessive to call her a member.

125
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Her presence here and now would certainly constitute membership.

126
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:39,380
May I... do a background check on this maid?

127
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,175
Would His Highness invite a palace maid here whose identity was uncertain?

128
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:48,048
There is no harm in being cautious.

129
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,236
Her name is Sung Deok Im.

130
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:57,774
Her father was Sung Yun Woo, a servant of the Hong family.

131
00:11:57,774 --> 00:12:00,346
Her mentor is Court Lady Seo of the Prince's Palace.

132
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:06,119
Three close acquaintances are Kim Bok Yeon, Son Young Hee, and Bae Kyung Hee.

133
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:10,218
None of them raised cause for suspicion.

134
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,834
Is that sufficient?

135
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,812
Certainly.

136
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,140
Now,

137
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,100
I shall inform you of our findings on the palace guardsman.

138
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,270
Come to think of it...

139
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,015
there is something I would like you to have.

140
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,220
Compilation of Materials on Korea. 
  (T/N: encyclopedic literature about various systems and culture in Korea)

141
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,250
It's a good book.

142
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,315
Let's see...

143
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:56,983
My goodness, so this book was here all along.

144
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,286
Have you read this book?

145
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,081
No, Your Highness.

146
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:21,581
I was greatly moved by it.

147
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,484
Read it.

148
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,354
Read one book every month,

149
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:37,785
write down any difficult sentences and bring them to me.

150
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,915
I will explain them to you.

151
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,363
Your answer?

152
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,573
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:51,822
You... don't look happy at all.

154
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:55,568
No. I am very happy.

155
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,939
- Truly? 
 - Truly, Your Highness.

156
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,242
My shortcomings today were great,

157
00:15:00,242 --> 00:15:03,853
but I received a rather light punishment.

158
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,680
I am moved by your kindness.

159
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,512
What punishment?

160
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,939
I presented you with these priceless texts

161
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,980
and offered to explain difficult passages.

162
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,735
How is that a punishment?

163
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,789
 What is it if not a punishment, a reward?

164
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,033
For sure, it is a reward. It's not a punishment at all.

165
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,690
It was a wrong choice of words.

166
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,696
I feel ashamed to receive a reward after having done wrong.

167
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,223
- If you would rescind the reward... 
 - Would you prefer to be punished?

168
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,950
A reward is much better for sure.

169
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,407
I am deeply, deeply overwhelmed with your unfathomable grace.

170
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,681
- Enough with that. 
 - A great honor...

171
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:45,560
It pains me to see you waste your time on useless folk tale novels

172
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,107
so this is my special gift to you.

173
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:52,507
When the tiger appeared, I helped you avoid a disaster by reading such a book though.

174
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:55,862
The circumstances were dire then,

175
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:59,050
and we had to gather the palace maids as quickly as possible.

176
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,928
Something as little as a drop of honey

177
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:04,166
will help gather in the bees or ants, wouldn't you say?

178
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,355
Are palace maids a colony of ants?

179
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,762
Sir Preceptor, that's a bit offensive—

180
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,646
Your Highness.

181
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,589
I misspoke, Your Highness.

182
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,624
Forgive me.

183
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,306
A few moments ago,

184
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:39,201
even when I said I could kill you,

185
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,662
you were not fearful.

186
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,355
Now I know why.

187
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,230
To you,

188
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,630
I am still that Royal Preceptor from the past.

189
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:04,859
I still wonder why I pretended to be Sir Preceptor back then.

190
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,420
At first, I saw no need to correct your misunderstanding.

191
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:12,872
But as time passed,

192
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,235
I lost the will to tell you the truth.

193
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,307
That's because...

194
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:24,833
the moments we shared in the library

195
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:29,127
were special to me.

196
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:35,894
The moments we were together there,

197
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,397
I thought you were captivated by me.

198
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,861
But I'm not sure anymore.

199
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,218
Did I captivate you?

200
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,325
Were you...

201
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,824
really captivated by me?

202
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,532
Or was it....

203
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,887
that I

204
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,110
was captivated by you?

205
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:52,934
Carrying heavy books is your punishment for having stalked me today.

206
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:58,474
I must attend to some matters. Return yourself to the palace.

207
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,360

208
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:39,193
 That's because...

209
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,660
 the moments we shared in the library

210
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,984
 were special to me.

211
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,737
Good. It suits you well.

212
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:14,316
You made this headpiece by yourself, Kyung Hee, right?

213
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:17,110
No one can make something this sophisticated but me.

214
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,298
Maiden Bae is the best!

215
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,168
You will wrinkle the dress.

216
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,978
- You're here, Deok Im. 
 - Yes.

217
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,653
And your ceremonial dress?

218
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:29,714
- Didn't you bring it? 
 - No.

219
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,125
The Coming-of-Age ceremony is just around the corner.

220
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,787
Did you forget we were trying them on together?

221
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:34,643
Oh, that's right.

222
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,311
Deok Im, why do you have sunken eyes?

223
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:39,352
Were you up all night?

224
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,186
If I...

225
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:50,413
said something weird, do you promise not to laugh?

226
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,531
Perhaps, this person might...

227
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,920
 like me.

228
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:03,467
Oh, never mind.

229
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:08,381
Oh my, Bok Yeon! You look so pretty!

230
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,925
Turn around.

231
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:13,992
Kyung Hee made this headpiece, right?

232
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:16,568
She's so gifted.

233
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,497
See? Now try it.

234
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,393
Slowly, with more grace.

235
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,504
All right.

236
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,131
Mind your head and shoulders.

237
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,382
Good, just like that.

238
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,130
Look! Look!

239
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,508
 He's so good-looking.

240
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,473
Bok Yeon.

241
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:03,095
Maiden Sung, may I speak with you for a moment?

242
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:19,893
I would like to express my regrets for having frightened you last night.

243
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,401
You must be very disappointed in me.

244
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:25,449
You ordered those men to kill me without a chance to speak.

245
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:28,789
Other than that, I understand. You may be on your way.

246
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,729
The fault is mine and mine alone,

247
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,929
but it pains me to see that look in your eyes.

248
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:40,564
Sir, do I seem a fool to you?

249
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:44,074
Are you under the illusion that I don't know what kind of person you really are?

250
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,663
What kind of person do you think I am?

251
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:48,050
A scary person.

252
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,228
Many times scarier than the palace maids would expect.

253
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:54,790
Oh, dear. You seem to be overly wary of me.

254
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,660
Notwithstanding last night, I was hoping we could build a friendship.

255
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,715
On what possible grounds would I do that?

256
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:06,343
On the common ground that we stake our lives for the good of our master.

257
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:14,124
Like it or not, we are now mates on the same ship.

258
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:18,113
I have a question along these lines.

259
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,731
Will you give me an answer?

260
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,493
What is it?

261
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:26,886
The Crown Prince, how does he view you, Miss Maiden?

262
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,757
The lengths that His Highness went to

263
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:39,311
on behalf of you last night

264
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,602
can produce only one possible answer.

265
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,857
Why do you ask me what is in His Highness's heart?

266
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:52,130
Direct your question to His Highness.

267
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,345
Such questions cannot be posed to the one who will be the future King.

268
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:58,769
The answer to such questions must be deduced.

269
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,178
If you have no desire to provide me with an answer,

270
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,345
I will be on my way.

271
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,258
Do you not wish to know what is in my heart?

272
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,327
What I think of him, I mean.

273
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,772
Of what significance is that?

274
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,983
What lies inside a palace maid's heart,

275
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:28,431
nobody cares to know.

276
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:54,438
 Draw closer if pulled

277
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:56,971
 and move away if pushed.

278
00:24:56,971 --> 00:25:00,880
 Neither thoughts nor convictions are necessary.

279
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:03,672
 That is the essence of palace maids.

280
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,495
Deok Im.

281
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,065
Deok Im.

282
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,620
Why do you suppose Sir Preceptor came all the way here

283
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,500
just to talk to you? Why?

284
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,201
Why?

285
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:50,467
What was it that was so important that you had to speak alone?

286
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,112
Book!

287
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:59,982
The Crown Prince inquired about the whereabouts of class material.

288
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:03,827
He said he may be admonished if the book isn't found.

289
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,752
As His Highness's handmaid,

290
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:09,946
Sir Preceptor asked if I could look for it in the Crown Prince's Palace.

291
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,580
What the heck. Is that it?

292
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,493
Oh! Sir Preceptor can't be reprimanded!

293
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,161
Deok Im, you'd better hurry off to find the book!

294
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:31,838
Right, I'd better go look for it!

295
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:35,274
- All right, I'm off. 
 - Hurry.

296
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,928
- Thanks, Deok Im. 
 - All right...

297
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:49,570
Here is the list of guardsmen that I recommended.

298
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,891
I made no list,

299
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:59,776
since there can be no traitor among those I recommended.

300
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,620
You see, they are all of the Jung clan.

301
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,028
There can be no traitors on account of them being from the Jung clan,

302
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:07,041
isn't that a little naive?

303
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,554
The Jungs are a better bunch than the Hong clan.

304
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:12,588
I am the only one from the Hong clan.

305
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:15,144
Would that make me the traitor?

306
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:19,158
Is that how you'd like me to report to the Crown Prince?

307
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,797
I will expect the list by tomorrow.

308
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:38,580
There is a witness who saw you leave the Left State Councilor Hong Jeong Yeo's residence.

309
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,512
You will have to explain yourself.

310
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:45,462
Lord Heungeun, do you suppose I need to give you an explanation?

311
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,538
Explain yourself. It's an important matter. If not, I shall call on His Highness—

312
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,415
I shall, and to your satisfaction.

313
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,919
Only if you provide me with that list.

314
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,078
Is it not an important matter?

315
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,730
And

316
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,600
I will give you my explanation.

317
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,700
Why would His Highness trust someone like him?

318
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:22,440
Sir Preceptor has served His Highness for a long time.

319
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,396
Though he springs from the Hong clan,

320
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:26,592
you should not question his loyalty.

321
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:30,815
Brother, he is a dangerous character.

322
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,617
Wait and see.

323
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:36,198
Time will show the world that my suspicions are well-founded.

324
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:38,342
We must not fight amongst ourselves.

325
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,684
For now, we must ensure that His Highness takes the throne.

326
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:51,796
Look at how easily this complex problem was solved.

327
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:59,945
Never does the Crown Prince disappoint his grandfather.

328
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,183
Seldom if ever,

329
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:07,315
the Crown Prince never disappoints me.

330
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,938
This is such a difficult one. He has a special gift, wouldn't you say?

331
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:21,795
The Crown Prince takes a lot after this old king,

332
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,185
wouldn't you all agree?

333
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:26,094
Most certainly.

334
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:30,747
All the wisdom of the Crown Prince comes from His Majesty.

335
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:33,779
This is, indeed, a great blessing to the state.

336
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,828
Many have passed through Sungkyunkwan, 
  (T/N: Top academy in Joseon)

337
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:41,576
but none to surpass the merit and talent of the Crown Prince.

338
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,653
Is that so?

339
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,079
The Crown Prince has a truly outstanding mind, doesn't he?

340
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,289
 Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,369
 Yes.

342
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:55,041
 Look here. Wake up!

343
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,700
Let's see…

344
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,901
Now…

345
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:22,716
I believe it is about time for the Crown Prince

346
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:26,415
to stand in for King.

347
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,232
What do you think?

348
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:36,180
Shall I take it that you all agree?

349
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:43,119
I am so proud of the Crown Prince.

350
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,482
A regent?

351
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:49,037
Yes.

352
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,651
Did Father really utter such words?

353
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,459
There is no other way to look at it, Mother.

354
00:30:56,459 --> 00:31:00,169
An official proclamation seems imminent.

355
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:04,996
Will that boy act as regent? This can't be.

356
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,396
The Crown Prince as regent...

357
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:16,262
So it has finally come to this.

358
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:19,808
Maybe we are interpreting the King's words erroneously?

359
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,837
How else can they be interpreted?

360
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:25,570
I would like to be optimistic, but…

361
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,410
Still, the King's words

362
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,360
could be interpreted differently.

363
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,388
Look here…

364
00:31:33,944 --> 00:31:35,579
How about abdication?

365
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,266
Abdication? Enough of this nonsense!

366
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,252
This King is not one to surrender the throne!

367
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:45,875
All that talk in the past of stepping down proved false!

368
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,064
You should know that.

369
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:59,109
The wind is blowing.

370
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,342
It could be a breeze or a typhoon.

371
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:05,183
If there is no way of knowing...

372
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,596
it's safer to assume that it's a typhoon.

373
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:12,059
One that rips out of the ground even those trees with the deepest of roots.

374
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:18,371
Because all past rumors of abdication were false,

375
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,191
will it be so again this time?

376
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:26,314
Your Excellency, His Majesty will soon be turning eighty.

377
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:29,747
Will it really be like it was twenty years ago?

378
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,371
Even the hot-tempered Princess is careful when it comes to the Crown Prince.

379
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,736
And Your Excellency's indifference on the Crown Prince

380
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:41,077
is contrary to Your Excellency's usual thorough self.

381
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:45,578
Why do you place the blame on me?

382
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:48,408
Do you think that I have been sitting on my hands until now?

383
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:54,053
Your Excellency cast aside the hand it took so long to build,

384
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:56,798
without making any use of it.

385
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:00,194
You lost a hidden card you worked hard to conceal.

386
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,562
The incident with the private guardsman…

387
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:07,141
Right. I was rash. Consider that my mistake.

388
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:10,608
You can be displeased as you had to clean up the mess,

389
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:13,818
but we must put the past to rest.

390
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:16,939
We must get on with the work of setting the future.

391
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,856
What frightens you so much, Your Excellency?

392
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:27,507
The end will be the same, whether it's regency or abdication.

393
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:30,564
It makes no difference as to what must be done.

394
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:33,213
Depose the Crown Prince

395
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:37,214
and see to it that another royal descendent becomes king.

396
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:42,680
The Crown Prince,

397
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,810
the little boy,

398
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:48,644
has become a young man.

399
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:52,322
I tremble with fear whenever I see him.

400
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:56,587
How could he resemble his dead father so much?

401
00:33:56,587 --> 00:34:01,084
The brow, the eyes, and the lips all give off the smell of blood.

402
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:05,002
How long will it be before he, too, goes crazy like his father?

403
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,180
The memory is still fresh.

404
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,675
Gone mad, the Crown Prince took the lives of more than a hundred court subjects.

405
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:16,562
After beheading a eunuch, he held his head and roamed the court as if he was showing off.

406
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:20,644
Court ladies, their bones and skin broken from the Crown Prince's repeated blows,

407
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,475
took their own lives, unable to bear the pain.

408
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:27,519
Not a day goes by that this survivor mops the blood-drenched floors in tears.

409
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,956
Early morning every day, I stand in the main hall

410
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:33,364
looking over the crossbeam

411
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,363
just to make sure...

412
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:39,742
that no court maid has hanged herself.

413
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:48,079
What had taken place after the Crown Prince lost his mind,

414
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:53,431
no passage of time can undo.

415
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,040
The current Crown Prince...

416
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,380
he cannot be king.

417
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:08,611
The son of a murderer cannot become king.

418
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,530

419
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:25,682
Your Highness, I urge you to rest today.

420
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:28,531
You have not slept in three days.

421
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,645
Is the regency weighing on your mind?

422
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,399
No, it is not.

423
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:39,006
Wasn't the fallen guardsman a father to a toddler?

424
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:42,536
Set aside the fees for the funeral,

425
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:45,889
and take the child to the closest relative.

426
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:51,613
Will you bestow favors upon a traitor's child?

427
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:58,230
The child will become my subject.

428
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,650
That now makes me its parent.

429
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:03,905
Do as you have been told.

430
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:05,337
Yes, Your Highness.

431
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,182
Will you be returning to the palace?

432
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:10,581
I shall go to the Office of Documents and Reports.

433
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:12,347
Your Highness.

434
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,837
His Majesty may proclaim my regency at any time.

435
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:19,050
I must look into precedents.

436
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,678
 It's been a busy day,

437
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:41,961
 but thoughts of you keep intruding my mind.

438
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:47,150
 Thoughts of the peace that awaits Your Highness's reign already have my heart racing.

439
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,716
 What might you be doing now?

440
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:52,757
 Could you have read the books that I gave to you?

441
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:58,331
 While reading the books, could you have thought of me?

442
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:25,016
Why? Why did you tie your hair up like that?

443
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:27,970
Did you by any chance...

444
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,834
come into the favor of His Majesty?

445
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,625
Your Highness.

446
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,100
Your Highness.

447
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,133
Turn your gaze in that direction.

448
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:50,666
The Coming-of-Age ceremony for apprentice maids is due shortly.

449
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:54,010
I am aware that they are conducting a dress rehearsal.

450
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:02,754
I feel a personal affinity towards His Highness today.

451
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:07,062
He just made a clown of himself.

452
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:09,212
He could hear you!

453
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,702
My lady! My lady!

454
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,898
Are you all right?

455
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:11,688
How can you sleep in on the day of your Coming-of-Age ceremony?

456
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:14,738
I was wide awake until falling asleep at dawn.

457
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,943
I thought you would wake me.

458
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:20,460
I thought you'd be like the others and be up and busy early.

459
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,816
I'm fine, it's not even my ceremony.

460
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,756
Run.

461
00:39:39,674 --> 00:39:41,708
What could be keeping her?

462
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,602
I'm not very late, am I?

463
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,168
No.

464
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:11,173
Now that all appears present, we shall commence with the ceremony.

465
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,792
My lady!

466
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:50,048
Is she not Young Hee's mentor?

467
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,670
Yes, Court Lady Park.

468
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:58,190
It has been a long time.

469
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,531
I wasn't expecting to see you here today.

470
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:05,113
It is the Ceremony for the one pupil I have under my tutelage.

471
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:09,215
It is only right for me to attend as her mentor.

472
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:12,866
I commend you for going to such great lengths to be here.

473
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:15,696
Will you be able to stay on your feet until the end?

474
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:18,881
Though I may crumble and fall,

475
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:24,044
I shall get back up when the time comes.

476
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,232
Make room for her.

477
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:46,347
The ceremony will now commence.

478
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,729
Your Highness, rather than the usual meal

479
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:57,774
the ceremonial food of the apprentice maids has been prepared.

480
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,485
Okay.

481
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,421
Just a moment!

482
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:06,077
Will the new maids of the court be paying us a visit?

483
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:08,934
That has been planned, Your Highness.

484
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,722
I see.

485
00:42:41,156 --> 00:42:45,290
Park Mi Geum of the Royal Kitchen, get ready.

486
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:55,367
How did it go? Did His Highness enjoy the food?

487
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:58,452
Yes, the meal was a humble one,

488
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:00,729
but His Highness commended us for the flavors.

489
00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:03,638
His Highness left no morsel behind.

490
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,408
Who is to come in next?

491
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:24,063
Park Mi Geum of the Royal Kitchen, Your Highness.

492
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:28,656
 Your Highness, Princess Hyebin calls.

493
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,500
Mother?

494
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,380
His Highness is ready to receive you, Your Highness.

495
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,772
- Court Lady Gweon. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

496
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:54,045
I have an order to give.

497
00:43:58,238 --> 00:43:59,939
You have returned early to court.

498
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:03,817
There are many rumors. I was concerned about you.

499
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:06,118
Do sit.

500
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:10,288
Your Highness, shall the next table be shown their way in?

501
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,355
Have them wait a little on account of my mother's visit.

502
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:18,975
No need! It would make me happy to see the ceremonial table.

503
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:21,396
Have the table brought in, and ask the maid to come as well.

504
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:24,124
Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,084
If you were curious about the regency,

506
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:33,996
no formal decrees have been made.

507
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:35,885
Try not to concern yourself too much about it.

508
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,336
How can I not be?

509
00:44:38,336 --> 00:44:41,393
A regency is an opportunity you should not miss.

510
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:43,619
But if you were to make a mistake...

511
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,220
you could lose the King's trust

512
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,819
and be driven into a corner.

513
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:54,747
Are you aware of how important and yet dangerous this period is?

514
00:44:56,714 --> 00:45:00,369
It surprises me that the Coming-of-Age ceremony for the apprentice maids is being held during this time.

515
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:04,266
What does the ceremony have anything to do with me?

516
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:08,475
New court maids will appear in your presence.

517
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:12,161
Young and new women…

518
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:14,589
His Majesty is worried

519
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:18,844
that you might neglect your studies and succumb to temptations.

520
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,943
If you keep a concubine without receiving royal permission,

521
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:24,698
you will put yourself in great trouble.

522
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:27,954
- You know, don't you? 
 - Don't you know, Mother?

523
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:31,720
I've never even once known a lady of the court.

524
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:35,277
That may not be the case in the future.

525
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,920
You are mistaken.

526
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:40,720
As for me...

527
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,520
I have no intention of keeping a palace maid, a woman of humble status, by me.

528
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:49,361
Only a daughter of a dignified noble family would qualify to be by my side.

529
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:53,323
Only such a woman can produce a rightful heir

530
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:57,797
and producing such an heir is my only duty.

531
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:02,875
I have known nothing but the comforts of life as the Crown Prince.

532
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:07,934
But as I ate rare foods and wore expensive clothes of silk,

533
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:10,589
I grew a sense of responsibility.

534
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:16,762
That I shall dedicate my life to the good of the Joseon Dynasty

535
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:20,205
and put its interests above those of my private life.

536
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,924
Wasn't this what you wanted to hear, Mother?

537
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:27,860
Am I right?

538
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,868
That's right.

539
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:34,840
If that's it, I'll receive the table now.

540
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,569
Raise the curtain.

541
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,779
Park Mi Geum of the Royal Kitchen, lift your head, and show your face.

542
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:11,757
Recognition as an official maid of the Prince's court upon completion of today's formalities...

543
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:37,650
It is custom for the table of the maid of the royal sleeping quarters to be served last.

544
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,390
Sung Deok Im,

545
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:45,074
it seems your table was served ahead of the Royal Kitchen's.

546
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:48,242
My deepest apologies, Your Highness.

547
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:51,483
Your Highness, the fault lies not with Maiden Sung,

548
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:54,638
but me, for failing to notify you of the change in order.

549
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,350
There is no need to explain yourself.

550
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,230
I have a good idea

551
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,690
of how the lapse occurred.

552
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:14,141
Sung Deok Im,

553
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:18,868
you have formally become an official maid of the court, after many years of training.

554
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:23,472
In recognition of your efforts, I shall receive your table.

555
00:48:23,472 --> 00:48:26,417
It is my greatest honor, Your Highness.

556
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:16,516
It is very good.

557
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,412
As such worthy food has been so sincerely prepared,

558
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:26,273
I, too, shall become a worthy master.

559
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:30,410
I bid your assistance and advice as an upright lady of the court.

560
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:36,290
I shall become a good and wise king and repay you for your sincerity.

561
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:49,224
Who do they think they are, sitting me there like that?

562
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:51,772
Did I volunteer to become a concubine or something?

563
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:55,751
It's not like I seduced him on purpose to change my own fate!

564
00:49:57,466 --> 00:50:01,721
What horrible people to make me feel so worthless!

565
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:04,942
Today is my Coming-of-Age ceremony.

566
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:08,436
The one day that has been dedicated to me!

567
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:11,418
No one has the right to ruin this day!

568
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,429
No one!

569
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:26,890
The day you did my bidding and trailed the Crown Prince,

570
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,543
he came to me in protest.

571
00:50:41,377 --> 00:50:45,044
 Don't call on the girl again.

572
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:46,711
 Sung Deok Im!

573
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:51,350
 I am her master, not you, Mother.

574
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:05,390
 It was unexpected.

575
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,020
Despite knowing that you were doing my bidding,

576
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,276
he still protected you.

577
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:18,494
Take care of the Crown Prince.

578
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,830
Until he becomes king,

579
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,820
he must be free from all troubles.

580
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:30,153
I shall follow and obey His Highness as a servant of his palace.

581
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,665
I hope that you will.

582
00:51:35,232 --> 00:51:37,188
Be on your way.

583
00:51:38,154 --> 00:51:40,243
Yes, Your Highness.

584
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:55,441
 Your Highness, Court Lady Bae calls.

585
00:51:55,441 --> 00:51:57,216
Show her in.

586
00:52:00,505 --> 00:52:02,805
- Your Highness. 
 - What is wrong?

587
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:05,339
Princess Hwawan and her son, Royal Secretary Jung,

588
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:08,095
conspired against the Crown Prince who has been summoned by His Majesty.

589
00:52:08,095 --> 00:52:09,850
What?

590
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,320
Royal Secretary Jung has informed me

591
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,164
that the Crown Prince prowls outside the palace at night.

592
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:25,865
Is this true?

593
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:31,136
Father, the Crown Prince has been visiting the Courtesan House frequently.

594
00:52:31,136 --> 00:52:37,800
He is rumored to be bosom buddies with your grandsons-in-law, and indulge in decadence.

595
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,643
Is that how it is?

596
00:52:39,643 --> 00:52:41,298
It is not, Your Majesty.

597
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:45,085
I am being falsely accused.

598
00:52:45,085 --> 00:52:50,274
A false accusation? My son saw you visit the courtesan house.

599
00:52:50,274 --> 00:52:51,819
Trust me, Father.

600
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,908
Princess...

601
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:57,304
Isn't your father talking right now?

602
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,982
Excuse me, Father.

603
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:05,610
One or the other is lying.

604
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,740
How should I find the liar?

605
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,437
Should both of them be beaten?

606
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,848
What say you, Your Highness, the Queen?

607
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:28,516
Your Majesty, may I speak?

608
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:31,010
Go on.

609
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,511
The Crown Prince may well have frequented the courtesan house.

610
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:38,621
Otherwise, Lord Jung may be lying to Your Majesty

611
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:42,654
and conspiring against the Crown Prince.

612
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:47,557
Either way, the punishment must be as severe as the crime.

613
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,425
But Your Majesty,

614
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:53,620
paramount above all else is Your Majesty's well-being.

615
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,449
Your Majesty does not look well.

616
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:59,837
I beg Your Majesty to retire for the night.

617
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:05,271
Adjudicating a dispute is not an urgent matter.

618
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:09,263
You are right.

619
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:11,984
I am tired today.

620
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:13,909
San.

621
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:15,364
Yes, Your Majesty.

622
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:18,164
I will issue a confinement order.

623
00:54:18,164 --> 00:54:22,386
Do not take one step outside your residential quarters.

624
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:25,044
Books will also be prohibited.

625
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:30,694
Reflect on your speech and behavior

626
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:33,630
to see if you have made any mistakes.

627
00:54:34,168 --> 00:54:36,080
Did you hear me?

628
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:39,392
Yes.

629
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:43,650
Leave me then.

630
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:09,405
Your resourcefulness has grown noticeably.

631
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:13,959
You made an excellent choice adopting your son.

632
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,070
Try not to worry so, Mother.

633
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,120
This battle

634
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,630
belongs to us.

635
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:49,293
They're all books the Crown Prince holds dear.

636
00:55:49,293 --> 00:55:51,937
- Wol Hye! 
 - You're here.

637
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:53,775
You're now officially a court maid.

638
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:55,207
What is happening?

639
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:57,600
Why are these books being removed?

640
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,470
You haven't heard? There was an incident last night.

641
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:45,797
The Crown Prince has been ordered confined within the premises.

642
00:56:45,797 --> 00:56:50,102
Other than transporting the basin and chamber pot early morning,

643
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:55,707
and the morning and evening meal tables, no one is allowed entry.

644
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:58,793
We'll need a roster...

645
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:01,830
Who will take the post tonight?

646
00:58:25,065 --> 00:58:27,021
You idiot!

647
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:28,359
Father!

648
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,464
What is this?

649
00:58:33,616 --> 00:58:35,317
Father!

650
00:58:40,906 --> 00:58:42,728
Are you all right?

651
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:49,127
I am fine, Mother, do not worry.

652
00:58:49,127 --> 00:58:51,704
Things are going well.

653
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,286
Your Majesty

654
00:58:56,287 --> 00:58:58,407
I'm fine, hurry.

655
00:58:58,408 --> 00:59:00,483
Yes, Your Majesty.

656
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,140

657
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:18,032
"The north wind is chilly, the falling snow is thick." 
  (T/N: poem called "North Wind" from the Book of Odes)

658
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:22,928
 "With the one that loves and has affection for me, I will hold your hand and part with you."

659
00:59:22,928 --> 00:59:27,430
 "Why do you hesitate so? I have urgency!"

660
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:32,378
"The north wind is chilly, the falling snow is thick."

661
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:38,543
 "With the one that loves and has affection for me, I will hold your hand and part with you."

662
00:59:46,364 --> 00:59:50,890
"Why do you hesitate so? I have urgency!"

663
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,157
Why did you stop?

664
00:59:57,157 --> 01:00:00,957
 Keep reading. I am bored.

665
01:00:02,255 --> 01:00:05,544
I am reading my favorite passages from the Book of Odes.

666
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:08,323
Do you know what they mean?

667
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:09,811
Never satisfied.

668
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:11,967
I see you.

669
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:17,254
 Keep reading.

670
01:00:17,254 --> 01:00:19,684
I long for a voice.

671
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:31,082
"Are foxes only red and ravens only black?"

672
01:00:32,397 --> 01:00:36,919
"With the one that loves and has affection for me, I will hold your hand and part with you."

673
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:41,809
"Why do you hesitate so? I have urgency!"

674
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:47,282
 I thought you were angry with me from the day of the Coming-of-Age ceremony.

675
01:00:48,826 --> 01:00:51,948
How could I ever be angry with you, Your Highness?

676
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,110
That ceremony occurs once in a lifetime for you.

677
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,260
And I ruined it.

678
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:03,600
I know you were unhappy.

679
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,190
No, Your Highness.

680
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,154
It has been for the better,

681
01:01:12,123 --> 01:01:15,445
for I now know where Your Highness's true heart lies.

682
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:19,280
You do not know where my true heart lies.

683
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:24,180
As I also don't know

684
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:27,120
where your true heart lies.

685
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:47,707
"Are foxes only red and ravens only black?"

686
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:51,366
Do you really know what it means?

687
01:01:51,366 --> 01:01:55,280
Of course, I do, Your Highness. Would you like to see it?

688
01:01:57,488 --> 01:02:03,343
"The north wind is cold, the falling snow is thick."

689
01:02:03,343 --> 01:02:06,031
"With the one that loves and has affection for me,"

690
01:02:06,918 --> 01:02:11,407
"...affection for me..."

691
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:16,479
"With the one that loves and has affection for me,"

692
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:20,220
"I'll hold your hand and part with you."

693
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:24,776
"Why do you hesitate so?"

694
01:02:24,776 --> 01:02:27,573
"I have urgency!"

695
01:02:27,573 --> 01:02:34,781
"The north wind is chilly, the falling snow is thick."

696
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:39,745
"With the one that loves and has affection for me,"

697
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:44,354
"I'll hold your hand and go back with you."

698
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:50,578
"Are foxes only red and ravens only black?"

699
01:02:50,578 --> 01:02:55,750
"With the one that loves and has affection for me,"

700
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:00,770
"I will hold your hand and go on a carriage together."

701
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,879
 His Majesty calls.

702
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:30,012
Let no one come any further!

703
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:32,702
Yes, Your Majesty.

704
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:43,202
Open it.

705
01:03:43,202 --> 01:03:45,621
Forget it!

706
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,522
Your Majesty.

707
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:52,902
You pathetic child!

708
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:55,445
Foolish boy!

709
01:03:55,445 --> 01:03:57,210
Your Majesty!

710
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,075
- What have I done? 
 - Stupid fool.

711
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:04,907
Lord Jung has put forward evidence!

712
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:08,824
On the first and seventh day of each month,

713
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:11,593
the guardsmen who are supposed to be on duty at the Crown Prince's Palace

714
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:14,271
left the palace, I see!

715
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:18,808
No doubt while escorting you!

716
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,135
Where did you go?

717
01:04:22,135 --> 01:04:26,916
Like the rumors have it, have you been visiting the courtesan house and behaving badly?

718
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,335
I failed you, Your Majesty! Forgive me!

719
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:34,394
No, you foolish boy! You cannot!

720
01:04:34,394 --> 01:04:37,416
You cannot become like your father!

721
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:41,190
Chasing skirts and neglecting your study,

722
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,113
getting mad for being reproached,

723
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:48,075
cursing and wishing death upon this old king!

724
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:52,433
You cannot become like your father!

725
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:57,561
San, my boy, you can make changes.

726
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:02,000
You can do it. Change your ways!

727
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,523
You can't be like your father.

728
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:08,677
You can change, right?

729
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:10,444
I know you can!

730
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:15,211
You can change!

731
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:19,330
Don't you know how I feel?

732
01:05:24,778 --> 01:05:26,844
San, my boy.

733
01:05:48,284 --> 01:05:52,673
Let no one enter.

734
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:31,760
Your Highness.

735
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,670
Are you all right?

736
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,930
Are you all right?

737
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:47,269
I am fine.

738
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,830
Is there anything you would like me to do?

739
01:06:57,594 --> 01:07:00,450
If there is something I can do…

740
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,627
Just stay with me.

741
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:06,860
That is enough.

742
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:17,739
I see that this was not the first time.

743
01:07:22,803 --> 01:07:25,426
Less often more recently.

744
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:29,734
When I was younger...

745
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:35,242
Just continue reading.

746
01:07:37,744 --> 01:07:43,080
May I ask a question, Your Highness?

747
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,738
You may.

748
01:07:45,738 --> 01:07:50,180
Do you bear it because you have no other choice?

749
01:07:55,524 --> 01:07:59,102
I hold back to attain my aims,

750
01:07:59,974 --> 01:08:04,651
and I bear it to get what I want.

751
01:08:06,033 --> 01:08:09,488
I know what pain is.

752
01:08:09,488 --> 01:08:18,095
And I know how many others are also suffering.

753
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:24,050
I am the Crown Prince of this land.

754
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,083
One day I will have the strength.

755
01:08:28,068 --> 01:08:30,224
With that strength...

756
01:08:30,224 --> 01:08:35,828
there are so many who I can help.

757
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:40,855
I have so many plans in store for the future.

758
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,933
Do you have any idea?

759
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:51,156
As for you... just stay by my side.

760
01:08:51,156 --> 01:08:53,300
That'll be enough.

761
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,860
What are you doing?

762
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,328
Do you know what'll happen to you if you disobey His Majesty's order?

763
01:09:14,328 --> 01:09:16,948
Leave at once!

764
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,303
Go on!

765
01:09:18,303 --> 01:09:23,133
There is something I must tell you, Your Highness, so I disobeyed His Majesty's order.

766
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:26,840
Lying in my heart, I must deliver this to you right now.

767
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,232
Until the succession day to the throne,

768
01:09:34,232 --> 01:09:36,709
I will protect you, Your Highness.

769
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:38,801
So you may rest assured.

770
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:43,889
You can achieve your ends, Your Highness.

771
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:48,207
You are a mere palace maid. How will you protect me?

772
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:52,280
I am a mere palace maid, but I am your servant.

773
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,509
I will remain by your side until the very end

774
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:59,953
as your loyal servant.

775
01:10:01,103 --> 01:10:04,430
Until the day life leaves me

776
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,270
for you, Your Highness,

777
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,330
I shall assist and protect you.

778
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:53,760

779
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:06,120
♫  I'll wait for the day I meet you. Wait for me again  ♫

780
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:13,200
♫  Till the moment you shine beautifully  ♫

781
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:19,210
♫  Just like now, step by step at a time  ♫

782
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,440
♫  If get closer to you  ♫

783
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,460

~ Preview ~

784
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:27,420
 In order to lift the confinement order, I need someone's assistance.

785
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,000
 We, as men, do not dare to think of her.

786
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,950
 This is only what I can do, as a woman.

787
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:38,010
 I'll need a reasonable excuse to put Princess Hwawan in her place and manage her behavior...

788
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,150
 Try to come up with something.

789
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,750
 I will have to wait and see.

790
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,310
 See what will happen here tomorrow.

791
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,790
 She must not do something dangerous.

792
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,730
 Are you perhaps worried about me?

793
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,160
 Because Deok Im, you are mine.

794
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,560
♫  My appearance fading in the early morning?  ♫
