1
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,844

2
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,250

3
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,150

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,980

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
 Magistrate!

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
Who is there?

7
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,533
 Magistrate!

8
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,820
Are you…

9
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,940
the ghost who kills all the newly commissioned officers dispatched to this place?

10
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,280
Show yourself!

11
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,540
 Magistrate!

12
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,080
 Magistrate!

13
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,220
 Magistrate!

14
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,160
 Magistrate!

15
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,884
Bok Yeon!

16
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,786
- Bok Yeon! 
 - Are you all right?

17
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,571
Listen.

18
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,449
That will be all for today.

19
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,323
 - What? 
 - Come on!

20
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,549
 - That is not fair! 
 - Hey!

21
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:30,940
 - I want to hear more! 
 - Please!

22
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,488
 - That is cruel! 
 - Please!

23
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,200

24
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:48,548
- Thank you for the story. 
 - I really liked it.

25
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,820
Here.

26
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:54,377
- Wow! 
 - I embroidered it myself.

27
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,020
To show such generosity to an unfortunate girl like me!

28
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,020
It's an honor, Young Maiden Bae.

29
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,906
Will someone buy this?

30
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,438
No one will want it, will they?

31
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,966
I sell them all at once, and every little bit helps.

32
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,002
Mi Goong, hurry!

33
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,538
Next chapter!

34
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:20,811
I want to hear more!

35
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:23,013
Next time. You have to hurry back to your duties.

36
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,899
I'm off duty.

37
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,579
Let me hear it first.

38
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,238
Why should you hear it first?

39
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:32,172
We all agreed to listen to Deok Im's reading when everyone has time.

40
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,561
I'll pay.

41
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,301
Let's save it for next time. All together.

42
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:38,996
I said I would pay!

43
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,031
 - What's she doing? 
 - You can't do that!

44
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,769
What are you doing attacking your peers?

45
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,632
- Deok Im, are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry.

46
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:49,933
I didn't mean to hit you.

47
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,936
I'll read up to chapter three next time.

48
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,200
This will be an advance payment then!

49
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:01,685
You have no pride.

50
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,600
How can you take it?

51
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Why not? It doesn't matter as long as I get the money.

52
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,760
Now, all I need is ninety-five more  nyang  and I'll have 100. 
  (T/N: Nyang was their currency. 1 won = 10 nyang)

53
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,860
Why do you need 100  nyang ? That's so much money.

54
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,485
Everything has its reason.

55
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,593
It must be something quite amazing.

56
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:21,369
- Se-cret. 
 - Everyone is curious.

57
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,438
Just tell us.

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,376
Well…

59
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,816
How about this?

60
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,480
When I collect 100  nyang,

61
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,327
I'll tell my secret to the person who gives me the last  nyang .

62
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,368
If you are desperate, you can pay me a good amount for my stories.

63
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:38,168
Forget it! We aren't curious. Let's go.

64
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,759
- Lady is coming! 
 - Come quickly!

65
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,568
The Court Ladies are here!

66
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,715
Come quick!

67
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:58,651
Oh no, hurry!

68
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,344
Wait!

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,580
- You've been slacking off on disciplining the girls. 
 - Apologies, My Lady.

70
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,800
- Won't it be okay to leave now? 
 - No, no, shh!

71
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,740
They should be gone by now.

72
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,000

73
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:18,428
The Crown Princess' maid.

74
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,170
The King's bath maid.

75
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:24,184
The Crown Prince's laundry maid.

76
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,755
The Crown Prince's attendant, of all people.

77
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,033
Gathering up to play  Jeongisu  like this…. 
  (T/N:  jeongisu - professional storyteller)

78
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:32,233
Is this the first time?

79
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,472
 Yes, My Lady.

80
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,958
And no one in particular played ringleader?

81
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:42,717
- Bring it here. 
 - Yes, My Lady.

82
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,253
It was a difficult item to bring in,

83
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,440
as it is from the West.

84
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,287
Inside…

85
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,279
lies a creature trained to bite off the hands of liars.

86
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,094
If nobody in here is lying,

87
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:09,264
then you can place your hands inside, with nothing to fear at all.

88
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:46,152
All of you, open your hands.

89
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:58,114
I lied about the box containing a creature.

90
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,538
There's an ink stick inside.

91
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:05,126
A liar wouldn't have dared to touch it so her hand must be clean.

92
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,660
An honest person would have no reason to hesitate

93
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,862
so her hand must be stained with ink.

94
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:16,351
- Twenty lashes for everyone except that girl. 
 - Yes, My Lady.

95
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,247
My Lady.

96
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,180
The one who took the lead in our game…

97
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,538
was me.

98
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:30,860
I became the storyteller and read books to everyone.

99
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,163
So then…

100
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,992
- you lied to me? 
 - Yes.

101
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:38,051
Then why did you touch the ink stick?

102
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,940
- Weren't you afraid of the creature? 
 - I'm sorry to say…

103
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,133
I had a feeling…

104
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,000
that you were lying to us.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Why did you think that?

106
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,660
If there were really a creature that bites off the hands of liars…

107
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,811
there is no way I would still have hands.

108
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:11,431
Fine. All right, then.

109
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,488
I choose you.

110
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:17,258
What is your name?

111
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:20,737
My name is Sung Deok Im.

112
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,961
Sung Deok Im.

113
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,550
 You passed!

114
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,872

115
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,059

116
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:41,627
You passed!

117
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,680
To excel in both  Eojesanghun  and  Eojejohun  in such a short time, 
  (T/N: books written by King Yeongjo to teach his successors)

118
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,780
it is truly admirable!

119
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,640
All credit goes to my teachers who taught me so well.

120
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:19,257
Your Highness, I'm afraid I can't give you a "Pass" for the last answer.

121
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,697
Pardon?

122
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,090

123
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,700
Yes.

124
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm afraid I made a mistake.

125
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,845
To think that Your Highness made a mistake,

126
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,278
I never thought I would see the day.

127
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,720
You have still accomplished much by having come this far.

128
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
No, Teacher.

129
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,934
I was careless, and I made a mistake.

130
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,720
I ask to be firmly scolded.

131
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,775
Tonight, I won't leave my study for even a moment.

132
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,263
I will study all night long.

133
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,280
 Royal Concubine Yeong has deceased!

134
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:20,832
Royal Concubine Yeong

135
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,740
has deceased!

136
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,640
Royal Concubine Yeong has deceased!

137
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,878
Your Highness!

138
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,740
Royal Concubine Yeong...

139
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,740
has passed away.

140
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,620
Grandmother…

141
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,220
Grandmother…

142
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,460
Can you really do it?

143
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,200
- It's better than getting whipped. 
 - Hey!

144
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,175
It's the middle of the night. How will you get there by yourself?

145
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,658
Why would Head Court Lady Jo

146
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,920
ever send you on an errand like this?

147
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,108
To go pay your respects to the deceased Royal Concubine Yeong.

148
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:08,360
This is crazy!

149
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,100
Girls, don't worry! I can do it!

150
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,260
- I'll be right back! 
 - You can't!

151
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,110
- Do you know the way? 
 - I know the way by heart!

152
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm lost!

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Please, help me!

154
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,280
Is anybody there?

155
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,740
I lost my way!

156
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,450
Is anybody there?

157
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,545
Kyung Hee!

158
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,800
Kyung Hee!

159
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,680
Bok Yeon!

160
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,340
Lady Seo!

161
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,860
Is he still reading?

162
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,460
His Majesty banned wailing.

163
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,620
What else would he be doing?

164
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,120
His Majesty is being unreasonable.

165
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,620
Royal Concubine Yeong was His Highness' biological grandmother.

166
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,705
 Do you want to see Royal Concubine Yeong?

167
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:57,500
 I heard her illness is very advanced.

168
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,620
 San,

169
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,760
 as your grandfather,

170
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,040
 I really appreciate your compassion.

171
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,300
 But what can I do?

172
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,430
 You can no longer see her

173
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,390
 as easily as you used to.

174
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,460
 I implore you, Grandfather.

175
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,940
 Royal Concubine Yeong was still my biological grand—

176
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,631
 If she was your biological grandmother,

177
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,700
 is the late Crown Prince that died in the year of black horse your father?

178
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,420
 Crown Prince Sado, who died as a sinner?

179
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,980
 If he was your father, then

180
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,400
 you'll have to live the rest of your life as a sinner's child.

181
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,376
 No, that's not true, Grandfather!

182
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:46,400
 I'll never again ask you to let me see Royal Concubine Yeong.

183
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,420
 I ask you to please forgive me!

184
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,680
Who is there?

185
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,420
I'm letting you know…

186
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

187
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,500
I mean it!

188
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm not afraid of ghosts…

189
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,340
Not at all…

190
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm not afraid…

191
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
Hey, hey!

192
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,700
Hey!

193
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,260
Do you know the way to Royal Concubine Yeong's residence?

194
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:45,952
Do you not?

195
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,020
You!

196
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,800
You scared me to death!

197
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,280
- Be careful! 
 - I will!

198
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,260
Shine the light carefully!

199
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,039
Careful! There we go.

200
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,980
 A young apprentice palace maid? Out of blue like this?

201
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,353
 Maybe she's a fox spirit in human form?

202
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:32,478
 A playmate of the Crown Prince

203
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
 sent on an errand by His Highness?

204
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,820
 An errand in the middle of the night?

205
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:39,582
 Is he really a crown prince's playmate?

206
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,620
What's your name?

207
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,082
Why should I tell my name to a lowly apprentice maid?

208
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,780
Hey!

209
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,132
Do you think being His Highness' playmate makes you something?

210
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:54,692
I'm going to be a fifth-level court lady someday.

211
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, really?

212
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,962
A fifth-level court lady…

213
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,522
Hey!

214
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,620
I don't even have to lift a finger to get there, either.

215
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,720
As for you…

216
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,530
Even now that you're the crown prince's playmate,

217
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,628
if you can't pass the state exam, you're not going anywhere.

218
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,328
State exam?

219
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,341
I don't take those kinds of tests!

220
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,101
Oh, really?

221
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,810
Then you're lower than me!

222
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,152
Come on!

223
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,560
What is with the lights?

224
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
If you follow the lights,

225
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
they'll lead you to Royal Concubine Yeong.

226
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,640
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,380
- Ask them to open it. 
 - No, we can't!

228
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,948
Why not?

229
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,940
Honestly,

230
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,940
I came here without permission.

231
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,140
You're crazy!

232
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,460
You can't come here without permission!

233
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,340
If a man enters the concubines' chamber without permission, it's the death penalty.

234
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,920
They won't let you off just because you're young.

235
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,100
Then what should I do?

236
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,720
Royal Concubine Yeong passed away.

237
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,700
She's gone forever.

238
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,140
If only I had hurried,

239
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,020
I would have seen her one last time.

240
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,372
I'm…

241
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,219
a coward.

242
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,560
Hurry and come down.

243
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,860
You should take your shoes.

244
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:25,361
Why is there nobody here?

245
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:53,149
Royal Concubine Yeong...

246
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,509
It's me.

247
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,925
San is here.

248
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,740
I meant to tell you myself that

249
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,160
what I said to you then…

250
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,180
I didn't really mean any of it.

251
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,540
I really meant to tell you…

252
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,660
 Grandmother, did you really tell Grandfather

253
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,200
 to have my father killed?

254
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,420
 Is it true?

255
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,130
 Yes, it is…

256
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,822
 Your Highness.

257
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:35,400
 You're my father's own mother.

258
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,380
 What kind of mother kills her own son?

259
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,722
 My father is dead because of you!

260
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:43,840
 How can you call yourself a mother?

261
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,900
 Are you all right, Your Highness?

262
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,140
 Don't act as if you're worried.

263
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,390
 You always pretended to be worried about Father, too.

264
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,080
 If I become like Father…

265
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,270
 will you leave me, too?

266
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:27,998
 Your grandmother… killed your father.

267
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,460
 I never sought your forgiveness.

268
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,520
 Everything…

269
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,210
 is grandmother's own fault.

270
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,220
 My poor grandson…

271
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,470
 I don't deserve your forgiveness.

272
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,220
You'll make yourself sick if you cry too much.

273
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,780
I'm sure she wouldn't want that.

274
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,440
No,

275
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm sure that she hates me

276
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,900
because of the cruel words I said.

277
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,840
How much she must hate me!

278
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm sure she knows how you feel.

279
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,200
- How would the dead know anything? 
 - You silly!

280
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,600
She knows because she is dead.

281
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,889
The dead know everything.

282
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:59,260
Even your hidden emotions.

283
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,220
I have proof. Shall I tell you?

284
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,620
What is it?

285
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,640
Remember those lights we saw?

286
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,180
The lights didn't go out even when the wind was blowing.

287
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,120
She was glad to see you coming.

288
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,660
"I'm glad you are here. I have missed you!"

289
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,160
"It is dark. Be careful and follow the lights."

290
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,990
Do you really not know that?

291
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:32,445
- Do you think that is true? 
 - Would I lie?

292
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:35,700
I got to hear about her thanks to you.

293
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,377
She was a good person.

294
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:42,240
At first, seeing her lying down like that was a little scary.

295
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,325
I'm not scared anymore.

296
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,330
It is all thanks to you.

297
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,329
Thank you, San!

298
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,560
You!

299
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,200
How do you know my name?

300
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,940
You said it yourself earlier.

301
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,300
Okay, so what is your name?

302
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,260
My name is—

303
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,080
 His Majesty arrives!

304
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,140
Step aside! Step aside!

305
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,480
Open!

306
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
You can't, Your Majesty!

307
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,719
Royal Concubine Yeong bore me six children.

308
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:27,310
Why would I be prohibited from being by her side in this moment of all?

309
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,880
Does that make sense?

310
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,045
It is the law.

311
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
Go away!

312
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,440
Those irritating laws, laws!

313
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,558
And who are you?

314
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:46,940
Your Majesty,

315
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,220
I'm one of the Crown Prince's apprentice maids.

316
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,495
I was paying my respects to Royal Concubine Yeong.

317
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:55,780
Raise your face!

318
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,980
You look like Princess Hwa Pyeong when she was little.

319
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,250
Come here!

320
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,390
That person

321
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,120
went through great lengths

322
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,060
for me and our future.

323
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,969
But now,

324
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:36,972
I can't even stay by her side in death.

325
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:43,432
No king has ever attended a concubine's burial.

326
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:46,800
How cruel is that?

327
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,320
What do you think?

328
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,260
Your Majesty is right.

329
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,160
Is that so?

330
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,300
Your Majesty is certainly right!

331
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,480
Even a young apprentice maid like you knows loyalty.

332
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,160
You're here to pay respects.

333
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,100
Let us both spend some time with Royal Concubine Yeong.

334
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,040
She used to be beautiful in her younger days.

335
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,720
She was a court lady, like you.

336
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,780
The ends of her sleeves were very red.

337
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,660
Every time I saw them, my heart ached so much.

338
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,720
Why did it hurt?

339
00:31:55,907 --> 00:32:03,280
When the court ladies dye their sleeve ends red,

340
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,388
it shows that they are the king's ladies.

341
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,570
At the time,

342
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,140
I was just a lowly prince born from a concubine.

343
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,080
I never dared to dream to be throned.

344
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,640
However, as time passed,

345
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,900
I received Heaven's will and became a king.

346
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,920
I was awarded the crown, and she came along with it.

347
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,380
I deluded myself into thinking

348
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,580
I could do anything I wanted in this world.

349
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,040
Why was that a delusion?

350
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,100
Since you are the king, can you not do anything you want?

351
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,060
Do you know how many things a king cannot control?

352
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,020
You would be stunned when you eventually find out.

353
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,280
Even ice can't be colder than my heart.

354
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,850
I…

355
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,900
have finally lost her.

356
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,390
Now

357
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,060
she won't ever come back.

358
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,140
It is fate that we met tonight.

359
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,293
I will grant you a special Imperial gift.

360
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:47,720
Let's see…

361
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,180
Let me ask you.

362
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:56,792
What kind of court lady do you wish to be?

363
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,022
I want to…

364
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,420
become a court lady who writes well.

365
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,630
Do you want to be a good writer?

366
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,650
Here, take this.

367
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,520

368
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,125
Royal Concubine Yeong wrote this book herself.

369
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:40,700
Can I receive such a precious book?

370
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,141
Tonight, fate brought you here.

371
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:52,651
Did you say you were one of the Crown Prince's young ladies?

372
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,600
You never know.

374
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
Your fate

375
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:08,245
might turn out the same as the owner of this book.

376
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,350

377
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,350
I hope Yi San went back safely.

378
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,580
Did I really meet the king?

379
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,770

380
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,100
My Lady.

381
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,400
You bravely carried out my errand.

382
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,680
You must have been scared.

383
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,060
You did well.

384
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,337
My Lady.

385
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,972
Why did you ask a lowly, young apprentice maid like me

386
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,760
to show final respects to somebody

387
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,318
as precious as Royal Concubine Yeong?

388
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:23,380
I wanted to show you

389
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,600
the last moments of a Royal Noble Concubine with the highest rank.

390
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,060
A court lady can't die inside the palace.

391
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,460
Only royalty is allowed to die here.

392
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,360
An old and infirm court lady has to leave the palace.

393
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,160
Regardless of the authority she had while in the palace,

394
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,060
her last moments are always shabby and insignificant.

395
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,460
However, there is an exception.

396
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,850
There is a way to die in the palace.

397
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,060
Win the King's favor.

398
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,140
If you win the King's favor and become a royal concubine,

399
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,460
you gain the right to die inside the palace.

400
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,080
Look at that!

401
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,780
That's an honor reserved only for those favored by the King.

402
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,980
It's every court lady's last wish.

403
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,588
I'm sure you wish the same.

404
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:48,020
Actually, I…

405
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,200
don't really understand what you mean.

406
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,620
Such a pretty face.

407
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,210
It will get prettier as you grow up.

408
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,540
Look carefully.

409
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,660
Start dreaming.

410
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,920
A dream that you can surely become like her.

411
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,360
 His Highness wants ginseng stew for his midnight snack.

412
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,420
I will inform the kitchen staff.

413
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,480
Yes, Sir.

414
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,300
Why do you do such dangerous things?

415
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:33,227
Thank you for helping me avoid getting caught,

416
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:34,995
but I refuse to allow you to meddle.

417
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:38,910
Do you think I'm making a fuss only over your absence?

418
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,358
I found it.

(T/N: Sagi, or Shi Ji, records a history of more than 3,000 years from the ancient Yellow Emperor to the Han Dynasty.)

419
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,060
I found this book in the Crown Prince's library.

420
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,740
You carefully hid this behind other books,

421
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,018
but anyone could have found it if they really wanted to.

422
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,980
Put it back where you found it.

423
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,680
No, you must burn it immediately.

424
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,400
His Majesty banned this book.

425
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,790
Why are you reading this?

426
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,580
What if I read this book because it's banned?

427
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,730
What if I read it because Grandfather His Majesty told me not to?

428
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:16,329
In your eyes, you must see me as a puppet of His Majesty.

429
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,160
Your Highness,

430
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,480
I really don't see you as His Majesty's puppet.

431
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,340
In fact, I'm constantly amazed

432
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,580
by how someone like you can exist.

433
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,040
There is no one else like you in this world.

434
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,180
I consider it a fortune to be able to serve you as my master.

435
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,440
When you eventually reach the throne, you'll usher in a new world.

436
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,110
I, Hong Deok Ro,

437
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,280
want to see that new world.

438
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,324
I always want to serve you.

439
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm sure you'll always be by my side.

440
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,219
Because Grandfather sent you to me.

441
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:10,380
You're always watching everything I do.

442
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,900
Isn't your job to report it to Grandfather?

443
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,480
Take this book back to the library.

444
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,980
Yes, Your Highness.

445
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:36,100

446
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,180
Everyone, line up, please!

447
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,020
You know the storyteller doesn't come every day!

448
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,380
Sung Deok Im will read for us!

449
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,660
Everyone, line up!

450
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,820
 - Read mine first! 
 - No, mine!

451
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,880
Line up, please!

452
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,320
Why are you cutting in line?

453
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,020
I will read the book of whoever pays me the most first.

454
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,870
"The Story of Hong Gye Wol" is first.

455
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,260
- My Lady. 
 - My Lady.

456
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,810
- Deok Im. 
 - Deok Im.

457
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,520
- Deok Im. 
 - Deok Im?

458
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,020
You! Didn't you just get scolded?

459
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,160
Storytelling, again?

460
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,190
That's how I make the most money.

461
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,160
I don't want to hear it! It's always money with you.

462
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,940
If I save 100 nyang, I'll get my wish. That's what you said!

463
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,560
All right!

464
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,400
Be that as it may, you still have to study!

465
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,637
You are the Crown Prince's maid.

466
00:42:56,637 --> 00:43:00,560
In order to serve him correctly, you'll have to grow up properly.

467
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,640
Honestly, I don't want to serve the Crown Prince.

468
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,620
What?

469
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,080
It's not like I will be paid.

470
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,200
I just wish to be a regular palace servant working at a quiet hall.

471
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,420
You! How can a Crown Prince's maid say that?

472
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,840
Your only duty as a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace

473
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,560
is to think of the well-being of His Highness!

474
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,320
Do you know what will happen to you if the Crown Prince gets ill?

475
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,860

476
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,660
Palace exile.

477
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,020
 - Palace exile!  
 - Louder!

478
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,720
- Palace exile! 
  - Palace exile!

479
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,060
If your immediate superior dies,

480
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,640
all the court ladies of the deceased will exit the palace.

481
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,460
She will immediately leave the palace.

482
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,220
If you don't want to leave, serve your master well.

483
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,720
Understood?

484
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,000
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

485
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,440
Okay. Let's take a break.

486
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,160
Here.

487
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,049
Since you couldn't read it today, read it for me next time, okay?

488
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,640
Crown Prince…

489
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,120
What?

490
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,170
Please, live a long and healthy life!

491
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,710

492
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,480
I will be teaching you something really important.

493
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,220
Close the windows.

494
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,460
 Yes, My Lady.

495
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,240
Now…

496
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,900
I will be teaching you about the palace taboos.

497
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,800
In the palace, there are banned books.

498
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,440
You'll be punished if you are caught reading them.

499
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,180
There was once a King's Eunuch Officer who was caught reading a banned book.

500
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,060
He was beheaded.

501
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,340
This is the book he was caught reading.

502
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,100

(T/N  - Sagi, or Shi Ji, records a history of more than 3,000 years from the ancient Yellow Emperor to the Han Dynasty)

503
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,740
His Majesty's biological mother was a lowborn.

504
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,280
She was a lowly servant for the court ladies.

505
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,180
Merely a lowly maid.

506
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,080
In this book here, called "Sagi" there was a verse.

507
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,310

508
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,320
Sung Deok Im, please explain.

509
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,880
"Ee" as in "your."

510
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,320
"Mo" as in "mother."

511
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,260
"Bi" as in female servant."

512
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,764
"Your mother is…"

513
00:47:25,764 --> 00:47:28,280
"a lowly servant."

514
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,260
Because of this particular verse,

515
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,300
His Majesty loathes this book.

516
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,600
Remember.

517
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,360
You are never to read or keep this book.

518
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,700
Understood?

519
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,780
 Yes, My Lady.

520
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,540
Are you asleep, My Lady?

521
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,740
What is it?

522
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,480
How is the Crown Prince? Is he well?

523
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,200
Yesterday, you had no interest in him.

524
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,600
I…

525
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,440
have nowhere to go outside of the palace.

526
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,260
His Highness is very healthy.

527
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,920
- He will live a very long life. 
 - I'm relieved.

528
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,700
Deok Im.

529
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,800
Yes.

530
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,380
You are the Crown Prince's maid.

531
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,560
He is your master.

532
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,400
You have to take immense pride

533
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,640
in the fact that you are allowed to take care of him.

534
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:14,300
When that loses its value, your life also loses its value.

535
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,343
Don't let that happen.

536
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:19,550
Yes, My Lady.

537
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,820
My Lady.

538
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

539
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,710
I will be going by myself.

540
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,360
Did he really promise?

541
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,260
Will my little princesses be marrying men of noble birth?

542
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,500
As long as you do your job,

543
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,680
I'll do whatever it takes. Tell me.

544
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,320
He found a chance to dethrone the Crown Prince.

545
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,820
- He was reading "Sagi," the banned text. 
 - Oh, gosh.

546
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,540
His Majesty hates that book!

547
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,025
It was found in the Crown Prince's library.

548
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:36,460
Give His Majesty a slight hint.

549
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,540
In a little while, His Majesty will visit

550
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,360
His Highness for a late-night snack.

551
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,200
All right!

552
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,380
 He found a chance to dethrone the Crown Prince.

553
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,418
So…

554
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:04,800
I will first tell Lady Seo, next…

555
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,332
 You are the Crown Prince's maid.

556
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,940
 His Highness is your master.

557
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,963
I'm the Crown Prince's palace maid.

558
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,049
His Royal Highness…

559
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,420
is my master.

560
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,470
 The book is in the Crown Prince's library.

561
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,340
Grandfather!

562
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,500
I made a terrible mistake!

563
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,660
I will never again go against your order nor disappoint you.

564
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,130
Please forgive me!

565
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,660
Oh, dear.

566
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,420
I've treated the crown prince so well!

567
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,540
I've cared for him so much!

568
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,700
You are his mother! Answer me!

569
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,520
What did I do wrong?

570
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Your Majesty

571
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,240
has always

572
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,922
- cared for him with your love— 
 - Shut your mouth!

573
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,500
Then…

574
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,400
why does the Crown Prince insults me?

575
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,900
I see…

576
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,740
He always looked down on his Grandfather's lowly birth.

577
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,840
Yes, that's it!

578
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,100
He's exactly like his father.

579
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,040
He's exactly like his father!

580
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,980
Get away!

581
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,200
Listen closely!

582
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:54,678
What have you been doing?

583
00:52:54,678 --> 00:52:59,580
Bring me that book the Crown Prince has been reading right now!

584
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,653
Before I depose him, I want to confirm it with my own eyes.

585
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:09,150
- Right now! 
 - Yes!

586
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,360
What is it?

587
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,671
Today's class was canceled so I thought I would read a book.

588
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:42,600
You can leave the palace.

589
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,700
I said, exit the palace!

590
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,920
As I am His Highness the Crown Prince's playmate, I have to adhere to his command.

591
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,320
I didn't hear an order to leave.

592
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,500
Everyone, search carefully!

593
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,390
 Yes!

594
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,280
My Lord! We couldn't find it!

595
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,020
Look everywhere!

596
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,660
Look underneath the table and behind the shelves!

597
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,100
Yes!

598
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,720
Search carefully!

599
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,890
 Yes!

600
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,420
I found it!

601
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,240
This isn't the right book!

602
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,400
Don't you know how to read?

603
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,340
I'm so sorry, My Lord.

604
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,950
- Search again! 
 - Yes!

605
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,280

(T/N: Imobia - Your mother is a lowly servant)

606
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,040

607
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,740
Everyone, stop!

608
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,740
Now that we found the book, let's go back to the king's royal chamber.

609
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,080
 Yes, My Lord!

610
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,580
Everyone…

611
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,840
calls me "Your Majesty" to my face and bows down to me.

612
00:56:20,096 --> 00:56:22,056
Behind my back,

613
00:56:22,056 --> 00:56:27,021
they jeer at me, calling me a lowborn.

614
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:35,561
Do you also look down on me as they do?

615
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:39,844
I do not look down on you.

616
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:41,225
Really?

617
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:44,240
I disobeyed the rules and read the banned book.

618
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,635
Since I broke the king's order, please punish me accordingly.

619
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:51,626
If you order me to step down, I will.

620
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:58,778
However, Grandfather, I have never looked down on you.

621
00:56:58,778 --> 00:57:02,891
I could have lied about reading the banned book,

622
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:05,880
but I never did.

623
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:16,287
I believe that, to show you my genuine affection, I should never lie to you.

624
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:27,531
On that day in the year of the black horse, you could've taken my life away as well.

625
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:34,726
But you let me live. You protected me.

626
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:42,154
You chose me as the Crown Prince, as your heir.

627
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:45,720
I apologize for not having been able to show my gratitude for your generosity.

628
00:58:01,075 --> 00:58:04,204
How arrogant of you.

629
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:08,429
When you could lie,

630
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:12,700
do you think you can take my place?

631
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:27,766
Your Majesty,

632
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:31,524
we found the book in the Crown Prince's Library.

633
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:49,480
This page is torn out.

634
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,240
San!

635
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:58,732
Did you tear out this page?

636
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,560
This book I banned you from reading.

637
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:07,420
You tore out this book to respect my order!

638
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:15,501
Yes, I did.

639
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:19,670
I tore out this book.

640
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:25,101
I was afraid I might read the page you banned

641
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:30,063
so I tore out that page in advance.

642
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:32,452
Yes, of course.

643
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:35,419
That's my grandson.

644
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:42,482
I failed to recognize your deep, genuine feelings for me.

645
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:48,133
I got mad just because someone told me you read the banned book.

646
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:51,038
What should we do?

647
00:59:51,038 --> 00:59:52,940
Oh, my.

648
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:57,056
Your hands are cold.

649
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:58,823
Why are you just standing there?

650
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:00,949
The Crown Prince is trembling with cold.

651
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:03,555
Bring me my coat.

652
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:05,660
Right now!

653
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:14,700
Give it to me!

654
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,110
Here. Here!

655
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:40,550
 Your Highness, Crown Prince's playmate Hong Deok Ro is here!

656
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,937
I heard you were looking for me.

657
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:10,330
I have something to ask you.

658
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:13,677
The book was torn.

659
01:01:13,677 --> 01:01:18,230
The page my Grandfather forbade me to read,

660
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:21,304
did you tear it out?

661
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,141
Was it you?

662
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:29,938
Your Highness,

663
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:32,795
actually…

664
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,733
Yes, I did.

665
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:42,230
I was afraid His Majesty would be angry at you.

666
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,925
Thank you, Deok Ro.

667
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:51,967
You saved me today.

668
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:55,153
I’ll never forget what you did for me today.

669
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:58,143
It was nothing. It’s an honor, Your Highness.

670
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:02,520
From now on, always stay by my side.

671
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,259
When I become King, I will make sure to repay this debt.

672
01:02:07,259 --> 01:02:09,550
Your generosity is immeasurable!

673
01:02:21,565 --> 01:02:24,592
Wasn't Deok Im supposed to come today?

674
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:26,061
We were supposed to go together.

675
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:28,309
I don't know where she went.

676
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:31,950
We were planning on sneaking into the kitchen tonight.

677
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,079
I don’t think she will stand us up, do you?

678
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,814
Girls, where is Deok Im? Only the three of you are here.

679
01:02:36,814 --> 01:02:40,334
My Lady, we didn't see Deok Im at all today.

680
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:42,725
- It's true. 
 - That's right.

681
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,106
- Goodbye. 
 - Hurry!

682
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:49,319
Deok Im, this girl,

683
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,033
why isn’t she coming?

684
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,870
What other mischief will you get up to?

685
01:03:05,357 --> 01:03:07,400
Where were you after you missed class?

686
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,650
My Lady.

687
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:12,932
Deok Im!

688
01:03:12,932 --> 01:03:14,572
Deok Im!

689
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:37,842
Your cold will get worse.

690
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:40,772
Let's go back to the palace.

691
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:43,175
I’m fine now, Mother.

692
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:45,764
What have you been doing?

693
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:51,799
I have been just looking…

694
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:55,040
at my place, where I will live forever.

695
01:03:58,842 --> 01:04:03,186
A while ago, about the favor you asked me...

696
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:06,622
Did you find that girl?

697
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:13,249
The apprentice maid you were looking for has already left the palace.

698
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,974
What do you mean she left?

699
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,502
How?

700
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,716
She said she was a maid from the crown prince’s palace.

701
01:04:18,716 --> 01:04:23,440
I'm her master. When I am still alive, how could she leave?

702
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,080
Let's just think that she has left.

703
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,020
It is better than being dead.

704
01:04:33,433 --> 01:04:38,738
What do you think will happen if His Majesty finds out you went to see Royal Concubine Yeong?

705
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:43,240
Not only Your Highness, but that maid, too, would receive a great punishment.

706
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:52,141
Don't be too disappointed.

707
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:57,061
With the passing of time, you’ll forget about Royal Concubine Yeong.

708
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,889
I will look for that girl then.

709
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:04,600
No, you don't need to.

710
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:12,336
Mother, what you say is true. What would be good in meeting her again?

711
01:05:12,336 --> 01:05:14,061
I'm the Crown Prince,

712
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:17,428
and she’s just a mere apprentice maid.

713
01:05:17,428 --> 01:05:20,254
We cannot even be friends

714
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:24,442
or sit together and look at each other’s faces as equals.

715
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:30,704
Since you say she left the palace, I will believe you.

716
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:35,360
I will never look for her.

717
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:06,875
Your Highness,

718
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:10,082
are you looking for someone?

719
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:11,980
No, I'm not.

720
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:21,359
 - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

721
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,150
 - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

722
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:29,460
 - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

723
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,690
 Your Highness!

724
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:36,350
Your Highness!

725
01:06:54,622 --> 01:06:59,992
 If I were ever to see you again, I just wanted to say thank you.

726
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:03,353
 On the most painful day for me…

727
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,637
 I wanted to thank you for being there with me.

728
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:09,432
 You will get sick if you cry too much.

729
01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:13,770
 But… it is better for you if you are away.

730
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:19,779
When somebody is with me, it can get dangerous for them.

731
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:27,221
Whatever danger lies ahead, I will be by your side.

732
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:33,251
I know.

733
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:35,110
Thank you.

734
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,220
Now.

735
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,200

736
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,090

737
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:46,420

738
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,756
I definitely remember saving the Crown Prince that day.

739
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:56,714
If I go to him with this, would I automatically become a Court Lady?

740
01:09:58,457 --> 01:10:00,907
I should be glad I'm still alive.

741
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:04,175
I must be out of my mind!

742
01:10:04,175 --> 01:10:06,189
Out of my mind!

743
01:10:07,587 --> 01:10:09,357
Let's go.

744
01:10:11,985 --> 01:10:15,033
Aren't you supposed to be on duty today?

745
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:18,670
I changed it to tomorrow. Today, I'm off duty.

746
01:10:22,397 --> 01:10:26,205
Hey, Sung Deok Im! You put frog eggs in our socks, didn't you?

747
01:10:26,205 --> 01:10:29,287
It wasn't me this time! I'm serious!

748
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:32,780
Hey! Stop right there!

749
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:40,419
I'm so sorry, Miss Palace Maiden.

750
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:48,366
- Sung Deok Im. 
 - Yes, My Lady.

751
01:10:48,366 --> 01:10:51,461
I heard you're good at calligraphy.

752
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:55,990
- Can you write my letter next time? 
 - Yes.

753
01:11:07,466 --> 01:11:11,278
Deok Im! I heard your friends have been waiting for you.

754
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:14,280
- I know. I'm going there. 
 - Hey! That's not the right way!

755
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,280
I'm taking a shortcut. I'm late!

756
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,320

757
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:04,060

758
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,600
♫  The word fate  ♫

759
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,750
♫  Is something I am finally feeling  ♫

760
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,810
♫  The moments that pass by  ♫

761
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:43,010

~ Preview ~

762
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:46,469
 Your Highness, I deserve to die.

763
01:12:46,469 --> 01:12:48,562
 Oh my, so you met my older brother?

764
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:51,545
 I couldn't dare to look straight at His Highness the Crown Prince's face.

765
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,235
 So are you the maid who looks after this library?

766
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,547
 What is your name?

767
01:12:54,547 --> 01:12:56,786
 - Hong Deok Ro. 
 - Sir Preceptor?

768
01:12:56,786 --> 01:12:59,961
 A tiger entered and already murdered twelve people.

769
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:02,981
 He shouldn't be catching the tiger with his own bodyguards.

770
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:05,228
 If you go now, His Majesty will find out.

771
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:08,095
 I know it is dangerous, but I only have you.

772
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,720
 Only you can do it.

773
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,690
♫  If only you could shine more...  ♫
