1
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,140

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,770

3
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,840

4
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,900

5
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,200
My child.

6
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,627
Father is here.

7
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,613
Open your eyes.

8
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:27,107
We have used the best medicine but seen no improvements.

9
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:30,221
We are at fault, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,314
My child…

11
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,321
Court Lady Gwon.

12
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,701
Tell His Majesty

13
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:21,421
that I beg to see the Crown Prince, even for a moment.

14
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:27,545
My apologies, Your Highness. But His Highness has measles.

15
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:31,236
You have not had it before, so that is a great risk.

16
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,310
But—

17
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,342
Also, you bear a child.

18
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:40,206
Please, think of the royal child you bear.

19
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,989
Your Highness, please return to your place.

20
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,291
My lady, please let us know if you have any news of the Crown Prince.

21
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,018
Yes, I will.

22
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,713
Your Highness…

23
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,930

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,913
Sun…

25
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,282
Sun…

26
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,920
My lady, let us…

27
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:54,390
Your Highness, we have prepared purified water

28
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,710
so that you can pray for the Crown Prince.

29
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,415
We collected it at dawn from Inwang mountain.

30
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:04,215
It will surely have a beneficial effect.

31
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:21,820
 Crown Prince has passed.

32
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:30,529
 Crown Prince has passed.

33
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:39,431
 Crown Prince has passed.

34
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,730
I hear a weird sound.

35
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:48,689
 - Crown Prince has passed.  
 - I must be hallucinating.

36
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:57,627
 - Crown Prince has passed.  
 - I am hallucinating.

37
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,508
Am I not?

38
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:06,719
Crown Prince has passed.

39
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:12,427
Crown Prince has passed.

40
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,219
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness.

41
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,826
Your Highness.

42
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:33,122
I let my child pass before me.

43
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:39,629
I cannot mourn enough for his passing,

44
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:45,803
but he's not my only child.

45
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:50,711
All people of Joseon are my children.

46
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:55,560
More than a hundred children

47
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,090
have died in the capital because of this plague.

48
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:06,413
I command you to stop wasting time mourning the dead

49
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:11,709
and to find a way to save the people from this.

50
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,074
 - Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,097
Have some soup, at least.

52
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,421
I am sorry.

53
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,914
You have to eat and regain strength.

54
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,700
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,922
- Your Majesty... 
 - Your Majesty.

56
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,697
When will you put an end to this?

57
00:08:55,492 --> 00:09:00,714
Will you starve and lie here forever?

58
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,497
I am sorry.

59
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,910
Do you wish to die?

60
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,801
Your Majesty, you shouldn't yell at a pregnant lady.

61
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,180
Leave us alone, Mother.

62
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,200
And you, too, Court Lady Seo.

63
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,309
You are not the only one that's lost a child.

64
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,501
More than a hundred children have died within the city walls.

65
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,537
We don't even have an estimate for the entire country.

66
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:53,703
I am aware.

67
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,323
And yet you act like this?

68
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:02,812
Your clothes, food, and housing

69
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:06,205
all come from the taxes from the people.

70
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:10,007
We owe everything to their blood and sweat.

71
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:14,891
I understand what you're speaking of.

72
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,391
You are the birth mother of the Crown Prince

73
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:21,438
and a Senior First-Rank Concubine bearing a royal child.

74
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:25,610
Hide your sorrows and show dignity to your people.

75
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,420
That is your rightful duty.

76
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,130
I have never

77
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,890
wanted this.

78
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:51,460
I have never wanted to be

79
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,230
a Senior First-Rank Concubine.

80
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,596
Do I have to endure everything and persevere

81
00:10:57,596 --> 00:11:00,717
simply because of this title?

82
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:04,635
My own child passed away.

83
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:08,280
Will you not let me grieve?

84
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,030
The Crown Prince

85
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,130
was not our only child.

86
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:22,117
We still have another one.

87
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:29,524
The child you bear depends solely on you.

88
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,331
Even I cannot look after it.

89
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,901
You are the only one it can depend on.

90
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,460
I…

91
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,830
was not able to protect the young prince.

92
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:51,413
You can blame me for everything.

93
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,731
But do what you must do

94
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,722
as a mother. Please.

95
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,321
I will spend some time alone.

96
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:10,218
 Yes, yes. You are sleeping well.

97
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,530
 We are indeed a family.

98
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:29,607
 No matter what happens, I will protect you and the prince.

99
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:33,425
 I give you my word as King. You can believe me.

100
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,319
 Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:45,204
 I think he looks a lot like you.

102
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:49,435
 I am glad he looks like you.

103
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:46,117
It's a relief that you've regained your appetite.

104
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,505
I have to take care of the child I bear.

105
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,572
I am the only one to take care of it.

106
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:05,140
Is Young Hee back from her home, yet?

107
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,819
No.

108
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,751
How about Bok Yeon?

109
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,834
No.

110
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:16,820
I heard Kyung Hee is busy with work.

111
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:23,210
This is weird…

112
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,951
Court Lady Seo.

113
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,180
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,782
Are you hiding something?

115
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,511
Why don't you answer?

116
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:45,190
My apologies, Your Highness. I do not know anything.

117
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,198
It's the King's command.

118
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:54,923
Bring my friends here right now.

119
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:57,412
- Your Highness. 
 - Quickly.

120
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:02,819
Is everything all right?

121
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,807
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,770
Nothing…

123
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,040
special.

124
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,749
What about Young Hee?

125
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,299
Where is she?

126
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,932
Has something happened to her?

127
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,428
Are you guys—

128
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:38,708
Stop that right now.

129
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm sorry, Kyung Hee.

130
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,437
But I think Her Highness has to know.

131
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,117
Know what?

132
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:51,923
Your Highness,

133
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,927
Young hee will die soon.

134
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,157
What?

135
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,280
Young Hee

136
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,130
had a miscarriage.

137
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,917
She was pregnant with a child in secret.

138
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,887
The Disciplinary Court Lady found out.

139
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,820
She is now imprisoned.

140
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,516
You are pregnant. This news might startle you, so

141
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:31,958
His Majesty has commanded to keep this a secret.

142
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:36,637
I have to go see her. Take me to where she is.

143
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:39,791
Your Highness. You cannot do this.

144
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,283
You are pregnant.

145
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:46,780
I am at fault. I shouldn't have told you.

146
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,520
If you won't take me, then I will go alone.

147
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,832
Step aside.

148
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,509
- Your Highness... 
 - Step aside, I said.

149
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,630
- But— 
 - Who do you think you're addressing?

150
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,165
I am a Senior First-Rank Concubine

151
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,725
and the birthmother of the late Crown Prince.

152
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,970
Do you think I'm nothing with him gone?

153
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,767
How would I dare? Of course not.

154
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,910
If not, step aside.

155
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:27,860
Then…

156
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,700
you may go in by yourself.

157
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,645
You will have to be quick.

158
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:37,075
Thank you, Court Lady Gwon.

159
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,132
I won't forget about this.

160
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,897
Your Highness!

161
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,060
Young Hee!

162
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:19,226
You're pregnant. You shouldn't be here. Please go back.

163
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,407
I'm sorry.

164
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,380
I'm sorry, Young Hee.

165
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,280
You have nothing to apologize for.

166
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,709
I've been thinking only about myself.

167
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:40,904
I've been concerned with my child and myself only. I forgot about you.

168
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,025
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,170
I'm sorry.

170
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:57,810
Who did this to you?

171
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,703
Who was it?

172
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,136
Your Highness, I'm not an innocent apprentice maid anymore.

173
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:10,202
I was not forced. This was my choice, made by my own will.

174
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,220
Why?

175
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,330
I only wanted to be with the man I love.

176
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,862
Even though you knew this would happen?

177
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,330
I am sorry, Your Highness.

178
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,103
I feel sorry for Kyung Hee and Bok Yeon, too.

179
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:34,430
But even though I knew I would make you all sad,

180
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,350
I just wanted to live the way I want.

181
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:44,893
I had the joy that no court lady could even dream of.

182
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:51,797
And I do not care if I have to pay the price for that.

183
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:54,900
No, Young Hee.

184
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,827
I cannot lose you like this.

185
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,093
No.

186
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,070
No.

187
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,080
Go now, Your Highness.

188
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,058
Go back, Deok Im.

189
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,822
Your Highness!

190
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:16,020
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

191
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,710
Your Highness!

192
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,447
You've woken.

193
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,895
- Our child— 
 - It's fine.

194
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,757
The royal nurse said it will be okay if you rest well.

195
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:57,136
Did you try to hide from me that my friend will die?

196
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,306
When you couldn't keep it a secret forever.

197
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:07,664
I… thought it would be the best way

198
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:12,699
because I knew how much you care

199
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,021
about your friends.

200
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,987
Your friend…

201
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,822
has committed adultery and had a miscarriage.

202
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:34,311
All court ladies know of this.

203
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,840
This country

204
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,920
has laws to be kept.

205
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,570
And everyone is equal before them.

206
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:52,290
Even if it's your dear friend,

207
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,600
I cannot let this go unpunished.

208
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,770
That…

209
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,620
is my duty as King.

210
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,342
I know.

211
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:08,021
You would never make an exception.

212
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:12,030
That's why I did not ask you to spare her,

213
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,514
nor beg of you.

214
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,403
All I want is…

215
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:27,907
I'd like to be alone.

216
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,522
Young Hee…

217
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,607
Young Hee…

218
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:09,938
Young Hee…

219
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,705
Young Hee…

220
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:04,498
Will Young Hee resent me from heaven?

221
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:07,983
You know all too well that she is not the type

222
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:11,717
that would hold such emotions.

223
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,967
Your Highness.

224
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:18,219
Perhaps Young Hee…

225
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:22,920
might be alive somewhere…

226
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:29,623
Like in the novel where

227
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:34,395
the heroine feigns death after drinking poison

228
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:40,380
and leaves with the man she loves.

229
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,810
You told us that story.

230
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,830
Do you remember?

231
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,512
I know it's nonsense.

232
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:57,319
I just…

233
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,630
Bok Yeon is right.

234
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,314
Young Hee went ahead and must be waiting for us.

235
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:10,314
Waiting for us?

236
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:13,114
We all made a promise together when we were little.

237
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:18,425
We promised to live together right next to a book renter.

238
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:22,395
When our hair has greyed, and we're discharged of service,

239
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:29,160
so that we can read all we want while munching on roasted chestnuts.

240
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:36,216
Perhaps, Young Hee has found a place like that and is waiting for us.

241
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,684
Then, we would get to see her someday.

242
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:42,618
Of course.

243
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,950
Right, she has a lover.

244
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:55,396
What if she wants to live with him instead of us?

245
00:27:55,396 --> 00:28:00,020
I wouldn't let that happen. I would drag her by her hair if I have to.

246
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,340
Young Hee is gone…

247
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,600
and now it's just the three of us.

248
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:21,338
From now on, we stay together. No cutting in line.

249
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,282
No one leaves first.

250
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,720
What if someone breaks the promise?

251
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,613
I don't know. But that's our promise.

252
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:39,006
You can never break it.

253
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:11,628
Are you getting your pulse checked every day?

254
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:13,817
Yes.

255
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,605
Are you taking the medicine?

256
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:21,811
Yes.

257
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,940
I am indeed well.

258
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,510
Or else, how could I have come to visit you?

259
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:32,530
Your Majesty.

260
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,490
I have done wrong.

261
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,269
What wrong?

262
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:42,560
I am not the only one who lost a child.

263
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:50,076
I knew you were also suffering greatly.

264
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:55,040
I knew that better than anyone.

265
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,320
But I was too harsh on you.

266
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:03,410
I thought you could endure the pain since you're King.

267
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:16,223
But I realized that, being the King,

268
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:25,101
you would only have suffered more.

269
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:28,240
I…

270
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,718
am okay.

271
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,403
I can bear it.

272
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:44,390
And I have to.

273
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:52,160
Are you indeed okay?

274
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,774
As soon as you lost our little prince,

275
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,500
you lost one of your dearest friends.

276
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:04,610
Do you have no grudge against me?

277
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:09,255
I had the power to save her life

278
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:13,211
but chose not to.

279
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:18,778
Won't you hate me for that?

280
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:28,200
I always knew from the very beginning… that you are that type of person.

281
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,530
That is just the way you are.

282
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,400
You can't help it.

283
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:40,050
Your Majesty.

284
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,720
When Spring comes, the flowers will bloom again, right?

285
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,890
Are you talking about that tree in the annex?

286
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:54,990
That tree—

287
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,023
It will blossom once more… someday.

288
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:02,330
It will.

289
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:08,770
And when that happens, everything will be okay.

290
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,440
I would like to go see the flowers with you.

291
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:20,911
Just like the old days when you were still the Crown Prince, and I a palace maid.

292
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:27,779
Just like those summer days

293
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,730
when everything was okay.

294
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,080
Your Majesty,

295
00:32:57,494 --> 00:33:02,590
I've heard that you worked three days straight without sleep at the public health clinic.

296
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,900
I had something to look over myself.

297
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,694
I am worried that you've caught a cold.

298
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:14,190
Please remember that your own well-being is in fact

299
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,482
the well-being of this entire nation.

300
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,829
I will keep that in mind.

301
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,419
Let me deliver this news, Your Majesty.

302
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,530
Kim Ki Ju has passed away in exile in Naju.

303
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:46,213
Does Queen Dowager know?

304
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:50,303
An official report has just arrived,

305
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:53,010
so she wouldn't have heard yet.

306
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,050
I will give her the news myself.

307
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,981
Y-Your Majesty!

308
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,510
 Your Highness, Lady Hyegyeong has come.

309
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,624
Your Highness. I heard the news.

310
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:39,000
You must be in great grief.

311
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,323
Where is His Majesty?

312
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:46,860
His cold has grown worse, and he is seeing his doctor.

313
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,800
Then you should be with him. Why come here?

314
00:34:55,732 --> 00:35:00,480
Is there anything that I can do for Your Highness?

315
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,597
What can you do about this?

316
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:10,885
There is nothing I can do for my own brother.

317
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:20,921
When my brother has passed, I cannot wear a mourning robe.

318
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,913
I cannot even attend the funeral.

319
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,940
I am caged in this palace,

320
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:35,387
never to set foot outside.

321
00:35:37,388 --> 00:35:40,411
Who might have caged us here

322
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,218
surrounded by nine walls

323
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,015
never to cross that boundary?

324
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:58,540
The palace…

325
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,140
is nothing but…

326
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,818
a luxurious prison.

327
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:38,680
When did you come?

328
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,608
Just a while ago.

329
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:52,728
I'm glad it's not a serious illness.

330
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:59,367
It's just a common cold. Don't worry.

331
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,875
You should sleep more.

332
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,402
Are you leaving already?

333
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,270
You need to rest.

334
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,970
Stay with me for a while longer.

335
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:27,514
No. You're pregnant. You should not catch a cold.

336
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,547
You should go.

337
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,400
I will stay for a while.

338
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,412
You would leave when you're asked to stay.

339
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,314
And you would stay when you are asked to leave.

340
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:44,302
I might have been a tree frog in my past life. 
  (T/N: someone that doesn't listen; "contrarian")

341
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,940
You might have.

342
00:37:48,997 --> 00:37:52,480
I will be by your side until you fall asleep.

343
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:56,020
So will you leave when I'm asleep?

344
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,930
Then…

345
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,590

346
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:14,039
Read a little bit for me until I fall asleep.

347
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,542
I want to hear your voice.

348
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,268

349
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:47,221
"The north wind is chilly, the falling snow is thick."

350
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:52,284
"You, who cherish and love me,"

351
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:56,706
"I will hold your hand and go with you."

352
00:38:57,886 --> 00:39:01,405
"Why would you hesitate?"

353
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,770
 "Oh, there is urgency!"

354
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:12,030
 "The north wind is chilly, the falling snow is thick."

355
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:16,804
 "You, who cherish and love me,

356
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:21,481
 "I will hold your hand and go home with you."

357
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:24,712
"Are foxes only red"

358
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:28,680
"and ravens only black?"

359
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:34,695
"You, who cherish and love me,"

360
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:40,697
"let us join hands and go together in our carriage."

361
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,883
We have lost

362
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:57,270
those who we hold dearest.

363
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:06,315
But we will endure the pain, for we have each other.

364
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:10,890
Won't we?

365
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:30,201
You have a fever… It's not me, it's you.

366
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,394
Since when have you had this fever?

367
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,290
Since when?

368
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:43,363
I am okay, Your Majesty.

369
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:47,960
You have a strong heart.

370
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:53,430
So… you will be okay.

371
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,406
Deok Im!

372
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:03,549
Deok Im! Deok Im!

373
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:06,037
Bring in the doctor.

374
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,224
Deok Im!

375
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,324
The doctor!

376
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:12,886
Deok Im!

377
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:15,875
Right.

378
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,469
Put in every little bit.

379
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,190
 Court Lady Seo!

380
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:28,909
Is it true that Concubine Uibin fainted?

381
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,631
Yes, it is.

382
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:37,140
Her delivery is expected soon, and now she is ill? That's not good.

383
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,774
Don't worry, Court Lady Seo. Her Highness will recover soon.

384
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:48,243
Of course, she will.

385
00:41:48,243 --> 00:41:50,214
Let me.

386
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,390
Stay away.

387
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:41,795
Court Lady Seo.

388
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:43,740
Welcome.

389
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,898
Is His Majesty in there?

390
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:47,309
Yes.

391
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,780
He is waiting for her to wake up.

392
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:59,066
Actually… the First State Councilor sent me.

393
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:03,251
He told me to bring back His Majesty to discuss urgent state affairs.

394
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:08,280
But what if something happens to Concubine Uibin?

395
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,585
I am sorry, Court Lady Seo. But we are servants of this country.

396
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:17,610
We have to do our duties.

397
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,721
Please inform His Majesty.

398
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:22,746
Yes.

399
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:33,105
I will head to the official court.

400
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:34,805
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:40,030
Let me know as soon as she wakes.

402
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

403
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:08,131
Your Highness, you're finally awake!

404
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:12,495
You have been unconscious for three days.

405
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:16,771
Please wait. I will go tell the royal nurse to bring you medicine.

406
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:23,910
My lady.

407
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:28,530
Your Highness,

408
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,630
why do you call me that?

409
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,720
I just

410
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,460
wanted to call you like in the old days.

411
00:44:45,638 --> 00:44:51,105
You have a strong heart, my lady.

412
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:56,310
I liked that about you so much.

413
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,260
Your Highness...

414
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:05,142
My birth mother was a sweet and kind person

415
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:07,965
but was not strong at heart.

416
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:13,190
It would have been better if she had been strong like you.

417
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:20,443
So you will be okay, my lady.

418
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:25,690
Please wait, Your Highness. I will bring His Majesty back here.

419
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,879
No, not His Majesty.

420
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:33,610
Please bring Kyung Hee and Bok Yeon.

421
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,504
But—

422
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:38,750
Please bring my friends here. Hurry.

423
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,925
You are awake.

424
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:36,306
Court Lady Seo.

425
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:40,310
Did I not tell you to bring Kyung Hee and Bok Yeon?

426
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,942
My apologies, Your Highness, but—

427
00:46:42,942 --> 00:46:45,908
Now, go and bring them here right now.

428
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:49,150
We don't have much time. Hurry.

429
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,771
Yes.

430
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,397
I have to see them before I leave...

431
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:02,097
Did you…

432
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,100
Did you not want to see me then?

433
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:11,977
Your Majesty will be okay.

434
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:16,874
You have a lot of things to protect.

435
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:23,851
And those you have to protect will keep you safe.

436
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:30,781
My friends have no one but me.

437
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:36,825
I'm just sorry I'd have to leave them behind.

438
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:39,739
Don't do this.

439
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,870
This is my fault.

440
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,066
If you were still a court lady,

441
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:54,965
if I had not urged you to become a concubine

442
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:00,601
this might not have happened, right?

443
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,677
Your Majesty.

444
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:12,470
Do you still hold me so dear at heart?

445
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,301
Yes.

446
00:48:15,403 --> 00:48:17,231
Yes.

447
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,120
Then…

448
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,740
when you see me

449
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:30,293
in your next life,

450
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:35,082
please just pass on by.

451
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:41,818
It is not because I hold a grudge

452
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:45,872
or because I hate you.

453
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:49,510
It's just that…

454
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:55,854
I want to live the way I want in my next life.

455
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,492
Does that mean

456
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,720
that you've never

457
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,220
truly loved me?

458
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,393
Did you not love me

459
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:24,861
even the slightest bit?

460
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,902
Do you still have to ask?

461
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:34,856
If I hadn't wanted you,

462
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:41,111
I would have run away no matter how.

463
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:49,123
Do you not understand that

464
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,350
it was my final decision

465
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,780
to stay by your side?

466
00:50:40,861 --> 00:50:42,705
Deok Im.

467
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:49,524
Deok Im.

468
00:50:58,158 --> 00:50:59,770
Deok Im.

469
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,786
Deok Im.

470
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,940
Deok Im!

471
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:12,150
Open your eyes.

472
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,512
Deok Im…

473
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,762
I am to blame.

474
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,237
I am to blame, Deok Im.

475
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:29,622
Please…

476
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:33,897
Please don't go…

477
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,206
Please don't leave me…

478
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:46,464
Deok Im…

479
00:51:56,524 --> 00:51:58,858
Concubine Uibin is dead?

480
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:02,504
Yes, Your Highness.

481
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:05,241
I see.

482
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,930

483
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,330

484
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:32,510
Court Lady Seo?

485
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:41,405
I heard you were at the concubine selection.

486
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,137
Yes.

487
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:47,240
I am truly sorry for what happened to Concubine Uibin.

488
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:53,680
But I believe His Majesty did only what he had to as king.

489
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,850
I know.

490
00:53:58,182 --> 00:54:02,050
How did the selection go?

491
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:07,960
His Majesty has always held Concubine Uibin dear to his heart, as you know.

492
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,517
She was the only one that His Majesty personally chose

493
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:16,270
by his own will.

494
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,240
Yes, she was.

495
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:25,838
Quite ridiculously, it seems that the entire world found out

496
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:32,091
about His Majesty's favorite.

497
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:43,938
 In some way or another

498
00:54:43,938 --> 00:54:47,327
 they resembled Concubine Uibin.

499
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:53,537
 The way her eyes would shine,

500
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:58,319
 her bright smile,

501
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:03,080
 and her humble character.

502
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,618
Each one was like the late Concubine in some way.

503
00:55:08,618 --> 00:55:14,884
Did His Majesty make a choice?

504
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:17,415
The one most similar to Concubine Uibin?

505
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:19,446
No.

506
00:55:21,378 --> 00:55:28,045
I have never seen His Majesty so angry.

507
00:56:06,468 --> 00:56:13,122
 We needed another round of selection.

508
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:19,441
At last, one new concubine was chosen.

509
00:56:20,805 --> 00:56:23,699
The new Concubine Subin

510
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:28,761
does not resemble Concubine Uibin at all.

511
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:34,124
I don't know why, but…

512
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:41,268
I was glad.

513
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:48,224
Are you okay, Court Lady Seo?

514
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:53,799
Is there anything I can do for you? Just tell me.

515
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,018
- My lord. 
 - Yes.

516
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:03,730
Please protect His Majesty.

517
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:12,434
Keep him company…

518
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:16,368
so that he won't be too lonely…

519
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:25,250
Please stay by his side, my lord.

520
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:31,417
Yes, I will.

521
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:14,925
Your Majesty, Concubine Subin made this herself.

522
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:18,670
Please try even a small bite.

523
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:42,425
 Your Majesty,

524
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,705
 I put my heart into this.

525
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:52,980
 Please try it.

526
00:58:55,387 --> 00:58:58,318
 Well then…

527
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:09,440
 It is taste that matters, not the look.

528
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,616
 It is love and care that matters even more than taste.

529
00:59:55,266 --> 01:00:01,799
 If you don't know how to cook, you could have used some help.

530
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,231
 It is your birthday.

531
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:08,244
 So I wanted to make it myself.

532
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:15,540
 Does it taste bad?

533
01:00:16,091 --> 01:00:17,968
 You don't have to eat it.

534
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:20,133
 No, that's not it.

535
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:25,513
 Well, it doesn't look great,

536
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:30,611
 but it tastes quite good.

537
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,851
 I will eat it all.

538
01:00:37,605 --> 01:00:40,350
 I've never seen dumpling soup like this.

539
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,559
 It's so…

540
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:15,073
 It's good that I made a lot.

541
01:01:16,016 --> 01:01:18,648
 Have one more bowl.

542
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:30,102
 Didn't you say it tasted good?

543
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:51,289
 How am I supposed to eat this?

544
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:54,730
 You can eat all of it in a single bite.

545
01:01:56,705 --> 01:01:59,399
 Would you like to try it?

546
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:02,931
 No. I'm just happy to see you enjoy my food.

547
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:07,121
 What are you saying? You put your heart into this delicious dish.

548
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:08,580
 I feel bad eating it all alone.

549
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,899
 - How would I dare? 
 - Here. Say "ah."

550
01:02:10,899 --> 01:02:14,509
 - Say "ah." Oh dear. 
 - No, thanks.

551
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:21,715
 Yes. Just like that.

552
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:25,677
 There you go. Good.

553
01:02:25,677 --> 01:02:29,544
 How do you like it? Isn't it good?

554
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:32,139
 - It is very good. 
 - Then have some more.

555
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:35,247
 Your Majesty, let me help you.

556
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:36,726
 I am quite full.

557
01:02:36,726 --> 01:02:40,714
 - I've already had a bowl. 
 - Say "ah."

558
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:45,415
 This is nice.

559
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:47,156
 What is nice?

560
01:02:47,156 --> 01:02:50,446
 It's nice to see you eat so well.

561
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,920
Send my apologies to Concubine Subin.

562
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:36,647
 Deok Im.

563
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:42,858
 I… will not think of you anymore.

564
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:49,684
 Even if I may be merely pretending that I've forgotten you, it won't matter.

565
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:53,400
 I will forget you.

566
01:03:55,022 --> 01:03:59,890
 I am the King. I will do what I must.

567
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:03,125
 I will fulfill my duties.

568
01:04:03,702 --> 01:04:09,523
 I've always lived that way and always will.

569
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:12,149
 I…

570
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,550
 I will forget you.

571
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,730
Hello, Sir, why don't you sit here and take a break?

572
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:04,522
You said you were not yet fifty years old.

573
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,520
That is right.

574
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,128
This old man is nearing ninety.

575
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:18,090
I have lived under the reign of four kings in my life.

576
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:24,016
But truly, no time has been as peaceful or prosperous as now.

577
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:33,246
I am old, ailing, and with dim eyesight. Yet, I still manage to live with dignity

578
01:05:33,246 --> 01:05:36,512
because this state takes care of me.

579
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:41,036
Such a thing could never have been possible in the past.

580
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,633
Old Sir,

581
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,759
the trail down the hill is quite rugged. Let me help you down.

582
01:05:56,759 --> 01:06:01,248
It is all right. I have walked that trail my whole life.

583
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:17,895
Take care.

584
01:06:48,947 --> 01:06:50,727
 Aim!

585
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:53,552
 Shoot!

586
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,120
 Aim!

587
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:05,118
- Are these archers from the Royal Army? 
  - Shoot!

588
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:07,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

589
01:07:08,915 --> 01:07:12,454
They are better than the soldiers of the Provincial Army.

590
01:07:12,454 --> 01:07:17,730
Of course, Your Majesty. Those soldiers were chosen by you, after all.

591
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,380
 Aim!

592
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,430
Next are the soldiers of the Capital Army.

593
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:24,080
 Shoot!

594
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,515
His shooting is uncanny.

595
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:42,670
The capital army has such skilled soldiers.

596
01:07:43,529 --> 01:07:50,190
Of course, Your Majesty. I handpicked those soldiers, after all.

597
01:07:55,501 --> 01:07:58,276
Bring him to me.

598
01:07:58,276 --> 01:08:04,530
He will be suitable as a lieutenant of the Provincial Army.

599
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:10,812
I, Sung Guk Min, have come before you as you commanded, Your Majesty.

600
01:08:10,812 --> 01:08:12,903
Raise your head.

601
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:14,734
Yes, Your Majesty.

602
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:23,440
You look familiar.

603
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,387
What is your father's name?

604
01:08:27,387 --> 01:08:30,590
His name is Sung Sik.

605
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,518
You…

606
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:37,625
are the nephew of the late Concubine Uibin.

607
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,036
That is right, Your Majesty.

608
01:08:49,094 --> 01:08:53,040
Appoint the lad to lieutenant of the Capital Army.

609
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,825
Yes, Your Majesty.

610
01:09:03,893 --> 01:09:09,580
The anniversary of Concubine Uibin's passing is in five days.

611
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:18,966
It's been a long time

612
01:09:18,966 --> 01:09:23,870
since you spoke of the late Uibin.

613
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:26,150
I have not

614
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,590
thought of her in years.

615
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:19,541
It's been a long time since I was here.

616
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:25,770
But this place

617
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:28,720
hasn't changed at all.

618
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:32,888
We kept it exactly the way it was

619
01:10:32,888 --> 01:10:38,110
as Your Majesty commanded all those years ago.

620
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,020
I wish to be alone for a moment.

621
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,270

622
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,560

623
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:20,540
Your Majesty,

624
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,350
I heard you are looking for someone who remembers Concubine Uibin.

625
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:30,322
That person will soon come to visit you.

626
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:35,860
I hope that she will be able to comfort you.

627
01:14:13,474 --> 01:14:16,760
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

628
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:23,402
You are the Head Court Lady.

629
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:29,092
I do not recall asking for you.

630
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:33,310
I heard you were looking for the personal effects of Concubine Uibin.

631
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:41,725
That is right.

632
01:14:48,008 --> 01:14:51,600
You were her friend.

633
01:14:56,901 --> 01:14:59,113
I had forgotten

634
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:03,910
even that for a long time.

635
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:09,110
Court Lady Bae,

636
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,460
what is your full name?

637
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,898
My name is Bae Kyung Hee.

638
01:15:14,898 --> 01:15:21,330
The late Uibin had two more friends beside you.

639
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:26,500
One passed away early on

640
01:15:29,427 --> 01:15:31,452
and the other…

641
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:38,010
Court Lady Kim Bok Yeon passed away two years ago.

642
01:15:42,643 --> 01:15:45,420
So you are also by yourself?

643
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:56,200
I am not by myself, Your Majesty.

644
01:15:56,904 --> 01:16:00,621
I swore an oath with my friends

645
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:04,010
that I would meet with them again.

646
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:10,580
So my friends will be waiting for me,

647
01:16:12,085 --> 01:16:16,780
as will Concubine Uibin.

648
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:21,290
Why would she be waiting for you?

649
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:34,640
She was my concubine.

650
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,500
She was my person!

651
01:16:38,812 --> 01:16:45,701
Time passed, but she belongs to me and me alone! I will not give her to anyone else!

652
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:49,780
I thought you had forgotten about her.

653
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:53,250
But I see that this is not the case.

654
01:16:56,124 --> 01:17:02,296
Concubine Uibin's personal effects are in the late Crown Prince Munhyo's Palace. 
  (T/N: Prince Munhyo was the son of King Jeongjo and Uibin)

655
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:05,730
I will bring them to you if you wish.

656
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,526
Go ahead.

657
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:40,218
I have kept the late Uibin's personal effects in this chest.

658
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:42,701
Good.

659
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,342
I will reward you.

660
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:47,510
I do not wish for a reward

661
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:53,310
as I was merely following my heart.

662
01:17:55,385 --> 01:17:58,325
You speak like the late Uibin.

663
01:18:00,606 --> 01:18:02,956
Maybe it's because she was your friend.

664
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:08,239
Even at the very end,

665
01:18:10,505 --> 01:18:13,370
she asked for her friends.

666
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,070
She was disappointed when I came instead of you.

667
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,240
She told me

668
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:30,259
to ignore her in the next life,

669
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:37,585
to just pass her by as if a stranger would.

670
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:43,616
Your Majesty,

671
01:18:43,616 --> 01:18:48,019
it was merely her bravado speaking.

672
01:18:49,509 --> 01:18:50,598
Bravado?

673
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:55,597
She told us that without such small acts of bravado,

674
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:57,804
she could not bear it.

675
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,487
But you know, Your Majesty,

676
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,527
Concubine Uibin truly loved His Maj—

677
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:07,494
Quiet!

678
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:16,579
Why must I hear of her true feelings from you?

679
01:19:18,882 --> 01:19:21,990
I do not wish to hear such a thing from you.

680
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,810
It is insolent.

681
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:28,238
My apologies, Your Majesty.

682
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:30,950
I wish to be alone, so leave me.

683
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,290

684
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,000
 Transcription?

685
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,012
 A lot of the palace maids do it on their days off as their secondary job.

686
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:39,562
 The Daehak Yeonibo, though?

687
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:44,093
 Did you really work on this?

688
01:20:44,093 --> 01:20:47,201
 How can a mere apprentice maid like you have such great handwriting?

689
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:50,825
 You keep calling me "little apprentice maid" and looking down on me.

690
01:20:50,825 --> 01:20:54,078
 What makes you so special?

691
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,790

692
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,410

693
01:23:12,389 --> 01:23:14,905
It's so small.

694
01:23:20,185 --> 01:23:23,520
Were you this small?

695
01:23:31,002 --> 01:23:32,862
Yet, I…

696
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,552
truly loved you.

697
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:55,128
Deok Im…

698
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:15,400
No, Your Majesty! The time is not ripe!

699
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:25,370
Left State Councilor, don't you get tired

700
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:30,402
of opposing everything I wish to do, time after time?

701
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:34,673
I am not against freeing government slaves.

702
01:24:34,673 --> 01:24:41,128
However, it is not the right time.

703
01:24:41,128 --> 01:24:44,060
Before we free the slaves,

704
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:49,489
we must save money for the wages their replacements will require.

705
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:55,990
And we must create a new source of income for the various government institutions.

706
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:03,340
I understand. Do as you wish.

707
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:07,241
- Your Majesty? 
 - You are right.

708
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:12,030
Find the quickest way to free the slaves.

709
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,916
You are dismissed.

710
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,591
Yes, Your Majesty.

711
01:25:23,674 --> 01:25:28,841
For heaven's sake. So annoying.

712
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:41,570
I never thought that I would say such words to you, Your Majesty.

713
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:45,950
But I feel compelled to say them today.

714
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:49,751
Never has this land known a benevolent king

715
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:53,460
who cherishes his people such as yourself.

716
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,319
I, Shim Hwi Won,

717
01:25:58,307 --> 01:26:01,830
am happy to get to serve you,

718
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,260
Your Majesty.

719
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:32,310
That was so unexpected

720
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,990
from that old man...

721
01:27:55,718 --> 01:27:57,750
Your Majesty.

722
01:27:58,794 --> 01:28:03,339
I'm so relieved that you're awake.

723
01:28:04,677 --> 01:28:09,700
It seems the smoke treatment was effective.

724
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,388
We will resume treatment.

725
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:14,307
No.

726
01:28:16,894 --> 01:28:19,512
Leave me for a moment.

727
01:28:22,124 --> 01:28:24,532
I wish to be alone.

728
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:09,293
 Why did it have to be me?

729
01:29:09,293 --> 01:29:11,890
 What do you mean?

730
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:14,890
 The world is full of women.

731
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:19,626
 There are many women who have everything,

732
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:22,355
 good families, learning, and character.

733
01:29:22,355 --> 01:29:24,870
 Why did it have to be me?

734
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:28,730
 That's because

735
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,780
 no other woman can be you.

736
01:29:36,112 --> 01:29:37,926
 Deok Im.

737
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:44,668
 I've loved you even though I had to go against what's decided by the heavens.

738
01:29:47,108 --> 01:29:49,779
 That is why I don't need any other woman.

739
01:29:52,486 --> 01:29:55,013
 It has to be you.

740
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:55,092
Did you have a nightmare

741
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,553
You…

742
01:31:09,948 --> 01:31:11,980
are here.

743
01:31:12,922 --> 01:31:15,585
I've been here all the while.

744
01:31:15,585 --> 01:31:19,170
You've been sleeping all day on my lap.

745
01:31:41,507 --> 01:31:45,507
You should go now. You are late.

746
01:31:45,507 --> 01:31:47,215
Right.

747
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,514
Okay.

748
01:32:08,286 --> 01:32:09,701
Deok Im.

749
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:11,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

750
01:32:13,089 --> 01:32:18,630
I will not love as my grandfather did.

751
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,201
Your Majesty?

752
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,794
I will protect you,

753
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:27,537
the woman I love, until the end.

754
01:32:29,288 --> 01:32:32,330
What are you trying to say?

755
01:32:34,704 --> 01:32:38,034
I understand, so please go.

756
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:40,700
You are very late.

757
01:34:47,112 --> 01:34:50,000
Why are you looking at the flowers?

758
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,599
They've blossomed again.

759
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:58,930
I never thought I would see them again.

760
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:02,342
You can look at the flowers later.

761
01:35:02,342 --> 01:35:04,810
You must be on your way.

762
01:35:05,996 --> 01:35:10,680
Everyone is waiting for you.

763
01:35:16,974 --> 01:35:19,012
Deok Im.

764
01:35:19,012 --> 01:35:20,095
Yes, Your Majesty.

765
01:35:20,095 --> 01:35:22,925
A long time has passed

766
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,930
and sometimes,

767
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,320
I didn't know

768
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:36,690
whether I really missed you

769
01:35:38,101 --> 01:35:39,870
or

770
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:46,120
if I missed an idealized past.

771
01:35:48,374 --> 01:35:50,436
But now I know.

772
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:55,610
I miss you

773
01:35:58,205 --> 01:36:01,600
and the days I was with you.

774
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:17,517
I will never let go of your hand again.

775
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,398
Do not say such things.

776
01:36:22,916 --> 01:36:26,837
It is not too late to return.

777
01:36:28,423 --> 01:36:33,314
Return to the place where Your Majesty belongs.

778
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,906
You must continue to be a good king as you have always been.

779
01:36:44,183 --> 01:36:46,920
This is where I belong.

780
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:50,100
As it turns out,

781
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:54,060
we did not have much time.

782
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,903
I wish to wait no longer.

783
01:37:03,088 --> 01:37:04,900
So

784
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,730
please love me.

785
01:37:13,222 --> 01:37:14,901
Please…

786
01:37:18,687 --> 01:37:20,826
love me.

797
01:38:41,108 --> 01:38:45,534
 I do not care if this is the past.

798
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,723
 I do not care if this is a dream.

799
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:52,737
 I do not care if this is death.

800
01:38:54,025 --> 01:38:59,758
 I choose this moment when I can be with you.

801
01:39:00,998 --> 01:39:03,431
 And I will hope

802
01:39:04,634 --> 01:39:09,023
 that this moment never passes.

803
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,680
 May this moment

804
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:15,450
 last forever.

805
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:26,308
 And so, this moment became our eternity.

806
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:36,980

807

808
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:49,600
♫  Love, with that ordinary feeling,  ♫

809
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:55,920
♫  Those lonely days that I endured  ♫

810
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:04,560
♫  In your tight embrace  ♫

811
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:11,660
♫  I feel like crying but I hold back the tears  ♫

812
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:18,640
♫  You colored my entire life  ♫

813
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:24,630
♫  But I will let go of your hand  ♫

814
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:33,680
♫  Happy days with you are almost over  ♫

815
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,700
♫  I'm getting tired of being left alone  ♫
