1
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,260

2
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,920

3
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,380

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Your Highness.

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,342
What is that?

6
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,509
They're signal kites.

7
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,228
Oh, so those are signal kites.

8
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,718
The kind used for war?

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,820
I always wanted to see one.

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,280
Why would you want to see one?

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,630
It's in order to protect you, Your Highness.

12
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,612
If there is a revolt,

13
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,796
I could inform you using this kite.

14
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,310
Then memorize the meanings of all the kites.

15
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,360
Do you mean all of these kites?

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,220
I will make sure to do that.

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,403
As your loyal servant, I am entirely devoted to your safety.

18
00:01:56,403 --> 00:02:01,382
You may hide behind me if a traitor ever appears.

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,390
Do you want me to hide behind you?

20
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,451
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,695
After we parted ways at the late Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber,

22
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,389
I missed you for a long time.

23
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:25,810
I thought of you countless times.

24
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,197
I was in so much pain after losing my grandmother that day.

25
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:33,158
On that night,

26
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:38,226
that girl was my lone comfort. Where could she possibly be at?

27
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:41,704
Is she still alive?

28
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,793
Could she have experienced troubles because of me?

29
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:49,399
Thoughts of you filled my mind,

30
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,960
but I dared not search for you.

31
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,252
At the time,

32
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,682
I was but a child that was looking out for his own skin.

33
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:06,389
But now, I am no longer a helpless child.

34
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,598
And I have finally found you.

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,403
Answer me.

36
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,070
What should I do with you?

37
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,898
That day, it was merely a chance encounter that brought us together,

38
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,317
and I had no idea of who you were.

39
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:44,910
It was a chance encounter of two children.

40
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,434
Must we give it some kind of significance?

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,088
So…

42
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:59,110
that encounter did not mean anything to you?

43
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,078
That is correct, Your Highness.

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,465
 Your Highness, His Majesty wishes to see you.

45
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,887

Did I-I ask for you?

46
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:24,010
I don't know.

47
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,709
Why would I have called you here?

48
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:32,014
What for?

49
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,823
Your Majesty, please take your time

50
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,670
to remember the reason why.

51
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:45,670
It seems His Majesty wanted to discuss the procession to the ancestral graves.

52
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,062
Because His Majesty is in no condition to lead it,

53
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:51,707
perhaps His Majesty was about to command the Crown Prince to lead the procession?

54
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,193
Is that so?

55
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,304
Then…

56
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:09,121
I shall lead the procession to the ancestral graves this time.

57
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,243
Crown Prince.

58
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:21,929
You wished to dedicate an exalted title to His Majesty and host a banquet at  Jibgyeong Hall. 
 (T/N: a building the king and his queen used for rest and leisure)

59
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:26,595
If you were to leave, we do not have anyone to prepare for those events.

60
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,857
His Majesty has already declined the exalted title

61
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,604
so we only need to prepare for the banquet.

62
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,694
Is that so?

63
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:39,539
Then would it be all right if I prepare the banquet in your stead?

64
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,825
I would be grateful if you did.

65
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,798
Your Majesty,

66
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,821
I will leave to inspect the state of Jibgyeong Hall,

67
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,754
so please continue to converse with your grandson.

68
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,545
Of course.

69
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,573
I plan to use the procession as an opportunity

70
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:25,160
to inspect the state of the people outside the capital city.

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,887
I plan to accept their petitions

72
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:31,212
and alleviate their troubles.

73
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:33,811
Please give me permission to do so.

74
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,821
Of course.

75
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:39,257
It is a wise plan.

76
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:41,932
Go ahead.

77
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:50,136
Depart wearing a majestic robe fit for a king.

78
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:55,320
That way, you will earn the trust and obedience of the people.

79
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,607
I understand.

80
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,207
I will take my leave now.

81
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,199
San.

82
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,455
There is something

83
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,750
that I absolutely must tell you.

84
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,601
What was it?

85
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,806
That was…

86
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,084
I have a headache.

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,961
Forget it.

88
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,778
Here.

89
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,234
This token will allow you to command the soldiers of the northern military camp.  (T/N: one of the five military camps in Joseon; in charge of Northern regions)

90
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,743
I hope you will not need it,

91
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:12,482
but keep it with you just in case.

92
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,153
Also, take care

93
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:21,273
and have a safe journey.

94
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:26,396
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,276
As His Majesty has turned down his exalted title,

96
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:01,010
the banquet should be a modest one.

97
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,412
Shall I invite Princess Cheongyeon and Cheongseon?

98
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:05,168
No.

99
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:09,276
There is no need to invite youngsters. They might feel uncomfortable.

100
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,282
It will be enough

101
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:15,146
that the Crown Prince and the people here to attend.

102
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:21,195
What will you prepare, Princess Hwawan?

103
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:27,701
What I prepare is none of your business.

104
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:34,550
After all, I will be the only one that will be preparing food

105
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,960
out of genuine concern for my royal father's

106
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:40,859
health and well-being.

107
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,506
How dare she, a mere princess,

108
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:53,375
walk out like that without paying proper respect to the Queen.

109
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,408
Princess Hwawan is anguished because of

110
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,389
His Majesty's rapidly declining health.

111
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:06,382
I won't take it to heart so please do the same, Princess Hyebin.

112
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,104
Yes, Your Highness.

113
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,459
No one is worried about Father.

114
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,620
The Queen is happy that she will soon become Queen Dowager,

115
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,442
and Princess Hyebin is happy

116
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,250
because her son will take the throne!

117
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:33,312
You are the only one who is truly concerned for His Majesty.

118
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,926
The heavens will be moved by your filial piety.

119
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:40,021
Just you wait.

120
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,779
His Majesty will return to his former vitality.

121
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,059
Just like he used to,

122
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,810
His Majesty will keep his favorite daughter by his side.

123
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,322
Are you sure?

124
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,636
Of course.

125
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,867
Please, shed no more tears.

126
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:21,667
I'll have to cut Princess Hwawan off.

127
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:26,059
She has already fallen out of His Majesty's favor.

128
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,956
Now, the Queen has His Majesty's ear.

129
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,193
Without His Majesty's favor,

130
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:36,687
a mere princess is of no use to me.

131
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:41,377
From henceforth, stop providing Princess Hwawan with funds.

132
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,453
Yes, my lady.

133
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,250
I overspent to satisfy Princess Hwawan's spendthrift ways.

134
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:59,814
My lady, the Left State Councilor has been stripped of his title.

135
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,345
What?

136
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,946
And His Majesty has commanded that the Crown Prince become regent.

137
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:08,045
The Crown Prince has accepted the appointment.

138
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:13,179
So the Crown Prince will ascend the throne?

139
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,781
What do we do now?

140
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,985
Draw near.

141
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:29,953
Yes, that is true, my lady.

142
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,178
A procession to the ancestral graves…

143
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,703
When the sun sets,

144
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:54,511
a storm is bound to come.

145
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:59,481
I know that you are frightened and confused.

146
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:02,095
However, I am still here.

147
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:07,731
Do not worry. I will protect you.

148
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,127
From the senior court ladies to the young apprentice maids,

149
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:15,614
I will protect each and every one of you.

150
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:18,489
Yes, my lady.

151
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,506
The Crown Prince as regent.

152
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:29,216
He has all the duties of the King.

153
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:33,850
So the Crown Prince is leaving on a procession…

154
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,327
He will be going far away

155
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,609
to a place out of His Majesty's sight.

156
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:01,005
You're so lucky, Deok Im. You get to go on the procession.

157
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:04,413
I wish I could go with you on a horse.

158
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,828
Not everyone gets to ride a horse.

159
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,774
It'll be tough to walk all the way there.

160
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:13,906
I don't care. It's been so long since I got to travel outside the palace.

161
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:17,219
I'll get to ride a boat across the river.

162
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:20,363
I'm so excited.

163
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:22,831
I wish I were an attendant maid, too, so I could go along.

164
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,872
Just consider yourself lucky to be serving at the Crown Prince's Palace.

165
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:28,113
You're so calm for someone serving at His Majesty's Palace.

166
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,159
What do you mean?

167
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,808
His Highness has become regent.

168
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,404
So what?

169
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,970
Don't you know what that means?

170
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,797
It means that His Majesty is seriously ill.

171
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:44,313
As soon as His Majesty passes away, you will be thrown out of the palace.

172
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:47,219
So what if I'm thrown out of the palace?

173
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,730
I already have a plan.

174
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:55,231
I'll work for a nobleman.

175
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:59,275
They pay you extra if you've worked in the royal washing department.

176
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:03,963
After I save lots of money,

177
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:09,597
I'm going to buy a house next to Sir Preceptors's and live there forever.

178
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:13,234
Even if you are thrown out, you'll still be a palace maid.

179
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:17,167
As you've sworn to serve the King, you won't ever be allowed to marry.

180
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,314
That's why I only admire Sir Preceptor from afar.

181
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,917
Sir Preceptor has countless admirers,

182
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,103
and I am but one out of many,

183
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:29,367
but I won't ever feel lonely or sad

184
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,392
since I know that it could never be.

185
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:36,395
Don't you think someone could still fall in love with us?

186
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,861
Are you crazy? You'd both be risking your heads.

187
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:46,155
Why are you so quiet today?

188
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,150
What?

189
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,050
Is something the matter?

190
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,265
I'm just wondering

191
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,831
what it feels like

192
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,939
to truly love someone.

193
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,647
Such frivolous emotions are risky for court ladies.

194
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,752
It's best to keep safe.

195
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,357
What is it?

196
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,486
I'm just happy

197
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:12,734
I have all of you as my friends.

198
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:40,734
They're so pretty!

199
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:43,965
Let's go!

200
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,231
Hurry.

201
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,523
Oh my!

202
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,307
They're beautiful!

203
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,864
I've never seen such a sight.

204
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,144
They're such angels.

205
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:05,917
They say that they're fairies

206
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:09,939
that came down to earth from the moon.

207
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,942
Will you stop yawning?

208
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,050
They're all looking at us.

209
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,111
But I stayed up all night packing.

210
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,927
I'm so tired.

211
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:25,189
I thought it would be fun to participate in the procession.

212
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,689
What did I tell you? I told you it would be tiring.

213
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:32,817
They say the temporary palace is in a state of disarray.

214
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:37,183
We'll have to start cleaning as soon as we arrive.

215
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,625
I wonder if His Highness

216
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,097
knows what we're going through for him.

217
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:48,509
What do you think?

218
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,717
I guess not.

219
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,705
Welcome, Your Highness.

220
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:07,005
You must be tired from traveling.

221
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,334
I will prepare your royal meal right away.

222
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,816
It can wait.

223
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:32,122
Deok Im, lie on the bedclothes.

224
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,521
What?

225
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,611
Why would I…

226
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,997
Why would I do that!

227
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:42,216
Hey! It's not what you're thinking.

228
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:45,313
- The floor heating is broken. 
 - Pardon?

229
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:50,019
The temporary palace has been unoccupied for so long

230
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:53,216
that the floor heating isn't working.

231
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:56,483
We can't let His Highness sleep on cold bedding, can we?

232
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,951
Oh!

233
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:01,930
Lie there until the evening so it warms up.

234
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,453
And do not ever fall asleep.

235
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,954
You have to leave before His Highness comes in.

236
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:10,941
Yes, my lady.

237
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,264
Oh my.

238
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:23,627
I can't believe how lucky I am!

239
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:34,925
The silk is so smooth and soft.

240
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,878
I mustn't fall asleep.

241
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,509
I can't…

242
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,283
Why have I not been informed

243
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:24,478
of such an important matter until now?

244
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:29,252
Little girls are being kidnapped

245
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,050
in the name of the royal house!

246
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,666
Apologies for my tardiness, Your Highness.

247
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,429
You're here.

248
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,155
What is going on?

249
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:04,931
His Highness received a petition from the people today.

250
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:09,345
Numerous common folks have made a plea.

251
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:15,214
They say girls have been disappearing for the past twenty years.

252
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:20,717
Their parents claim that they sent their daughters away to the palace

253
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:23,227
so they can work as palace maids.

254
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:26,369
They believed their daughters would become apprentice palace maids,

255
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:29,859
but they disappeared, is that it?

256
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,853
That's right.

257
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,666
How many girls have disappeared?

258
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:38,744
They say that more than a hundred have disappeared over 20 years.

259
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:44,523
If you count the girls whose parents have given up on,

260
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,014
there's probably many more.

261
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:59,586
Your Highness, may I speak?

262
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:04,928
I understand the importance of the matter.

263
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:07,886
However, it would be best

264
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,902
to feign ignorance for now.

265
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,228
What did you just say?

266
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,798
Feign ignorance

267
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,783
for now?

268
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,413
Yes.

269
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:31,136
I wish to speak to Preceptor Hong alone.

270
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:49,052
Please allow me to explain myself.

271
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,611
Go ahead.

272
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:53,745
Although Your Highness is acting as regent,

273
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:56,686
you do not yet have military or judiciary authority.

274
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:01,617
Therefore, you cannot command the military or punish criminals.

275
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:05,311
That authority only belongs to His Majesty.

276
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:10,395
If Your Highness were to encroach on His Majesty's authority,

277
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:13,019
this could become the cause of great trouble.

278
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,672
But you are aware of His Majesty's condition, are you not?

279
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:18,397
He cannot help those people.

280
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:21,430
But the rest of the kingdom does not know this.

281
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:27,963
Your Highness, do not give your enemies a pretext to attack you.

282
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,613
Over a hundred girls have disappeared.

283
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,223
The police and Ministry of Justice must be involved in order to solve the case.

284
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:38,247
And if the kidnappers are caught, they must be punished.

285
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,806
However, Your Highness

286
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:44,195
does not have the authority to issue punishments yet.

287
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,994
So what you are saying

288
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:56,948
is that I should ignore

289
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:59,594
such an atrocious crime?

290
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:04,022
Please wait until you ascend the throne.

291
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,985
So until then,

292
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,477
it doesn't matter how many more girls

293
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,361
disappear or are killed,

294
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:18,331
is that right, Deok Ro?

295
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:22,350
If this kingdom loses you, even more people will suffer.

296
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,533
I disagree!

297
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,723
To be a King who must ignore the resentment of his subjects and

298
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:37,275
the suffering of those who have lost their children…

299
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,384
It would be better not to take the throne.

300
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:47,352
Your Highness, you won't have to wait very long.

301
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:50,761
It could only be a month or even a day.

302
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:52,863
If Your Highness were to take the throne—

303
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,819
Speak no more.

304
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,411
As soon as we return to the palace,

305
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:02,584
I will command the Ministry of Justice and the police to investigate the matter

306
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:04,447
and that's final.

307
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,144
Now leave me.

308
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,075
Yes, Your Highness.

309
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,611
How many more chances must I give,

310
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,900
and how much longer must I wait

311
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:45,230
for you to truly become loyal to me?

312
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:58,742
Your Highness, may we serve you dinner?

313
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:00,923
Not now.

314
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,438
His Highness is distraught about a petition he received.

315
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:15,206
Pardon?

316
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:17,033
It seems that there is a gang

317
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:21,320
that is acting like court ladies and kidnapping little girls.

318
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:35,384
There is no need to arrange bedding tonight—

319
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:41,353
 Your Highness, did you call for me?

320
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,152
No.

321
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,328
Are you not frightened of me?

322
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,008
Frightened of what I could do to you?

323
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,195
You are quite bold.

324
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,796
- Head Guardsman. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,825
Protect this place and let no one inside.

326
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,270
Yes, Your Highness.

327
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,090

(T/N: Haeshi - about 10:00 pm)

328
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:15,734
It is 10 o'clock tonight.

329
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:17,821
Understood.

330
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:28,025
I feel so refreshed!

331
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,074
Who goes there!

332
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,930
Sir Head Guardsman…

333
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,760
Maiden Sung…

334
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,736
When did she get in there?

335
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:17,691
Was I dozing as I stood guard?

336
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,125
This is awful.

337
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,716
Look here! Tell no one of this!

338
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,279
Yes, sir!

339
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:29,373
If His Highness found out, he would have a fit!

340
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:34,231
Should I pack my bags and go back to my hometown?

341
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,956
Then my mother would be...

342
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:40,714
My mother was so happy that I became a military official.

343
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:43,608
What do I tell her?

344
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,516
I must be out of my mind!

345
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:50,373
How could I fall asleep there?

346
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:55,206
 What do you mean we are out of food?

347
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:57,698
 How will we prepare His Highness's breakfast tomorrow?

348
00:33:57,698 --> 00:34:00,591
 We really don't know, my lady.

349
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,416
 We aren't in charge of the ingredients

350
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,700
for His Highness's meals.

351
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,052
That's the job of the royal kitchen.

352
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:11,181
All right. Let me go talk to the court lady of the royal kitchen.

353
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,025
There's no need to trouble yourself, my lady.

354
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,972
The maids of the royal kitchen will not know what to do.

355
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:21,686
We just need to visit the nearest royal administrative office.

356
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,594
For heaven's sake.

357
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:28,184
It's at least a four-hour walk to the nearest administrative office.

358
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:32,088
You should go there yourself.

359
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:37,673
I should go there?

360
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:42,169
I guess I will.

361
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:47,363
They'll give high-quality ingredients since I am a court lady.

362
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,453
Have a safe journey then.

363
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,680
Come with me. There is something we must do.

364
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:10,994
My lady, it seemed like Wol Hye was the senior court lady,

365
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:13,961
and you were her apprentice.

366
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,656
Why are you so scared of her?

367
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:24,522
I'll come with you to the royal administrative office.

368
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,953
All right.

369
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:29,836
Let me get ready for the trip.

370
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:44,140

371
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:47,751
Deok Im.

372
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:49,831
Yes, my lady?

373
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:53,603
I have something to tell you.

374
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:58,906
I think it's about time that you knew.

375
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,260

376
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:06,816
Have you

377
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,158
heard of Gwanghan Palace?

378
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,914
 The palace where the fairies live is called Gwanghan Palace.

379
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,223
Is there really a secret organization of court ladies?

380
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:25,167
So you knew about it?

381
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:29,997
If the Fairy Palace does exist, then who is the leader of the organization?

382
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,533
It is the Head Court Lady.

383
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,150
The Fairy Palace is a scary organization.

384
00:37:37,613 --> 00:37:40,719
At first, it was started to ensure

385
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,331
the survival of the court ladies.

386
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:48,400
But as time passed by, they became more and more obsessed with power.

387
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:54,945
They would even overthrow the king for the safety of the court ladies.

388
00:37:55,574 --> 00:38:01,309
The court ladies say that they choose the king they will serve.

389
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:03,342
That can't be.

390
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:07,519
How could you keep such a horrible secret until now?

391
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:12,698
I didn't have the courage.

392
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:17,369
All of the court ladies of the Fairy Palace are my friends.

393
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,478
They're companions that I've known my entire life.

394
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:28,502
I could not bring myself to betray them.

395
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:32,286
I've kept my silence for years,

396
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:35,292
pretending not to know anything,

397
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:38,705
not to see or hear anything.

398
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,113
Then finally,

399
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:48,719
I was nominated to join their ranks.

400
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:53,856
Now, I too am a member of the Fairy Palace.

401
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:32,728
My lady.

402
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:35,292
Have no worries.

403
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,559
I will find a way.

404
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,995
I will make sure to protect you.

405
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:46,527
First, let's do what we can.

406
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,605
Watch your step!

407
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:12,253
- We're almost there, my lady. 
 - You're right.

408
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:20,160
Are you all right?

409
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,464
I'm sorry.

410
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:32,005
Child, where did you get this?

411
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:34,222
I found it over there.

412
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:45,967
My lady, this is…

413
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:49,178
It's a gunpowder pouch.

414
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:52,206
It is gunpowder for rifles, is it not?

415
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,877
It's useless because it's wet.

416
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:01,333
This is from the Crown Prince's Palace.

417
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,589
It's used by his guardsmen.

418
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,627
Why do you think it's been discarded here?

419
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,625
The temporary palace is over there.

420
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,794
 A royal procession…

421
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:21,783
 You should go there yourself.

422
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:26,731
Deok Im, we are in trouble. We must return immediately!

423
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:27,834
Pardon?

424
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:32,169
Someone discarded this gunpowder and rendered it useless on purpose.

425
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:35,777
Think about it. Why would someone do this?

426
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:37,671
It can't be…

427
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,434
It's treason.

428
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,426
Let's go. We have no time to waste.

429
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:46,100
Wait. We won't make it in time.

430
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,443
It will take at least two hours even if we run as fast as we can.

431
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:51,611
But what else can we do?

432
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,956
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

433
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:01,868
Here you go.

434
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,892
Thanks.

435
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:06,197
What is this?

436
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:09,160
- Pumpkin taffy! It looks delicious! 
 - Pumpkin taffy!

437
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,738
- It's all mine! 
 - It's mine!

438
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:10,859
I was in the wrong, Your Highness.

439
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,150
I will take care of this issue myself.

440
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,567
I am sure that with your help,

441
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:28,488
the children will return to their parents as soon as possible.

442
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:31,197
I will not disappoint you, Your Highness.

443
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,711
Your Highness, that is a signal kite.

444
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,119
That kite means…

445
00:43:57,598 --> 00:44:00,017
"An enemy will attack"

446
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,658
"so face them and fight."

447
00:44:35,562 --> 00:44:38,102
All of our bowstrings have been cut.

448
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:45,228
All of the gunpowder is gone.

449
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,208
The rifles are also gone.

450
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:56,434
Your Highness's bow is safe as I have been keeping it elsewhere.

451
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:58,060
How many arrows do I have left?

452
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,898
There are five arrows.

453
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:02,022
There are fourteen guardsmen.

454
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:05,348
They have twenty-eight soldiers under their command.

455
00:45:05,348 --> 00:45:07,016
That is less than fifty men.

456
00:45:07,016 --> 00:45:08,933
Fifty?

457
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,778
Your Highness, there are hundreds of soldiers guarding you.

458
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:15,882
Have them posted around the palace and shut the palace gates.

459
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:19,557
That way, you need not fear your enemy, whoever that may be.

460
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:22,416
That is only if the enemy comes from the outside,

461
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:27,441
but we do not know whether the enemy comes from without or within.

462
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:30,330
We must not close the palace gates.

463
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:35,334
Also, the hundreds of soldiers outside this temporary palace are of no use to me.

464
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:42,328
The only men I can trust with my life are my guardsmen.

465
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:53,488
This token allows its holder to command the soldiers of the Northern military camp.

466
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:57,845
Bring the soldiers to me as quickly as you can.

467
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:02,822
I will make haste and return as quickly as possible.

468
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:05,792
I'm counting on you.

469
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:29,327
The wind has stopped blowing.

470
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:33,853
Let's go, my lady. We have to run back.

471
00:46:33,853 --> 00:46:36,345
His Highness may not have seen the kite.

472
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:38,033
Okay.

473
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:16,195
My lady!

474
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:18,080
My lady!

475
00:47:19,695 --> 00:47:21,863
Are you all right?

476
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,450
Deok Im, I don't think I can go any farther.

477
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,697
Go on ahead without me and warn His Highness.

478
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,496
- Yes, my lady. 
 - Hurry!

479
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,320
Go! Make haste!

480
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:18,965
Who are you?

481
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,870
I am an attendant maid of the Crown Prince's Palace.

482
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,717
What brings you here?

483
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:29,110
I came to ask His Highness when he would like his meal.

484
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:32,748
What is this?

485
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:37,560
This is the chalice His Highness will use for the ritual at the ancestral graves.

486
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:43,412
Open it.

487
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:55,500
You may enter.

488
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:25,660
Your Highness, I have brought the chalice to be used at the ritual.

489
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:32,209
You are not a handmaid of the Crown Prince's Palace.

490
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:33,861
Who are you?

491
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:50,820
Do you truly wish to die?

492
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,595
Speak.

493
00:50:24,002 --> 00:50:26,236
Who are you working for?

494
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:29,072
Speak!

495
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,032
Who goes there?

496
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,485
Bring your commander out at once!

497
00:51:02,485 --> 00:51:06,090
I have brought a token from the Crown Prince.

498
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,340

499
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,112
Gather together all the men.

500
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:25,764
Yes, sir.

501
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,360
Let us begin the battle!

502
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,300
 Your Highness!

503
00:56:14,393 --> 00:56:17,909
Your Highness! Are you all right?

504
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,550
Your sword is fragile because it is ceremonial.

505
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,133
Please use mine.

506
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:22,934
What will you use?

507
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:28,028
As you know, everything I touch becomes my weapon.

508
00:56:28,731 --> 00:56:30,486
Watch out!

509
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:35,808
Thank you, Your Highness.

510
00:56:54,936 --> 00:56:57,011
Do not move.

511
00:56:57,911 --> 00:56:59,569
This is a rare handgun.

512
00:56:59,569 --> 00:57:04,803
I only saw such a thing once during the visit of a foreign envoy.

513
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,005
Who are you working for?

514
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:12,394
You should know that handgun has no bullets.

515
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:22,323
I see you are from the palace.

516
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:28,544
A person who can command people of the palace, smuggle in weapons,

517
00:57:28,544 --> 00:57:31,831
and raise a private army of over a hundred soldiers…

518
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,120
It won't be hard to figure out who's behind this.

519
00:57:56,809 --> 00:57:58,494
So you've managed to obtain a bowstring.

520
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,915
It took some time. I'm sorry I'm late.

521
00:58:00,915 --> 00:58:03,503
I almost got killed.

522
00:58:58,477 --> 00:59:01,499
 It might already be too late.

523
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:06,550
 I must have already lost him.

524
00:59:16,783 --> 00:59:19,440
Your Highness! Your Highness!

525
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,258
Your Highness!

526
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,583
Your Highness.

527
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,630
Are you all right?

528
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,577
Yes, Your Highness.

529
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:42,998
She signaled with the handgun so even more assassins will come.

530
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:47,628
Form a single line.

531
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:49,323
Yes, Your Highness.

532
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:52,106
Form a single line!

533
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:12,315
Your Highness, will you promise me one thing?

534
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:17,200
When you ascend the throne, please revoke the ban on wines.

535
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,823
I am dying for a drink.

536
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,434
I will bestow a cup of royal wine to you.

537
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,420
If I make it out alive,

538
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:35,278
will you have a drink with me?

539
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:41,723
I am honored, Your Highness.

540
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:47,230
Protect His Highness!

541
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,406
Your Highness, I have brought the soldiers

542
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:27,347
of the Northern military camp as per your command.

543
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,712
Good work.

544
01:03:48,712 --> 01:03:53,210
I'm glad that you didn't come too late.

545
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,234
Go take care of the wounded soldiers.

546
01:03:55,234 --> 01:03:57,511
Yes, Your Highness.

547
01:03:57,511 --> 01:03:59,312
Let's go.

548
01:05:37,189 --> 01:05:41,227
Did you see it, Your Highness? The signal kite I flew?

549
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:45,830
You saw it, right?

550
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,994
I did.

551
01:05:47,994 --> 01:05:49,839
I saw it.

552
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:54,805
I promised that I'd protect you, didn't I?

553
01:05:56,222 --> 01:06:00,417
Your Highness is always busy protecting this kingdom,

554
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:04,398
and I am busy protecting you.

555
01:06:05,784 --> 01:06:08,492
Who do you think is busier?

556
01:06:08,492 --> 01:06:10,626
Would it be you or—

557
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:13,864
Stop talking nonsense and rest.

558
01:06:13,864 --> 01:06:16,080
Right here?

559
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:19,438
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

560
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:22,250
I will protect you.

561
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:28,413
I'm sorry, but I will take a short break.

562
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:31,580
I am very tired.

563
01:06:42,523 --> 01:06:45,139
When I saw that kite,

564
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:49,798
I knew it was you.

565
01:06:54,117 --> 01:06:56,411
It could only be you.

566
01:07:01,135 --> 01:07:06,841
When I thought that I could die, your face came to mind.

567
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:15,103
I prayed to the heavens for one more chance…

568
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,909
to see…

569
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:26,576
your face…

570
01:07:27,928 --> 01:07:29,891
Deok Im.

571
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:50,260

572
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,880
♫  The footprints between the white snow  ♫

573
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:08,730
♫   drawn by dawn  ♫

574
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,980
♫  Though I don’t know where someone was headed  ♫

575
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,950

~ Preview ~

576
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:20,290
 But His Majesty, who must trust me, looks at me with so much suspicion.

577
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:23,670
 The investigator will soon return, and time will tell.

578
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:28,690
 Do you really think I won't do anything for those ten days?

579
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,550
 You... Were you crying?

580
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:32,700
 You weren't hurt, were you?

581
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,140
 There's no time to waste on a lowly palace maid.

582
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,180
 You must return. To your rightful place.

583
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,040
 I can't pretend any longer.

584
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,380
  - If your heart is… in accordance with mine… 
 - Please...

585
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,650
 What I'm saying is… What I feel about you–
