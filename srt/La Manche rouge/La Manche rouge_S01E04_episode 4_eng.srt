1
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,100

2
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,840

3
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,776
You should greet Deok Im.

4
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:37,923
Deok Im went to Grandfather in my place

5
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:42,112
and asked for your forgiveness.

6
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:46,878
I'm a bit busy right now, so let's do it later.

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,010

8
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,157
Such insolence!

9
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:12,922
How dare you gaze upon His Highness's royal face.

10
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:15,025
My apologies, Sir.

11
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,613
Your Highness!

12
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:25,258
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:26,680
I was passing by,

14
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:30,031
and I saw Your Highness drop your fan.

15
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:34,044
I was worried that Your Highness had lost such a valuable fan.

16
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:38,056
It is fortunate that the Royal Preceptor happened to be passing by, Your Highness.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,512
Thank you, Sir Preceptor.

18
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,076
Sir Preceptor?

19
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,344
Miss Palace Maiden...

20
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:59,010
Your Highness, we should be leaving for the royal academy.

21
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,884
It is time to prepare for your studies.

22
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:03,769
I understand.

23
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,131
Which way was it?

24
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:19,211
Brother, aren't you going to say goodbye to your sister?

25
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,413
Mother asked me to relay her message to you.

26
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,672
See you later, Deok Im!

27
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:26,768
Brother, Mother is concerned for you.

28
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:32,177
She wants you to eat properly and get enough sleep.

29
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:36,973
What was that?

30
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,958
Why would he deceive me?

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,047
He was playing with me!

32
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:52,748
- See you later. 
 - Bye.

33
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,804
I can't believe they left just because they are done with their work.

34
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:56,937
Why can't they help us?

35
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,355
Sewing is so hard!

36
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:02,333
Is anything not hard for you?

37
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,256
Hey, we are sitting here to help you. Just for you!

38
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:07,677
Then help me properly.

39
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,576
Don't annoy me. I'm already annoyed enough as it is.

40
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:14,075
The hazing of the sewing house is so scary.

41
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,531
The senior court ladies are such jerks.

42
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:19,678
They force us to do all of their difficult chores.

43
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:21,947
We don't even have enough thread.

44
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,035
This sucks!

45
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,674
Why are you so late? You said you would be here by 5 p.m.

46
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,803
- Let's go stone skipping. 
 - What?

47
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:38,532
I'll help you finish all this even if I have to stay up for three nights straight.

48
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,054
Let's go stone skipping.

49
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,797
Come on.

50
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:44,395
Wait for me!

51
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:54,117
Wow, Deok Im, you're really good at skipping stones.

52
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:01,828
Darn, why can't I do it?

53
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:03,113
Do you have a secret?

54
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,436
Of course, I do.

55
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:10,155
Think of this pond as the face of the person you hate most.

56
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:14,266
You're hitting his face every time the stone skips.

57
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,110
Think about it.

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,045
Would you hit him just once?

59
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:26,381
You would want to slap him at least ten times.

60
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,692
Wham!

61
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:55,231
I waited for three days,

62
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,365
and she hasn't visited even once.

63
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,991
Who are you waiting for, Your Highness?

64
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,835
It's nothing.

65
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,609
Now, tell me.

66
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,165
I have learned of the source of the anonymous letter.

67
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,333
The source of the anonymous letter is…

68
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,501
Forget it. Hold your tongue.

69
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,612
You are empty-handed.

70
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,768
If you found evidence, you would have brought it.

71
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,157
I don't need circumstantial evidence.

72
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:43,402
I can't do anything with that.

73
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:46,074
My apologies, Your Highness.

74
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:52,002
Forget the anonymous letter if you cannot find evidence.

75
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,124
We cannot dwell on the matter indefinitely.

76
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,520
Your Highness, we should not dismiss such an issue lightly.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,653
We must find the scoundrels

78
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,553
who dared to plot against you.

79
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,856
Is the mere anonymous letter

80
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:08,287
more important than my life?

81
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,476
On the day we hunted the tiger,

82
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,568
someone launched an arrow at me.

83
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:30,429
As I hunted the tiger,

84
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:34,084
I was also being hunted by someone.

85
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,226
Do you have any idea

86
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,779
how that feels?

87
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,460
The culprit is among my bodyguards.

88
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,230
Find him.

89
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,129
No matter what.

90
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:24,426
The Queen's Palace has issued the date of the coming-of-age ceremony.

91
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:28,970
You will no longer be apprentices.

92
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,794
You will be official palace maids and 9th level officials.

93
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:38,618
I pray that all of you will

94
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:41,487
be court ladies of the utmost integrity.

95
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,921
 Yes, my lady!

96
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,117
Is something wrong, Deok Im?

97
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,617
Why is your face so gloomy on such a happy occasion?

98
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:10,130
I don't want to be an official palace maid.

99
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,531
Why wouldn't you want that?

100
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,723
Official palace maids are treated so much better than apprentices.

101
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:20,481
I would rather stay in the library as an apprentice.

102
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,854
What is there to like about a dusty library?

103
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:26,090
It is a thankless job no matter how hard you work.

104
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,679
When you serve at the Crown Prince's Palace,

105
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,790
people will treat you with much more respect.

106
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,126
I don't want to go to the Crown Prince's palace!

107
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:35,515
Why not?

108
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,530
Even if I'm there,

109
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,559
I will still be a servant.

110
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,483
What?

111
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:53,695
You'll get a pretty dress, attend the coming-of-age ceremony and become a 9th-level official.

112
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:58,428
Even so, we will still be servants that serve masters.

113
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,655
We can't even object if our masters wrong us.

114
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:06,033
But if we make a mistake, we will be kicked out of the palace.

115
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,411
We will always live in fear

116
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:11,078
as servants.

117
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:16,178
You shouldn't think too much if you're a servant.

118
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:21,226
Yet I keep having frivolous thoughts.

119
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,896
Stop talking nonsense.

120
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:33,484
It's just depressing. Stop it.

121
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:38,926
We are not alone. We can help each other when things go wrong.

122
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:42,281
Don't be scared of becoming an official palace maid.

123
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,958
All right.

124
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:08,441
Thanks for everything, Kitty.

125
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,008
Thanks for keeping me company.

126
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,398
I met a real jerk here,

127
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:18,022
but there were good times as well.

128
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,923
Am I…

129
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,809
the jerk you just mentioned? No way.

130
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,041
Of course not, Your Highness.

131
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,412
Is there anything you would like me to do?

132
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:47,759
To whom does that sack belong?

133
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,712
It belongs to me, Your Highness.

134
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:53,009
I will no longer be working here.

135
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,498
Then where will you be working?

136
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,969
Since I am a palace maid of the Crown Prince's Palace, I will work there.

137
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:03,393
As a master of the palace,

138
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,556
I will still have to see you.

139
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,860
Yes.

140
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,895
I wish to clear the air between us.

141
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,128
I deceived you, even though it was not my intention to do so.

142
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,941
But you must bear no grudge

143
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,853
or create a fuss because of it.

144
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,597
Do you understand?

145
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,618
I have countless responsibilities.

146
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:32,954
Many of them are immediate and of the utmost importance.

147
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:35,865
But because of you... For three days…

148
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:43,110
Anyways, annoy me no further.

149
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,840
It's tiring.

150
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,844
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,270
Liar!

152
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:11,457
Why would he deceive me? He's such a jerk!

153
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,050
You!

154
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,606
Do you not value your life?

155
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,266
I asked you a question.

156
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,065
Y-Your Highness.

157
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:39,113
No words can express my regret!

158
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:44,209
What are you thinking right now?

159
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,603
You can overcome any peril if you're quick to think on your feet.

160
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:51,036
Your Highness, I deserve to die.

161
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,172
However, please spare my life in your infinite mercy!

162
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,592
Why the change of heart?

163
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,126
As if I would really have you executed.

164
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,093
Your Highness.

165
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,220
Your Highness.

166
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,881
Your Highness.

167
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:22,558
Sit.

168
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,504
Your Highness.

169
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:29,387
Come here and sit down.

170
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,651
- Your Highness. 
 - Don't prostrate yourself.

171
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,694
Take a seat over here.

172
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,653
I only have an hour

173
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:06,740
so tell me what you really think

174
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,973
instead of talking ill of me behind my back.

175
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:13,711
Until the clock reads sinsi, 
  (T/N: 3 to 5:00 pm in traditional Korean time)

176
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:18,184
you may think of me as a royal preceptor like before.

177
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:21,427
But I know that you are not.

178
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,094
So how could I treat you like before?

179
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:25,706
You did when you threw the salt.

180
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:29,496
But we could talk ill of the king behind his back...

181
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:32,797
Please have mercy!

182
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,668
Sit.

183
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,968
I give you my word

184
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,249
that I will not get angry before sinsi

185
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,570
so tell me how you really feel.

186
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,768
You may think

187
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:00,609
of me as merely a lowly servant.

188
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,120
However, I will be serving you as my master all my life.

189
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,564
So you mustn't treat me with such contempt and ridicule.

190
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:09,126
Did I ridicule you?

191
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:11,493
You were out of your royal attire and pretended to be working at the Crown Prince Academy…

192
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,169
- And called yourself a Royal Preceptor and what not. 
 - First,

193
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,667
I wasn't wearing those clothes on purpose to deceive you.

194
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,543
I enjoy dressing in humble clothes when I can.

195
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,591
More importantly,

196
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:24,923
no matter how I am dressed,

197
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:29,701
I did not realize a palace maid can be so stupid, failing to recognize my face.

198
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:31,373
Second,

199
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:34,963
I never told you that I was the Royal Preceptor.

200
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:38,011
You jumped to that conclusion on your own.

201
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,467
But you could have corrected me.

202
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,086
Why should I correct the mistake of a lowly palace maid?

203
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,953
In any case, let go of your grudge.

204
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:50,838
I don't want to worry about it. It's tiring.

205
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,587
So

206
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,354
"Hold no grudge for having been deceived,"

207
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,345
"How dare you to resent me when you are a lowly servant?"

208
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:01,389
Did you come here to tell me that?

209
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:06,292
All you had to do was offer me a sincere apology.

210
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,878
But you don't know how to apologize.

211
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,030
So you want me

212
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,609
to learn how to apologize to my inferiors?

213
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,931
Yes. You should learn.

214
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,329
All the people of this kingdom are your inferiors

215
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,000
but also, someday, they will become your subjects.

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,258
Therefore, please learn how to apologize to your inferiors and your subjects.

217
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:30,743
They say a true monarch must learn

218
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:33,846
to recognize his faults and bow his head in contrition.

219
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:38,830
The fact that you do not understand this has been of great disappointment to me.

220
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:11,504
I now understand what you truly think of me.

221
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:17,680
I will forget everything that happened.

222
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:22,512
Nothing ever happened between you and me.

223
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,817
Stay out of my sight from now on.

224
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,713
My lady!

225
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,966
Nonsense!

226
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,266
You belong to the Crown Prince's Palace. How could you not work there? Does that make sense?

227
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:49,028
But I can work somewhere else. I could work at the ceremonial hall or annex palace.

228
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:52,874
If you can't serve at the Crown Prince's Palace, you can't call yourself a palace maid. You're just a lowly servant.

229
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,293
So stop talking nonsense and get to sleep.

230
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,398
 If I were to work at the Crown Prince's Palace,

231
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:15,775
 how can I stay out of His Highness's sight?

232
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,453
 For heaven's sake!

233
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:37,030
His Highness is strict about all things

234
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,511
so you must learn everything thoroughly.

235
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Pay attention to the shade of the ink.

236
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,536
It mustn't be too dark or too light.

237
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,490
It should be exactly this shade.

238
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,943
 Yes, My Lady.

239
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:20,319
Now, try drawing a line.

240
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:36,612
It's all wrong.

241
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,897
How do you expect His Highness to write using such light ink?

242
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:43,941
How frustrating.

243
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:46,138
I'm sorry, My Lady.

244
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,110
You've done a fine job.

245
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,336
Deok Im is great at grinding ink sticks.

246
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:11,351
Her handwriting is impeccable, too.

247
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:13,217
Really?

248
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,963
You're very good indeed.

249
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,092
Wol Hye.

250
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,778
You're in big trouble.

251
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,917
Trouble? What did I do wrong?

252
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:51,228
You're going to be the Crown Prince's personal handmaid.

253
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,559
 Your hair is a mess.

254
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:03,199
 Dock her half a month's wages.

255
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:06,119
 Yes, Your Highness.

256
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,174
 What are you doing?

257
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,631
 My apologies, Your Highness.

258
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,180
 You're late.

259
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,890
 Why can't you be punctual?

260
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,587
 Dock her one month's wages.

261
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,615
 Yes, Your Highness.

262
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:34,769
 My apologies, Your Highness.

263
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,710
 Take those girls to the disciplinary court lady

264
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,160
 and give them twenty lashings.

265
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,460
 Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,663
 Do you think I'm your friend?

267
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:47,407
 How dare you speak to me with such insolence!

268
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,768
What did those palace maids do wrong?

269
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,231
They behaved too familiarly with the Crown Prince.

270
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,095
His Highness despises palace maids with a passion

271
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:00,160
so they all go out of their way

272
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,089
to stay out of his sight.

273
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,777
I can't serve him.

274
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:08,099
Can you help me get out of the assignment?

275
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:14,467
It's too late.

276
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,230
You shouldn't have done such a perfect job grinding the ink stick or writing.

277
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,997
Everyone failed on purpose, you know.

278
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,783
Now, you'll be responsible for filling the Crown Prince's ink water.

279
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:27,051
Make sure the water doesn't drip off the bottle.

280
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,288
It's not that hard.

281
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:31,476
Just stay close by the Crown Prince.

282
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,946
Good luck, Newcomer.

283
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:42,595
I want to go back to the library.

284
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,603
The location of your lesson will be moved by the beginning of next month.

285
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,847
It's taking a bit of time to fix the building.

286
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,622
Tell them to hurry as much as possible.

287
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:55,846
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:57,912
But why do you wish to move to a different building?

289
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,957
Are you displeased with the current location, Jooamroo?

290
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,598
I don't like the library next to it.

291
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,955
You!

292
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,644
Yes, Your Highness.

293
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:20,742
Don't ever touch my desk again.

294
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,756
Yes, Your Highness.

295
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,356
Your Highness.

296
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,055
We have brought your medicine.

297
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:29,061
You may enter.

298
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,646
Can I trouble you for a cup of cold water?

299
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,233
Of course.

300
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:26,290
We found a possible culprit

301
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,780
amongst your bodyguards.

302
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:41,742
What are you doing here?

303
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,828
Just seeing how well you're faring.

304
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:50,861
How are you holding up?

305
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,056
I was scolded for touching the desk.

306
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:54,865
At least he didn't punish you.

307
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:57,508
If you had touched his food, you would get an instant lashing.

308
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,417
Don't even think about tasting it.

309
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,533
That's the job of the eunuch.

310
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:06,830
They didn't give me any instructions and just sent me here!

311
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,496
Will you please help me, Wol Hye?

312
00:26:11,157 --> 00:26:12,424
I'll think about it.

313
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:13,940
You should return.

314
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,440
Hurry back.

315
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:15,338
I've already done that.

316
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:33,192
Take this to the window to dry.

317
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:43,219
What are you doing here?

318
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:47,194
Do you know how distracting you've been?

319
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:51,581
Did you recognize me?

320
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:56,016
Of course, I did. You've been here in the same room.

321
00:29:56,803 --> 00:30:00,337
I would have left had you commanded me to do so.

322
00:30:02,726 --> 00:30:04,749
My apologies, Your Highness.

323
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:06,569
I should not have come here

324
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:09,825
after incurring His Highness's wrath.

325
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,373
I will ask for a new assignment

326
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:12,970
and stay

327
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,600
out of your sight for good.

328
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,611
Return.

329
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,815
Raise your head.

330
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:39,114
My personal handmaid has the right

331
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:41,944
to look straight at me.

332
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,441
That way, you can serve me more quickly.

333
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:50,115
Make sure that this is always full.

334
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:57,848
Your Highness, since I will be assigned to a different area,

335
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:59,279
I will relay your order to the newly assigned maid—

336
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,187
Change your assignment?

337
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,155
By whose command?

338
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:09,583
Can a foot soldier command a general?

339
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,370
I issue the commands,

340
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,899
and you follow them.

341
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,338
You told me to stay out of your sight.

342
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:18,324
I only looked at you today because it was your first day.

343
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:21,915
But if you are always next to me,

344
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:25,009
someday I will see you no more.

345
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:29,168
As you are merely one palace maid out of many

346
00:31:29,168 --> 00:31:31,421
and of no consequence.

347
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:35,903
Just make yourself useful.

348
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,965
Now, bring me some water.

349
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:45,216
Yes, Your Highness.

350
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,220
♫  At the end of a cold winter night  ♫

351
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:04,400
♫  I felt you, as warm as spring ♫

352
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,570
♫  Your warm gaze ♫

353
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,180
♫  Your soft touch ♫

354
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,640
♫  I became your little star ♫

355
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,740
♫  You would take a good look at me ♫

356
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,220
♫  With your eyes ♫

357
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,620
♫  I'm hiding behind the Moon ♫

358
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:39,740
♫  I'll wait until we meet ♫

359
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,850
♫  I'll wait until I shine beautifully again ♫

360
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,300
♫  Just like this ♫

361
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,750
♫  One step at a time ♫

362
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,500
♫  If I get closer to you ♫

363
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,110
♫  Someday ♫

364
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,950
♫  My feelings will reach you ♫

365
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,637
I don't mind the rain,

366
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,303
but I don't have an umbrella.

367
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:46,844
Sir Preceptor.

368
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,378
Miss Maid.

369
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,394
I wanted to apologize to you.

370
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you

371
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,190
that I was the Royal Preceptor.

372
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,369
You don't need to apologize.

373
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,930
I was a fool

374
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,785
to think that someone else was the Royal Preceptor.

375
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:13,365
I wanted to tell you the truth,

376
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:15,620
but I was worried that His Highness

377
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,610
did not wish you to know.

378
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,430
So you knew all along

379
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,428
that I was referring to the Crown Prince.

380
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,582
I was a fool not to notice.

381
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,992
Who else could have roamed

382
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:33,629
the palace so freely while wearing a headband with jade buttons?

383
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:37,064
I wonder why His Highness deceived you.

384
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:41,085
He probably thought it was fun to tease a gullible apprentice palace maid.

385
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:45,024
I realized for the first time that His Highness could be like that.

386
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,243
I should have known

387
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,587
about that side.

388
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,862
Thank you, Sir.

389
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:01,552
I'll walk alone from here on.

390
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:05,574
But it's still quite far away from your quarters.

391
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,992
There will be a lot of people there,

392
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:10,885
and I wish to avoid any misunderstandings.

393
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,527
I see.

394
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,742
Take care, Sir.

395
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,419
Goodbye,

396
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:18,396
Miss Sung.

397
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,486
How did you know my family name?

398
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:25,790
I was going to wait.

399
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,149
I hoped you would

400
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:31,861
personally tell me your name.

401
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,360
I don't think it's a good idea

402
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,130
to see you too often.

403
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,600
Why?

404
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,086
Because you're a palace maid.

405
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,868
You can keep

406
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:54,694
this umbrella.

407
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,110

408
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,550
I can see why everyone

409
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,310
is so enamored with the Royal Preceptor.

410
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,903
You're back, Deok Im.

411
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,633
Sam Wol, are you heading home?

412
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:30,578
Yes.

413
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:31,578
Take this.

414
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,467
It's all right.

415
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,900
Take it

416
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,473
or you'll catch a cold.

417
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:38,426
Thank you.

418
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,475
Bok Yeon.

419
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:20,433
What are you doing here?

420
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,400
It's not Deok Im.

421
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
She doesn't have an umbrella.

422
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,103
You're lucky

423
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:31,223
it's not your friend.

424
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:32,387
What's wrong?

425
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,097
Some apprentice palace maid

426
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:37,953
shared the Royal Preceptor umbrella with him.

427
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:41,187
She even took his umbrella.

428
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:44,140
The Royal Preceptor has always been a kind man,

429
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,350
but he doesn't give his umbrella to just anyone.

430
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,500
Some tart must have coaxed him to give it up.

431
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:55,074
Why couldn't Ok Geum have seen her face clearly?

432
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,928
Just wait until we find her.

433
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:59,273
We'll make her pay!

434
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:05,749
But… why haven't we seen anyone with an umbrella?

435
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,692
Deok Im!

436
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:15,599
Ok Geum said she definitely saw it.

437
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,958
The apprentice palace maids' coming-of-age ceremony draws near.

438
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,190
Every year around this time,

439
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,238
I feel glad…

440
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:54,437
but also sad.

441
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,947
After palace maids have been through the ceremony,

442
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:59,333
we all become one family.

443
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:02,810
Growing our family is a lovely thing,

444
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:06,275
but it's sad seeing these pretty young girls

445
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:10,269
become trapped here in the palace forever.

446
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:16,400
People revere us as though we're from another world.

447
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,196
They call us palace fairies.

448
00:40:19,196 --> 00:40:21,070
Fairies like those in the legends live

449
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,860
in the Moon Palace,

450
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,777
"Gwanghangoog."

451
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,878
They have no idea how sad a place it is.

452
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,716
We have to rely on and protect each other.

453
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:39,059
The only ones we can trust are ourselves.

454
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,871
All of you here must take this to heart.

455
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,748
 Yes, My Lady.

456
00:40:47,784 --> 00:40:50,508
Not sure why I said such frivolous things.

457
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,970
Maybe it's because of the rain tonight.

458
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,961
Let's talk about work.

459
00:40:55,961 --> 00:41:00,576
Of the girls who will become official palace maids, I would like recommendations.

460
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:05,793
We will need new girls to put with His and Her Majesties.

461
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,713
Of course, the Crown Prince's Palace, too.

462
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:12,236
Lady Seo.

463
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,247
Yes?

464
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,339
Yes, my lady.

465
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:27,729
You're Deok Im's teacher, aren't you?

466
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:29,848
I am, My Lady.

467
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:33,895
I remember when I first set eyes on her.

468
00:41:34,538 --> 00:41:37,494
She was always a bold one.

469
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:41,337
She seems bright, meticulous.

470
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:45,427
Perhaps it would be good to place her with the Crown Prince.

471
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:50,890
I-I think… that would be

472
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,673
improper, My Lady.

473
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:53,646
Is that so?

474
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:55,493
She is a reckless child,

475
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,537
unable to stifle her words, good or bad.

476
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:59,161
Put in another way,

477
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:02,260
she's bold and daring, right?

478
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:05,580
The timid sort wouldn't work.

479
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,287
She can't be trembling while attending to her superiors.

480
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,292
I think she's just right,

481
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,836
but you disagree?

482
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:15,427
Still…

483
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:19,650
I cannot let her trouble you with her imprudence, My Lady…

484
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,690
As she is still young, I will continue to teach her.

485
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,963
She comes of age soon, though,

486
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,665
and will have to leave your side.

487
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,433
Still…

488
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:31,110
I must… instruct her further…

489
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:34,130
All right, we'll wait and see.

490
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,836
There's no rush.

491
00:42:35,837 --> 00:42:37,489
No, my lady.

492
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:41,492
But it'll come eventually.

493
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,536
As the Crown Prince is a young man,

494
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:46,839
he'll need a young woman.

495
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,643
Yes, My Lady.

496
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:15,771
My lady!

497
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:19,805
My lady!

498
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:23,210
I'll be going now.

499
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,119
You leave the palace today to visit your family, yes?

500
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,718
Yes, My Lady.

501
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:32,603
Look how you've grown.

502
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:35,078
You're a woman now.

503
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:37,698
Of course, I am. It's almost time for the coming-of-age ceremony.

504
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,758
See you later.

505
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:49,090
What's taking so long?

506
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,860
There they are!

507
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,500
Daddy!

508
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,929
I'm so glad to see you!

509
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,760
Deok Im, I'll see you later!

510
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:57,020
Who are you?

511
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:01,626
It's me, Deok Im.

512
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,801
Don't you recognize me?

513
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,490
Oh! Miss Sung,

514
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,440
the apprentice palace maid?

515
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:13,049
I would like to bow and greet you two properly.

516
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:14,422
May I go inside?

517
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:17,690
What could we have done to earn your bow?

518
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,882
You adopted me as your daughter

519
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:21,727
so I was able to become a palace maid.

520
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:25,135
We were only doing the princess's bidding.

521
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:30,053
We didn't know anything about you…

522
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:37,002
Her Highness, the princess, is asking for you, Miss Palace Maid.

523
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:39,577
Go and see her, Miss.

524
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:50,320
For all...

525
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,140
For adopting me as your daughter,

526
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,666
I am deeply thankful.

527
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:19,380
 Our mother and father

528
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,450
 are both dead.

529
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:24,113
 If you, Your Highness, do not show us mercy,

530
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:27,111
 we will die as well.

531
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:33,579
 I don't care if I die,

532
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:36,194
 but please save my sister.

533
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:38,490
 Our father

534
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,148
 served the Crown Prince with loyalty.

535
00:46:41,148 --> 00:46:43,020
 So please,

536
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,660
 I beg of you, Your Highness!

537
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:00,569
You've come.

538
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:05,225
Princess Hyebin.

539
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:23,028
You're already eighteen.

540
00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:26,750
How time flies.

541
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,189
So will you now become an official palace maid?

542
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:32,642
All because of you, Your Highness.

543
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:35,036
You saved my brother and me.

544
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,858
Someday I will repay your kindness.

545
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,102
Do you truly think so?

546
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,134
Will you repay my favor?

547
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:45,970
How can I not?

548
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,690
You saved my life.

549
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:53,661
Then start now.

550
00:47:54,774 --> 00:47:56,774
I need someone

551
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:59,805
to tell me the doings of the Crown Prince.

552
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:03,511
Are you asking me to spy on the Crown Prince?

553
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:07,240
I need… to know everything

554
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,270
my son is doing.

555
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,391
Your Highness, even if you're his mother,

556
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,039
I cannot spy on the heir of the state.

557
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,592
It's against the law of the palace, and—

558
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,688
The law of the palace.

559
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:25,238
I once strictly adhered to it myself.

560
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:29,931
Everyone in the palace spies on each other.

561
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:34,651
Truly, in the palace, it would be difficult to find a soul that isn't.

562
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,589
But I…

563
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:40,703
just whiled away my time, trapped there,

564
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,735
reading moral treatises,

565
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:45,340
bound by the law of the palace.

566
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:50,709
What is shame?

567
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:53,500
What is

568
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,700
grace?

569
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,930
If only I had

570
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:02,608
planted eyes and ears near my husband,

571
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:06,661
watched him

572
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:08,789
and watched him closely…

573
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:17,565
But what good is it to talk of the dead?

574
00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:20,120
I have to take care…

575
00:49:20,563 --> 00:49:23,329
of my living son.

576
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:30,930
Just tell me everything that happens to him.

577
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,770
Don't leave anything out.

578
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,596
I need to know of everything that concerns my son.

579
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:41,449
- Your Highness. 
 - You and your brother are a traitor's children.

580
00:49:41,866 --> 00:49:45,152
I'm the only reason you're alive.

581
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,450
Someday you would like

582
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,240
to meet your brother again, right?

583
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:53,241
For some time, I will leave the palace

584
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:56,048
and will be resting at a private residence.

585
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:03,659
This is the entrance token.

586
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:05,550
Should anything happen,

587
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,970
leave the palace and report to me.

588
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:15,930
My lady.

589
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,074
Yes.

590
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:19,041
Please say it was well received.

591
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,519
Yes, Court Lady.

592
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,460
The young palace maid

593
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,420
that begged forgiveness for the Crown Prince,

594
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:31,677
is that her?

595
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:33,483
Yes, Your Highness.

596
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:36,886
And she currently serves as his personal handmaid?

597
00:50:36,886 --> 00:50:38,349
Yes, Your Highness.

598
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:47,770
You bitch!

599
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:50,875
Wh-Who are you?

600
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,158
This is Princess Hwawan.

601
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:54,297
Your Highness…

602
00:50:54,297 --> 00:50:57,129
Do you know your mistake?

603
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:00,013
I-I don't know what I've done, Your Highness…

604
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,067
How dare you trespass on the King's Path?

605
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,878
- Pardon me? 
 - I saw it all.

606
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:09,209
I saw your skirts touch the King's exclusive path!

607
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:11,808
But I was nowhere near it.

608
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:14,772
Throwing out childish excuses for a major crime?

609
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:17,051
How dare a young apprentice maid be so impudent?

610
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:20,254
Come on! Drag her away and give her a hundred strokes of flogging!

611
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:21,629
Yes, Your Highness.

612
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,049
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

613
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:26,946
I have done wrong! Your Highness!

614
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:29,357
I have done wrong, Your Highness! Please forgive me!

615
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:31,800
Let go of her!

616
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:48,203
Crown Prince.

617
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:50,190
Royal Aunt.

618
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,618
This maid broke the rules so I was attempting to punish her.

619
00:51:54,618 --> 00:51:56,095
Did you see it first hand?

620
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:58,573
- Of course. 
 - That's odd.

621
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:03,440
I was in the same place, at the same time, and I didn't.

622
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,611
Oh, I see now.

623
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:13,504
Then you are taking her side.

624
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:16,506
Because she serves in your palace?

625
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:21,625
How did you know that she serves in my palace?

626
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,240
Oh...

627
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,920
That is obvious.

628
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,290
If she didn't, why would you intercede on her behalf?

629
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,645
Yes, as you say, Royal Aunt,

630
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:35,754
she serves in my palace.

631
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:41,673
And so, her punishment is not for you to give,

632
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:44,911
but for me as her lord and master.

633
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,622
Come.

634
00:52:54,815 --> 00:52:56,781
Stop right there!

635
00:53:13,183 --> 00:53:14,927
So you think that only you are entitled

636
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:18,133
to punish the attendants of your household?

637
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:19,491
No.

638
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:23,667
There is another person who rules

639
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,813
all the maids of the court.

640
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:45,994
Your Highness, a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace broke the law.

641
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:49,944
The Crown Prince is dead set on protecting his servant.

642
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:54,094
I humbly request that you strictly punish her with a hundred strokes of flogging.

643
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:56,621
Do you not approve of punishment?

644
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:59,038
No, Your Highness.

645
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:01,520
Even if she did touch the King's Path,

646
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,997
your proposed punishment is too severe.

647
00:54:03,997 --> 00:54:07,572
One hundred strokes could kill her.

648
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:09,567
Instead…

649
00:54:10,586 --> 00:54:14,841
would cutting wages for the next six months satisfy you?

650
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:18,689
Were you to show her mercy and tolerance, Princess,

651
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,799
I will support your decision.

652
00:54:24,277 --> 00:54:25,943
What do you say, Crown Prince?

653
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:28,838
As the court ladies fall under your purview, Your Highness,

654
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,359
I will follow your wishes.

655
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:38,727
Mercy and tolerance…

656
00:54:39,663 --> 00:54:44,090
they sound grand, but don't force them on me.

657
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:47,129
Is it so wrong

658
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:52,661
to seek to always preserve the dignity of the King and follow palace rules?

659
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:55,117
I tell you

660
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:59,414
I saw her commit the infraction with my own eyes!

661
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:01,582
To protect the integrity of all court ladies,

662
00:55:01,582 --> 00:55:05,177
she must get a hundred strokes of flogging.

663
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,468
Crown Prince.

664
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:15,689
Yes, Your Highness.

665
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:20,254
You just said that, as I'm in charge of palace affairs,

666
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:22,978
you would follow my wishes.

667
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,940
Princess Hwawan is your aunt.

668
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,462
We can't allow

669
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:33,426
your relationship to become strained over a mere palace maid.

670
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:35,679
As the princess requests,

671
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:39,760
she will be punished.

672
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:45,867
With such a display of decisiveness

673
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:49,553
you are truly a fine head of palace affairs.

674
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:53,190
I'll be going now, Your Highness.

675
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,757
You, Wench. Follow me immediately.

676
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,941
Princess!

677
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:07,179
The maid can be punished at any time.

678
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:09,033
It has been so long since I've seen you,

679
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:13,000
I'll be quite sad to see you go so quickly.

680
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,690
I made honeyed rice cakes. Please try one.

681
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:21,387
Your Highness, I'm a bit busy—

682
00:56:21,387 --> 00:56:24,091
It took me six hours to make them.

683
00:56:24,091 --> 00:56:27,815
You would oblige me greatly by trying one.

684
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:31,389
I won't take no for an answer.

685
00:56:44,993 --> 00:56:49,004
His Majesty the King arrives!

686
00:56:56,245 --> 00:57:00,567
Oh, now, why are you all gathered here?

687
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:11,267
My Queen.

688
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:12,445
Yes, Your Majesty.

689
00:57:12,445 --> 00:57:17,757
Making these for me with your own hands,

690
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:20,486
wasn't it difficult?

691
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:25,589
As it was for you, it seemed no effort at all.

692
00:57:26,678 --> 00:57:28,700
Let's try them.

693
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,900
Please don't eat it, Father!

694
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:39,613
What? The Queen Consort made them with care.

695
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:40,969
So why are you stopping me?

696
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:43,770
They're… poison!

697
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,566
What?

698
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:51,000
Princess! I prepared them myself and tried them…

699
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,436
Poison?

700
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,894
Do you doubt me, Princess?

701
00:57:55,894 --> 00:57:59,667
What are you talking about, Princess?

702
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:03,688
I do not mean that they are poisoned.

703
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:09,234
I mean to say that the entirety of those rice cakes is poison to you, Father.

704
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:12,073
You once suffered from acute indigestion after eating them.

705
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:16,318
Did you forget those three days of torment?

706
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,526
I remember them well.

707
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:22,892
I was so worried that you were seriously ill,

708
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:25,804
I spent those days crying.

709
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,267
More than anyone

710
00:58:31,057 --> 00:58:34,424
I think of your well-being, Father.

711
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:38,340
You're my earth and sky, Father.

712
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,620
Were I to lose you…

713
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:44,392
I would lose everything.

714
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:48,838
No one else would lose a thing.

715
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:55,102
How could they ever understand how I feel?

716
00:58:58,075 --> 00:59:00,208
Well now…

717
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:05,904
if I don't eat it, it will make Queen disappointed.

718
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:11,415
And if I do, my daughter will worry…

719
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:17,517
What do you think, San?

720
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:24,560
What should your grandfather do with this rice cake?

721
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,080
As she spent six hours preparing it…

722
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:46,186
the Queen will surely be disappointed if you don't eat it, Your Majesty.

723
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:54,922
However, as your safety is paramount,

724
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:58,340
not eating it is surely…

725
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,822
for the best.

726
01:00:02,706 --> 01:00:03,818
Yes?

727
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:06,483
The Crown Prince speaks truly.

728
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,513
I apologize, Your Majesty.

729
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:12,281
I should have been more thoughtful.

730
01:00:12,281 --> 01:00:15,725
I only thought of something pleasing to taste,

731
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:19,455
without considering the effect it would have

732
01:00:20,374 --> 01:00:23,018
on your royal constitution.

733
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,120
Wait now.

734
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,050
Her there!

735
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,361
That's her.

736
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:41,753
Sung Deok Im. Right?

737
01:00:41,753 --> 01:00:44,633
Yes, Your Majesty.

738
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:46,501
Why are you here?

739
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:49,474
Your Majesty, as she violated the law,

740
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:52,794
we were discussing her punishment.

741
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:56,777
Her skirts touched your exclusive path, Your Majesty.

742
01:00:56,777 --> 01:00:59,212
Though it is not a serious matter,

743
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:01,887
as the Crown Prince and the Princess were so displeased,

744
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:04,944
I was helping them consider her punishment.

745
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:08,447
Stop worrying over it.

746
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:14,370
There are so many palace maids. It's impossible for you to care for everyone.

747
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:18,785
As she belongs to the Crown Prince's palace,

748
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:22,107
he will decide her punishment.

749
01:01:22,107 --> 01:01:24,233
- Father! 
 - What?

750
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:26,023
If he determines the punishment,

751
01:01:26,023 --> 01:01:29,801
everyone will suspect him of favoritism.

752
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:32,835
That's almost no punishment at all.

753
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:37,635
Then you can watch to make sure he does it right.

754
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:40,865
See if he is too lenient since she's his subject,

755
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:45,981
or if he gives her an objectively fair punishment.

756
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:49,965
- San. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

757
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:54,317
One day you'll be the source

758
01:01:54,317 --> 01:01:57,758
of all justice in the kingdom.

759
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:03,523
So you must punish fairly

760
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:07,335
so that everyone is persuaded.

761
01:02:07,335 --> 01:02:09,923
I will remember, Your Majesty.

762
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:13,078
Try punishing her then!

763
01:02:13,078 --> 01:02:14,824
Let's see

764
01:02:14,824 --> 01:02:19,245
if the punishment you choose strikes your grandpa as fair.

765
01:02:26,883 --> 01:02:31,706
The King would surely never be satisfied

766
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:36,369
if the Crown Prince goes easy on her.

767
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:39,243
As I see it,

768
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:43,700
were a minister to willfully touch the path,

769
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:47,761
they would certainly be killed.

770
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:50,045
But were a commoner to touch the path,

771
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:52,182
they would be sent to prison

772
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:56,339
to be set free again after a period of confinement.

773
01:02:57,195 --> 01:03:00,500
Although an ignorant subject did something wrong,

774
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,164
I cannot take away the god-given life of a subject so easily.

775
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:07,873
That would be my judgment.

776
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:13,960
However, if a palace servant were to set a foot on the king's exclusive path,

777
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:23,086
I would rather not waste my time on something so trivial.

778
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:26,040
Royal Aunt.

779
01:03:26,592 --> 01:03:29,169
If a leaf falls onto the path,

780
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:33,192
palace servants must schedule a time to remove it.

781
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:35,901
If the path freezes over,

782
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:38,142
they'll spread hot ash to melt it

783
01:03:38,142 --> 01:03:40,820
and then remove the ash.

784
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:46,976
If it's slippery, if the King were to slip,

785
01:03:46,976 --> 01:03:49,373
would that not be terrible?

786
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:53,618
Because palace servants are simply our helpers,

787
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:58,764
debating their punishment is beneath us.

788
01:03:58,764 --> 01:04:00,387
Still,

789
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:06,817
as that palace maid appears to have offended my Aunt,

790
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:10,425
I will administer punishment.

791
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:25,845
I will confiscate half a year's pay.

792
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:28,980
How do you find your nephew's judgment?

793
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:38,314
Princess, how about that then?

794
01:04:38,314 --> 01:04:40,840
Father, I…

795
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,786
find the punishment satisfactory.

796
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:49,240
And I hope you, too, are satisfied by his wisdom.

797
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,273
Of course, I am.

798
01:04:52,273 --> 01:04:57,376
He has never once disappointed me!

799
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:00,624
I'm happy that all has turned out well.

800
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:05,810
You! You must be happy to get off lightly!

801
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:11,500
If it had been too severe, I would have had to save you.

802
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,177
What happened today wasn't your fault.

803
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:26,868
I hope you don't dwell on it.

804
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:31,430
- Thank you, Your Highness, for saving— 
 - Today…

805
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,060
it was you who saved me.

806
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,970
I misread His Majesty completely.

807
01:05:39,588 --> 01:05:41,271
If you hadn't have been there,

808
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:45,155
I wouldn't have changed my approach.

809
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:48,871
It could have been bad.

810
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:57,730
A lady is certainly quite meticulous.

811
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:14,631
 A lady is certainly quite meticulous.

812
01:06:14,631 --> 01:06:17,543
Careful, don't mess it up.

813
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:21,014
I'm really trying my best.

814
01:06:22,037 --> 01:06:23,670
Deok Im!

815
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:26,927
What are you thinking about?

816
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:31,900
Am I… meticulous?

817
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,375
In what world?

818
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,605
I've been called meticulous before.

819
01:06:38,605 --> 01:06:42,434
I don't know who it is, but they sure don't know meticulousness.

820
01:06:42,434 --> 01:06:43,810
Look at Young Hee.

821
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:47,144
To help us work better she got us all the same color. That's meticulousness.

822
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:51,774
Anyway, it's a good thing, right? It's a compliment.

823
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,690
Who said it? You really took it to heart.

824
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:57,363
No, I didn't.

825
01:06:57,363 --> 01:07:00,920
I just wondered if he saw me in a positive light.

826
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:09,935
Like Gyeong Hui said, I'm not meticulous at all!

827
01:07:09,935 --> 01:07:13,490
If someone expects it from me, he'll be completely disappointed!

828
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,572
Yes, but who would expect it from you?

829
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:27,492
Court Lady Seo…

830
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:29,702
Liar.

831
01:07:30,601 --> 01:07:33,220
You're acting weird.

832
01:07:39,725 --> 01:07:42,281
Is Sung Deok Im here?

833
01:07:46,698 --> 01:07:49,431
There's a strange rumor going around

834
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:53,224
that the Crown Prince is visiting courtesan houses.

835
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:54,033
Pardon?

836
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:57,850
They say he's visiting with Lord Gwangeun and Lord Heungeun.

837
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,966
Do you know anything about it?

838
01:07:59,966 --> 01:08:01,852
No, Your Highness.

839
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:05,661
But I don't think the Crown Prince would ever do…

840
01:08:06,856 --> 01:08:10,879
Do you think it's just idle talk?

841
01:08:11,698 --> 01:08:13,631
I do not know, Your Highness.

842
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,809
I'm just a lowly servant,

843
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:18,719
how dare I make predictions about His Highness?

844
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,501
Look into it.

845
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:29,342
Yes, Your Highness.

846
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:53,028
Welcome back, Sir!

847
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,313
Leave us.

848
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:05,787
Sir Preceptor?

849
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:09,640
Where is His Highness the Crown Prince?

850
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,878
Who are these people?

851
01:11:15,533 --> 01:11:18,755
You don't know anything but came all the way here?

852
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:19,999
Pardon?

853
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:23,585
Whether you know anything or not,

854
01:11:23,585 --> 01:11:25,990
there's really only one thing for me to do.

855
01:11:31,777 --> 01:11:33,099
Kill her.

856
01:11:33,099 --> 01:11:34,744
Yes, Sir!

857
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:39,010
Stop!

858
01:11:53,110 --> 01:12:00,050

859
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:08,570
♫  The tranquil air fills up the warmth in here  ♫

860
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:14,970
♫  As if this is the fate  ♫

861
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,939

~ Preview ~

862
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:20,258
 You're no longer the Crown Prince's palace maid.

863
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:22,158
 Leave the palace tomorrow.

864
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,821
 If you get pulled, you get closer. If you are pushed, you go away.

865
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:27,612
 That's the life of a palace maid.

866
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:32,494
 It seems like the Crown Prince could replace me.

867
01:12:32,494 --> 01:12:37,271
 I will depose the Crown Prince and put another in his place.

868
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:39,904
 We've won this round.

869
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:44,312
 Until the boy becomes king, we must avoid troublesome accidents.

870
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:46,697
 Did you fall for me,

871
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:51,520
 or did I fall for you?

872
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,340
♫  Without any hesitation  ♫
