1
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,900

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,570

3
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,910

4
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:42,928
I've missed you so much,

5
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,825
Deok Im.

6
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,706
Will you be mine if I command so?

7
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:26,466
I shall… if you command so.

8
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:29,276
Would that be what you wish?

9
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,328
Perhaps.

10
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,209
Perhaps that is what I desire.

11
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:41,290
But even more than that,

12
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,600
I hope to keep my place.

13
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,403
That is the answer I expected.

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,519
Her Highness the Queen Dowager is waiting.

15
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:43,100
I didn't expect your visit at such a late hour.

16
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,896
There is something I wish to discuss with Your Highness.

17
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:50,125
Is it that urgent?

18
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,512
I am but a concubine of His Majesty.

19
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,950
Without a child,

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,420
there will be no purpose for me.

21
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:05,430
And I will be miserably abandoned.

22
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:13,011
Your Highness is the only one who can offer me help.

23
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,760
I beg of you.

24
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,190
Have pity on me.

25
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:36,940
 It pains my heart…

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
 when you cry.

27
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,322
 So much so that I can't bear it.

28
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,842
 I've missed you so much...

29
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,275
Deok Im.

30
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,934
Brother.

31
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,690

32
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,702
Don't you have a better way to spend your vacation than spend time with me?

33
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:22,223
What are you talking about? This is what I most wanted to do.

34
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:31,522
Here.

35
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,420
What's this?

36
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,090
I passed the examination.

37
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,410
I will be serving at the Royal Artillery.

38
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,230
You'll be a soldier, just like our father was.

39
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,541
It's all thanks to you.

40
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:50,417
Thank you, Deok Im.

41
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:58,481
And you have my thanks, too.

42
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:02,114
I have long waited for a day like this.

43
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,307
Is there anything else you want?

44
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,684
Take a look at these.

45
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,820
Well then…

46
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,536
No. How about this one?

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,490
 Your Majesty.

48
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,430
A message has arrived from Queen Dowager.

49
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:29,995
Her brother, Kim Ki Ju, has fallen ill.

50
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:36,498
This message is from your royal elder and seems to express her desperate plea.

51
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:41,317
Wouldn't it be wise to release Kim Ki Ju from exile?

52
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:47,014
For this, I shall pay Queen Dowager a visit myself

53
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,485
and deliver my answer.

54
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:53,700
Your Majesty, please let us know of your intention.

55
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,900
Do you intend to ignore

56
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,582
the request from Queen Dowager?

57
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:07,695
You must serve Queen Dowager well and do your duties as a grandson.

58
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:09,434
Assistant Counselor.

59
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,478
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,942
Do you know of the saying,

61
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:21,961
"Bulgageun, bulgawon."

62
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:29,202
"One should not draw too close, nor stray too far from another."

63
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:37,714
I hope you understand why I speak of this.

64
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:43,317
I will be disappointed if you don't.

65
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,156
Let us discuss our next agenda.

66
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:06,451
There are things in this world that are not easily reversed.

67
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:12,607
One's feelings. When they are hurt, it's hard to undo what's been done.

68
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,302
Your Majesty,

69
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:20,386
if my brother dies, I will hold a grudge against you.

70
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:28,876
I will send the royal doctor to tend to Kim Ki Ju's illness.

71
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:34,800
Could you not have trust in me for even once?

72
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,204
I gave my trust to Hong Deok Ro.

73
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:42,802
I knew well how it was going to turn out,

74
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:46,933
but I really wanted to put my trust in him.

75
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:51,233
And I will not let myself make the same mistake again.

76
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:58,105
Your brother is the leader of the Noron faction.
  (T/N: the conservative political faction)

77
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:04,263
If he were to return, it would jeopardize the political balance I wish to achieve.

78
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:09,378
And I cannot let that happen.

79
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:14,889
I hope nothing happens to my brother.

80
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,727
That is what I sincerely hope for.

81
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:24,628
For myself, and for Your Majesty, as well.

82
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,977
Visit Concubine Hwabin at 8 o'clock tonight.

83
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,420
This is not for your sake,

84
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,300
but for someone else's.

85
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,619
It is someone that I cherished once,

86
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:50,323
someone I still cherish until now.

87
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:58,384
 The King finally spoke,

88
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:03,814
 "If Pyeong Guk were a woman, how would he have fought so valiantly on the battlefield?"

89
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:09,517
"But Pyeong Guk's skin is fair and the figure is slender, "

90
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:14,117
- "...it is a bit suspicious." 
 - Why won't you serve me?

91
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,902
Why is that

92
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:24,434
I could not take you away from His Majesty?

93
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:28,320
But if it's Concubine Hwabin…

94
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,832
Will you serve me, Deok Im?

95
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:42,006
Pledge your loyalty to me as you did to His Majesty.

96
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:46,397
I will become a better mistress than Hwabin.

97
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:48,783
I am sorry, Your Highness.

98
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:53,132
My answer remains the same.

99
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:15,198
In the past, my intention was to use you

100
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,387
for you have the favor of His Majesty.

101
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:23,840
So I wanted to have you by my side.

102
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:29,104
You probably knew that, too.

103
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,410
But it's different now.

104
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:40,800
You are enough as you are.

105
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,230
All I want is…

106
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:47,724
a friend like you to be by my side

107
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,418
in my long, lonely palace life.

108
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,018
To be a friend of yours is an honor too lofty for me.

109
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,696
Please forgive my refusal.

110
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,620
I take it

111
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,910
that you do not wish so.

112
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,027
My apologies.

113
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,743
That's a shame.

114
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:24,330
I've always enjoyed your reading.

115
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,227
It is a shame, indeed.

116
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,685
What are you doing?

117
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,448
Why are you doing this?

118
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,595
We're only doing what we were commanded to do.

119
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,893
Commanded? By whom?

120
00:11:57,094 --> 00:12:00,997
Your Highness the Concubine Hwabin, why are you doing this to me?

121
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,794
I am an official palace maid.

122
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:08,075
If you find me guilty in any way, you would have to refer me

123
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,909
to the disciplinary court lady.

124
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:14,011
You will have a chance to explain later.

125
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,932
- Follow me. 
  - Yes, Your Highness.

126
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:30,011
Why don't you visit the Royal Academy personally?

127
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,049
It will help ease objections and encourage the scholars.

128
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,412
You may also find the right candidate to serve at the Royal Library.

129
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:41,907
My schedule is quite full, but I will consider it.

130
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,289
Your Majesty.

131
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,429
Your Majesty.

132
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:08,424
Your Majesty? It is 8 o'clock.

133
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:17,230
You commanded us to remind you.

134
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:23,682
I have a lot to do, indeed.

135
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,482
My apologies, Your Majesty.

136
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:49,794
I did not expect your visit and failed to make suitable preparations.

137
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:54,135
I came without notice. You need not apologize.

138
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:59,730
Your Majesty... Actually, Queen Dowager is inside.

139
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:04,136
Queen Dowager?

140
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,605
Welcome, Your Majesty.

141
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,396
Why is Sung Deok Im kneeling like that?

142
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,629
Is this an interrogation?

143
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:40,533
Yes, and we are about to begin.

144
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,129
What crime is she accused of?

145
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:56,330
It was reported that she has committed adultery.

146
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,732
Is there any evidence?

147
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:05,888
You will need evidence for such an accusation.

148
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:08,123
- Hwabin. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,520
Show him the evidence.

150
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,011
Yes.

151
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:47,310
Is it true that you received this from an officer at the Royal Artillery?

152
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,428
Yes, it is true.

153
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:55,207
Sung Deok Im has met with this man regularly.

154
00:15:56,085 --> 00:16:01,007
She would give him food and medicine that she received at the palace.

155
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:06,318
And on holidays, she would meet him alone.

156
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,400
Is that true?

157
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,175
It is.

158
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:15,921
So you acknowledge seeing an army officer in privacy?

159
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,017
I do.

160
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,204
And you've exchanged presents and letters.

161
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:23,327
We have.

162
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:27,910
A court lady who has an affair with any man but the king,

163
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,307
is punishable by death.

164
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,125
Your Highness!

165
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,500
What is it, Your Majesty?

166
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,519
Is there anything you would like to add?

167
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:47,515
I have something to discuss with him alone. Step outside for a moment.

168
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:49,127
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Yes, Your Highenss...

169
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:18,400
Your Majesty, I remember I once told you

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,898
that there is nothing wrong in desiring something.

171
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:26,320
As King, you may desire anything.

172
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,810
Ask for this grandma's help and claim what you desire.

173
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,191
Isn't there something that you so desperately desire?

174
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,230
Adultery?

175
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,609
Deok Im is under interrogation for adultery?

176
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,301
What do we do, my lady?

177
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,784
Concubine Hwabin must have framed her.

178
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:00,890
An affair with whom?

179
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,467
It's some army officer that just passed the exam.

180
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,593
An officer?

181
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:06,721
I heard there is evidence for it.

182
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:11,151
- And they say that guy paid for the exam with the money Deok Im made by transcribing books. 
 - What?

183
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:14,170
But that is nothing but a rumor.

184
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,925
The man who passed the exam with her help?

185
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:26,510
I-I have to go and talk to someone.

186
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,604
Who are you talking to? Is it His Majesty?

187
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,918
What will you do?

188
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:40,796
Will you take the hand that I offer you?

189
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,840
I won't.

190
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,525
I could let my emotions guide me to act against the law and save her.

191
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,505
- But I would be dishonoring all court ladies. 
 - How so?

192
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:01,729
Those court ladies that are lofty and live in chastity,

193
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:06,332
those devote their entire lives to the royal family.

194
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:12,730
I cannot become a dishonorable king to them.

195
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,760
You are indeed virtuous.

196
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,290
What a great king you are.

197
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:23,800
But you should also remember

198
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:29,005
women do not like cold-hearted men.

199
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:33,124
I thought you had quite some feelings for her.

200
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,491
But now you will watch her die?

201
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:40,880
I do not believe that she has committed adultery.

202
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,615
She is not the sort!

203
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,213
How naïve are you

204
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:53,260
to believe that hundreds of court ladies will all be faithful to you.

205
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,238
Perhaps,

206
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,380
she could have held feelings for another man.

207
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,680
Even a king does not have control of what one desires at heart.

208
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,418
So you would tolerate her harboring affection for another man?

209
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,632
Well, I beg to differ.

210
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,433
For me, loyalty is a top priority.

211
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:26,215
Even if I like her, if she can't be mine,

212
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:28,816
I would rather destroy her

213
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,721
for getting on my nerves.

214
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:36,307
I understand your intention.

215
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:41,621
Even a king of one nation cannot save a mere court lady.

216
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:47,800
Then, you can sit and watch as she dies.

217
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:58,477
Bring in Sund Deok Im!

218
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,940
 Yes, Your Highness.

219
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:18,127
Mother.

220
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:32,700
Lady Hyegyeong, what brings you here? 
  (T/N: after King Jeongjo took the throne, her title changed from Princess Hyebin to Lady Hyegyeong)

221
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,215
I heard there is a misunderstanding.

222
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:37,599
A misunderstanding?

223
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,524
I heard Deok Im is accused of adultery.

224
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,804
Concubine Hwabin reported it.

225
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,714
And she did not deny it.

226
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:48,119
She didn't?

227
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,016
She is merely being a good sister.

228
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,210
Sister?

229
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,518
Do you know who the officer is that she has allegedly been seeing?

230
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,430
He is her brother.

231
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,541
Brother?

232
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:10,018
That cannot be true. Not according to what I've discovered.

233
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:14,602
The name of the officer is Sung Sik.

234
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:19,209
His last name may be Sung, but they do not share lineage.

235
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,007
Hwabin,

236
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,590
that is because this girl has been adopted by a servant of mine.

237
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,560
Adopted?

238
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,638
Your Highness,

239
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:37,799
Deok Im's father was a royal guard at service of Prince Sado.

240
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:43,140
When Prince Sado died, all of his royal guards were executed.

241
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,940
That's when I rescued her and made her a palace maid.

242
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:53,033
Sung Sik is indeed a blood brother of Sung Deok Im.

243
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:04,527
He was your brother?

244
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,088
Not knowing that, I…

245
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,321
Why did you not tell the truth?

246
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:16,540
You could've said so.

247
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,308
Isn't it obvious, Your Majesty?

248
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,480
If she were to reveal the fact that he is her biological brother,

249
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,322
she must first reveal that they are children of a traitor.

250
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:33,333
Then her brother would lose his position. That's why she couldn't say anything.

251
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:37,633
Your Highness, this does not change anything.

252
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,402
Please go ahead and punish Sung Deok Im.

253
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:45,908
Although she has not committed adultery, she is the daughter of a traitor.

254
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,325
Prince Sado was a sinner.

255
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:58,716
- Sung Deok Im is a daughter of a traitor that served a sinner. Please behead— 
 - I am!

256
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:10,913
I am the son of Prince Sado.

257
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,460
My apologies, Your Majesty.

258
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,570
I did not intend to insult you.

259
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,921
Do you agree with Hwabin, Your Highness?

260
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:31,918
Will you claim me an illegitimate king

261
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:36,541
because I'm the son of Prince Sado?

262
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,410
No.

263
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,200
Do not get me wrong.

264
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:49,910
That's a relief.

265
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,105
If you really thought so,

266
00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:02,110
that could have caused a lot of trouble for me.

267
00:25:05,077 --> 00:25:11,538
Did you say that you would rather destroy her if she doesn't become yours?

268
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:16,423
I don't think that will be possible.

269
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:21,699
I will not let that happen.

270
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:39,160
- Court Lady Seo. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,259
Court Lady Sung will not be serving Concubine Hwabin anymore.

272
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:43,415
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,777
Have her join me in my bedroom tonight.

274
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,501
Yes… What?

275
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,507
I won't say it twice.

276
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,992
As you command, Your Majesty!

277
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:55,300
Wow. Wow!

278
00:25:58,216 --> 00:26:00,825
You need not worry about your brother.

279
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:05,019
He will not lose his position or suffer penalties.

280
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,110
I give you my word.

281
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:11,579
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

282
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,320
How am I to return this favor?

283
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:20,325
Deok Im.

284
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:25,235
You once saved the King's life when you found the secret document.

285
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:28,493
I have never forgotten about that.

286
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,210
I should be the one to thank you.

287
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:59,511
Your Highness.

288
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:05,018
I hope I won't ever have to see you again.

289
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:25,322
My lady, you must have worried.

290
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:31,535
You don't have to worry. Everything is fine.

291
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,315
Deok Im…

292
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,446
you have to come with me.

293
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,919
Sorry?

294
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:45,107
What is it?

295
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,507
Where are we going?

296
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:52,293
Won't you tell me what it is?

297
00:27:58,168 --> 00:28:04,324
Deok Im… His Majesty has made up his mind.

298
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:11,724
A court lady must obey.

299
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,650

300
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:10,890
You… are a palace maid.

301
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:14,540
You have to do…

302
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,090
whatever His Majesty wants.

303
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:37,316
 Your Majesty, Sung Deok Im is here.

304
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:40,207
Let her in.

305
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,717
Draw near.

306
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,903
Would you like a drink?

307
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:16,598
Are you upset about what happened today?

308
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:23,928
Are you trying to punish me as you said before?

309
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:28,994
You said you would punish me by undoing my blouse.

310
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:33,190
If I don't officially become a concubine even after you bed me,

311
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,999
I will be left pathetic and helpless for the rest of my life.

312
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:46,002
And you know that such an end would be harsher punishment for me than death.

313
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,529
Is this the punishment?

314
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:55,592
Now, this is more like you.

315
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:58,503
Talking back to the King.

316
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:06,918
You were scared to death back at the Concubine Hwabin's chamber.

317
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,310
When you were falsely accused of stealing the Yeo Beom,

318
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:21,806
you spoke with confidence in front of the former king.

319
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,960
But today…

320
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,060
you were only trembling.

321
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,920
I thought about the reason why.

322
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,721
Is your brother so precious to you?

323
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:45,243
Were you scared you would cause him harm?

324
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:51,680
To you,

325
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,000
your brother must be more precious than me.

326
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:03,310
Just as your friends are to you.

327
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:10,092
Deok Im…

328
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:16,834
I have lost you many times.

329
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,891
It pained my heart every time,

330
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:26,606
but I couldn't say anything.

331
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,414
And I will not do the same.

332
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:35,931
I will never lose you again.

333
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,704
Even if you do not love me,

334
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,340
you are mine.

335
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:11,805
Don't… shed tears alone in my absence.

336
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:19,880
Do not let anyone else hurt you.

337
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:24,382
You will regret this before daybreak.

338
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:30,505
You will regret doing this and then forget about it.

339
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:34,596
While you can simply forget,

340
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:40,186
I will lose everything I have.

341
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:57,410
I once made a promise to you

342
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,508
that I would protect you until you ascended the throne.

343
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:08,120
I kept that promise and did my absolute best.

344
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,819
And I have nothing more to give you.

345
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,703
Please, let go of me.

346
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,700
Let me go.

347
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,540
Can you…

348
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,920
live without ever seeing me again?

349
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,140
If you indeed

350
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,500
refuse me tonight,

351
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,295
I will let you go,

352
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:57,608
and I will never see you again.

353
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,126
Today will be our last encounter.

354
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:09,930
I love you.

355
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:15,719
I don't care if you don't love me back.

356
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:20,180
I don't care…

357
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,090
how you feel about me,

358
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,240
be it loyalty

359
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,710
or pity…

360
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:38,517
as long as you're by my side.

361
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,417
Please answer me,

362
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:50,527
should I let go of your hand?

363
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,823
Tell me…

364
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,230
Deok Im.

365
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,930

366
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,207
I never expected he would do this.

367
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,599
- He would always keep a distance from the palace maid— 
 - Hush!

368
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,415
There is a meeting scheduled soon.

369
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,300
Lord Head Eunuch, take a look inside.

370
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,909
Stop with all that. How could you be so dull?

371
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:47,601
I'm not dull. I only mean to let him know the hour.

372
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,616
I will take a look.

373
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:52,076
But, my lady?

374
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,980
- Court Lady Seo. 
 - Yes.

375
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,305
His Majesty is not a child anymore.

376
00:38:57,305 --> 00:39:01,803
His bedding a palace maid is something that can happen at any time.

377
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:04,986
It's nothing to make a fuss over.

378
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,466
Understood.

379
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,916
The bell.

380
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:15,334
Court Lady Gwon, didn't you say you would take a look inside?

381
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,302
- You just said you would go inside. 
 - Hush.

382
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,740
Court Lady Gwon?

383
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:58,391
Is Deok Im not back yet?

384
00:40:58,391 --> 00:40:59,856
No.

385
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,219
Where has she gone? She worries us again.

386
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:13,626
What are they up to?

387
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:16,206
Let me hear what they're saying.

388
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:22,490
- They are close to Deok Im, right? 
 - Yes.

389
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,559
How lucky are they?

390
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,730
- I know, right? 
 - What is going on?

391
00:41:38,106 --> 00:41:42,310
Guys, pinch me so I know this isn't a dream.

392
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,734
What's up?

393
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:54,830
Deok Im

394
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,900
has been bedded by His Majesty.

395
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,508
What?

396
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:34,560
Do we… call you Your Highness?

397
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,728
Shouldn't we? Your Highness?

398
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,488
I don't want to.

399
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:46,820
Is this a good thing?

400
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:50,085
Or is it bad?

401
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:53,574
That's not what's important here.

402
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:57,311
It already happened and cannot be undone.

403
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,292
I know, too.

404
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:07,313
Hey. How was it?

405
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:13,628
Is it the same as in pornography?

406
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:18,307
Hey! Let me just talk!

407
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:23,694
Deok Im, you listen carefully to what I say.

408
00:43:23,694 --> 00:43:27,221
You getting bedded is not the end. You have to be alert.

409
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,312
What is this? What do you mean by that?

410
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:33,724
Don't ever truly love him.

411
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,919
Men are uncontrollable. A king, even more so.

412
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:41,126
Too much attachment will only hurt you.

413
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:45,776
Just do as little as you can without losing his favor.

414
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:50,340
Pretend to love him if you need to. But don't actually fall in love.

415
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:54,110
Gyeong Hee, you're indeed so smart.

416
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,487
What's with that face?

417
00:43:56,487 --> 00:44:00,814
Are you already in love with him?

418
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:06,517
What do you think? Do I look like I am?

419
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:12,016
But one thing is certain.

420
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,509
I may be in love with him,

421
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,880
but I will never let him know that.

422
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:24,584
- Why? 
 - It's just an act of bravado.

423
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:28,480
And it's the only thing I can choose to do now.

424
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:32,130
Without that,

425
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,690
I think it will be painful.

426
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:47,730
Deok Im, life is full of things you cannot control.

427
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:51,703
I didn't want to be a court lady at first,

428
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:57,809
but my family would have starved to death if I had not become one.

429
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:03,513
If you cannot avoid it, then accept it.

430
00:45:03,513 --> 00:45:09,810
Try your absolute best, and you might end up with a bit of happiness.

431
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,915
 Here comes the Queen Dowager.

432
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:44,699
I sent someone to Concubine Hwabin this morning

433
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:48,290
to inform that Sung Deok Im will be serving me.

434
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,800
But I was late.

435
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,060
I didn't know you had taken her

436
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,091
and bedded her.

437
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,216
That is true.

438
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:05,904
Are you happy to have snatched away what I want?

439
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,915
What becomes of Hwabin?

440
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:13,202
What will happen to Chief State Councilor that was sponsoring her?

441
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:16,369
Will Court Lady Sung be given your absolute favor,

442
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:18,853
or will you have another new concubine?

443
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:20,749
What do you want to hear from me?

444
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:22,714
Everyone…

445
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,328
waits for you to speak

446
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:30,605
and look where your gaze lingers.

447
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:36,605
You may have put her in danger.

448
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:41,913
I put her by my side to protect her.

449
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:44,517
Is that so?

450
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:49,231
It didn't seem that she wanted to be a concubine.

451
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,411
I think it was you that she was afraid of.

452
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:04,800
Perhaps she wanted to run away from you and failed to do so.

453
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:20,770
Court Lady Seo,

454
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,810
what's with the long face?

455
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:28,193
Aren't you happy that one of your pupils was bedded by His Majesty?

456
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:35,535
That... I know that you are a nice person.

457
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,804
But you're not so observant.

458
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,997
What have I done wrong?

459
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,013
I think I'm quite observant.

460
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:50,080
Maiden Sung is a good person.

461
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,215
It's good that she's by His Majesty's side.

462
00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:01,208
After Lord Hong passed away, His Majesty mourned greatly.

463
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:05,517
He did not say so, but he was lonely.

464
00:48:05,517 --> 00:48:11,599
And it is a good thing indeed that he has someone by his side.

465
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,397
Sure. Good for His Majesty.

466
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:19,704
And of course, for Maiden Sung, as well.

467
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:24,250
He is indeed a good king, isn't he?

468
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:30,520
But a good king might not be the best husband.

469
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,071
What?

470
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,870
Oh, that could be.

471
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:58,029
Can you… be doing this with us when you are a court lady bedded by His Majesty?

472
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:00,950
Why not? I have nothing else to do.

473
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,716
Is it really okay?

474
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:04,910
Yes, it is.

475
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:10,660
Why are you making fortune strainers so early? 
  (T/N: fortune strainers, or strainers of blessings, are considered to bring in good fortunes)

476
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,802
I'm going to make a bunch of them and sell them later.

477
00:49:14,802 --> 00:49:19,311
It was better when I was helping you with book transcription. We made quite a sum of money.

478
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:23,216
I'm going to continue doing the transcribing job.

479
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:24,610
Why not?

480
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:30,330
Don't. People will think you're dishonoring him doing lowly work.

481
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:40,819
Kyung Hee!

482
00:49:46,388 --> 00:49:49,187
- Did you fight someone? 
 - Yes.

483
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:52,069
You called some other girls ugly and annoying again?

484
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,297
I did. And that was true anyway.

485
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:56,670
For what?

486
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,440
They were talking trash about you when they know nothing.

487
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,817
They were saying you've been doing things to get bedded by His Majesty, saying you did everything to win his favor.

488
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:10,012
Forget it. I will keep it to myself. Unspeakable things.

489
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:13,390
I don't care.

490
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:17,217
Why do you not care?

491
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:20,211
It's good enough that you got upset for me.

492
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:23,806
I don't care what others say about me.

493
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:25,902
How can you be so calm?

494
00:50:25,902 --> 00:50:30,925
Why hasn't His Majesty visited you? It's been ten days already.

495
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,810
They say what he did that night was a mistake.

496
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,319
Perhaps it was.

497
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,250
He'll visit you soon.

498
00:50:46,312 --> 00:50:49,030
I am sure of it.

499
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:52,010
She's right. He will.

500
00:50:55,223 --> 00:51:00,870
Hey, if Kyung Hee is like this, I think those girls would be dead. They won't be able to walk.

501
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,004
You beat them good, right?

502
00:51:17,597 --> 00:51:21,482
Why are you so late? His Majesty has been waiting for you.

503
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:24,118
It's been an hour.

504
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,504
What's with that face?

505
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:32,159
Well… I've been stuck in a room for ten days

506
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,524
just waiting for him to come.

507
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:38,242
It's the King we're talking about here.

508
00:51:40,905 --> 00:51:43,880
And what happened to your dress?

509
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,520
Why do you have to be so clumsy, Court Lady Sung? Oh dear, Court Lady Sung...

510
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:56,189
Court Lady Sung. His Majesty has been waiting for you.

511
00:51:56,189 --> 00:51:59,723
Take good care of him.

512
00:52:00,696 --> 00:52:03,706
I shall leave now.

513
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,009
You put your hair up, I see. 
  (T/N: married women wear their hair up in a low knot or bun)

514
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,485
Yes, I did.

515
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:41,040
Where have you been?

516
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,040
I spent some time with my friends.

517
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,388
It was my first time going out today.

518
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:50,750
Did I say anything?

519
00:52:51,895 --> 00:52:53,980
What brings you here today?

520
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,201
Why do you ask? Can't I come here?

521
00:52:57,201 --> 00:53:02,624
You certainly can. This annex belongs to you.

522
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:05,417
This is your residence now.

523
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:08,760
And I came to see you.

524
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:12,929
Why are you looking at me like that?

525
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,810
I am just looking at you.

526
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:26,750
Will you refuse me tonight?

527
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,650
If I do, will you let go of me?

528
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,160
No.

529
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:01,950
I've missed you.

530
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:09,220
I thought you didn't visit me because you regretted that night.

531
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,012
I should have come sooner

532
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:16,040
if I had known you were having a silly thought.

533
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:29,110
I thought… that you would need some time alone.

534
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:35,280
Do you hate me for what I did?

535
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,213
No.

536
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:40,860
I've also missed Your Majesty.

537
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:43,698
Is that true?

538
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:50,106
From now on, you will always be by my side.

539
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:53,502
For you are mine.

540
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:59,013
Yes. I am yours.

541
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:05,623
 But you cannot ever entirely be mine.

542
00:55:06,705 --> 00:55:09,199
Don't give me that look.

543
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:12,622
Why do you say that?

544
00:55:12,622 --> 00:55:18,160
You… look like you're thinking about running away.

545
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,920
That will be of no use.

546
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:34,505
I will never let you go.

547
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:26,214
Factions shouldn't matter in any way.

548
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:29,403
I expected political balance from all of you.

549
00:56:29,403 --> 00:56:33,327
You are neither narrow-minded people nor little children in the streets!

550
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:36,750
Until when do I have to reconcile the two factions?

551
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,196
 We are honored, Your Majesty.

552
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:50,414
 We are honored, Your Majesty.

553
00:56:59,992 --> 00:57:04,316
If you visit me during the day, the officials will issue an appeal.

554
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:09,110
I just came to catch my breath.

555
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,215
This feels better.

556
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:19,620
Are you tired?

557
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,809
A little bit…

558
00:57:28,003 --> 00:57:30,896
What have you been doing all day?

559
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:36,630
I've done nothing special.

560
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,891
 I but sit here waiting for you.

561
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,101
 That is my part.

562
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,212
I like lying on your lap.

563
00:57:53,212 --> 00:57:57,640
And my legs have to do the hard work for that.

564
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:03,093
Why do you smile?

565
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:05,013
Because I'm enjoying this.

566
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:11,625
I mean it's good to be slacking off.

567
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:18,490
I wish we could stay like this forever.

568
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:10,690
Did you have a bad dream?

569
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:21,190
You…

570
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,400
you're here.

571
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:29,780
I have been here all along.

572
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,450
You've been sleeping all day long on my lap.

573
00:59:56,504 --> 01:00:00,811
You should go now. This is too long a break.

574
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:04,600
Yes.

575
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,520
I will.

576
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:24,898
Deok Im.

577
01:00:24,898 --> 01:00:26,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

578
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:34,180
I will never love as my grandfather did.

579
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,312
Pardon?

580
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:38,014
I will do anything

581
01:00:40,313 --> 01:00:42,702
to protect the one I love.

582
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:47,360
What are you speaking of?

583
01:00:49,998 --> 01:00:53,297
I see. Please, return.

584
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:55,880
You are actually late.

585
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:26,280
Are you not having your period?

586
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,096
No.

587
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,650
Could you be… pregnant?

588
01:01:32,214 --> 01:01:38,217
It's not certain. So I haven't told His Majesty yet.

589
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:41,499
I want to wait until it is confirmed.

590
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:44,480
Then you can't be in bed with him.

591
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,620
Doesn't he visit you every day? Would you be all right?

592
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:11,920
 His Majesty is on his way!

593
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:21,861
Your Majesty, I sent word that I cannot be with you tonight.

594
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:25,284
I heard you were sick. That's why I came to see you.

595
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:31,229
You don't look pale or anything.

596
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:36,198
Tell me about your symptoms. I have read many medical texts. I know quite a lot about illnesses.

597
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:38,170
What are they?

598
01:02:39,096 --> 01:02:41,340
Well…

599
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,510
- I have the chills... 
 - Chills?

600
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:48,840
You don't have a fever.

601
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:52,902
- I'm dizzy. 
 - Dizzy?

602
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,280
Walk a few steps.

603
01:03:07,915 --> 01:03:10,220
That's weird.

604
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:20,022
Perhaps... Did you happen to feign illness

605
01:03:20,022 --> 01:03:22,512
because you didn't want me here?

606
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:24,892
I didn't.

607
01:03:24,892 --> 01:03:28,025
I don't think you're sick at all.

608
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,920
Did you not want me? Is that it?

609
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,774
Your Majesty, are you so fond of me?

610
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:36,684
What?

611
01:03:36,684 --> 01:03:41,125
Would you fall ill if you don't see me even for a day?

612
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,630
Hey! You…

613
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,604
Right.

614
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:52,086
You must actually be sick since you're talking nonsense.

615
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:55,510
I will give you the perfect prescription.

616
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:01,320
Drink some cold water

617
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,500
and go to bed.

618
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:14,412
Your Majesty.

619
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:21,220
Are you not returning to your palace?

620
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:25,707
Do you want me to walk back there when it's so late?

621
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:29,480
I am actually not feeling well…

622
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,750
What are you thinking? I'm not going to do anything.

623
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:49,628
Tonight I will simply hold your hand. That's all.

624
01:04:49,628 --> 01:04:51,819
Are you sure?

625
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:23,726
You are indeed pregnant. Congratulations, Your Highness.

626
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:28,623
Be careful.

627
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:33,210
Congratulations, Your Highness.

628
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:36,440
Congratulations, Your Highness.

629
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,990
 We have to share the news with Court Lady Seo.

630
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,119
 And with His Majesty.

631
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:51,602
 He will be so happy.

632
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:54,320
 He will be beyond happy.

633
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,699
Pregnant?

634
01:06:58,699 --> 01:07:03,008
Yes, Your Majesty. Court Lady Sung is pregnant.

635
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:07,519
Does she indeed bear my child?

636
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,650
Yes. A royal nurse confirmed so.

637
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,720
What am I doing here?

638
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,360
Please watch your steps.

639
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,050
- Hurry. Follow me. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

640
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:43,591
Your Majesty.

641
01:08:02,623 --> 01:08:05,323
I thought you were going to the annex.

642
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:26,310
What is that purse?

643
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,318
Nothing…

644
01:08:33,703 --> 01:08:36,235
When is His Majesty coming?

645
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:38,040
He must be busy.

646
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,606
Still, he has to come to see you on a day like this.

647
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:47,602
He will come soon.

648
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:53,920
 Court Lady Sung, this is the Head of the Royal Guard.

649
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:11,003
His Majesty wanted me to deliver a message.

650
01:09:11,003 --> 01:09:15,816
He cannot visit you tonight, so you shouldn't wait.

651
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:20,015
How can he not come on a day like this?

652
01:09:20,015 --> 01:09:23,475
Does he not know that Court Lady Sung is pregnant?

653
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:25,401
This cannot be.

654
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:29,144
But it's not my fault that he can't come.

655
01:09:29,144 --> 01:09:33,241
My lady here has waited all day.

656
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:37,370
Well… I didn't stop him from coming here.

657
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,690
He's just…

658
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:44,796
I am the captain. You're not supposed to treat me like this.

659
01:09:44,796 --> 01:09:49,760
I will explain this to Court Lady Sung.

660
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:00,724
Congratulations on your pregnancy.

661
01:10:04,114 --> 01:10:05,791
You should go now.

662
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,360
Then I'll leave you to it.

663
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:13,920
You should leave, as well.

664
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,895
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

665
01:10:35,687 --> 01:10:40,619
Deok Im, what a blessing this is.

666
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:42,811
It truly is one.

667
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:48,230
Can His Majesty not come?

668
01:10:55,009 --> 01:10:59,212
He is with the Queen.

669
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:03,301
He will stay there tonight.

670
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:09,836
Her Highness has wanted a child for so long,

671
01:11:09,836 --> 01:11:12,619
but that never happened.

672
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:18,011
It only took you three months to get pregnant since you were officially favored by His Majesty.

673
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:21,519
How do you think Her Highness would feel?

674
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:28,217
He has to visit and comfort her.

675
01:11:29,102 --> 01:11:35,270
It is his rightful duty and responsibility as King.

676
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,824
I understand, my lady,

677
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:48,324
that the Queen has to be in his top priority, not me.

678
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:54,360
I already knew I should not desire anything or

679
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,422
expect anything from His Majesty

680
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:03,110
from the beginning.

681
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:13,695
You're here.

682
01:13:13,695 --> 01:13:16,350
I didn't mean to wake you.

683
01:13:25,386 --> 01:13:27,927
I am glad you came.

684
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:32,457
I'm sorry I couldn't come yesterday.

685
01:13:32,457 --> 01:13:34,412
Don't be.

686
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,533
I thought you would be disappointed.

687
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:41,380
It is not your fault.

688
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,570
Have you heard?

689
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,600
I have your child.

690
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,617
Yes. I was so glad to hear that.

691
01:13:55,982 --> 01:13:58,638
Do you wish it'd be a son?

692
01:13:59,694 --> 01:14:02,800
Am I asking something so obvious?

693
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:11,493
A daughter like you will be a clueless tomboy.

694
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:14,107
How would I handle her?

695
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:22,900
Still…

696
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:28,332
she would be lovely, just like you.

697
01:14:30,795 --> 01:14:35,904
Be it a mature son, or a reckless daughter,

698
01:14:37,701 --> 01:14:40,194
I'll be truly happy.

699
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:46,714
With our child, we will truly become family.

700
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:56,950
Have you ever wished to be a common man, not a king?

701
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:03,616
Well.

702
01:15:06,987 --> 01:15:09,923
I've never thought about that.

703
01:15:11,393 --> 01:15:14,850
I sometimes wonder,

704
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:21,109
what if I were not a court lady, and you not a king?

705
01:15:22,295 --> 01:15:28,500
How would it be if we were to meet as commoners?

706
01:15:34,724 --> 01:15:37,111
I'm not so sure...

707
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:40,896
I cannot imagine.

708
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:51,309
It suits you to be a court lady.

709
01:15:54,893 --> 01:16:01,320
Indeed. And it suits you to be king.

710
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,031
 Your Majesty.

711
01:16:23,594 --> 01:16:28,177
We have heard that your concubine got pregnant.

712
01:16:28,177 --> 01:16:30,014
Congratulations.

713
01:16:30,014 --> 01:16:33,070
 - Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

714
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:38,396
Thank you all.

715
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:46,660
It would have been even better if it were the Queen.

716
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:56,404
But it is good enough that you have an heir.

717
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,127
Congratulations.

718
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:03,467
Thank you, Assistant Counselor. I'm so happy.

719
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:08,706
Hey, Assistant Counselor. Aren't you happy, too?

720
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:14,440
Oh, of course, I am, Your Majesty.

721
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:18,298
Then perhaps you should laugh harder!

722
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:25,450
Laugh louder.

723
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:40,622
Don't you really need anything?

724
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:44,192
I can procure anything through my father.

725
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,330
I don't need anything.

726
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:49,770
And please talk to me like a friend.

727
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,326
It gives me chills whenever you talk to me formally.

728
01:17:52,326 --> 01:17:58,738
We cannot do that. You now bear His Majesty's child.

729
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:01,523
Things are different.

730
01:18:01,523 --> 01:18:07,420
But remember that, at heart, we will always be your friend.

731
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,709
It's been a while since our last vacation together.

732
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:17,523
It's too bad you can't join us, Your Highness.

733
01:18:17,523 --> 01:18:22,908
You know well. I cannot set foot outside the palace forever.

734
01:18:22,908 --> 01:18:27,180
Now, I'm destined to live here all my life.

735
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:34,029
It's fine. I have you guys. You can see everything outside the walls for me

736
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:37,730
and tell me when you return.

737
01:19:11,603 --> 01:19:13,297
 Guys!

738
01:19:16,191 --> 01:19:19,120
 You're late!

739
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,624
 Hey.

740
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:23,095
 Let's go.

741
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:24,995
 What do you want to eat?

742
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:28,440
 It's been a while since I went outside. I want something good.

743
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,110
 What should we have?

744
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,718
 Deok Im!

745
01:20:34,201 --> 01:20:37,416
 As I spend more and more time in this room by myself,

746
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,216
 I keep thinking about

747
01:20:42,019 --> 01:20:46,020
 what I have gained in my time here

748
01:20:47,716 --> 01:20:51,870
 and… what I have lost.

749
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,570

750
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,415
Oh, you're up.

751
01:21:18,686 --> 01:21:20,818
When did you come here?

752
01:21:21,993 --> 01:21:25,508
Stay seated. No need to stand up.

753
01:21:25,508 --> 01:21:29,103
- But how could I? 
 - It's fine. 
  (T/N: A person with a higher rank is supposed to sit inside)

754
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,870

755
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:40,184
What have you written down?

756
01:21:40,184 --> 01:21:42,500
A character I will bestow on you. 
  (T/N: Name for her new title as a concubine)

757
01:21:44,693 --> 01:21:47,618
You're pregnant.

758
01:21:47,618 --> 01:21:52,390
If you give birth to a son, you will officially become a  bin. 
 (T/N: the most senior rank for concubines)

759
01:21:56,498 --> 01:21:59,330
I have decided on a name.

760
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,680

761
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,220
"Ui" meaning "appropriate."

762
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:08,804
But why this character?

763
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,815
Wait. Don't you like it?

764
01:22:11,815 --> 01:22:15,513
It's weird that you're giving me such a good one.

765
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,250
It's not like you.

766
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:22,780
Then… what character do you think I would give you?

767
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:28,390
It could be "Mungbin" for "a stupid concubine"...

768
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:33,660
Or "Gwaebin" for "weirdo"...

769
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:39,227
If such characters existed, they would be perfect for you.

770
01:22:39,227 --> 01:22:44,640
Tell me. Why did you pick this character?

771
01:22:47,298 --> 01:22:50,899
Do you know the expression "Ui-ga-ui-sil"?

772
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:54,393
It means "to live in harmony as husband and wife."

773
01:22:54,393 --> 01:22:58,193
Do you know the expression "Ui-ga-ji-rak"?

774
01:22:58,193 --> 01:23:01,635
It means "to live in joy as husband and wife."

775
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:08,900
That's why I'm giving you the character "ui."

776
01:23:10,103 --> 01:23:15,800
I told you that I want to have a family with you.

777
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:26,927
Doesn't "ui" also mean "to like"?

778
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:31,934
Is that right?

779
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:37,012
So you already know.

780
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:40,810
You…

781
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,310
once told me

782
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:51,024
that you would never truly love me.

783
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:57,814
Do you still think so?

784
01:24:26,904 --> 01:24:29,006
It doesn't matter.

785
01:24:30,203 --> 01:24:33,098
After all, you're mine.

786
01:24:38,622 --> 01:24:43,903
 I may be happy today, but sad on another.

787
01:24:43,903 --> 01:24:49,016
 Perhaps, that's what life is all about.

788
01:24:49,016 --> 01:24:54,370
 It will be both sad and happy.

789
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,330
I'm happy that you're giving me a good name.

790
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,814
Shall I make you happy, as well?

791
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,880

792
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:15,604
Do you feel it?

793
01:25:20,894 --> 01:25:23,328
I do.

794
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,408
There is no way you can already feel it.

795
01:25:29,685 --> 01:25:32,411
No, I really do feel it.

796
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:34,294
Are you serious?

797
01:25:34,294 --> 01:25:39,712
Of course, I can feel its heart thump.

798
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,890
That's impressive.

799
01:25:42,998 --> 01:25:45,420
Are you that happy?

800
01:25:46,378 --> 01:25:48,320
I am.

801
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:58,370
♫  My nights I have barely swallowed and endured  ♫

802
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:05,450
♫  If you'd look at me, who's dreaming, who's struggling  ♫

803
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:10,670
♫  I want to newly write my own little story  ♫

804
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:18,590
♫  If it's something you've been waiting for all this time  ♫

805
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:25,990
♫  There is nothing to hesitate. 
 This is a story written by only the two of us  ♫

806
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:28,910
♫  If it's the moment I hope for again and again  ♫
