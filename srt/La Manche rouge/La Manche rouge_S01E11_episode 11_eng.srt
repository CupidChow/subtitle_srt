1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,520

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,170

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,520
Persimmon

4
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,360
and marinated crab.

5
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,360

6
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:45,185
Let's see.

7
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:59,020
Who would dare…

8
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:02,965
to offer me such food?

9
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:11,297
Who might it be?

10
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:54,063
You bitch!

11
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:06,597
It is not Mother.

12
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,986
I will take the punishment.

13
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,187
What?

14
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:16,706
Lay your punishment on me.

15
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:18,372
Do you wish so?

16
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,657
Your Majesty!

17
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,567
Let go!

18
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,022
- Head Eunuch! 
 - Yes, Your Majesty!

19
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,363
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,069
Are you okay, Mother?

21
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,533
Crown Prince, it was not me.

22
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,744
I… did not prepare the food.

23
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:12,418
I know it wasn't you.

24
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,327
Grandmother,

25
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:43,774
I humbly beg of you.

26
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,849
Please, take care of Mother.

27
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,761
That is all I ask.

28
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,091
I will.

29
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,128
You honor me.

30
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:10,200
Go stay at your private residence for the time being, Mother.

31
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:22,284
Crown Prince, Crown Prince!

32
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:23,867
Crown Prince!

33
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Princess Hwawan, remain here.

34
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,531
Out, the rest of you.

35
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:56,474
What is the matter? What do you wish to say?

36
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,269
I'm surprised that the Crown Prince asked you to take care of his mother.

37
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,102
I guess I was not aware that

38
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:10,116
Your Highness and the Crown Prince have become so close.

39
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:13,717
We do not share a single drop of blood.

40
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,984
How close a grandmother-grandson relationship can that be?

41
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,024
But today, I cannot but honor his favor

42
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:27,527
because I am indebted to him.

43
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,771
Indebted?

44
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:33,512
It's not just me. You and Concubine Suk Eui are also in his debt.

45
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,790
Without him,

46
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,490
we all would have suffered gravely.

47
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:47,768
If His Majesty had struck Princess Hyebin, what would have happened next?

48
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:50,809
You would have been next, Princess,

49
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:56,030
and then Concubine Suk Eui, and even me…

50
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,160
Father would never do such a thing.

51
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,730
I'm his favorite child.

52
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:08,355
How can you be so dull?

53
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,319
A cherished daughter you may be.

54
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,342
Only when you were cute and little.

55
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,784
But think about this.

56
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:24,417
What did he do to his son

57
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,269
when his authority floundered?

58
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:37,602
I do not care who put you up to this inane plot,

59
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:42,110
but… how dare you involve me in it?

60
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,841
I was about to go find you.

61
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:27,614
So… how is Court Lady Park?

62
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,087
I've cherished you for a long time.

63
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:41,157
I always thought

64
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,103
that I needed you.

65
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,828
But you see,

66
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:51,650
I have no use for you now.

67
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,731
See you later.

68
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:09,404
Deok Im! Something awful has happened!

69
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:12,359
His Highness the Crown Prince is in trouble.

70
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,827
What?

71
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,400
Sir.

72
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,267
Maiden Sung, what's the matter?

73
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,218
I beg of you. Please, let me inside.

74
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,854
Only His Majesty's maids with permission are allowed in.

75
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:48,074
Just for a short time. I beg you.

76
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:51,948
I wish I could. I'm sorry, Maiden Sung.

77
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,455
Sir,

78
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,434
will you be seeing His Highness?

79
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,898
Yes.

80
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,053
Will you give him this?

81
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,477
What is it?

82
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:20,022
It's medicine for burns. I thought His Highness might need it.

83
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:23,924
Only medicine from the royal medical office may be used.

84
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:27,755
I know, but if you would just give it to him…

85
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:31,108
Why give him medicine that cannot be used?

86
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:35,964
Or is this how a palace maid captures his heart?

87
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,033
Thank you, sir.

88
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,782
Has the royal doctor visited?

89
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,428
He has.

90
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,191
Then you should go to the King's palace

91
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,415
and kneel to beg for forgiveness.

92
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,439
I know.

93
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,782
This was another conspired plot to harm you, Your Highness,

94
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:41,144
but you still have to go.

95
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:46,256
I have not yet received an official retraction of the regency,

96
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,292
and I have state affairs to manage.

97
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,729
I am where I should be.

98
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,569
Right here,

99
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,966
I shall await his decision.

100
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:13,425
I will notify the Dongdeok Order of your intention.

101
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:15,827
Do so.

102
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,116
Did you…

103
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,596
come from my palace?

104
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
I did.

105
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,177
Did you see Maiden Sung by chance?

106
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:45,516
No, I did not.

107
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:50,214
If you see her,

108
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:52,889
tell her not to worry…

109
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:57,390
Never mind.

110
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
You may leave.

111
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,967
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:24,391
Sir, how is His Highness?

113
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:27,743
- The wound on his hand—
- You can ask him yourself.

114
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,327
You're a fool.

115
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,295
Is there anything you can do?

116
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,611
You can't do anything.

117
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,122
You swore not to be swayed by feelings.

118
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:20,376
The Crown Prince must have been

119
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:24,121
plotting this the whole time!

120
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:29,658
He must have been looking for a chance to mock me

121
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:34,923
that I killed my own brother and took the throne.

122
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:40,271
No… That's not it. It can't be.

123
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,938
My San is certainly not that sort.

124
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,547
My San is a good boy.

125
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,217
He's different from his father.

126
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,033
Perhaps, Princess Hyebin put him up to this.

127
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:59,445
Right. Though that wench remains silent,

128
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,980
she's always held a grudge against me.

129
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,313
How dare she make a mockery of me, the king of this nation!

130
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:10,492
I will never forgive her!

131
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,794
Isn't that right?

132
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:22,512
Head eunuch, why do you not offer a reply to the King's questions?

133
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,420
Are you insulting me?

134
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,715
I… am but following your command.

135
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:32,684
What command?

136
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:38,507
You've commanded me never to speak my mind.

137
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:41,142
You have commanded me

138
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:45,676
to hear nothing and see nothing as I serve you.

139
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,751
So there is only one thing I can do.

140
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:52,974
To hold the lantern and light your way.

141
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:57,674
Well, you're not doing that very well.

142
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,473
Do you want forgiveness?

143
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:39,195
Yes, I do.

144
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,028
Then…

145
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:45,493
Say that your mother did this.

146
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,458
If your mother is to be accused,

147
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,467
it wouldn't be your crime.

148
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,603
And after that,

149
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,236
do you want me to erase Mother from my life?

150
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,158
Just like I erased Father?

151
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:14,139
I have already told you

152
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:17,162
that it was not Mother.

153
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,794
Then…

154
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,840
who was it?

155
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:27,003
Princess Hwawan? Concubine Suk Eui?

156
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,419
Who is guilty of this?

157
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,528
Your Majesty,

158
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,555
whom do you wish me to name?

159
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:41,266
Will it be your beloved daughter?

160
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,635
Or your dearest concubine?

161
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:49,114
Whom do I have to name

162
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:53,346
so that you will regain your calm?

163
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:00,557
It is I that hosted the banquet.

164
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:05,478
And for the food that was served to you,

165
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,535
I am responsible.

166
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,867
I am the one to blame.

167
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,456
Lay your punishment on me.

168
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,126
You're…

169
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,557
already…

170
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:26,568
the successor appointed to be regent.

171
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:30,951
You take that throne

172
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:37,173
or else, you shall die.

173
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,573
Go back to your palace.

174
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:45,707
And you may not leave until commanded.

175
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,510
Soon,

176
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,960
I will hand down my decision.

177
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:10,056
 If you were by my side,

178
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:14,601
 would it soothe this pain?

179
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:39,444
 I know that my presence will not be of any help to you,

180
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,476
 but today, I wanted to be there with you.

181
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,826
How is Court Lady Park?

182
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:03,792
She was herself for a bit in the morning. She also had some porridge.

183
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:09,197
The Head Court Lady knows about everything.

184
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:14,031
Let's not worry ourselves. It's not like she'll kill us.

185
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,473
Have you seen His Highness the Crown Prince?

186
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,907
No.

187
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:24,302
That's why you have such a long face.

188
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,496
That's not true.

189
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:29,008
Don't think you can fool me. I know everything.

190
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,451
You're in love with His Highness, so why won't you be his concubine?

191
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:41,030
You don't need the Head Court Lady's support

192
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:43,952
to become a concubine.

193
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:49,694
You can just take the hand that he offers.

194
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,349
Why?

195
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:55,959
Why does liking him mean becoming his concubine?

196
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,358
I don't want to live as one.

197
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,966
A life full of suffering.

198
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,656
There will be a new concubine every day.

199
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,450
She will come from some noble family.

200
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,897
She will be young and pretty.

201
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:16,942
I would have to remain silent while suffering all that.

202
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:20,283
That's the life of a concubine…

203
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:23,403
Why should I live like that?

204
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,759
The Crown Prince is precious to me,

205
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,760
but it's more important to take care of myself.

206
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,645
So I will never, ever

207
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:39,001
let myself suffer great pains.

208
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:42,324
It's better to have nothing

209
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:47,229
if you can't have it all to yourself.

210
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,866
Then why the tears?

211
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:53,623
Because His Highness is in trouble.

212
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:58,279
His Highness has devoted his life

213
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,454
to becoming a good king.

214
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:06,850
He's given his life

215
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,381
but his efforts were of no avail.

216
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,513
And now his life is in danger.

217
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:17,033
I wish to help His Highness,

218
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,888
but I don't know what I should do.

219
00:24:30,116 --> 00:24:33,105
 If I taught you the way,

220
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:36,086
could you handle it?

221
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,830
Court Lady!

222
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,271
Will you

223
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:56,009
protect his son?

224
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,486
I…

225
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:05,068
could not protect the child whom I raised with my own hands.

226
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:10,176
I regretted that all my life.

227
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,211
But thoughts of regret

228
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,381
can never change the past.

229
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:30,974
But you can change what happens now.

230
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,058
Would there be a way?

231
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:41,613
His Majesty

232
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,868
made a promise

233
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:49,643
to protect his grandchild

234
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:52,599
and see him to the throne.

235
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,151
His Majesty

236
00:25:57,151 --> 00:26:00,481
has forgotten that promise.

237
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:12,822
If he indeed has dementia

238
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:16,377
and has lost his memory…

239
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:20,632
you have to help him remember.

240
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,984
That's the only way

241
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:27,651
the Crown Prince can ascend the throne.

242
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,506
 There is a document

243
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:40,612
 that was written by His Majesty's very hands

244
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,879
 and has the royal seal on it.

245
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,339
 Find that document

246
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,328
 and show it to His Majesty.

247
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,053
 And tell him

248
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:01,749
 to honor the promise

249
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:07,832
 that Prince Sado gave his life

250
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,530
 to procure.

251
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:16,744
 I've come to see Princess Hyebin!

252
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:19,621
 Princess Hyebin!

253
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,476
 Princess Hyebin!

254
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:27,597
I have to see the Princess right now.

255
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,291
Princess! Princess Hyebin!

256
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,237
Princess!

257
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,586
Deok Im!

258
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,219
What is going on?

259
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,688
There was a promise, Your Highness.

260
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,534
It is a promise

261
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:53,962
that the late Prince Sado gave his life to procure.

262
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:56,295
This is proof of that.

263
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,970

(T/N: "to brighten or enlighten")

264
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,481
You…

265
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,080
What is this?

266
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:13,043
A secret document.

267
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:16,165
You have to hurry and find the secret document.

268
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:22,935

269
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:34,744
A secret document… What in the world?

270
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,283
Princess!

271
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:04,680
Court Lady Park…

272
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,634
I remember now.

273
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:10,996
She was Crown Prince Sado's nursemaid.

274
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:15,314
I thought she was discharged from service after his death.

275
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:20,360
She has been hiding in the royal laundry room all along, waiting,

276
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,049
in order to pass the secret to the Crown Prince.

277
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,601
A secret document...

278
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,047
Prince Sado begged His Majesty to spare his son's life

279
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:35,012
and give him the throne in exchange for his life.

280
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:38,144
And His Majesty accepted the plea,

281
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:41,955
wrote down the promise and stamped the royal seal himself.

282
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:46,110
That is the secret document I'm talking about.

283
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:07,510
Without knowing that…

284
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,917
I have blamed him until now…

285
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:20,028
I have blamed my late husband.

286
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,044
If I had known,

287
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,148
I wouldn't have blamed him so much.

288
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,985
Perhaps my husband did not trust me

289
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,554
because I am so shortsighted.

290
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:46,596
That's why he did not even leave me a clue.

291
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,959
He did.

292
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:56,246
That ring you're wearing,

293
00:30:56,952 --> 00:31:00,493
Prince Sado left it to you, didn't he?

294
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:09,139
There are three clues to find the secret document.

295
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,328
The first is that winter hat,

296
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,862
the second is that ring, and the third is—

297
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:17,549
The letter on your back.

298
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,937
Right.

299
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,474
Your father was Prince Sado's most trusted guardsman.

300
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:29,761
He put a letter on your back.

301
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:35,362
That… That's what happened…

302
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,965
Now you know, Princess,

303
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:42,949
that Prince Sado trusted you

304
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:47,038
and left you with that ring.

305
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:55,300
Thank you for telling me that.

306
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:22,469
Your Highness.

307
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:27,424
Thank you for guarding my palace while I was gone.

308
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:30,141
I'm sure you've heard.

309
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,006
Your Highness…

310
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,663
Bar all the gates.

311
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,497
Close the windows, and lower the shades.

312
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:44,181
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,161
Your Highness,

314
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:01,909
I…

315
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,143
have something to report.

316
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:39,269
Why are you here without permission?

317
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,922
Do you know how dangerous this is?

318
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:45,887
This is nothing compared to what's to come.

319
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:50,817
His Majesty has called for an unscheduled meeting.

320
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:56,260
He has commanded that his court officials assemble in the royal court by 8 o'clock in the morning.

321
00:33:57,358 --> 00:34:00,103
There's no telling what will happen.

322
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:04,005
You might be deposed.

323
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,510
Please,

324
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,360
do what is necessary.

325
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,851
His Majesty is 83 years old.

326
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:18,995
He suffers from dementia

327
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:22,128
and has lost the capacity for discernment.

328
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,287
So?

329
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,645
So?

330
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:38,721
As King Taejong did to King Taejo, 
  (T/N: Taejo - the first king; Taejong - the third king of Joseon )

331
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,876
you need to make His Majesty

332
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,043
abdicate and give you the throne.

333
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,500

334
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,111
Here's the roster of the Dongdeok Order

335
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:01,686
with the names of all its members.

336
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:04,903
Well done.

337
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,392
Will you take the next step?

338
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:10,803
No.

339
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:15,165
Learn to wait when you fish

340
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:18,166
lest the catch swim away.

341
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:23,089
Let the fish squirm in the net so it becomes tighter.

342
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:27,824
It takes time to catch fish.

343
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:33,426
Let's give that time to the Crown Prince.

344
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:57,613
Force His Majesty's abdication?

345
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,702
Does everyone agree with Preceptor Hong?

346
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,547
I am asking you a question!

347
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,569
Your Highness,

348
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:19,665
His Majesty once said the following.

349
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:24,280
 For the people of Joseon,

350
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,366
 know when to step down

351
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:30,706
 and when enough is enough.

352
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:37,033
 That applies even to myself.

353
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:40,077
Treason…

354
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:43,789
Our intention might seem like it.

355
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,687
Yet, I dare to think

356
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:52,388
that perhaps, this is what His Majesty truly wills.

357
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:59,784
Perhaps, that night when he assembled us to the official court

358
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:03,464
was meant for a day like this.

359
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:10,357
Should we not follow the command

360
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:15,868
that he gave us when he was not ill?

361
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:24,209
Please think of your sisters.

362
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:28,521
They can only live as long as you do.

363
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,885
What is your opinion, head guardsman?

364
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:36,258
I do not have one.

365
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:40,101
I merely follow your command.

366
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:45,048
Your will is my will.

367
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:53,990
Everyone may leave

368
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,350
except for Preceptor Hong.

369
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:19,514
Did you gather these men?

370
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,123
Yes, Your Highness.

371
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:24,301
Without my permission?

372
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:28,734
I only did it for your sake.

373
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:30,755
For my sake…

374
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,671
For my sake…

375
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:43,412
The only way you can help me

376
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:50,922
is to do…

377
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,675
nothing.

378
00:38:57,384 --> 00:39:00,550
Do not harbor in your heart

379
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:05,005
any treacherous thought.

380
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:10,210
How is this a treacherous thought?

381
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,458
I am but a loyal servant.

382
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:16,491
A loyal servant to Your Highness!

383
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,757
Are you afraid of how others may see you?

384
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:25,002
What would the others think of this?

385
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,666
It is only for the sake of Joseon.

386
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:34,047
The people want a strong and wise king to protect them.

387
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:38,021
It is not a king

388
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:41,829
that's old and ill. It is Your Highness!

389
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,455
It is you that they want.

390
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,873
Please, do not be afraid.

391
00:39:57,185 --> 00:40:00,427
Even if I am killed for treason,

392
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:04,193
I will gladly die if it is for your sake.

393
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,060
Your Highness,

394
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,477
we have to do something.

395
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,424
We won't lose you without a fight.

396
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:32,484
Do you not know

397
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:37,505
why I cannot do as you suggest?

398
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:42,128
The king that you speak of...

399
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,880
The king that is old, ill,

400
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:50,301
and out of his mind!

401
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:56,737
He is my grandfather.

402
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,771
The man I truly hold dear in my heart!

403
00:41:03,143 --> 00:41:05,099
My grandfather...

404
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:19,046
Even if the world is against him,

405
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,832
I will protect him.

406
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,172
Leave.

407
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:31,467
What's taking so long?

408
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,821
It's impossible to know His Highness's intentions.

409
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:41,302
What did he say?

410
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,970

(T/N: "five", "to brighten", "peaks")

411
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:55,687
So these characters show where the secret document is…

412
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,114
I can't think of anything.

413
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,668

414
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,184
How about in this order?

415
00:43:10,184 --> 00:43:12,806
Does anything come to mind?

416
00:43:13,483 --> 00:43:15,571
Still nothing.

417
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:22,592
Do you have any thoughts?

418
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,205
Your father left the letter on your sister's back.

419
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,759
He might have left something to you.

420
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,910
Think carefully.

421
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:40,889
I'm sorry, Princess.

422
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:45,975
Deok Im,

423
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:49,298
help the Crown Prince.

424
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:52,503
I will, Princess.

425
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:12,777
Deok Im.

426
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,142
You're trembling.

427
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:28,860
Right.

428
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:32,527
This indeed is scary.

429
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:39,491
Would you leave with me to a land far away

430
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:46,284
where there will be nothing to worry about

431
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,680
and have a much easier life?

432
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:52,356
Brother…

433
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,367
I don't want you in any kind of danger.

434
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,913
You are most important to me.

435
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,006
I also want to live in comfort.

436
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:10,793
Have a long and quiet life.

437
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:15,424
But for that to happen, His Highness must be alive and well.

438
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:18,344
Why do you have to do so much for him?

439
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:22,632
What is he to you?

440
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,025
 Stop talking nonsense and rest.

441
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,622
 Right here?

442
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,975
 Wouldn't it be dangerous?

443
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:38,948
 I will protect you.

444
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,425
Right. I have your answer.

445
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:56,458
What? I didn't say anything.

446
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,977
Well, you didn't have to.

447
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,123
Deok Im,

448
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:06,366
I don't know what the secret document is

449
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:09,209
or where it's hidden,

450
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:12,637
but there is one thing I do know

451
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:17,212
about the letter on your back.

452
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:30,731

(T/N: "to brighten")

453
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,234
This letter has to be split in half.

454
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:57,543
Il, wol… 
  (T/N: the "sun" and "moon")

455
00:46:59,576 --> 00:47:01,676
Oh, bong… 
  (T/N: "five", "mountain peaks")

456
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:08,193
I think I know

457
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:11,779
where the secret document is hidden.

458
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:32,740
My lady, there will be a meeting at 8 a.m.

459
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,635
A meeting that was not scheduled?

460
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:40,893
Bring the Minister of the Court.

461
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:44,476
Let him know I have something for him.

462
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:46,372
Yes, my lady.

463
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,650

464
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,700
I think it's time.

465
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:24,791
See you.

466
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:34,441
Deok Im!

467
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:38,098
Stay safe.

468
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,847
 May Your Highness come out

469
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:56,647
 and receive His Majesty's royal command!

470
00:49:21,236 --> 00:49:23,225
Your Highness,

471
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:27,892
dress in proper attire and come to the official court.

472
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:31,949
I will.

473
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,677
 Your Highness! Your Highness!

474
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:47,434
Your Highness!

475
00:49:48,673 --> 00:49:51,828
- You may not pass without permission. 
 - Your Highness! Just a short while.

476
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,884
- You, step back! 
 - Your Highness.

477
00:49:53,884 --> 00:49:56,825
 - Your Highness!  
 - Your Highness, it's 8 a.m.

478
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:59,499
How dare you stand in my way?

479
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:02,264
- Your Highness. 
 - Let her go.

480
00:50:03,498 --> 00:50:06,835
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

481
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:10,688
Your Highness, I have something to tell you. You have to hear this.

482
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:13,901
His Majesty is waiting for you.

483
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:16,512
Please step inside, Your Highness.

484
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,923
Your Highness, you need to hear this right now. I have something to tell—

485
00:50:19,924 --> 00:50:23,190
It's okay, Deok Im.

486
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:48,583
I'm fine. Stop trembling.

487
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:52,604
I will be right back.

488
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:46,978
 What do you think you're doing?

489
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,386
 I told you to go.

490
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:55,090
 Oh, dear…

491
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:59,356
 No, you cannot play with that.

492
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:03,850
 Now, off you go.

493
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,989
 I am not your owner.

494
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:11,391
 Is this puppy bothering you?

495
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,124
 I will give her a talking to.

496
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:19,835
 You little brat!

497
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:22,178
 Do you know who this is?

498
00:52:22,178 --> 00:52:25,800
 He is the Crown Prince, the heir to this Joseon's throne.

499
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,086
 Remove yourself from sight!

500
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:31,998
 "As you command, Your Highness."

501
00:52:42,804 --> 00:52:44,748
 Having fun?

502
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:59,982
 The pup is quite fond of you, Your Highness.

503
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:03,803
 I found her hurt and soaked in rain when she was a baby.

504
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:05,738
 I looked after her for some time.

505
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:08,053
 Why don't you take her with you?

506
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,698
 No.

507
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,730
 Why wouldn't you?

508
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:20,424
 She lost her mother as a pup. I won't let her lose her owner, too.

509
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:23,458
 Lose her owner?

510
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:27,299
 Why do you speak of such a thing?

511
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,983
 The palace is full of conflicts

512
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,771
 and those who wish me harm.

513
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,473
 I shouldn't have said that. Forget it.

514
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:47,739
 If Your Highness were to pass away,

515
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:51,771
 I will be discharged from the palace.

516
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,098
 I will be jobless. Won't you feel bad for me?

517
00:53:58,016 --> 00:54:00,940
 Well, that's not even funny.

518
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,323
 Never speak of such a thing, again.

519
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,198
 I told you to forget it.

520
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:12,500
 I always end up telling you things I shouldn't.

521
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:16,130
 I feel uneasy.

522
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:50,102
Think… What can you do?

523
00:54:50,675 --> 00:54:53,108
There must be something you can do.

524
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:12,658
The Crown Prince has committed a crime against me.

525
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,890
I have called this meeting

526
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:20,211
to discuss the penalties

527
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:23,473
befitting his crime.

528
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:28,855
Crown Prince.

529
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:31,327
Yes, Your Majesty.

530
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,750
Do you have anything to say?

531
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:38,730
I have done wrong.

532
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:41,930
What wrong?

533
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,689
I am guilty of leaving you in the dark,

534
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:49,526
alone and helpless.

535
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:54,393
You suffer from a severe illness.

536
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:58,440
You are not your old self anymore.

537
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:02,974
You are not well, Your Majesty.

538
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:07,163
And everyone around you

539
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:12,341
has gone along and avoided any discussion of this matter.

540
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:17,427
You fought a lonely battle in anguish.

541
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:25,187
I should have been the one to help and protect you.

542
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,522
Yet, I failed to do so.

543
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,053
What kept me from doing my duty?

544
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,135
I asked myself this.

545
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,813
Now, I know.

546
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,402
It was the grudge that I held against you

547
00:56:51,594 --> 00:56:54,305
deep inside my heart.

548
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:59,155
I did not want to offer you any help.

549
00:57:00,312 --> 00:57:03,068
But now I realize

550
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:07,162
that I

551
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,249
was only being childish.

552
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:16,576
Such feelings are a luxury that I cannot afford

553
00:57:16,576 --> 00:57:19,798
when death is lurking at my doorstep.

554
00:57:21,388 --> 00:57:23,510
Your Majesty has always been

555
00:57:24,948 --> 00:57:30,693
like a big tree that protected me.

556
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:37,319
Now, that tree is nowhere to be found

557
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:41,820
and my life is in danger.

558
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:48,538
That is what I miss and need.

559
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:52,513
And so I beg of you.

560
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,252
Have trust in me.

561
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:05,230
Protect me.

562
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:08,910
As you always have.

563
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,443
That is what I beg you, Your Majesty.

564
00:58:19,393 --> 00:58:21,626
Close the gates.

565
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:30,433
- You wench, what do you think you're doing?
- Apologies.

566
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,255
My Queen, it is me.

567
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:38,601
Maiden Sung Deok Im from the Crown Prince Palace.

568
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:40,428
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

569
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:43,257
Please allow me an audience!

570
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:48,998
We are here to discuss your crime.

571
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:54,206
And you dare speak of my illness

572
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:57,442
in front of my officials?

573
00:58:57,442 --> 00:59:01,310
What is the intention behind those words?

574
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:05,893
Do you want the entire world to know?

575
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:10,768
How dare you speak with such nasty intent!

576
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:18,710
I have been keeping quiet so as not to cause problems.

577
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:22,189
I refrained from meeting anyone

578
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:26,614
lest people discover that I'm ill!

579
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:31,571
I did all that for you!

580
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:35,496
To save you the burden!

581
00:59:35,496 --> 00:59:37,763
And yet,

582
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:41,953
this insult is your answer to that?

583
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,740
Your Majesty,

584
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,590
you have to believe me.

585
00:59:46,598 --> 00:59:52,190
There are traitors who conspire and scheme against me.

586
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,741
What?

587
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:57,885
Do you speak of treason?

588
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:02,850
Do you know who the real traitor is?

589
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:10,138
There!

590
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,490

591
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:34,287
Minister of the Court!

592
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:37,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

593
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,477
You brought this to me,

594
01:00:41,477 --> 01:00:44,362
so you will explain.

595
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,387
What is that roster?

596
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:53,023
It is that of the Dongdeok Order.

597
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:58,281
The Crown Prince gathered these men in secret

598
01:00:59,064 --> 01:01:04,297
to drive you from your throne

599
01:01:04,297 --> 01:01:10,674
and take it for himself as soon as possible.

600
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:21,843
Why should I help the Crown Prince?

601
01:01:21,843 --> 01:01:25,217
Whether it's the Crown Prince that becomes king or his cousin

602
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:28,005
does not matter to me.

603
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:31,478
I'll be Queen Dowager, regardless.

604
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:35,467
Why should I take the risk?

605
01:01:35,467 --> 01:01:38,240
Is that indeed what you think?

606
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:44,656
Right, you serve the Crown Prince.

607
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,504
Have you come to negotiate?

608
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:52,284
Let me hear your terms then.

609
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:56,515
I am not here to negotiate with you.

610
01:01:56,515 --> 01:02:02,324
I'm only here to offer you advice to do what you rightfully must.

611
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:05,731
The Crown Prince remains the legitimate successor.

612
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:10,086
To lose him would bring chaos to this country.

613
01:02:10,086 --> 01:02:12,782
To prevent chaos and protect the Crown Prince

614
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:16,227
is your rightful duty as Queen.

615
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,268
Please go to the official court.

616
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:26,812
His Majesty is not well and suffers from dementia,

617
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:30,773
but no one dares to speak for the Crown Prince.

618
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:36,120
Your Highness is the only one who can.

619
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:49,455
You speak of rightful duties,

620
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:54,145
so you have no cards to play.

621
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:57,106
Is that what you mean?

622
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,904
I need not hear any more from you.

623
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,560
You may leave.

624
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:15,738
This will be an opportunity

625
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:20,685
for you to show the people that you are a capable queen.

626
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:22,332
The country's fate depends on this.

627
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:25,500
It is a rare opportunity for you.

628
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,476
The Crown Prince will be gratefully in your debt.

629
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:33,582
Would you miss the chance to offer the new King a favor?

630
01:03:33,582 --> 01:03:38,611
If the Crown Prince gets deposed because you wish to avoid a small risk,

631
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,729
that will make Princess Hwawan so happy.

632
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:49,453
You will become Queen Dowager,

633
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:53,920
a powerless one contained in her little chamber embroidering all day.

634
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,733
I do appreciate your insight but not the impudent attitude.

635
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:26,799
You are quite good with words.

636
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,600
Your daring attempt to manipulate me with just words

637
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:34,894
has indeed changed my mind.

638
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:42,348
Okay. I will go to the official court.

639
01:04:42,348 --> 01:04:47,613
I will ask His Highness to forgive the Crown Prince.

640
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:51,689
It will do me no harm to play the generous grandmother

641
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:57,157
but that will be it.

642
01:04:57,157 --> 01:05:00,580
Never try to manipulate me again.

643
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:05,092
That will be enough, Your Highness.

644
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:11,224
Now, allow me to tell you about a secret document.

645
01:05:11,224 --> 01:05:13,334
A secret document?

646
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:17,906
What is that?

647
01:05:29,655 --> 01:05:34,132
Your Majesty, this is but the Minister of the Court's slander.

648
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:38,225
- The Dongdeok Order is not such a…
 - You little rat!

649
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:44,427
What did I tell you when I dispatched you to the Crown Prince's Palace?

650
01:05:44,427 --> 01:05:49,112
Not once did you obey my command

651
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,827
to report to me of his activity!

652
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:55,217
Your Majesty, that was—

653
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:58,106
Shut your mouth!

654
01:05:58,106 --> 01:06:03,582
You only think of the things you'll get

655
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:08,334
when the Crown Prince is King!

656
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:11,790
Do you think I didn't know that?

657
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:17,720
I only turned a blind eye!

658
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:38,123
Crown Prince, do you know

659
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:43,036
why I had high expectations for you?

660
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,095
I do not.

661
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,097
Because I did not want you to go through the things I did!

662
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:58,703
My father did not expect anything from me.

663
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:05,620
No one in this world had any expectations for me!

664
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:08,900
I was alive,

665
01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:13,616
yet I was no better than dead.

666
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:20,410
Crown Prince, do you understand

667
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:25,171
what misery that would have been?

668
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:33,170
That's why I held such high expectations for you.

669
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:38,491
I gave you the affection that I never received.

670
01:07:39,803 --> 01:07:45,036
Do you know how much I cherished you?

671
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:48,600
How much I loved you!

672
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:21,580

673
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:32,930
♫  In this strangely cold winter  ♫

674

♫  We cannot embrace each other   ♫

675
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:44,340
♫  So we are stuck in this season forever  ♫

676
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,400

677
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,350
♫  A sharp cut in my heart  ♫

01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,800
 You wish for me to die soon, right?

680
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,970
 No, Your Majesty.

681
01:08:54,970 --> 01:09:01,930
 Chasing skirts and neglecting your studies. Holding grudges when scolded!

682
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:06,500
 That's why you want this old king dead and gone!

683
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,320
 You have lost your mind and murdered over a hundred!

684
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:16,200
 Did you think you'd stay alive just because you are my son?

685
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,990
 Yi Seon, you scoundrel!
