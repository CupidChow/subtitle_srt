1
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,950

2
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,550

3
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,450

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,070

5
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:07,398
You wish for me to die quickly!

6
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,454
No, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:12,601
You wish for this old king to disappear!

8
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,880
No, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,023
You ungrateful scoundrel!

10
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:21,332
You chase skirts and neglect your studies!

11
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,540
And hold grudges when you are reprimanded!

12
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,536
That's why you want me dead and gone!

13
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:37,019
Yi Seon! You scoundrel!

14
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,027
You scoundrel!

15
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:42,884
You murdered over a hundred in your madness!

16
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:48,031
How can I let you live when you harm my people?

17
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,520
Did you think I'd spare your life

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,819
merely because you are my son?

19
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:00,292
After I heard of your deeds,

20
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:04,102
I cried out loudly in anguish and beat my chest!

21
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:11,020
How could you stab your old father in the heart!

22
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:14,931
I am not Father!

23
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,020
What?

24
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,109
I am San!

25
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:27,333
It's San, Grandfather!

26
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,611
Please look at your Grandson!

27
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:38,594
If only once, please see me for who I truly am!

28
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:44,401
It is I, San! It is San, Grandfather!

29
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,102
What the…

30
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,722
Left State Councilor!

31
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,892
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,819
Left State Councilor!

33
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,993
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,777
That boy…

35
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,733
isn't my son?

36
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:27,803
It's not Yi Seon, my son?

37
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:33,823
That is n-not

38
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:37,381
your son,

39
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,420
but your grandson, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,600
Is that you, San?

41
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:54,613
Yes, Grandfather.

42
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,209
It's you, San!

43
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,827
Yes.

44
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,320
Hey you,

45
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:12,519
what year is it?

46
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,840
Is it the Year of the Horse?

47
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,130
It is not.

48
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,515
My head! My head hurts!

49
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,803
It hurts!

50
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,434
What do I do?

51
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,875
What do I do?

52
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,914
The King must discern

53
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:50,330
and decide.

54
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:55,314
I am the King,

55
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,913
but I can no longer do it.

56
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,513
I just can't.

57
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,589
What am I going to do?

58
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,022
Your Majesty.

59
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,895
Please get up again.

60
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,384
Please make one final decision

61
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:24,722
as the King of Joseon.

62
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:29,605
If you wish to kill your grandson,

63
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,942
I will obey.

64
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:36,081
As things stand,

65
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:39,292
the court will be split in half,

66
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,013
as will the people,

67
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:48,514
and the nation of Joseon will be thrown into chaos!

68
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,631
Please get up

69
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,717
and fulfill

70
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:00,513
your final duty as the King.

71
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:04,534
It's you, San!

72
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:08,536
Why is it so cold?

73
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:13,106
It's San! It's truly you!

74
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,019
My lady!

75
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,002
My lady.

76
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,217
 The Queen has arrived!

77
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,523
Queen!

78
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:08,109
Your Majesty, due to the urgency of the situation,

79
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,720
I was forced to break with protocol.

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,175
Please forgive me.

81
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,202
What brings you all the way here?

82
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:21,995
There is a document that I must show you.

83
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,716
Document?

84
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:27,428
It is a secret document.

85
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,830
A secret document?

86
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,823
A secret document.

87
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:40,138
Do you have no recollection?

88
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:46,033
Remind His Majesty of where that secret document is hidden.

89
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,391
Yes, Your Highness.

90
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,716
- Your Majesty, the secret document is… 
- Apologies, Your Majesty!

91
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,698
An immature palace maid

92
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:07,037
has recklessly come here to sow confusion in Your Majesty's heart!

93
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:10,717
It is all my fault!

94
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:16,008
Your Highness, I do not know what words this maid used

95
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:20,939
in order to beguile you to come here, but it is all a lie!

96
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,478
I will take her to the Disciplinary Court Lady

97
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,522
and have her confess her sin!

98
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:40,619
They say that on that day in the Year of the Horse lightning and thunder struck like today.

99
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:46,602
And when the eunuch came and informed you of your son's death,

100
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:51,687
Your Majesty wrote a document with your own hand and put the royal seal on it.

101
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:56,925
You wrote the document and hid it in accordance with your oath.

102
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:02,325
Please... try to remember.

103
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:11,725
Your Majesty already knows with whom you made the oath

104
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:18,666
and where you hid the document!

105
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,830
Oh, my head...

106
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:23,931
My head hurts.

107
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,922
What?

108
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,998
A secret document?

109
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:44,620
A secret document that I hid…

110
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,400

111
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,910

112
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,623
"Oh, you bloodied shirt."

113
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,413
"Oh, you bloodied shirt."

114
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,382
 "Oh, you odong tree,"
(T/N: odong tree - Paulownia coreana, a tree endemic to Korea)

115
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,409
 "Oh, you odong tree,"

116
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:21,288
 "who is loyal like Geumjang?" 
 (T/N: Geumjang - A loyal subject from Chinese history)

117
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,701
 "Who is loyal like Cheonchu?"
(T/N: Cheonchu - A loyal subject from Chinese history)

118
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,692
"I have such regret."

119
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,491
Such regret...

120
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,200

121
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,925
I recognize the handwriting

122
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:55,292
as mine.

123
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,022
And here,

124
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:02,316
I see my royal seal.

125
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:10,022
I remember now.

126
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,528
I made an oath with my son.

127
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,416
In return for his death,

128
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,925
I promised

129
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,816
to spare my grandson's life

130
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:34,811
and ensure that he ascends the throne.

131
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,589
As proof of that oath,

132
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:42,605
after my son's death,

133
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,119
I wrote this myself

134
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:52,091
and put my seal on it.

135
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,120
And then…

136
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,500
I hid it over there.

137
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:04,622
I made an oath

138
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:09,509
to do so with my son.

139
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,303
Who did you

140
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,011
make an oath with?

141
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,014
Your father

142
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:31,595
and my son, Prince Sado.

143
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,905
My head hurts.

144
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:47,909
It hurts.

145
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,692
Royal Secretary Jung.

146
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,814
Yes, Your Majesty.

147
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:04,209
Go fetch my daughter,

148
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,916
Princess Hwawan.

149
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,217
Yes, Your Majesty.

150
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:55,324
Princess.

151
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,132
Yes, Father.

152
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,429
Draw near.

153
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:03,829
Come here and take my royal seal.

154
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:08,324
Then deliver the seal yourself.

155
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,132
D-Deliver the seal?

156
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,827
But to whom, Father?

157
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,598
To my grandson.

158
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:27,479
You must do it yourself

159
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:34,659
so that all who are present may understand my intention.

160
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:39,127
Father!

161
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:44,902
How can you give me such a devastating command?

162
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:50,820
All the world will whisper

163
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:55,204
that you have already passed away!

164
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,634
That is what they will think!

165
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,726
Princess,

166
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,118
I am already dead.

167
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:11,504
No, Father.

168
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:17,020
I am already dead as a king.

169
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,420
I am the King.

170
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,221
Therefore, I am dead.

171
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,484
Let those who are present, listen.

172
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:40,226
I will no longer be able

173
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:45,107
to carry out my duties as ruler.

174
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,518
From this moment on,

175
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:52,029
I entrust my seal

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,513
to my grandson and heir.

177
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,300
I plan

178
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,790
to rest from now on.

179
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,529
Princess,

180
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,734
deliver him the royal seal.

181
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:18,323
No, Father! No!

182
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,084
Father…

183
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,531
Aunt!

184
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,224
Take good care of it.

185
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,713
It belongs to you now.

186
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,515
 I don't care if we lose everything.

187
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:54,829
However, we cannot lose the spirit of the Fairy Palace.

188
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,823
We will never trust the King who reigns over this land.

189
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,438
We only have each other,

190
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:07,518
and we can only trust ourselves.

191
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:18,090
No matter how powerful the new King may be, he cannot kill all of us.

192
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,810
We court ladies are the pillars of the royal palace.

193
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,563
Even the King cannot live without us.

194
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,845
That's right.

195
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,806
How about you, Aunt?

196
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,837
What will you do now?

197
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,926
As I have failed,

198
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,799
I must bear the responsibility.

199
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:32,117
What happened?

200
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:35,430
A royal edict has been issued.

201
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,280
From henceforth, the Crown Prince will rule over the police.

202
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,122
Also, His Majesty's personal army will support His Highness.

203
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:48,019
So His Majesty has entrusted the Crown Prince with the army?

204
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,486
Yes.

205
00:21:51,424 --> 00:21:55,735
Also, the royal seal

206
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:59,291
has been entrusted to him.

207
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,908
Oh my!

208
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:02,728
I'm so relieved!

209
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:06,828
It is quite a relief!

210
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,598
- I'm so happy! 
 - Thank you!

211
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,222
Wait, sir.

212
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,418
Yes, Court Lady Seo?

213
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,010
Have you seen Deok Im?

214
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,124
Maiden Sung has gone to the Queen's Palace.

215
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,522
The Queen's Palace?

216
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:57,695
It does not feel as bad since the Crown Prince is indebted to me now.

217
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:01,845
I'm sure he feels deeply grateful for the help you've given him.

218
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,231
Of course, he does.

219
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,585
You've done well today.

220
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:12,302
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,880

222
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,123
 Will the flowers bloom again?

223
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:18,234
Deok Im.

224
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,906
What

225
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,495
are you doing here?

226
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,622
I thought I might see you here, Your Highness.

227
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,114
I waited here to see you.

228
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,926
How is your burn?

229
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:02,902
Does it still hurt?

230
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:07,906
I met with hundreds of subjects today

231
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,303
and was inundated with questions.

232
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,694
However, not one asked me about my burn.

233
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,466
You are the only one.

234
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,214
If you feel about me

235
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:25,811
the way I feel about you,

236
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,886
I thought that you would be here.

237
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,326
I merely

238
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:36,809
was worried about Your Highness's burn.

239
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:40,233
My apologies,

240
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:44,412
but I do not know how to dress your wound since I'm not a physician.

241
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:51,106
I do not care about

242
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:56,086
what you know or do not know how to do.

243
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,723
It is of no importance.

244
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,209
Deok Im.

245
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,798
I have already made my decision.

246
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,225
- Your Highness, I… 
 - Not right now.

247
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,055
There is much I need to ask you

248
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:19,491
and much I need to hear from you.

249
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,306
However, this is not the time.

250
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:24,187
So…

251
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:32,122
I will talk about my feelings later,

252
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:35,506
and also hear

253
00:26:36,822 --> 00:26:38,787
the same from you then.

254
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:17,114
A royal commandment has been issued to imprison you, Head Court Lady Jo.

255
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:21,605
Drag her away!

256
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:23,826
Lord Head Eunuch.

257
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:29,795
You and I have served His Majesty together for many years.

258
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:34,803
During that time, we neither supported nor harmed each other.

259
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:38,530
Please consider that

260
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:42,906
and allow me to walk out of here on my own two feet.

261
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,537
You may do as you wish.

262
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,697
His Majesty wishes to see you.

263
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,322
The Emergency Investigator has returned.

264
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:26,314
He leveled

265
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:30,108
an accusation against you.

266
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:36,699
Why did you try to harm my grandson?

267
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:40,553
It is my petty revenge.

268
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,619
I hated Concubine Yeongbin.

269
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,203
That is why I took revenge on her progeny.

270
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,844
That is all.

271
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,613
Did you despise me?

272
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,924
Did you hate me

273
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:09,394
for abandoning you?

274
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:14,414
After a lifetime of dedication to the royal house,

275
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:18,599
a court lady gets discharged from the palace when she is old and ill.

276
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,102
I did not wish

277
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:24,988
to meet such a miserable fate at the end of my life.

278
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,224
That is why I concocted a plot.

279
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:33,027
I chose you, the son of a lowly servant,

280
00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:35,586
to become King.

281
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,813
I thought I could easily become your concubine.

282
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:49,014
I never dreamed that you would betray me

283
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,820
and bestow the honor on Concubine Yeongbin.

284
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,742
For me, you were always the means to achieve my goals,

285
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:04,422
but my means ruined my goals.

286
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:08,274
So what else could I do but take my revenge?

287
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:11,611
As you know me,

288
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,025
I, too, know you well.

289
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:20,727
Seeing you use such cruel words to arouse my anger,

290
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:26,291
I know that you have come here to die.

291
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:30,920
But there is something you must know.

292
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:38,180
Countless memories have been lost to me

293
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:43,117
and only a few remain.

294
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:48,588
However, there is one thing I do remember.

295
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:54,002
It is the shame of using

296
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:58,791
the true affection you felt for me

297
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:02,009
and discarding you.

298
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,724
I did what I did because I was King.

299
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,730
I thought the King could do that.

300
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:21,181
I have made countless rulings

301
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:24,605
during the decades I have spent on the throne.

302
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:30,158
But I have not made any that I am ashamed of.

303
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:37,316
This will be the first time.

304
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,297
Go far away.

305
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:12,399
Live out your life in comfort.

306
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,938
I do not care what sins you have committed.

307
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:23,263
I do not wish to see you die.

308
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,008
Go.

309
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:39,400
Do you even have the authority to grant me such a reprieve?

310
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,088
Will your subjects even listen to your command?

311
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,808
You are nothing but a sick and senile old man,

312
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,384
still as pompous as you ever were.

313
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:56,800
Why do you grant me your favor now?

314
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:01,888
That favor which I waited for so long to receive,

315
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:09,705
during countless nights spent in sleepless longing,

316
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:15,680
hoping that you might remember your oath to me.

317
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:21,916
Then when the morning came,

318
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,797
I would always realize

319
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:31,795
how foolish it is for a court lady to love a king.

320
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:39,627
Your Majesty, you have always only taken from me.

321
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:46,391
Will you give something to me just once?

322
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,019
What do you want?

323
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,916
Let's see…

324
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,730
What could it be?

325
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:02,642
Heartfelt tears of sadness?

326
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:10,545
What are you doing?

327
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:14,613
There are many ways to die here in the palace.

328
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:19,097
As you see, I have my own way.

329
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:22,281
No! Don't do it!

330
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,711
I have become too shrewd to believe your oath.

331
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:31,570
I am too tired

332
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,844
to believe in Your Majesty's favor.

333
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:38,727
Wait!

334
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,709
No!

335
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:45,602
I told you I'd spare your life!

336
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:49,725
I am the King and I told you I would let you live!

337
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:58,498
Did you hate me this much!

338
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:01,674
How bitter your grudge!

339
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:08,214
How could a woman be so harsh?

340
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:12,405
Oh, why must you be so cruel!

341
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:22,860

342
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:40,473
I beg of you, Your Highness!

343
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:43,502
I will die in her place!

344
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:46,818
Please let my mother live!

345
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,826
I have no reason to kill you.

346
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:54,899
If I nullify the adoption, you will no longer be Princess Hwawan's son.

347
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:58,909
You will become a commoner, but your life will be spared.

348
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:02,129
My mother will always be my mother,

349
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:05,829
and I will die as her son.

350
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:09,500
Please allow me to do so.

351
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,330
Do you think I will grant your request?

352
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:23,509
Long ago, Your Highness begged His Majesty

353
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:26,509
to kill you

354
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,199
and let your father live.

355
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:33,230
Although your wish was not granted,

356
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,818
please have the mercy to grant mine.

357
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:45,512
Please allow me this request.

358
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:57,821
What happened?

359
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,820
Did you meet the Crown Prince?

360
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,585
What did he say?

361
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:05,457
He hates me, doesn't he?

362
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,018
Will he not forgive me?

363
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,520
Rest assured, Mother.

364
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,502
The Crown Prince has given his oath to spare your life.

365
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:22,785
I wager that Father told him to do so.

366
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,716
What a relief.

367
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:28,224
I will go see Father at once.

368
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:32,215
Wait.

369
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,376
Will you listen to your son for a moment?

370
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:43,698
When I became your son,

371
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,698
all the world was envious

372
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:55,698
since a commoner became the King's grandson overnight.

373
00:38:56,502 --> 00:39:01,785
Households of repute would not give me their son.

374
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:06,272
So after much searching,

375
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:09,788
when I decided to adopt the son of a fisherman,

376
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:12,751
I did so with much regret,

377
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,001
but that doesn't mean I disliked you.

378
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:21,598
You

379
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,490
remind me of my late husband.

380
00:39:27,122 --> 00:39:29,684
Had I bore a son,

381
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:33,051
I suspect he would resemble you.

382
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,184
What you have said is enough.

383
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,396
Why are you prostrating yourself?

384
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:55,787
Are you going away?

385
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,590
When…

386
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:11,113
When I became your son,

387
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:13,727
I was overjoyed.

388
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:19,112
It is not because you are a princess.

389
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:24,580
I lost my mother as soon as I was born.

390
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,170
Since then,

391
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:33,066
I had never

392
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,715
called anyone "mother."

393
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,885
So when I called you

394
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:44,684
"mother" for the first time,

395
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:49,370
do you have any idea how happy I was?

396
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:59,105
I will always be grateful to you

397
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:07,559
and will repay the debt of gratitude if only in the next life.

398
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:57,950
Son! Son! Where are you going?

399
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:02,317
Come back to me! I will protect you!

400
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:07,212
I am the King's daughter. No one would dare hurt me!

401
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,540
So please come back!

402
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:33,596
Your mother will protect you. Come back!

403
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,689
Don't go, my son!

404
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,723
Your mother will protect you!

405
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:41,312
Don't go! No!

406
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,809
No need.

407
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:05,501
Raise me up.

408
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:25,603
Leave us,

409
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:29,592
all of you.

410
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,586
I said, leave!

411
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,876
I need to say

412
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:01,884
some final things to you.

413
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,770
The first

414
00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:10,618
I tell you as King.

415
00:44:11,697 --> 00:44:14,003
Henceforth,

416
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:22,148
you will take the lives of hundreds if not thousands.

417
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:27,925
Whether you want to or not,

418
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,337
you will have to take lives.

419
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:38,712
Do what you must.

420
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,701
That is

421
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:47,603
the burden that you must carry as King.

422
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:52,018
Another

423
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:57,307
I say to you as your grandfather.

424
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:08,692
Please forgive your grandfather.

425
00:45:11,517 --> 00:45:14,665
I've committed many sins,

426
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:21,811
but always with the best of intentions.

427
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,907
So please forgive me.

428
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,103
San.

429
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:39,142
Now,

430
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,173
you are

431
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:46,289
the King of Joseon.

432
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,011
See?

433
00:45:57,393 --> 00:46:01,023
I've kept my oath, boy.

434
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:04,111
Right?

435
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,131
Your Majesty.

436
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:40,407
Y-Your Majesty?

437
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:47,798
Grandfather...

438
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,204
Grandfather.

439
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:03,017
Why did you have to leave like this?

440
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:09,975
After all the suffering

441
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:13,696
that you've put me through.

442
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:19,128
You took my father.

443
00:47:20,653 --> 00:47:23,284
You took my grandmother.

444
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:27,804
You are to blame for everything.

445
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,307
All of that

446
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:35,921
was your fault!

447
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:43,625
I cannot forgive you.

448
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:47,431
I cannot forgive you ever!

449
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,331
Grandfather…

450
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:07,117
Please come back to me…

451
00:48:11,012 --> 00:48:12,868
Your grandson

452
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:19,467
is so scared that he can barely breathe.

453
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:27,361
Please come back to me.

454
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:32,932
Please come back!

455
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:56,014
His Majesty has passed away.

456
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,861
From now on, we are the court ladies of the King's Palace.

457
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,835
As servants of the King,

458
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:06,790
we must not make any mistakes. Do you understand?

459
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,214
Yes, my lady.

460
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:12,807
Let us prepare to leave for the King's palace.

461
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:15,511
Yes, my lady.

462
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:40,811
Be careful.

463
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,180

464
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,720

465
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:21,012
 "With the one that loves and has affection for me, I will hold your hand and part with you."

466
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:23,523
 Do you even understand what you are reading?

467
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:25,010
 You complain about everything.

468
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,998
 I can see everything.

469
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:29,559
 Keep reading.

470
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,807
 I wish to hear your voice.

471
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:06,791
We made this together for Court Lady Park.

472
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:11,279
She should have new clothes for her journey to the next world.

473
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:15,360
Let's go to her grave and burn it.

474
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,936
She seemed to be at peace when she passed away.

475
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:25,619
I'm sure she went to a better place.

476
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,555
Yes.

477
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:30,183
Thanks, you guys.

478
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:39,709
Last night, while I was on an errand,

479
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:43,430
I saw them carry out the Head Court Lady.

480
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:58,988
 She was covered in a straw mat.

481
00:52:02,008 --> 00:52:07,775
So that was the end of the person who oversaw 700 court ladies.

482
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:14,805
Do you guys remember when they carried Concubine Yeongbin out?

483
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:19,114
Both the Head Court Lady and Concubine Yeongbin

484
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:23,006
were court ladies like us.

485
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,993
 But their lives ended quite differently.

486
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:29,705
 Concubine Yeongbin probably wasn't that happy.

487
00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:32,608
Court Lady Park said that

488
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:37,788
Concubine Yeongbin blamed herself for her son's death

489
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,922
until the day she died.

490
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,413
How can a court lady live a happy and fulfilling life?

491
00:52:48,413 --> 00:52:52,100
I think you just need to live the way you want.

492
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:59,305
To not care about what others think and live as you wish,

493
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:01,297
that must be happiness.

494
00:53:01,297 --> 00:53:03,814
Then how do you wish to live?

495
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:09,000
Like right now, with you guys by my side,

496
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:16,003
sharing each other's joys as well as each other's burdens,

497
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,009
living in peace.

498
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:22,923
I don't want things to change.

499
00:53:23,697 --> 00:53:27,016
I hope that everything can stay as it is.

500
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:33,381
Things can't stay the same.

501
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:37,511
Actually, things have already changed.

502
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:42,191
We are court ladies who must serve the King until we die.

503
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:44,900
And the King has changed.

504
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:53,778
From now on, everything will change.

505
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,788
 All responsibility belongs to the King.

506
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:12,315
 Until now, when things went awry,

507
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:17,798
 I could come here and blame you, Your Majesty.

508
00:56:18,718 --> 00:56:25,274
 Everything was as easy and simple as that.

509
00:56:26,304 --> 00:56:29,400
 Is the Crown Prince, who died in the Year of the Horse, your father?

510
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,221
 Prince Sado who died a criminal?

511
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:41,405
 If he is your father, you must live as a sinner's son all your life.

512
00:56:42,111 --> 00:56:46,890
 San, if I lose you,

513
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,293
 I won't be able to go on.

514
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:55,038
 San…

515
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:00,716
 You scoundrel!

516
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:04,449
 San, you can mend your ways!

517
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:08,984
 You can mend your ways. I know it!

518
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:17,612
 Some day when you sit on that throne,

519
00:57:19,294 --> 00:57:24,960
 you will truly understand me.

520
00:57:39,841 --> 00:57:44,996
 Now, my sky has fallen,

521
00:57:44,996 --> 00:57:48,412
 and I have become the new sky.

522
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,793
 I am so scared

523
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:56,810
 that I can hardly breathe.

524
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,407
Still,

525
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:15,210
I will never run or hide.

526
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:21,110
From now on,

527
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,030
everything is my responsibility.

528
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:17,892
Let's buy a present for Bok Yeon.

529
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:19,419
All right.

530
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:26,160
Wait. Let me choose.

531
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:38,387
Let's buy this.

532
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:44,247
This is delicious.

533
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,325
 Give us two rice stews!

534
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:51,173
Are you sure we are supposed to meet Bok Yeon here?

535
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:52,316
Yes.

536
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:53,741
Maybe she is running late?

537
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:56,019
 Miss, give me a rice stew.

538
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:59,003
 Sure. Welcome!

539
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:02,109
Please take a seat.

540
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:04,119
Bok Yeon…

541
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:07,814
Bok Yeon!

542
01:00:07,814 --> 01:00:10,484
You guys are here. Have you been well?

543
01:00:10,484 --> 01:00:15,917
Yes, Bok Yeon, have you been working here since you left the palace?

544
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:17,116
Yes.

545
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:21,990
My aunt owns this place and she pays me well.

546
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:26,410
You must be hungry. Wait a little. How about some rice stew?

547
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,620
That sounds good.

548
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:33,179
When are we getting our stew?

549
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:34,097
Hold on.

550
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,403
What is taking so long?

551
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:37,047
It's almost done.

552
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:41,410
- Give us a bottle of rice wine. 
 - Right up!

553
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,278
Did you wait long?

554
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,651
We would like a plate of meat.

555
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:00,309
Of course.

556
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:02,221
Thank you. I would like a cup of rice wine.

557
01:01:02,221 --> 01:01:04,294
We have been waiting forever. Can you please give us our food?

558
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,883
Okay. Hold on.

559
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:11,008
Will you wait?

560
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,417
Who is she?

561
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:18,614
Jeez, she is scary.

562
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:19,997
Hurry!

563
01:01:19,997 --> 01:01:23,115
Okay. Here.

564
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,284
This is chewy. It's so good.

565
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:37,090
You guys haven't changed a bit.

566
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:39,528
Why have you changed so much?

567
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:40,997
Just look at you!

568
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,614
Don't you know that a court lady is always a court lady?

569
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:46,314
You're a court lady even if you have left the palace!

570
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:49,011
How could you dress like this?

571
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:52,793
- I'm leaving. 
 - Don't go. I've missed you so much.

572
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,108
I don't want to see you like this.

573
01:02:01,187 --> 01:02:03,784
She's sulking again.

574
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640

575
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:12,118
Eat up.

576
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:13,801
All right. Let's eat.

577
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,121
This is so good.

578
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:17,710
Right? Enjoy the food.

579
01:02:53,476 --> 01:02:55,214
Maiden Sung!

580
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:03,015
Head Guardsman, please tell His Majesty I have brought him his medicinal broth.

581
01:03:03,015 --> 01:03:06,484
There is no need. After all, it is you who brought it.

582
01:03:06,484 --> 01:03:09,323
Go in before the broth becomes cold.

583
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:20,420
The factions are only loyal unto themselves.

584
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,318
Anyone who betrays that loyalty is considered an enemy.

585
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:30,500
They consider the King as a tool to grab power.

586
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,740
They are always courting me to their side.

587
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:36,282
I can stand it no longer.

588
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:41,112
The fact that factions are always in pursuit of their own interests is only a minor problem.

589
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:44,400
They ostracize those that do not agree with them,

590
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,898
making governance impossible and blocking people from talking to His Majesty.

591
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:51,062
Please tread carefully, Your Majesty.

592
01:03:51,062 --> 01:03:55,410
 The previous King tried to remain impartial but to no avail.

593
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:59,321
In his attempt to remain impartial,

594
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:03,390
he gave out ministry positions equally to each faction

595
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,429
 without regard to talent or ability.

596
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:09,399
 More important was to show no favoritism.

597
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:14,056
 However, true impartiality cannot be achieved that way.

598
01:04:14,056 --> 01:04:17,509
Your Majesty, a maid has brought your medicinal broth.

599
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:22,212
I'm not saying we can rid ourselves of corrupted factions overnight.

600
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:27,686
However, they must not be allowed to keep people from talking to me.

601
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:31,711
Everyone in this kingdom must have a way to talk to me.

602
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:35,391
I must not be left in the dark about any matter.

603
01:04:35,391 --> 01:04:38,673
Your Majesty, the broth is getting cold.

604
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:41,790
Stop bothering me!

605
01:04:48,812 --> 01:04:51,600
How long have you been standing there?

606
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:02,357
For a few hours, Your Majesty.

607
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,312
Leave it and go.

608
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:07,285
Your Majesty, it is my duty to see that you drink--

609
01:05:07,285 --> 01:05:10,278
I told you to leave it.

610
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:11,989
Yes, Your Majesty.

611
01:06:06,575 --> 01:06:08,906
The medicinal broth is cold.

612
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:12,700
My apologies, Your Majesty. I will reheat it.

613
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,812
That's not what I meant.

614
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:19,340
It seems I kept you waiting for a long time again.

615
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:24,414
It was not on purpose.

616
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:01,392
I will serve you sugar-coated ginger.

617
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:23,314
Wait.

618
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,726
I have something to say.

619
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:33,806
The three-year mourning period is over.

620
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:36,083
And I have

621
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:40,608
taken care of the most pressing matters after my ascension.

622
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:45,710
You probably know what I am going to say.

623
01:07:51,593 --> 01:07:54,119
I want to keep you by my side,

624
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:58,830
not as a court lady,

625
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,580
but as a woman.

626
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:08,820
What I am saying is that

627
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:14,080
I want you to become my concubine.

628
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:28,597
I'll give you some time so think about it.

629
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:32,313
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:45,941
Deok Im…

631
01:08:52,008 --> 01:08:57,050
I want you to become my family.

632
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,980

633
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:19,020
♫  Your smile full of sunshine  ♫

634
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:25,970
♫  that came to me like a dream  ♫

635
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:33,170
♫  If I walk a little slower, can I keep it?  ♫

636
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:39,750
♫  As much as it hurts  ♫

637
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,740
♫  Your face shining  ♫

638
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:54,090
♫  through the cloudy clouds  ♫

639
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,000
♫  It keeps hurting  ♫
