1
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,200

2
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,760

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,020

4
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:14,825
I alone decide your fate.

5
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,930
Everything you own…

6
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:23,289
belongs to me.

7
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,818
I decide whether you live

8
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,353
or whether you die.

9
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,041
Never…

10
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,008
forget that.

11
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,470

12
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,256
Where on earth can His Highness be…

13
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:48,187
You go check Juhamnu Pavilion and you go check Gyeongindang Pavilion.

14
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:50,153
Yes, Sir.

15
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,596
 The doctor visits the King far too often…

16
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,435
 Is there anything besides the medicine for a stomachache?

17
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,322
We are looking for ginseng and high-quality Poria mushrooms.

18
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,165
 Poria mushrooms...

19
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,346
Still, could he really…

20
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,240
The head guardsman is on board.

21
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,436
Anyhow, I'd better head back.

22
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,083
Sir Preceptor.

23
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:56,732
The person who just left was that His Majesty's royal doctor?

24
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:59,746
Yes, that's right.

25
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:03,595
It would have made a fuss if he had been seen by others.

26
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,161
Thank goodness it is you, Sir.

27
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,973
What is this?

28
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:26,178
The Crown Prince ordered that the doctor should not be approached.

29
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,158
His orders cannot be ignored.

30
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,114
Please remember that.

31
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:39,288
I plan to bring the doctor

32
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,865
to the next meeting.

33
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,980
Sir Preceptor!

34
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,255
So let's wait and see…

35
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:50,011
whether His HIghness forgives me…

36
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,941
or not…

37
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,553
- I will do the rest. 
 - Then I will be back.

38
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:11,992
Okay.

39
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,203
My lady…

40
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,016
Where is Young Hee?

41
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,504
She went to the sewing room for an errand.

42
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,211
So I'll have to go alone…

43
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:44,044
If it's okay, I'll come with you.

44
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,870
I don't want to trouble you.

45
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,347
It'll be too difficult to go alone.

46
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,532
My lady, shall I just deliver it myself?

47
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:16,548
No… I have to personally

48
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:19,256
give it to His Highness the Crown Prince.

49
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:22,951
It is difficult for anyone other than his quarter maids to see him.

50
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:28,480
Come now… He will make time for this old lady.

51
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,735
I was  Crown Prince Sado 's… 
  (T/N: Yi San's deceased father)

52
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,699
nursemaid.

53
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:54,130
How difficult it must have been for you to come all this way.

54
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:59,757
I wonder… what are you trying to deliver?

55
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,073
I need to speak to you privately.

56
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,773
This evening, please come to my chamber.

57
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,768
Yes, my lady.

58
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,568
Off you go then.

59
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,935
What is this all about?

60
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:53,085
I said the doctor was not to be approached.

61
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:56,894
Then I should be punished for disregarding your orders.

62
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:02,394
However, please listen to what the doctor has to say.

63
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,684
Many people have begun to notice.

64
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,492
Your Highness needs to know as well.

65
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,486
Preceptor Hong deceived me!

66
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,298
I thought it was you who called me here, Your Highness.

67
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,686
 That is why I came.

68
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:24,514
 Please spare me, Your Highness!

69
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:29,054
I will never reveal what happened here!

70
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,873
Sir Preceptor is my man.

71
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,827
Because one of my own called you here,

72
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,416
I will guarantee your safety.

73
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,076
Tell me now…

74
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,061
What was the reason he disobeyed my orders

75
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,758
and called you here?

76
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,570

77
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,870

78
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:18,149
The doctors of the royal medical office

79
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,449
prescribed  Chungmaetang  to His Majesty.
 (T/N: Medicine to treat dementia)

80
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:32,423
So His Majesty…

81
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,424
has dementia.

82
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:48,741
Did you ask me to come, my lady?

83
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:01,636
I didn't plan to do it this soon.

84
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,170
But

85
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,180
I feel a sense of foreboding.

86
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:12,127
If we don't hurry, we may miss our chance.

87
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:25,213
I have always trusted my intuition.

88
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:31,142
We have to look after His Highness the Crown Prince.

89
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,801
Whether he'll become like the late  Crown Prince Sado … 
  (T/N: Yi San's father)

90
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:38,700
whether that scary incident of the year of the horse will repeat… 
  (T/N: Crown Prince Sado was executed then)

91
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,079
I have to know.

92
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,340
For the 700 court ladies I direct,

93
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,903
for all of us,

94
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:53,631
would you please go and do this?

95
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,587
Won't you become His Highness's concubine

96
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,341
and act as my eyes and ears?

97
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,937
I beg this of you.

98
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:20,324
There's no need to scheme.

99
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,976
We only need to trust in the Crown Prince.

100
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:29,564
I believe in His Highness. He will become a wise king.

101
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:34,736
He will never become like his late father.

102
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,859
Now that I have heard your thoughts,

103
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:46,246
you may go.

104
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,545
- Leave no corner unsearched! 
 - Yes, my lady.

105
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:38,471
You wench, stop right there!

106
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,815
No, you can't!

107
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,915
What's going on?

108
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,118
 My lady.

109
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,740
Is this yours?

110
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:37,095
I asked if it's yours.

111
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,195

112
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,597
It's mine, my lady.

113
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,940
- Take her. 
  - Yes, my lady.

114
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,909
 Deok Im!

115
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,986
My lady, it's just one book.

116
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:58,824
Is it a forbidden folk tale novel?

117
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:02,008
I'll make sure Deok Im understands…

118
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:05,660
Do you know what this book is?

119
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,645
This book is "Yeo Beom." 
  (Book of female norms)

120
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:10,211
It was once in the possession of the late Her Royal Highness Yeongbin!

121
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,814
Pardon?

122
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:26,164
My lady, the disciplinary court lady has gone.

123
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:30,604
And did she find something suitably horrible?

124
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,960
The late Yeongbin's book?

125
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,730

126
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,739

127
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,216
Try Yeongbin's seal.

128
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,326
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:25,927
So it is truly the late Yeongbin's book after all.

130
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:29,887
So it's true that you stole one of the possessions of the late concubine.

131
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,073
This is a misunderstanding, Your Highness. I did not steal it.

132
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,858
Court Lady Seo.

133
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,558
Yes, Your Highness.

134
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:42,725
What is the punishment for stealing royal properties?

135
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:46,418
According to the legal codes of Joseon,

136
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,136
anyone who steals royal possessions…

137
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,464
is to be punished by beheading.

138
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,601
Sung Deok Im.

139
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,190
Yes, Your Highness.

140
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,464
This is quite a difficult situation.

141
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:03,732
You haven't even the slightest acquaintance with the late Yeongbin.

142
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,288
And yet you carry one of her things.

143
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,396
What am I to make of this?

144
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:17,169
I can explain, Your Highness. Please give me a chance to do so.

145
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,450
All right, then do so.

146
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:30,198
It happened in the year that Lady Yeongbin died.

147
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:49,079
So the business with the doctor… Did nothing come of it?

148
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,053
Being forgiven so easily… Is that strange to you?

149
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:57,302
The Crown Prince is not one to forgive lightly.

150
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:01,612
If a subordinate disregards an order, he always gives punishment. However…

151
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,099
you were quite the exception.

152
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,673
I'm excessively favored then.

153
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:13,343
Are you jealous?

154
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,770
It's not jealousy, you…

155
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,417
One must be punished to absolve impropriety.

156
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,217
It's the only way to prevent future improprieties, and…

157
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,925
if I were you, I'd request one hundred lashes at least.

158
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,013
That's what a man does, isn't it?

159
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:37,287
My affairs… are my business alone.

160
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,463
You…

161
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,424
Sir Preceptor! Sir Preceptor!

162
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,310
Maiden, you are...

163
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,295
Do you remember me, Sir?

164
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:02,323
Of course. What brings you here, Maiden Kim?

165
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:07,490
So you remember me, Sir… At the well, I—

166
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,853
Sir, we come to beg for your help.

167
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,739
Could you please to tell His Highness the Crown Prince

168
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,692
that handmaid, Sung Deok Im, was dragged off to the Queen's palace?

169
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,982
She's being interrogated by the Queen.

170
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,505
- Interrogated? 
 - Maiden Sung?

171
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,195
Yes, Sir.

172
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:34,955
So you are saying everything you told me is the truth.

173
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,305
I swear to you, Your Highness.

174
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,410
Do you have any proof or someone

175
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,450
to corroborate it?

176
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,854
Do you?

177
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,542
I do not, Your Highness.

178
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,230
Your Highness,

179
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,240
the Crown Prince requests an audience.

180
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,317
What shall I say?

181
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,093
Send him in.

182
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,251
Your Highness.

183
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:28,197
Were you so worried that I would hurt a member of your staff

184
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,830
that you ran all the way here?

185
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,058
That is impossible.

186
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,760
I was simply sorry

187
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,050
that one of my maids had worried you.

188
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,074
Do you know what she's done?

189
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,709
I heard she had one of late Lady Yeongbin's things.

190
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:51,985
She tells me that it was His Majesty who gave it to her.

191
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,740
She says she met him

192
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,410
when she was an apprentice maid.

193
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,513
What shall we do?

194
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,640
Is it appropriate

195
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,890
to trust her tale

196
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,097
without any evidence?

197
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:16,434
His Majesty cared so much for the late Lady Yeongbin…

198
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:19,050
Would he really

199
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,167
have given her possession away to a mere apprentice maid?

200
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,337
It's…

201
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,634
difficult to believe.

202
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,780
Even your master cannot believe it.

203
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,711
As there are no witnesses nor evidence,

204
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,422
it's a very tricky situation.

205
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:49,924
The exalted King of this land

206
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,860
gave the late Lady Yeongbin's property to me long ago

207
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,359
when I was an apprentice maid.

208
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,620
Even to my ears, it sounds ridiculous,

209
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,367
so I understand why my master would not believe it.

210
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,264
But I proclaim it the truth a hundred times over.

211
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:09,418
I did not steal the late Lady Yeongbin's book.

212
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,280
I earned the book

213
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,290
so that book is mine.

214
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,800
I beg you pardon, but

215
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
it is inappropriate to say that there is no witness.

216
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,222
As it was His Majesty who gave me the book,

217
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,522
he is the only witness I can call.

218
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,658
I beg you, Your Highness.

219
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,380
Please…

220
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,087
please do not fault me for what I have not done, Your Highness.

221
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,257
We do not dare to ask His Majesty,

222
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,387
the supreme king, to offer himself as a witness for a mere maid, but...

223
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,086
You are a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace.

224
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:49,293
If your master begs me, then...

225
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:56,680
Your Highness, if His Majesty

226
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,421
cannot recall old memories,

227
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,621
what happens then?

228
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,070
According to the law,

229
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,398
those who steal royal possessions

230
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,897
are sentenced to death.

231
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,470
Then...

232
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,720
I beg you...

233
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:15,980
as Maiden Sung has contributed a lot as a maid of my court,

234
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,500
please treat her leniently,

235
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,313
and simply exile her from the palace.

236
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:29,041
Do you mean it?

237
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,990
How could we possibly

238
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,250
bring such lowly business to the King?

239
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,540
As it stands,

240
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,170
it's difficult to prove

241
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,560
that she stole it,

242
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,224
so executing her is too much.

243
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,250
Exile

244
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,480
will be sufficient.

245
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:55,080
It would be best to simply

246
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:57,577
resolve this quickly.

247
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:03,504
Will you accept this punishment?

248
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,096
Your Highness,

249
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,480
you are the mother

250
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,380
of everyone in this land Joseon.

251
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,460
Therefore,

252
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,292
as a child would beg for her mother's mercy,

253
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,903
please...

254
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,640
Please allow me an audience with His Majesty,

255
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,600
so I may ask one question.

256
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,284
I did not steal it.

257
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:31,284
If I am exiled for a crime I did not commit,

258
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:34,795
there will be no greater shame for me as a palace maid.

259
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,962
Please…

260
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:41,650
give me one chance, Your Highness.

261
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:58,665
The Crown Prince is your master.

262
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:02,358
The Crown Prince won't give you a chance to prove you innocent.

263
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:04,808
If I should give you a chance...

264
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,510
that wouldn't be a bad idea.

265
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,049
So bitter.

266
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,815
I don't remember that,

267
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:33,448
so all of you go now.

268
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:38,943
Your Majesty, her life depends on your answer.

269
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,311
Please, try once more to remember.

270
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:45,995
How can you ask me to remember something from so long ago?

271
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:56,950
I may very well have given the book.

272
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,970
That would have been

273
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,030
a very special day for a little child.

274
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,440
But for me,

275
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,090
it would have been nothing at all.

276
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:11,685
How do I remember something so unmemorable?

277
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,685
It's not like you,

278
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:17,640
asking something

279
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,860
so trivial of me.

280
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,175
Long ago,

281
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:28,430
this maid transcribed a book and gave it to you, Your Majesty.

282
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,070
I remember how happy you were that day…

283
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,224
and so I hoped to give her a chance.

284
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,540
Did that maid

285
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,960
give me a book?

286
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:46,290
What book?

287
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,992
A book, you say?

288
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:56,426
What sort of book?

289
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,120
Oh, my head,

290
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,190
I have a headache.

291
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,190
Well, come on now.

292
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,560
Punish her

293
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,840
as the law requires.

294
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,521
As it seems you don't want to sentence her to death,

295
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:14,927
I'll choose her punishment.

296
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,880
That maid

297
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,690
will have her heels cut

298
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,149
and be exiled from the palace.

299
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:27,558
Now, all of you go.

300
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:35,112
Please wait a moment, Your Majesty.

301
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:42,096
If we maim her and send her away from the palace,

302
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,923
she's no better than dead, Your Majesty.

303
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:47,580
Therefore, someone's fate

304
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,400
is dependent on you.

305
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,430
Your Majesty, you have always

306
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,530
given me lessons.

307
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:58,240
"As the King of Joseon,"

308
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,173
"you hold in your hands the absolute power over life and death."

309
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,682
"As your subjects were bestowed by heaven,"

310
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,312
"if we do not treat each life as uniquely valuable,"

311
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:11,830
"we are not qualified"

312
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,480
"to lead them."

313
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:19,115
I humbly request

314
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,090
that you allow

315
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,110
your subject

316
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:26,822
a bit more of your time, Your Majesty.

317
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,615
If I cannot protect my heaven-sent subject

318
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:44,442
just because I cannot recall the incident,

319
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:49,962
I'm unfit to lead the country, eh?

320
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,613
Come here.

321
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,150
Tell me what happened.

322
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,870
Very thoroughly.

323
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,620
Who knows?

324
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,680
I might be able to remember.

325
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:14,247
Do you suppose

326
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:15,830
you can

327
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,100
summon my forgotten memories?

328
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:37,370
First, please accept

329
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,820
my apology, Your Majesty.

330
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:42,941
Apology?

331
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:46,685
It will certainly be a painful memory.

332
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:50,112
So I ask forgiveness now

333
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:52,578
before I remind you of that, Your Majesty.

334
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,596
All right.

335
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,938
May we light the incense?

336
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,960
It was when Lady Yeongbin

337
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,300
passed away in the year of the monkey.

338
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,061
When I was a little apprentice maid,

339
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,500
the Head Court Lady ordered me

340
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,460
to go pay final respects to the lady Yeongbin.

341
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,890
In the gardens,

342
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,220
there was a line of lanterns.

343
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,944
I followed those lanterns

344
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,776
until I found Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber.

345
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:50,340
 If you follow the lights,

346
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,112
 you can go to Lady Yeongbin.

347
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,740
 Inside the hall

348
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,610
 on that dark night,

349
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,208
 yellow candles danced and flickered.

350
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,550
 The room was full of incense.

351
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,617
 Outside the hall, the air was exceedingly hot and humid,

352
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:14,971
 but inside it was eerily cold.

353
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:19,168
 The icy chamber where the lady lay

354
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,591
 seemed to surround her in a protective embrace.

355
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:26,230
 It was there

356
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,500
 I saw Your Majesty.

357
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,050
 Your Majesty saw me there

358
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,250
 and said these words.

359
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:39,378
 You look like Princess Hwa Pyeong when she was little.

360
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:42,970
Your Majesty then honored me

361
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,870
by telling me of Lady Yeongbin.

362
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,830
 She used to be beautiful

363
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,300
 in her younger days.

364
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,896
 She was a court lady, like you.

365
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:59,156
 The ends of her sleeves were very red

366
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,922
 Every time I saw them,

367
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,514
 my heart ached so much.

368
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,137
"Even ice"

369
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,693
"can't be colder than my heart."

370
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,793
 Even ice

371
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:16,220
 can't be colder than my heart.

372
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,965
 I have really lost her.

373
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:24,370
 Now…

374
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:28,489
 she won't ever come back.

375
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:32,330
The image of Your Majesty crying as you uttered those words

376
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,930
is still fresh in my mind.

377
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,442
Afterward…

378
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:42,799
Your Majesty bestowed upon me a book of Lady Yeongbin's.

379
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,990
 Here, take it.

380
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,550
 It's a book

381
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,810
 Lady Yeongbin wrote herself.

382
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,909
You unbelievable rascal!

383
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,687
To save your life

384
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,921
you got me crying, didn't you?

385
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:17,410
I apologize, Your Majesty.

386
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:24,034
Do you perhaps remember that day, Your Majesty?

387
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,897
I don't!

388
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:30,633
You will be maimed and sent away!

389
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,794
Do you know…

390
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,390
why I gave you

391
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,060
Lady Yeongbin's book?

392
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,883
Do you not remember?

393
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,873
I do not, Your Majesty.

394
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,426
You said…

395
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:04,205
you wanted to become a maid with great handwriting.

396
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:08,453
That's why I gave it to you.

397
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,332
Lady Yeongbin had beautiful penmanship.

398
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,936
Still…

399
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,851
it was good giving it to you.

400
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,936
Sung Deok Im.

401
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,000
You…

402
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,460
have excellent handwriting.

403
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:43,260
You favor me, Your Majesty.

404
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,825
You have great handwriting.

405
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,670

406
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:21,280
The life of a palace maid

407
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,560
isn't easy.

408
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,980
It's not easy

409
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,300
to be a prince, either.

410
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:36,383
Take it.

411
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:40,554
It's yours.

412
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,470

413
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,780
The night you went to Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber...

414
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,588
you… weren't alone, were you?

415
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,109
Is it true?

416
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:59,852
How does Your Highness know—

417
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:01,962
Is it true?

418
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,597
Yes.

419
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,523
Prince.

420
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,969
Your Highness.

421
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,565
You've had a rough day.

422
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:31,226
Go back to the prince's palace.

423
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:33,975
Yes, Your Highness.

424
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,784
Are you still looking at that?

425
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:10,217
It's so pretty!

426
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:14,130
Please tell the maiden how thankful I am.

427
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,591
Is it that great?

428
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,513
Yes, it is.

429
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,400
It's not special.

430
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,920
It's really nothing.

431
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,209
It's what was left behind

432
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,056
after making the royal clothes.

433
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,991
The lowly palace maids might be satisfied with that kind of thing,

434
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,967
but you can't do the same.

435
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:49,730
Brother, why do you look at the sky like that?

436
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:52,370
Because I wonder…

437
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,670
when this tiresome night will end.

438
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,461
In your brother's heart…

439
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,722
there is a sun that is as bright as fire.

440
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:05,277
I wish that the sun would rise from the east,

441
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:09,144
with all my heart, you know.

442
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:11,844
Only then will…

443
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:14,669
the people of the world know my name.

444
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:19,201
Your dreams will come true, Brother.

445
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:24,148
I believe in you.

446
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:35,348
You said you liked the palace, right?

447
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,524
I did.

448
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,391
That's enough then.

449
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:39,804
 Your Majesty.

450
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,732
So you're all here.

451
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,830
Though we might hate it,

452
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:59,742
there are times we must follow the will of heaven.

453
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,921
Do you remember the actions

454
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,900
I was forced to take in  the year of the horse ? 
  (T/N: Crown Prince Sado was executed)

455
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:13,060
I did it all

456
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,900
for my subjects in Joseon.

457
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,981
Those who needed to disappear were made to disappear,

458
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:22,514
while those who needed to be deposed were deposed.

459
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,130
Even if that meant

460
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,540
removing me!

461
00:40:30,198 --> 00:40:35,568
When I thought of those capable of

462
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,260
devote their lives in protecting the Crown Prince,

463
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,178
you were the ones that came to mind.

464
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:53,551
I earnestly ask

465
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:57,490
that in the times to come,

466
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,200
all of you will do

467
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:04,995
the difficult things needed without giving up!

468
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,533
 Will the time finally draw near?

469
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:33,422
 The night you went to Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber…

470
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:35,856
 you weren't alone were you?

471
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:38,713
How did he know?

472
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,795
What is this?

473
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,353
Are you guys sleeping here tonight?

474
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:52,694
I knew it. You haven't even laid out the comforter yet.

475
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,377
You should get some rest.

476
00:41:56,062 --> 00:41:58,437
Did you come because you were worried about me?

477
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:01,205
Are you laughing? You almost died today!

478
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:04,094
Yes, we were really worried.

479
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:08,347
Sleeping together like this...

480
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,447
it is like we are back to the good old apprentice days, isn't it?

481
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,157
Should I tell you guys an old story?

482
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:20,521
What's up, Young Hee? You're not one to tell stories.

483
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:25,343
A long time ago, I heard a story from Court Lady Park…

484
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:29,588
She told me to never tell anyone else, but…

485
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,444
I really want to tell you guys.

486
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:36,844
A long, long, very long time ago,

487
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:40,854
there were celestial fairies who lived on the moon.

488
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:44,253
The name of their moon palace was…

489
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,209
Gwanghan Palace.

490
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:50,286
The fairies, they lived there happily,

491
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:52,683
without any worries at all.

492
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:56,106
One day, the fairies looked down from the above,

493
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,666
and there they saw a magnificent king ruling a kingdom.

494
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:04,450
The fairies wanted to serve the king,

495
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,039
so they all came down from the moon and became palace maids.

496
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,661
 The king was very happy

497
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:17,332
 and promised to always treat them well.

498
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:23,419
During the great reign of peace, that promise was well kept.

499
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,245
The fairies lived happily.

500
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:32,742
But then one day, war arose out of nowhere.

501
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:36,346
 The king abandoned the palace and fled.

502
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:40,270
 The king threw off his royal robe,

503
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,560
 abandoned his subjects,

504
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:45,289
and abandoned the fairies, too.

505
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:48,038
Taking only strong men,

506
00:43:48,038 --> 00:43:51,537
who could protect him, he went far away.

507
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:56,704
And then? The king never returned?

508
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:59,104
He did return.

509
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,286
So the fairies lived happily again?

510
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,276
The king returned

511
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:08,097
and berated the fairies.

512
00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:12,321
He said that they, his women, had lost their chastity,

513
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:16,564
and he chased them away.

514
00:44:16,564 --> 00:44:21,617
New fairies can always come down from the moon, he said.

515
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,715
He chased the old fairies away,

516
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:30,236
saying he'd only be satisfied with new young fairies.

517
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,690
That's unforgivable! That king!

518
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:34,558
I'd rip him apart.

519
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:39,234
Hey! What if someone hears you and misunderstands?

520
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:42,282
But what happened to the moon fairies is too sad!

521
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:44,771
It's just a story.

522
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,753
It's just a story, right?

523
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,419
So?

524
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:53,214
And then what happened?

525
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:58,536
He chased all the fairies away

526
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:01,159
until he was left alone in the palace.

527
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:05,711
It was only then that the king realized

528
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:09,088
how much he needed the fairies.

529
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:16,014
Without them, he could no longer function as a king.

530
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,981
 The king's food, clothing, and even his bed…

531
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:24,292
 It all required the fairies.

532
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:30,199
Without them, no king is a king.

533
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:37,335
So the king ordered the old fairies

534
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,898
to return to the palace and resume their work.

535
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,915
 So the old fairies worked as they always had

536
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:48,065
 and taught the young fairies about their responsibilities.

537
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:53,555
The king was satisfied, believing everything had been resolved,

538
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:59,133
but the fairies, they didn't just forget about what happened.

539
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:06,043
They gathered the young fairies and taught them the following.

540
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:11,187
"Never believe the king."

541
00:46:12,657 --> 00:46:15,858
Never believe the king.

542
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:20,142
The only ones we can trust are ourselves.

543
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:25,443
All we have are ourselves.

544
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,779
Don't you ever forget

545
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:32,405
this burned robe,

546
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:34,715
or the king that abandoned us.

547
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,682
Whatever the means,

548
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:42,638
we must always remember

549
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,870
to trust ourselves.

550
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,907
Yes, my lady.

551
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:08,030
 The two of you will work in the royal kitchen at His Majesty's palace from tomorrow.

552
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,387
We welcome you to our group.

553
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,898
There's only one person left.

554
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:43,262
Bring her here.

555
00:48:22,894 --> 00:48:24,671
Court Lady Seo.

556
00:48:28,026 --> 00:48:29,978
M-My lady.

557
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,973
You know where we are, yes?

558
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,396
You lived your whole life in the palace.

559
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:43,641
You have at least heard rumors, have you not?

560
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:46,939
No, I don't know…

561
00:48:46,939 --> 00:48:50,260
Where am I?

562
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,008
Oh no, oh no…

563
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:57,392
I must be dreaming now…

564
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:01,066
My body is weak these days so I've had terrible dreams.

565
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,788
Yes, I'm sure it is a nightmare.

566
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:09,744
If we wrap you up again and beat you with rods,

567
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:12,780
will it wake you from this dream?

568
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:22,370
It's always the same with you.

569
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:26,897
Pretending to be silly, pretending to be useless,

570
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,519
pretending not to know, when you really do.

571
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:33,749
You've lived a long time that way.

572
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,438
I suddenly had a thought…

573
00:49:39,298 --> 00:49:42,987
If I'd gotten you under control sooner,

574
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:47,472
might it have been easier to take control of your student, too?

575
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:52,528
Are you… talking about Deok Im?

576
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,772
Just her?

577
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:59,966
It would have been easier to plant people I need in the Crown Prince's Palace.

578
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:02,776
Am I wrong?

579
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,379
Bring it here.

580
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,748
Make your mark.

581
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:15,817
We welcome you to our Fairy Palace.

582
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:20,331
I look forward to seeing your students among us.

583
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,266
However dull you might truly be,

584
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,677
you now understand what you're to do, yes?

585
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:51,387
How unfair it is.

586
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:56,497
You were always ready to stab me in the back,

587
00:51:57,363 --> 00:52:00,396
but because you're a court lady, and for that reason alone,

588
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:03,208
I can't take your life.

589
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:16,831
Why are you interfering with my plan?

590
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:20,976
To protect our court ladies, I have to appoint a wise king.

591
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,500
You're a court lady.

592
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,290
How can you ignore my struggles and act against me?

593
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,842
The Crown Prince is Prince Sado's son.

594
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,885
How dare you protect a criminal's son?

595
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:41,515
The one who drove the late Prince into lunacy…

596
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:45,393
was it not you yourself?

597
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:50,445
You drove father and son apart.

598
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:53,598
You made His Majesty

599
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:57,839
loathe his own son.

600
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,493
With everyone saying he was insane,

601
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:04,381
it drove him into madness.

602
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,743
What happened in the year of the horse,

603
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:11,829
was it not all your doing?

604
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:16,293
You wretched witch, you lash out at the leader of the Fairy Palace?

605
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,215
But I know…

606
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:22,992
why you hated the late Prince so much.

607
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,582
Because he was the sole son of Lady Yeongbin.

608
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:36,502
The King is the son of a lowly maid.

609
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:41,671
You chose the worthless, insignificant prince.

610
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:45,951
The King must have promised…

611
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:50,750
to make you his wife.

612
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,718
Shut up.

613
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:56,675
But then as soon as His Majesty succeeded to the throne,

614
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:59,652
he then chose Lady Yeongbin.

615
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:05,962
Your closest friend, Lady Yeongbin…

616
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,740
You are quite something!

617
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,517
And now, haven't you gotten your revenge?

618
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:20,909
You killed

619
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,893
the child of His Majesty

620
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,174
and Lady Yeongbin.

621
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:31,510
Shut up.

622
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:34,398
I told you to shut up.

623
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:47,276
You don't have what it takes to be one of us.

624
00:54:47,276 --> 00:54:51,529
However many times we give, however many chances, you don't change.

625
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,905
The day I became the leader of the Fairy Palace,

626
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,000
I vowed to protect the ladies of the court.

627
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,809
I don't want to break that vow just because of you.

628
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:16,860
The pride and dignity I take

629
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,645
in protecting my court ladies,

630
00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:24,173
I'd rather not lose them over you.

631
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:28,971
And so even now, I am forced to save you.

632
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:40,970
Save her life only.

633
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,078
Why did she go to the Crown Prince's Palace with those tottering legs?

634
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:54,258
I'm talking about Court Lady Park.

635
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:58,381
What was she so determined to give His Highness the Crown Prince?

636
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:04,250
I think there was some kind of clothing inside.

637
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,490
It must have been a winter hat.

638
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:08,944
A winter hat?

639
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:30,915
 It's a small winter hat, something a baby prince would wear.

640
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:36,268
But she could just ask someone to run the errand for her.

641
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:40,202
Why did she want to give it to him directly?

642
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:44,570
And then why did the Head Court Lady take it?

643
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,660
Your Majesty,

644
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:13,660
I speak only for our Joseon kingdom and our government.

645
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,705
The Crown Prince…

646
00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:20,574
has no need to understand the complex factionalism of the court.

647
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:27,280
He has no need to consider the best appointees for the government.

648
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,686
He has no need to know the inner workings of the royal court.

649
00:57:33,686 --> 00:57:39,483
I beg you to revoke the order appointing him regent.

650
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:43,790
We beg you, Your Majesty.

651
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:02,411
Will their cries change anything?

652
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,954
Our great undertaking has already been decided.

653
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,756
We'll have to be careful.

654
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:11,550
You have rejected appeals to act as regent twice.

655
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,040
It's sufficient.

656
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,578
Now is the time to step forward, Your Highness.

657
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:27,433
Vice Minister.

658
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:28,890
Yes, Your Highness.

659
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,366
You will see that the Left State Councillor resigns his post.

660
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:34,957
Please appeal to His Majesty.

661
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:40,129
Ask him to punish those who tried to harm and conspire against me, the heir to the throne.

662
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:42,651
Do not budge an inch.

663
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:46,384
There will be great resistance, Your Highness.

664
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,755
It's their choice to make

665
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,100
whether they will live in my Joseon

666
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,120
or die in it.

667
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:05,990
But no forced executions by poison.

668
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,900
On the day that I ascend the throne,

669
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:12,585
I'll personally give the Left State Councillor poison.

670
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:29,533
Mother!

671
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:33,002
Do you think your son is already king?

672
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,570
 Mother.

673
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,099
Even if your son becomes king…

674
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,620
you'll never become Queen Dowager.

675
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,099
You'll always be simply the wife of a dead prince,

676
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:45,473
so don't be arrogant.

677
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:50,481
You should escort your mother away.

678
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:53,293
Let's leave now, Mother.

679
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:55,893
Who are you listening to right now?

680
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,323
I'm your mother.

681
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:07,619
Hyebin.

682
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:11,408
The King is still fit to rule, but now he needs a regent?

683
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,879
Does that make sense?

684
01:00:13,879 --> 01:00:16,819
Go now and persuade your son.

685
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:20,438
He'll surely listen to the mother who gave birth to him.

686
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,182
Go, quickly!

687
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:34,589
As the Princess has said,

688
01:00:36,221 --> 01:00:38,778
I cannot become the Queen Dowager,

689
01:00:38,778 --> 01:00:40,491
forever…

690
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:43,147
I'll forever be simply a consort.

691
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:47,471
But my son…

692
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:51,891
he's been trying hard to respect the mother who bore him.

693
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:57,910
He said he would someday give me a palace name.

694
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:04,038
He's already decided on my palace name and title.

695
01:01:04,038 --> 01:01:07,038
"Her Highness of Hyegyeong Palace."

696
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,959
And so,

697
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:15,650
that's what people will soon call me.

698
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:25,064
And you, Princess, do you know what others will call you?

699
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:32,506
When the Crown Prince becomes king, you will lose your title.

700
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:38,033
No longer a princess, you'll be demoted to a simple commoner.

701
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:44,084
Your dead husband was a member of the Jeong clan.

702
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:46,839
So you'll be the Wife of Jeong,

703
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:51,171
or Mrs. Jeong, I suppose.

704
01:01:52,437 --> 01:01:54,781
You bitch, how dare you!

705
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:57,625
Mother!

706
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:59,781
Let go of me!

707
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:02,320
- Princess Hyebin, please leave.
- Take your hands off me.

708
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,960
Let go! Hyebin!

709
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,409
Mother…

710
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:10,544
This is my room. Am I the one who should go?

711
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:12,261
Princess Hyebin, please!

712
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,251
Hyebin!

713
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:17,265
Let go of me!

714
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,296
I won't let this stand.

715
01:02:20,296 --> 01:02:22,700
Mother. Mother…

716
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,948
You saw it, right?

717
01:02:45,948 --> 01:02:48,952
You saw how much Hyebin hates me.

718
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,625
She won't let the past go.

719
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:59,537
Does she think I killed her husband?

720
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:05,594
Why does she hate me?

721
01:03:05,594 --> 01:03:11,301
Is she saying I wanted to hurt my own brother or what?

722
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:14,061
My brother had gone insane...

723
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:18,500
What else could I have done when he killed so many people!

724
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,230

725
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:21,039
That day in the King's chamber, if Your Highness hadn't stepped in,

726
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,302
I would have been maimed and exiled.

727
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:29,357
The great favor shown to me by Your Highness…

728
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:34,700
I'll take the gratitude to my grave… No, I'll die grateful…

729
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,125
"Eternally grateful" sounds better…

730
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,391
Ah, yes…

731
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:57,906
That day… I misunderstood Your Highness.

732
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:00,242
I hadn't stolen anything,

733
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:06,187
but when Your Highness didn't believe me, I felt angry and disappointed.

734
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,947
But… now I understand why you did what you did.

735
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:16,946
At His Majesty's chamber that day, I was happy that you stood up for me, and

736
01:05:18,932 --> 01:05:21,822
protected me, Your Highness.

737
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:33,840
On the day Lady Yeongbin passed away,

738
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,390
didn't you perhaps meet a little playmate of the Crown Prince?

739
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:42,910
Your Highness, how do you know that?

740
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:50,341
Yes, that day I met a playmate of the Crown Prince around my age.

741
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:52,061
 Hey, you!

742
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,701
 Hey, you. Do you maybe know the way to Lady Yeongbin's residence?

743
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:04,058
We went to her funeral chamber together, where the boy broke down.

744
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:07,456
I still remember the way he cried over her.

745
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,920
And do you still remember

746
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,250
that boy's name?

747
01:06:16,757 --> 01:06:19,240
His name was…

748
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,833
 Lady Yeongbin, it's me.

749
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,982
 San is here.

750
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,710
San…

751
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:29,721
San…

752
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,338
My name…

753
01:06:44,135 --> 01:06:45,964
is San.

754
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:07,052
 Crying too much is bad for you.

755
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:09,511
So it was you.

756
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:11,252
 The civil service exam?

757
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:15,135
 I don't take such an exam.

758
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,675
So it was you, Your Highness.

759
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:36,000

760
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:45,570
♫  Stay by my side and make flowers bloom  ♫

761
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:53,180
♫  I only need that one, you only need one  ♫

762
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:57,330
♫  Every day  ♫

763
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:00,380

~ Preview ~

764
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,683
 Leave in a dignified outfit as a king would do.

765
01:08:04,683 --> 01:08:11,085
 So the Crown Prince is planning to visit the tombs, far away, where the king cannot reach him.

766
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:13,105
 This is a gunpowder pouch from the Crown Prince's Palace.

767
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:15,165
 It's soaked. We can't use it now.

768
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:18,333
 "Our enemies have emerged, fight against them."

769
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:20,730
 Everyone protect His Highness!

770
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,700
 Please hurry, my lady. We'll have to run now.

771
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:30,190
♫  Stay by my side and make flowers bloom  ♫
