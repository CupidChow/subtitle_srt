1
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,250

2
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,830

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,620

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,200

5
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:54,879
Did you see it, Your Highness? The signal kite I flew?

6
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,971
You saw it, right?

7
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:01,052
I did.

8
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,559
I saw it.

9
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:08,401
I promised that I'd protect you, didn't I?

10
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:14,197
Your Highness is always busy protecting this kingdom,

11
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:18,250
and I am busy protecting you.

12
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:22,257
Who do you think is busier?

13
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,437
Would it be you or—

14
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:27,015
Stop talking nonsense and rest.

15
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:29,753
Right here?

16
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,948
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

17
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,742
I will protect you.

18
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,122
I'm sorry, but I will take a short break.

19
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:45,179
I am very tired.

20
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,835
When I saw that kite,

21
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:03,642
I knew it was you.

22
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,920
It could only be you.

23
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,529
When I thought that I could die,

24
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:20,587
your face came to mind.

25
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,820
I prayed to the heavens

26
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,810
for one more chance…

27
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,280
to see…

28
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,011
your face…

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,409
Deok Im.

30
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,361
Everyone is looking for you, Your Highness.

31
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,739
Tell them to wait.

32
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:51,411
Just a little longer.

33
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:58,479
There's no time to waste on a lowly palace maid.

34
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,141
You have to locate our hidden enemies

35
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:06,568
and command the troops from the Northern military camp.

36
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:08,812
Please, come with me.

37
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:11,279
Aren't you at all curious?

38
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:16,387
Curious about who gave the signal and saved me?

39
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,525
It was her.

40
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,949
I promised I'd watch over her until she wakes.

41
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,123
I can't go right now.

42
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,033
I, too, saved you, Your Highness!

43
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:38,987
I got on my horse and did not stop once until I reached the Northern military camp base.

44
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,287
Though my lungs nearly burst, I never stopped.

45
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:46,185
Just to protect Your Highness,

46
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:52,431
so many people put their lives on the line and died.

47
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,150
So you must return.

48
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,425
To your rightful place.

49
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,168
You must protect everyone in this land Joseon, Your Highness.

50
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,877
You are not trying to say

51
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,757
protecting one woman is enough, are you?

52
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:28,007
Your Highness, thank goodness you are safe.

53
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:29,917
Court Lady Seo.

54
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,134
Deok Im…

55
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:37,067
She only fainted from exhaustion.

56
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:44,596
I promised I'd stay by her side until she wakes up…

57
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:51,269
Please do it in my stead.

58
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,601
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,273
There's a problem, my lady.

60
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:49,684
His Highness is on his way back to Palace with the troops from the Northern military camp.

61
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,527
What?

62
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:55,826
What shall we do, my lady?

63
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:00,213
I'll go see the Left State Councilor right now—

64
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:05,508
No, I'll go see the Minister of the Court. Get ready.

65
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,666
 Yes, my lady.

66
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,697
Welcome.

67
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,489
Please enter.

68
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,873
Oh, how tasty.

69
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:38,122
Here. Pour me a drink.

70
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:42,887
You've had so much already, Your Excellency. No more, please.

71
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,920
What of it? Why can't I?

72
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,395
I don't go to court now anyway, so why not?

73
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:53,628
What else can I do except drink all night?

74
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,940
Stop nagging and pour me some more.

75
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,061
Oh, now who is this?

76
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,348
My dear sibling-like lady, is it not?

77
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:18,024
How honored I am to see you, Sister.

78
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,658
Well, since you're here…

79
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,548
why don't you me a drink?

80
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,184
Here.

81
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:39,363
Not water.

82
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:47,866
I'm sobered up. Sobered up.

83
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,732
Totally sober.

84
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:58,388
Now that your sister is in trouble,

85
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:01,799
she'll need Your Excellency's help.

86
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,757
I'd thought I'd die first.

87
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,215
Will you help me?

88
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,628
What have you done?

89
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:21,320
Hearing that you were dismissed from your office,

90
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,190
I hired killers

91
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,797
and tried to kill the Crown Prince.

92
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:31,792
Sadly, I failed.

93
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,842
So please help me.

94
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,706
Or… die with me.

95
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,481
Why did you have to fail?

96
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:45,931
It would have been so nice if you had succeeded.

97
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,548
All right. So what is your plan to get yourself out of this alive?

98
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,073
You wouldn't have come without one.

99
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:10,195
My plan? Using the past.

100
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,805
My past experiences.

101
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:19,850
I've observed His Majesty for a long time,

102
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,679
so I know him well.

103
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,850
When it comes to the King,

104
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,653
no one knows him better than me.

105
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:33,417
Do you think it was easy

106
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:37,305
for some servant's son to become king?

107
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:42,333
Many betrayed him, but more so,

108
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,861
he cruelly betrayed others.

109
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:50,716
The King doesn't trust anyone completely.

110
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,071
Go request an audience with him.

111
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:00,327
If it's you, he will grant the request.

112
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,330
Tell him this.

113
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,671
 The Crown Prince is bringing troops from the Northern military camp here to the capital.

114
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,083
 Your subjects that have seen this

115
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:15,560
 tremble in fear and are in great confusion.

116
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,530
How dare he move the troops from the Northern military camp?

117
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,363
 If Your Majesty were to deign to inquire...

118
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:26,445
I'm sure the Crown Prince would insist like this.

119
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,081
 He'd say that there was a plot to assassinate him, the next king.

120
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:37,035
- But I, Your Majesty…  
 - But I, Your Majesty…

121
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:42,226
 I think it is a mere excuse…

122
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:47,458
 The Crown Prince simply wanted to show himself to the people.

123
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,420
 He wanted to portray himself as

124
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,263
 a dignified king controlling hundreds of soldiers.

125
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,104
Even still…

126
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,053
that only buys us some time.

127
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:13,670
His Majesty will surely dispatch a temporary investigator

128
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,571
to look into this incident.

129
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,095
There was a plot of treason after all.

130
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:23,767
It will take the investigator to examine and come back to report...

131
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,786
maybe… ten days?

132
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:30,374
It'll all come to light, anyway.

133
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:33,846
What does it change?

134
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,637
Your Excellency.

135
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,474
Do you really think…

136
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:45,562
I won't do anything for those ten days?

137
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,597
Didn't I just tell you?

138
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:55,397
I know His Majesty better than anyone.

139
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,902
Sung Deok Im.

140
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,058
Yes, sir.

141
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:53,504
I heard that you used to work in the library.

142
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:54,485
Yes, sir.

143
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:59,995
Take the books there and stay there for the time being.

144
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,224
Yes, sir.

145
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,996
The text you requested.

146
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,339
Sir.

147
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,269
Do you perhaps know why His Highness is being sent to another palace?

148
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,231
It was a royal order.

149
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,599
Yes, but why the sudden order?

150
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,371
I don't know.

151
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,549
I'm sure he will be okay.

152
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,756
Nothing bad will happen.

153
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:52,024
It's not that His Majesty doesn't trust the Crown Prince.

154
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,758
He'd just like to process each and every matter thoroughly.

155
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:00,091
He's already dispatched an investigator.

156
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:03,814
When he returns, everything will become clearer.

157
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,868
Your Highness, the Crown Prince nearly lost his life.

158
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:13,351
Just thinking that I nearly lost my son, I…

159
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,783
Though he doesn't show it,

160
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,466
think how painful it must be for him.

161
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:25,039
His Majesty bellowed at the Crown Prince, who just faced treason,

162
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,239
to return the token to command troops.

163
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:34,524
Do you think the Crown Prince doesn't know of His Majesty's suspicions?

164
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:39,309
Please, try to understand his perspective.

165
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:44,339
Naturally, as his mother…

166
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,172
you would see things from his perspective.

167
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,974
But for me,

168
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:54,484
I need to examine my husband's, His Majesty's royal mind.

169
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,100
This one is good.

170
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,299
Yes, Your Highness.

171
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,459
Oh, that's right.

172
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:12,719
I heard he's been ordered to move into the palace next to the king's quarter.

173
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:17,765
Unsure of his loyalty, His Majesty must want to watch him closely.

174
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,998
Could that be it?

175
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:25,700
Perhaps it's actually that he'd like to ensure his heir's safety.

176
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,011
Is that what you think, Your Highness?

177
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:36,359
Truly, I do not know.

178
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,570
It could be either.

179
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:44,292
The investigator will soon return, and time will tell.

180
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,251
With your help, the preparations are going smoothly.

181
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,029
Let's hope the banquet goes well.

182
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:20,655
Are you slacking off?

183
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,754
Don't doze off now and grind the ink stick for me.

184
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,120
Yes, Your Highness.

185
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,802
I miss you.

186
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:42,838
Are you slacking off?

187
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,943
I'm glad you're safe, Your Highness.

188
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:00,463
Didn't you already see that then?

189
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:03,258
My mind was all over the place that day.

190
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,636
You weren't hurt, were you?

191
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,215
I'm quite well, as you can see.

192
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:22,887
You…

193
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,689
Were you crying?

194
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,574
Did something happen?

195
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:35,353
Oh, I yawned in my sleep…

196
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:57,750
You should be punished for dozing off.

197
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,991
Then reward me, too.

198
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:03,606
You should reward those who do well.

199
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:08,505
Yes, you did do well.

200
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:12,335
What would you like?

201
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:16,630
It sounds like I can say anything I want.

202
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,213
Name it.

203
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,339
Anything.

204
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:27,463
What do you want?

205
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,495
Wow!

206
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:46,295
Wow.

207
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:52,704
To call it a lifetime wish... It's a quite humble one.

208
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:56,090
A telescope of all things.

209
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,997
I was so curious whenever I saw Your Highness use it.

210
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:03,434
Does Your Highness know what it's like to just watch it being used?

211
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:07,830
Still, this really isn't appropriate as a wish.

212
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,386
Think of something else.

213
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:12,908
Okay.

214
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:24,023
Your Highness, your eyes look like saucers!

215
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:32,220
Your Highness, did you know that you have a mole on your earlobe?

216
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
Let's see what else…

217
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:40,234
Why are you just standing there?

218
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:44,229
"How impertinent!" You should yell at me.

219
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,567
Deok Im.

220
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:52,744
Yes?

221
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:57,592
In the library… who was it you missed?

222
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,084
Missed enough to cry…

223
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:25,076
 I miss you.

224
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:32,571
Deok Im.

225
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:36,582
Deok Im.

226
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,873
I can't pretend any longer.

227
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:44,073
And I don't want to.

228
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:53,466
If your heart is… in accordance with mine…

229
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,117
I mean, what I'm saying is…

230
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,379
What I…

231
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,728
feel about you--

232
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:04,561
Please don't.

233
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:08,468
Say no more, Your Highness.

234
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,756
Why not?

235
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:17,877
Tell me why not.

236
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,318
You asked me for my wish.

237
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,975
I wish for Your Highness to ascend the throne safely.

238
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:36,348
Please think of nothing else until then.

239
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,980
You must become a good king.

240
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,258
Can you afford to consider anything else?

241
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:54,766
Is that your wish?

242
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,968
It is.

243
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,653
All right.

244
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,474
I will return now.

245
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,433
Please be safe, Your Highness.

246
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,540
I won't be able to come see you for a while.

247
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,396
Take care.

248
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,594
And you, too, Your Highness.

249
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,852
Keep yourself safe.

250
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:15,692
Have you waited long?

251
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:19,516
No, Your Highness. Have you come from the annex building?

252
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:21,176
I have.

253
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:23,710
So you were with Maiden Sung.

254
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,665
Just have your way with her.

255
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,986
Once you do,

256
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,817
it'll be easier to think clearly.

257
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,613
It happens to us all.

258
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,323
Don't speak of her again.

259
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,586
That's an order.

260
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,570
Yes, Your Highness.

261
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:10,041
Oh, you've come.

262
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,629
I fell asleep.

263
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:20,799
I'm happy Your Majesty called for me. I ran straight over.

264
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,976
All but Lord Jung, leave now.

265
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:27,899
Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:30:38,624 --> 00:30:42,480
You seem to be very troubled about something.

267
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:48,390
Do His Highness's actions worry Your Majesty?

268
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,069
Bringing soldiers from the Northern military camp here, His Highness—

269
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:53,399
Come now.

270
00:30:55,165 --> 00:31:00,159
We both promised, didn't we,

271
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,596
not to talk about palace affairs.

272
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,468
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

273
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:11,144
These days I sense it.

274
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:15,267
My time here is running short.

275
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,911
Before I go,

276
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:25,451
I'd like to do something for you.

277
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:30,195
Lord Jung, write out this edict.

278
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:32,282
Yes, Your Majesty.

279
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:36,348
I bestow a house in  Bukchon 
 (T/N: area where high class officials and noblemen live)

280
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:40,214
to Head Court Lady Jo.

281
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,980
She will be given 100 nyang.

282
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,118
It will come from my private funds,

283
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:52,117
so the inspecting officials of the treasury will not interfere.

284
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:56,553
That's too much, Your Majesty.

286
00:31:56,553 --> 00:32:01,475
For a court lady, a house in the village of former court ladies is enough.

287
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:05,785
How dare I take up residence in Bukchon?

288
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:11,714
These days, more and more…

289
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:17,567
I find myself forgetting things.

290
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:24,574
I'm so tired of pretending I don't.

291
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:31,398
I might forget you soon, too,

292
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:34,321
so I will tell you this now.

293
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,262
I am very sorry.

294
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:44,327
Now…

295
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:49,629
My days on this earth are short.

296
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,180
Please forget any ill will of bygone days.

297
00:32:57,036 --> 00:33:00,321
Let go of your disappointment.

298
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,684
I am honored, Your Majesty.

299
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,364
I have been foolish.

300
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,509
I was not able to comprehend how I felt.

301
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,434
I understand now.

302
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,893
For such a long time,

303
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,328
I've…

304
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:35,391
I've waited to hear those words, Your Majesty.

305
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,452
May I ask you a question?

306
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,552
I did not dare to speak out loud.

307
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:54,055
For decades, I've longed to ask it.

308
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,940
What is it?

309
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:05,591
Why Concubine Yeongbin and not me, Your Majesty?

310
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,803
Looking at you like this…

311
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,537
it's like looking in a mirror.

312
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:25,767
You and I were cut from the same cloth.

313
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:33,993
Yeongbin was full of warmth.

314
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,775
With people like that,

315
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:42,155
it's so easy to relax.

316
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:55,254
So I made that impossible for you.

317
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:02,297
I'm sorry.

318
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:04,629
No, Majesty.

319
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,072
I'm glad, actually.

320
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,717
My long-held question has now been answered.

321
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,656
Are you all right?

322
00:36:20,397 --> 00:36:22,853
Today's the full moon, I see.

323
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:30,296
Many court ladies hang themselves on the full moon.

324
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,727
The problem is the moon.

325
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:40,028
Looking at it, we suddenly realize

326
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,280
how meaningless our lives are.

327
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:55,317
I will dedicate to Princess Hwawan the house in Bukchon I have just received.

328
00:36:56,048 --> 00:37:01,281
But in return, please deliver a message for me.

329
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,974
I was asked to deliver this message from the Head Court Lady.

330
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:26,174
"Married princesses traditionally live outside the palace."

331
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:30,912
 For a long time you've lived comfortably within the palace,

332
00:37:30,912 --> 00:37:35,390
 solely due to the affection of His Majesty.

333
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:41,009
 But now the royal heir will ascend the throne.

334
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,470
 That means all will soon change.

335
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:48,477
 Please tell Her Highness.

336
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,202
 She'll soon need to leave the palace,

337
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,854
 and she'll have to steel herself.

338
00:37:56,796 --> 00:38:00,209
I'm going to be kicked out of the palace?

339
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:01,633
 Mother,

340
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:04,618
I'll take care of you, so please do not worry—

341
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:07,179
I am the King's daughter!

342
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:09,467
When she says I'd get kicked out of the palace,

343
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:12,241
that's all you have to say?

344
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:21,524
You will see.

345
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:26,373
I won't sit still and let that happen.

346
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,870
 I'm suspicious of you, my lady.

347
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,788
 If you keep hiding things from us,

348
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:43,599
 I'll have to tell the Head Court Lady.

349
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,132
 What do you mean? I'm not hiding anything.

350
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:50,262
 Whether you wanted to or not,

351
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:55,050
 you've become one of us when you signed the covenant.

352
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,610
 Never forget that fact.

353
00:39:18,396 --> 00:39:23,970
And here I was worrying. It's just Deok Im.

354
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,463
How are things in the library?

355
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,844
It's just like I've become an apprentice maid once again.

356
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:31,666
How are things in the Crown Prince's Palace?

357
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:36,551
Not great. His Highness isn't even there.

358
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:38,634
Everyone's really unhappy.

359
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:41,317
After what we went through in the temporary palace,

360
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:45,430
people in the palace are calling us liars.

361
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,619
Yes, right.

362
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:53,102
I haven't seen you much, my lady,

363
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:56,067
so I stopped in to say hello.

364
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:58,522
Anyway, I'll head back.

365
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,466
Okay.

366
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,777
Take care of yourself, Wol Hye.

367
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:35,759
Deok Im, what's wrong?

368
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:38,450
You need to know what's happening.

369
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,406
That's a lie, right?

370
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,117
Say it's not true, please.

371
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:48,612
Just calm down.

372
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:54,407
So if I'm hearing you right, what Young Hee said was all true.

373
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:57,688
For God's sake!

374
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,220
You were surprised, too.

375
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,410
And who wouldn't be?

376
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,461
I mean, a secret organization of the palace maids!

377
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:09,822
And even Court Lady Seo is one of them.

378
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:14,715
What I'm going to say now is just my guess.

379
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:17,251
The attempt of treason in the temporary palace,

380
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:21,106
I think that the Fairy Palace might have been behind it.

381
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:26,445
So then the Head Court Lady is a traitor?

382
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,627
Why do you think so?

383
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:30,410
It's just my gut feeling.

384
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,350
You need more than a gut feeling for stuff this serious!

385
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,032
Hurry and go ask Court Lady Seo.

386
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:40,216
She'd never tell me. She was the one who suspected the treason,

387
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:45,043
but she never said anything about the Fairy Palace.

388
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:47,698
Why keep it a secret?

389
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:51,135
Maybe she didn't want to.

390
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:56,677
Maybe she wanted to protect the group.

391
00:41:56,677 --> 00:41:58,198
Why?

392
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:01,198
Maybe she wants to protect her master His Highness the Crown Prince,

393
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:04,654
but she still doesn't want to betray her lifelong friends either.

394
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:08,665
She's caught between a rock and a hard place.

395
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:11,948
Deok Im, one thing is for sure.

396
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:16,252
The reason she told you any of it is because she was worried for you.

397
00:42:16,252 --> 00:42:20,542
She doesn't want you to be in any danger.

398
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:25,296
What do you want to do?

399
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:27,038
I…

400
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,727
I want to protect her.

401
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:58,524
Deok Im!

402
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,135
I'll explain on the way,

403
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:04,028
for now, just follow me quietly.

404
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:06,216
Oh, okay.

405
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,048
Tonight, the Head Court Lady won't be in her room.

406
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:20,237
She has gone to the banquet hall to help prepare for the banquet.

407
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:23,957
Deok Im. Don't tell me, you're…

408
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,601
I'm going to go in and find the list of signatures.

409
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:29,890
And I'll erase yours.

410
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:37,720
Do you know how dangerous this is?

411
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,258
I do.

412
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:40,318
Let's go back.

413
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,732
When the Emergency Investigator returns, the Fairy Palace will be exposed.

414
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:46,820
And you'll die, too.

415
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:53,803
I promised you I'd find a way.

416
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,229
I won't let you get caught up in it.

417
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,018
If someone comes, I'll give you a sign.

418
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,564
Thanks.

419
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:16,761
If I'm not back by daylight, just leave me and go back.

420
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:49,971
My lady, I'll look this way.

421
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:51,490
You search some place else.

422
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,233
Sure, okay.

423
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,310
Why is it taking so long? Should we go in?

424
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,358
Let's give them more time.

425
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,543
It's the Head Court Lady!

426
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:46,900
Too late, she is already coming this way.

427
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:02,787
What are you doing here, this late in front of my residence?

428
00:46:02,787 --> 00:46:05,688
We were just, I-I mean…

429
00:46:05,688 --> 00:46:09,836
I've come to pay my respects.

430
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:11,643
That's right!

431
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,951
She's the daughter of a famous merchant.

432
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,556
Do you perhaps know her?

433
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:19,268
Her father asked that she come to offer her greetings.

434
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:18,076
My lady.

435
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:38,282
Oh my, that's the secret entrance to the meeting area.

436
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:39,420
The secret entrance?

437
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,985
Yes.

438
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:45,136
I didn't know the door was here…

439
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:50,380
They always covered our eyes, you see…

440
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,166
My lady.

441
00:48:09,981 --> 00:48:11,782
No…

442
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:18,804
My lady.

443
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:32,974
My lady.

444
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:36,664
M-My lady.

445
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:47,144
You're surely busy. We'll leave you now.

446
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:44,045
The signature book might be here. Let's look for it.

447
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:46,256
Yes, sure.

448
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:24,719
The girls who came here earlier, they're Sung Deok Im's friends, right?

449
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,034
Yes, my lady.

450
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:30,377
Bring Sung Deok Im here to me, now.

451
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:32,229
Yes, my lady.

452
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:09,498
My lady, come help me with this.

453
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:28,951
Deok Im.

454
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:31,620
There's a winter hat in here.

455
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,340
 (T/N: A winter hat for a baby prince)

456
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:38,617
 Court Lady Park.

457
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:42,645
 What was it she wanted to give His Highness?

458
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:44,610
 It would have been a winter hat.

459
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:49,687
 And why did the Head Court Lady have to take it away from her?

460
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:53,970
Court Lady Park disappeared after that, didn't she?

461
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:29,336
 - My lady! 
 - My lady!

462
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:31,555
My lady!

463
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,595
My lady!

464
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:37,969
Open it, quick!

465
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:42,273
My lady!

466
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:44,292
- My lady! 
 - Oh no, my lady!

467
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:45,138
My lady!

468
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:46,793
What's happened to you?

469
00:52:46,793 --> 00:52:50,658
Please wake up, my lady!

470
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,381
My lady.

471
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:04,938
My lady, let's take Lady Park out of here.

472
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:06,829
Okay.

473
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:07,886
My lady.

474
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:10,473
Can you stand, my lady?

475
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:16,827
My lady, can you walk?

476
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,927
Watch your step.

477
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,421
Are you making sure to pay your respects to His Majesty daily?

478
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:59,449
Yes, Mother.

479
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:03,161
And he hasn't said anything?

480
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:04,829
No.

481
00:54:10,357 --> 00:54:13,157
San, cheer up.

482
00:54:13,157 --> 00:54:16,186
You can't be this gloomy.

483
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:20,920
You know His Majesty likes bright, cheerful people, right?

484
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,240
You have to ensure His Majesty is in a good mood tomorrow at the banquet.

485
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:35,637
They hatched a plot that nearly took my life.

486
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:43,876
But His Majesty, who must trust me, looks at me with so much suspicion.

487
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,774
How could I…

488
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:50,198
How could I possibly smile?

489
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:54,515
To survive, yes.

490
00:54:55,819 --> 00:55:00,624
Ever since my father died,

491
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:04,189
I haven't smiled sincerely once.

492
00:55:06,324 --> 00:55:12,702
Yet I survived, and I will continue to survive.

493
00:55:30,612 --> 00:55:33,121
Your Highness, petitions will soon be—

494
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,687
It turns out I lied to my mother.

495
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:42,960
Come to think of it, I've smiled quite a bit.

496
00:55:44,244 --> 00:55:48,821
 I've been smiling since I met you.

497
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:52,495
 You're the one who has made me smile.

498
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:56,720
 Right, Deok Im?

499
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,454
My lady, I'll stay here today.

500
00:56:26,454 --> 00:56:28,986
Please go to the palace.

501
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,737
They'll be suspicious if you don't report for duty.

502
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:34,505
All right, then I'll come back tomorrow.

503
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:36,633
Take good care of the Court Lady.

504
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,210
I will.

505
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:09,345
Her Highness the Princess has arrived.

506
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:19,638
Your Highness.

507
00:57:19,638 --> 00:57:23,143
I will not be removed from the palace.

508
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:28,603
Find me a way to keep him from the throne.

509
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:33,284
Aren't you on my side?

510
00:57:55,313 --> 00:57:57,713
Yes, Your Highness.

511
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:01,510
I'm always on your side.

512
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:14,610
Concubine Suk Eui will be of great help to Your Highness.

513
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,505
Speak, Suk Eui.

514
00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:30,790
Tell me how I can defeat His Highness.

515
00:59:41,062 --> 00:59:46,463
Mother, you're not hiding anything from me, are you?

516
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:48,641
It's nothing.

517
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:56,550
It's just something I need to do now while Father is still healthy.

518
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:19,328
I apologize, Sir, but you have not been invited.

519
01:00:39,438 --> 01:00:42,943
 His Majesty the King is on the way!

520
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:46,173
Her Highness the Queen is on the way!

521
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:52,586
No, no. Sit.

522
01:00:54,175 --> 01:00:57,270
All of you, sit.

523
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:16,031
It's so good to see all of you, here in one place.

524
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:22,688
This is what family is all about.

525
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:25,097
Isn't that right, my Queen?

526
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:27,931
It is, Your Majesty.

527
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,827
Right.

528
01:01:33,888 --> 01:01:35,921
San.

529
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:37,817
Yes, Majesty.

530
01:01:37,817 --> 01:01:42,127
Why do you look troubled?

531
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:44,727
Did something happen?

532
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:48,539
It's nothing important, Your Majesty.

533
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,680
I've simply had a heavy heart since the regency period began.

534
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:59,907
That the work of the state would be this difficult…

535
01:01:59,907 --> 01:02:02,384
I truly had no idea.

536
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:10,003
If you recognize how hard it is, that means you're doing well.

537
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:16,558
Difficult problems cannot be treated as one would with minor ones.

538
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:18,860
I will not forget, Your Majesty.

539
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:24,012
Your Majesty, I have a request.

540
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:25,299
What is it?

541
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:32,322
This banquet's purpose is to praise your virtues and offer Your Majesty our felicitations.

542
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:35,237
We know that Your Majesty has rejected to receive an exalted title,

543
01:02:35,237 --> 01:02:39,422
but we ask that you consider once more the Crown Prince's feelings.

544
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:43,160
So you want me to accept the exalted title?

545
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,543
It is our ardent wish.

546
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:48,355
Is that so?

547
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:56,450
If that's what my grandson wants, who am I to say no?

548
01:02:57,837 --> 01:03:00,344
We thank you, Your Majesty.

549
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:04,492
But look here,

550
01:03:05,645 --> 01:03:07,956
why is there so little food?

551
01:03:07,956 --> 01:03:14,166
With so many people here, this won't go far, will it?

552
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:18,858
Your Majesty, the truth is

553
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:23,003
all these people here today prepared this food.

554
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:29,221
It was prepared with sincerity in hopes to please Your Majesty.

555
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:30,782
Please accept it.

556
01:03:30,782 --> 01:03:33,695
Of course, I will!

557
01:03:33,695 --> 01:03:37,686
My Queen, I'm so happy.

558
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:43,333
I apologize I could not prepare food for you myself, Your Majesty.

559
01:03:44,563 --> 01:03:48,901
No, my Queen,

560
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:52,808
have you not always cared for me?

561
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:57,369
Your Majesty, for fun,

562
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:01,613
will you not guess who contributed which foods here today?

563
01:04:01,613 --> 01:04:03,086
Why not?

564
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:04,809
My lady.

565
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:10,655
Let's not trouble His Majesty with useless trivialities.

566
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:14,026
No, no. It's fine.

567
01:04:14,026 --> 01:04:17,537
I think it sounds fun.

568
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:22,258
I'm confident I can guess them all!

569
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:35,366
Present the food to His Majesty.

570
01:04:35,366 --> 01:04:37,643
Yes, my lady.

571
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,335
Please wait.

572
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:55,589
What is going on in there?

573
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:57,590
What do you mean?

574
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,729
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

575
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,680
If you mean the banquet,

576
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,300
don't worry.

577
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:14,985
All is going smoothly.

578
01:05:14,985 --> 01:05:17,523
Not even one hiccup.

579
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:30,944
I was right about Suk Eui's dumpling soup,

580
01:05:30,944 --> 01:05:36,738
and Princess Hwawan's brazier preparation.

581
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:40,550
So now, which food is next?

582
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,793
Bring it in. Quickly now!

583
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:49,923
- Princess. 
 - Let's see now!

584
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:58,568
Oh, let's see!

585
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:24,138
 There's food that His Majesty is most afraid of and can't accept even in his dreams.

586
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:30,076
 Persimmon and marinated crab.

587
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:35,710
 The dish suspected of poisoning the former king…?

588
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,240
 He's heard the rumors his whole life.

589
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,459
 That the dish killed his older brother, King Gyeongjong.

590
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:45,666
 Like a curse,

591
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:49,806
 fear of that dish has plagued him his entire life.

592
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,900
 Were His Highness to offer up such food,

593
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:01,152
 what would his fate be?

594
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:21,110
Persimmon

595
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,140
and marinated crab.

596
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,953
Let's see.

597
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:49,786
Who would dare to give me this?

598
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:58,051
Who might it be?

599
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:47,170
