41

I'm sorry.

42

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,289
- Do you think that makes sense? - Exactly.

184
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,720
What are you doing here?

185
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,419
I got on the wrong bus.

186
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,929
You're not even trying to come up with a good excuse.

187
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,830
What about your home? Is it in Cheorwon?

188
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,899
What was the school number again?

189
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,129
Hey. Come on.

190
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,668
We're both playing hooky.

191
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,370
That's a petty threat.

192
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,669
I'm not playing hooky.

193
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,049
I see. You're giving up?

194
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,548
I get it. Playing hooky is too wild for you. Isn't it?

195
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,849
I have a ticket leaving in the evening.

196
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,480
I see. Is that so?

197
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,019
Then have fun.

198
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,529
(Cheorwon to Seoul, Time: 2:48pm)

199
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,149
You're following me now.

200
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,158
Hey, I don't want to talk to you...

201
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,429
any more than you want to talk to me.

202
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,039
Why are you following me?

203
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,470
I don't know either.

204
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,039
Why am I following you?

205
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,939
What?

206
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,549
This stop is the front of the Jingyeok Base.

207
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,919
The next stop is Cheorwon Sam-li.

208
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,659
(Stop)

209
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,690
- Hey, let's get off. - Why?

210
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,558
You said you were following me.

211
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,769
(Cheorwon City Bus)

212
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,690
(Front of the Jingyeok Base)

213
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,590
Where are we going?

214
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,230
Even if I told you, you wouldn't know. Just keep up.

215
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,299
You're not going to a weird religious center, right?

216
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,970
Maybe.

217
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,408
I bet your heart is pounding...

218
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,268
with excitement at the fun possibilities...

219
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,779
ahead of us.

220
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,909
It's closer to anxiety and concern.

221
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,509
That also makes your heart pound. The heart-pounding feelings.

222
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,159
Where are we going?

223
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,730
Over there.

224
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,569
(Jingyeok Base, the 2nd Division, Army, 3:32pm)

225
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,480
Wait.

226
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,419
Did you come here to visit someone?

227
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
No.

228
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,589
I'm here to confess my feelings.

229
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,529
Hey, what do I do? I'm so nervous!

230
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,529
Let's go. Let's do this.

231
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,039
For love.

232
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,849
You went to see Bang Jun Ho in the military?

233
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,849
And you played hooky, on top of that?

234
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,549
That was all for Bang Jun Ho?

235
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,519
Why?

236
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,789
With Oddball, at that?

237
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,990
Why did you go with her to see...

238
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,289
You!

239
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,599
Hey, you!

240
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,769
Your crush wasn't Ms. Kim?

241
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,369
You... Really?

242
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,868
Then you and my tenant...

243
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,140
That gutsy girl, Oddball...

244
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,240
Lee Hong Ju was your first love?

245
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,410
Uncle, it feels like my head is going to split open.

246
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,920
Could you keep it to yourself?

247
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,749
Oh, my gosh!

248
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,220
Then you postponed going back to the US for a week.

249
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,220
Was it to spend time with Hong Ju?

250
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,588
What if you end up liking her more?

251
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,689
Not going back to the US because of Hong Ju...

252
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,359
wasn't part of your plan!

253
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,798
Hey, I know you really well.

254
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,169
But you take after your meticulous mother.

255
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,538
You've never failed in your life.

256
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,939
Because you're smart, I know you were able...

257
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,909
to get everything done just like you planned.

258
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,739
Then you must have gotten everything you wanted in life so far.

259
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,980
Is being successful a problem?

260
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,609
Yes. Your problem now is Lee Hong Ju.

261
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,879
I get that you're acting like this because your first love was Oddball.

262
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
But... Hey.

263
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,118
I doubt you'll be able to have your way when it comes to her.

264
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,719
- You're not her type either. - Uncle.

265
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,959
I'm giving you my warning!

266
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,160
I'm giving you my warning now!

267
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,670
How did the blind date go?

268
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,640
Well...

269
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,579
If it didn't go well, go on a date with my niece.

270
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,879
She recently got a job at a company.

271
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,419
She's ready to settle down too.

272
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,579
She's only 25.

273
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,689
I just think she would be perfect for you.

274
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,619
Gosh. I doubt...

275
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,189
your niece will like me.

276
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,088
Goodness. She's my niece.

277
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,890
I'm not going to set her up with just a random guy.

278
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,029
Men like you are a gem these days.

279
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,729
You're kind, reliable,

280
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,969
and neat.

281
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,839
You also have thick hair.

282
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,109
But he has incredibly high standards.

283
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,078
Look at him. He didn't even bat an eye at me.

284
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,338
Gosh, no.

285
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,579
Goodness. My niece is much younger than you.

286
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,279
Besides, she's naturally beautiful like me.

287
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,250
Gosh. Ms. Oh.

288
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,589
Bragging about that is so outdated. Seriously.

289
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,159
Right. Could you relay this message to your niece?

290
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,758
When she gets her first paycheck,

291
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,730
do tell her to buy a package at a good dermatologist.

292
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,640
Mr. Son, could we talk for a second?

293
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,349
You know,

294
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,880
I wasn't going to say this because it would hurt my pride.

295
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,890
Why wouldn't you ask my friend out on a follow-up date?

296
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,930
Well, that's... I...

297
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:31,058
I'm not saying this just because she's my friend.

298
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,500
Hong Ju has a charm as deep as a black hole.

299
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,470
Once you're in, you can't get out. Hence the name, black hole.

300
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,400
I can vouch for her.

301
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,469
I'm the proof.

302
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,970
I haven't been able to escape from her charm for ten years.

303
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,239
Ms. Kim, but...

304
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,680
Hong Ju told me she wasn't interested in dating.

305
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,778
What? Hong Ju thinks...

306
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,819
you're not interested in her.

307
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,318
What? There was a misunderstanding between you two.

308
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,919
Mr. Son, contact her quickly.

309
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,829
Well, actually, the truth is...

310
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,930
Let's go.

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,099
Right. Mr. Son.

312
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,710
You cannot go on another blind date. Okay?

313
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,569
Her family is weird.

314
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,349
Okay.

315
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,119
(Peter's Pen)

316
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,130
(Peter's Pen)

317
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,700
Gosh. This car again?

318
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,099
How many times must I tell her she can't park here?

319
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,970
Come on.

320
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,799
(This Woman)

321
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:53,239
The person you reached is unavailable. You will be directed...

322
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,450
- to voicemail after the tone. - Okay. You won't answer your phone?

323
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,650
Should I just ram into her car?

324
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,420
I told her not to park...

325
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,920
(Baek Do Seon)

326
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,660
Hey, what's up?

327
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,500
Did you see the data Mr. Kang put together?

328
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:12,900
Yes.

329
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,829
I didn't see a single error.

330
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,529
What more does he need to review that he's staying?

331
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,599
I didn't like it from the start.

332
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,400
It's so obvious he knows he's smart.

333
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,470
I must admit that he is smart.

334
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,279
Hey.

335
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:28,910
So what if he's smart?

336
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,049
I bet his head's filled with nothing but numbers.

337
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,490
So this is what happened?

338
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,229
(Lee Hong Ju, first love, ex-boyfriend)

339
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,099
(Bang Jun Ho! Piece of trash)

340
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,298
What the heck?

341
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,299
- Darn it. - Hello, sir.

342
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,940
He should've told me.

343
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,039
Hey.

344
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,079
What's up with you?

345
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,849
- What about me? - You got promoted.

346
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,549
You didn't know?

347
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,220
Should I congratulate you or not?

348
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,829
The new office is linked to a huge Korean family.

349
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,059
It's not final yet.

350
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,229
As if it's not.

351
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,400
Your mom wants you back at the head office immediately.

352
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,329
I'll handle it.

353
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,730
Where are you going?

354
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,970
At least stay for dinner.

355
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Hoo Young.

356
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,319
Success or love.

357
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,519
That boring dilemma is back again.

358
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,190
Hong Ju. I'm glad I met you.

359
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,420
So that guy almost turned you into a carp-head yesterday, right?

360
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,789
I should keep pretending to know nothing about this too, right?

361
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,700
I should pretend not to know.

362
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,559
Hey, Kang Hoo Young. We meet again.

363
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,359
Are you off work?

364
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,200
We met because we have the same commute.

365
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,710
Property prices here went up.

366
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:12,279
I should've bought a building long ago.

367
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,250
How's the business you came to take care of going?

368
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,819
So-so.

369
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,250
When will you go back to the US?

370
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,359
I don't know.

371
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,200
But then, you never left with a warning.

372
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,970
Kang Hoo Young.

373
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:42,670
Do you want fried chicken?

374
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,289
Isn't it a surprise?

375
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,930
It is. How could this be?

376
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,900
Hoo Young you're really Mr. Baek's nephew?

377
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:16,539
You and I must be destined to be together.

378
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:18,740
I guess so.

379
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:21,750
We'll have a half-and-half and a Coke.

380
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,108
Why a half-and-half?

381
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,579
We used to eat one each.

382
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,519
I don't have an appetite.

383
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,289
You craved chicken, didn't you?

384
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,549
Shall we order more?

385
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,889
- Excuse me. - Yes?

386
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,529
- One fried and one with sauce. - Okay.

387
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,660
Why don't you have an appetite?

388
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,259
Did your boss nag you again?

389
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,659
Why would she nag me?

390
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,099
I'm good at what I do.

391
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,140
Then why did your 29-year-old appetite disappear?

392
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,538
(Crunchy skin, tender flesh)

393
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,670
What's up with her?

394
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,410
I wouldn't know.

395
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,049
Where did you two meet?

396
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,019
Outside work.

397
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,089
Someone followed me in secret.

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,130
"In secret?"

399
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,730
That could be misunderstood.

400
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,528
You were walking ahead of me,

401
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,339
and I was walking behind you.

402
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,569
You were going to ignore me.

403
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,380
After thanking me for saving you earlier.

404
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,910
You saved her earlier? Why?

405
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,650
I didn't know your leg was there.

406
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,490
My legs are so darn long. Sorry.

407
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,789
Lee Hong Ju, you...

408
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,859
How come you haven't changed in ten years?

409
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,630
What do you mean?

410
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,130
You're...

411
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:53,869
still clueless...

412
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,839
and still stupid.

413
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,809
You call me stupid to my face?

414
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,489
I took you on rides and took your photos...

415
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,220
all day yesterday.

416
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,719
And today, you said you wanted chicken.

417
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,129
I had a date with Hye Ji...

418
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,160
and kindly let you tag along.

419
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,400
That's how nice I was to you, and you say what?

420
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,500
That I'm clueless and stupid?

421
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,539
You're still a jerk, and I can't stand you.

422
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,450
Excuse me. Can I have a beer?

423
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,650
Three?

424
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,519
No, cancel the beer.

425
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,289
Ms. Kim, it's a Monday.

426
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,359
We agreed not to drink on Mondays.

427
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,960
I need to go to the ladies'.

428
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,900
Start without me.

429
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Enjoy.

430
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,420
Hoo Young.

431
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,490
I might be crossing the line here,

432
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,829
but I prefer things to be exact.

433
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,529
Do you like Hong Ju?

434
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,440
Does she know?

435
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,910
(Oddball)

436
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,319
Why are you calling?

437
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:49,119
No, don't do this.

438
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,519
Hey, Oddball.

439
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,670
Something urgent came up at work.

440
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,180
Kang Hoo Young, it's your lucky day.

441
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,650
I'll let it go because Hye Ji likes you.

442
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,720
Why does she like someone like that?

443
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,750
Sorry.

444
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,250
Why should you apologize to me about how you feel?

445
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,329
Did you track her down on purpose when you got here?

446
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,759
We met by chance.

447
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,059
I see.

448
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,400
By chance, you're Mr. Baek's nephew.

449
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,730
By chance, you're Oddball's neighbor.

450
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,940
By chance, you met up yesterday,

451
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,069
and by chance, you met Hong Ju today?

452
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:18,509
Is that all really by chance?

453
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,519
There's one thing that isn't by chance.

454
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,289
Then since we were in school...

455
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,339
(Grilling Meat Again Today)

456
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:51,369
Welcome.

457
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,779
Hi, there.

458
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,750
Is this how you run a business?

459
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,950
You should welcome a customer with gusto.

460
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
How are you a customer when you're no good for me?

461
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,058
I told everyone I met...

462
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,930
that the food here is amazing.

463
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,858
If I got a commission per head,

464
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,200
I'd own a building by now.

465
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,900
What kind of logic is that?

466
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,368
How much commission must you get...

467
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,700
to afford a building that I can't?

468
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,069
Did you have dinner?

469
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,539
Make me something tasty.

470
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,740
I left fried chicken to come here.

471
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,579
Okay, I'll make you something good.

472
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,779
Hang on.

473
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,690
You.

474
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,390
I'll only feed you.

475
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:41,160
If you need a psychology consult, go to your friend.

476
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:44,130
My friend.

477
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,200
She's eating chicken with her first love.

478
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
What?

479
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,299
She's alone with Hoo Young?

480
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,700
Yes.

481
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,339
I can't stop thinking...

482
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,410
that Hye Ji's wasted on him.

483
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,389
This doesn't make any sense at all.

484
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,860
Well, it's not all nonsense but...

485
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,659
Hey, can I have another beer?

486
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,630
You can't drink.

487
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,409
If you won't date me, don't be so nice to me.

488
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,440
Okay.

489
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,610
Okay. This is it for me.

490
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,389
Are you staying in Korea, then?

491
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,230
You're going back?

492
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,329
Oh, okay...

493
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,340
You got so worked up earlier, so I thought you were serious.

494
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,670
You're just like me, though. Poking to see what happens.

495
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,510
Not really.

496
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:08,110
Do you know whose number Oddball saved on speed dial?

497
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,749
Neither you nor Bang Jun Ho was with her for the past ten years.

498
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,280
It was me. I'm her guardian.

499
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,849
You can't replace me.

500
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,019
This is on me.

501
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,419
You didn't eat. Take it home.

502
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,960
You won't get to eat this in the US.

503
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,869
How much is it?

504
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,719
I made an extra side dish for you.

505
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,619
When will you grow up?

506
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,260
I stopped growing in ninth grade.

507
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,719
You're stupid, aren't you?

508
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,760
What day is it today? Why are you all picking on me?

509
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,960
Oh, my gosh...

510
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,968
Poor, long-suffering Hoo Young.

511
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,698
Why is he a poor guy?

512
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,269
He's a spiteful jerk.

513
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,269
Pity me, a Korean office worker.

514
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,510
Why am I eating this good food on my own?

515
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:18,809
How could people work if they wanted to...

516
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,179
get drunk on a Monday?

517
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,989
They should give their livers a day or two to recuperate...

518
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:33,699
Darn it.

519
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,869
Drink all you want.

520
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,638
My boss.

521
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,909
She insists that I should work on the tenth-anniversary project.

522
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,860
Well, you must do what the boss says.

523
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,389
Who are you to refuse?

524
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,259
She'll make me the main producer.

525
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,900
It's all good, then. You wanted that title.

526
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,599
Yes. After ten years there, I finally got a shot.

527
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,900
It's been that long? Has your time come at last?

528
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,510
It was written by Bang Jun Ho.

529
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,110
Say no.

530
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,550
You worked there for ten years. You can say that much.

531
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,348
I finally get to be a producer after ten years.

532
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,550
What if you do? Do you get convenience store discounts?

533
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,089
Who will do it if I don't?

534
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,959
Why would you worry about that?

535
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,159
There are many others who can do that job.

536
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,900
I'm a founding member of the company.

537
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,030
I should work on the anniversary project...

538
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,638
Are you insane, Hong Ju?

539
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,070
You'll work with Bang Jun Ho?

540
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,139
You still aren't thinking straight.

541
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,579
- I'll call Hye Ji. - I'll kill you.

542
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:55,139
Darn you. You said that knowing what would happen.

543
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:00,919
- What? - I want ramyeon noodles.

544
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,150
I'm sick and tired of this!

545
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,190
(Mother)

546
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,839
Yes. Your problem now is Lee Hong Ju.

547
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,110
I doubt you'll be able to have your way when it comes to her.

548
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:31,448
You can't replace me.

549
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,849
You're still a jerk, and I can't stand you.

550
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,129
(Mother)

551
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,159
Come back.

552
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,690
Is he not back yet?

553
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,130
(Speed dial 0: Ms. Kim)

554
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,670
No.

555
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,409
I should leave them alone.

556
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,050
Kang Hoo Young.

557
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,119
Don't be like that.

558
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,159
It took a lot on my part to let you get together with Hye Ji.

559
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,329
There was a lot I wanted to tell her today.

560
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,050
Oh, gosh.

561
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:19,519
Goodness.

562
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,590
("Is It Serendipity? Is It Love?")

563
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,219
(What did you do after hearing you won the Writer's Award?)

564
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,158

00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,590
(Bang Jun Ho's boundary between reality and fantasy)

566
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:08,900
("My Avant-garde Lover")

567
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,340
(January of 2014, Peter's Pen job interview)

568
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:15,909
I liked your proposal.

569
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,848
It could do with some work,

570
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,420
but you chose a good book,

571
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,718
and you looked at it from the viewer's standpoint,

572
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,920
and that wasn't bad.

573
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,929
Thank you.

574
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,860
Give me your resume.

575
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,469
Weren't you told to bring one?

576
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,139
Here you go.

577
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,479
(Resume: Lee Hong Ju)

578
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,509
(Obok High School, Future graduate)

579
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,510
- This is it? - Yes.

580
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,550
This can't be it.

581
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,449
How little did you think of "Peter's Pen"...

582
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,260
that you applied with zero qualifications?

583
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,859
You said you were looking for people...

584
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,059
who love anime movies.

585
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,730
- That academics don't matter. - They don't matter...

586
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,928
as long as you have an educational background...

587
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,139
of a certain level.

588
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,670
People who love animated movies...

589
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,868
means people with expert knowledge...

590
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,739
in how they're produced. Don't you get that?

591
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,880
Is that so? I didn't know.

592
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,449
I should've been more precise.

593
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:30,889
Very well.

594
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,260
You can go.

595
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,730
Ms. Bae.

596
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,599
I'll do anything you want.

597
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,170
I'll learn. I'll try anything.

598
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,710
I stayed up all night writing that for the first time in my life,

599
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,139
and I found a dream.

600
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,980
I want people like me to see our animated movies...

601
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,980
and have warm and fun dreams.

602
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,780
Just thinking of that got me so excited.

603
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,849
And meeting you just now convinced me.

604
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:07,690
This is the place.

605
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,389
I want to work here.

606
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,429
(Turn "My Avant-garde Lover" into an animated movie!)

607
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,099
Did you enjoy typing this up?

608
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:17,130
Yes.

609
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,570
How much?

610
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,099
Enough not to know I'd stayed up...

611
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,909
and that the sun had risen.

612
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,510
("My Avant-garde Lover")

613
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,269
Hello.

614
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,409
Ms. Bae.

615
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,550
Ms. Bae. I'll do it.

616
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,590
Because it's Mr. Bang?

617
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,250
No. Well...

618
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,059
To be honest, I don't know.

619
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,559
I know I'll regret doing it later on.

620
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,159
But if I don't do it, I'll start regretting right now.

621
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,699
I'll do it.

622
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,570
I want to become a main producer through this project.

623
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:33,110
I'll take you off it...

624
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,840
if your emotions take over.

625
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:36,909
Deal.

626
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,070
Are you really okay with leaving like this?

627
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,000
Is this your answer?

628
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,340
My work here is done.

629
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:07,239
Take my car. I'll drive you to the airport.

630
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,409
Say goodbye to the staff for me.

631
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,280
Tell them they did well.

632
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,860
Did you say goodbye to Oddball?

633
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,159
She knows I'm leaving.

634
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,130
And...

635
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,329
she said goodbye each time we met.

636
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,929
Is that good enough for you?

637
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,869
That's more than enough...

638
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
between me and her.

639
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,480
Call when you reach the airport.

640
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,110
See you in the US.

641
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,929
Play!

642
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,468
Get someone!

643
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,869
- Darn it. - Here comes, Mi Jin!

644
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,739
- Shoot. - Nice save.

645
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,480
Hey, pick it up!

646
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:18,150
- Keep going. - Run away!

647
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,519
Come on!

648
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,479
- Hey! - That's it!

649
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,750
- Give me the ball. - Hey.

650
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,359
Tell me how the fried chicken date went.

651
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,428
(Oddball: Tell me how the fried chicken date went.)

652
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,860
Are you still in the middle of having it?

653
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,130
Hye Ji?

654
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,170
Ms. Kim.

655
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,900
There is something I must tell you.

656
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:42,840
Hye Ji. Is something going on with you?

657
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,710
(Oddball)

658
00:46:58,889 --> 00:46:59,889
Kim Hye Ji,

659
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,329
you're pathetic.

660
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,630
- Let's go again. - Gosh.

661
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,000
Sir, can we stop playing this game?

662
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:13,469
Right. We have to get hit by the ball on the girls' behalves.

663
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,170
It's unfair.

664
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,570
You think?

665
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:18,869
Okay. I accept your opinion.

666
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:22,340
It's unfair for you to enjoy the experience...

667
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,980
of protecting someone with all your bodies.

668
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,880
It was cool when you threw yourself earlier.

669
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,489
I didn't.

670
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:35,460
No wonder why he's called Superman. He's obsessed with protecting.

671
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,260
Here.

672
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,828
- Over here. - Me!

673
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:40,829
- Gosh, what... - I mistook you.

674
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,399
- Give it to me. - There!

675
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,429
- Take this! - Hey!

676
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,269
Let's go.

677
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:50,239
- Hurry up and throw it. - There.

678
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,750
Mr. Son.

679
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Over here.

680
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:14,929
Mr. Son.

681
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,630
May I ask you something?

682
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,599
Sure. Go on.

683
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,670
Well...

684
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,369
If...

685
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,880
your first love...

686
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,449
liked your very best friend, how would you feel?

687
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,780
It's a coincidence,

688
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:36,349
but they seem to get involved with each other like a fate.

689
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,489
If...

690
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:48,599
at least my friend found someone new to love,

691
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,730
I'd congratulate him.

692
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,469
My 1st love will probably turn 60 next year.

693
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,280
Oh, that's not exactly the reason,

694
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,679
but my friend is such a decent man.

695
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:08,150
I really hope he finds someone nice.

696
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,820
My first love is a nice lady too.

697
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:12,449
Since they're both nice...

698
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,719
Right.

699
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,630
I think it'd be nice.

700
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:23,869
What?

701
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,409
What are you saying?

702
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,750
Oh, gosh.

703
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,150
It's hilarious.

704
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,389
Oh, right. Did you turn down the blind date with Ms. Oh's niece?

705
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,159
- Yes. - You shouldn't have!

706
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,259
I'll tell her to arrange it again.

707
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,789
No, Ms. Kim.

708
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:55,860
Mr. Son. Forget that I asked you to meet Hong Ju.

709
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,869
Goodness.

710
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,550

(Kwon Sang Pil)

712
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,869
I broke the promise again.

713
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,849
I'm here to pay a visit.

714
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:49,949
Who are you visiting? And which company is he with?

715
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,349
Which company? Just a moment.

716
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,230
Here.

717
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,829
Company One doesn't reside here now.

718
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,170
I sent letters to this address until last week.

719
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,139
I received this letter from here too.

720
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,570
I can't check any details for you.

721
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,280
(From Bang Jun Ho, To Lee Hong Ju)

722
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,710

(Mom, Uncle Baek Wook)

725
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,110
I must be out of mind.

726
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,480
Why did I have to tag her along?

727
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:32,949
Let's go.

728
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,800
There's only one bus that comes here.

729
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,869
We'll have to walk all the way to the terminal if we miss it.

730
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,289
Why don't we have ramyeon before we get going?

731
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,518
(Jingyeok Samgeori Mini-Mart)

732
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,829
(Ramyeon, Gimbap)

733
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,500
(Jingyeok Samgeori Mini-Mart, 5:25pm)

734
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,408
(Healthy Event, Healthy Milk)

735
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,679
You don't go to school in this neighborhood.

736
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,280
We came to visit the military base nearby.

737
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,519
We came all the way, but we didn't get to meet the person.

738
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:38,149
It'd be bearable...

739
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,619
to think of not seeing him at all.

740
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,788
But if you couldn't see him when you knew he was right there,

741
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,159
it'd be devastating.

742
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,130
My cooking tends to be quite spicy.

743
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,530
If the ramyeon is too spicy, have some water as you eat.

744
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,500
Enjoy.

745
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:53,840
Thank you.

746
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:10,989
It's spicy.

747
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,730
Ma'am, this ramyeon is so spicy.

748
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,360
Your ramyeon is too spicy.

749
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,300
It's spicy.

750
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,929
Oh, dear.

751
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,909
Hey. Why are you crying all of a sudden?

752
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,309
This ramyeon is too spicy.

753
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:39,550
Should I pour some water in it?

754
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,820
No. It won't be as good, then.

755
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,139
Eat slowly. We have some time left before the bus comes.

756
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,238
Go without me. I'm sleeping over here.

757
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,809
But you know nothing about this neighborhood.

758
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,420
I'm not leaving until I express my feelings for him.

759
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,788
How will you possibly do it? We don't even know if he's here.

760
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:17,849
I'm going to do it.

761
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:19,590
I'll find him and do it.

762
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,530
My heart is overflowing.

763
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,400
I feel suffocated because it keeps overflowing.

764
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,769
It might kill me if I don't tell him.

765
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,340
Still, don't do it. Don't profess your feelings for him.

766
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:40,880
Why?

767
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:43,210
Because I...

768
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,389
am going to report you...

769
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,719
for dating a soldier as a teenager.

770
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,900
You'll report me? Are you out of your mind?

771
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,269
He gave you the wrong address so you couldn't visit him.

772
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,499
You'd be rejected anyway.

773
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,769
It's fortunate that you couldn't see him.

774
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,969
Oh, right. You aren't rejected yet.

775
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,960
She hit me with that spoon first.

776
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,510
Stop crying.

777
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,949
Do you want some gimbap?

778
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:59,420
Ice cream?

779
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:01,889
Chocolate?

780
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,829
Then, should we...

781
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,030
try visiting the base again after this?

782
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,210
Fine.

783
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,179
Let's go and ask them.

784
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,380
Eat up. The noodles might get soggy.

785
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,889
(In front of Jingyeok Base, 7:30pm)

786
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,960
She kept sending letters to this address,

787
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,500
and she received replies too.

788
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,500
Bang Jun Ho is in the First Company of this base.

789
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,570
You got the right base,

790
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,269
but the First Company isn't here anymore.

791
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:51,309
I told you.

792
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:53,469
If they aren't here anymore,

793
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,579
it means they went somewhere else.

794
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,249
Tell us where they went.

795
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,719
I can't tell you because it's a military secret.

796
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,969
Then, could you hand the letter and gift to him?

797
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,469
Look. This isn't a janitor's office.

798
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,539
Then, tell us where he went so we can do it ourselves.

799
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:43,059
The First Company went up to the border zone last week.

800
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,860
It means they're up those mountains.

801
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,530
So, visiting is not allowed for six months.

802
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:50,329
Happy now?

803
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,639
Six...

804
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:13,150
(Reed field in Gangpo-ri, Cheorwon, 9pm)

805
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,469
Hong Ju, let's walk a little faster.

806
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,309
The bus might come soon.

807
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,179
I'm walking. Go on.

808
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,690
If he was going to a place where visiting wasn't allowed,

809
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,989
he should've sent her a letter.

810
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,230
What is with this punk?

811
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:06,570
Wait.

812
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,039
(Cherwon City Bus)

813
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:10,239
Hey. That's the last bus.

814
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,050
Hoo Young, run.

815
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,429
- The bus. - Are you okay?

816
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:29,860
The bus!

817
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:32,130
You should've caught the bus!

818
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,869
But you tripped.

819
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,268
That's not important right now.

820
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,440
What if we even miss the bus to Seoul?

821
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:40,070
Then, we'll sleep over here.

822
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,638
I'm not sleeping with you.

823
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,909
I never said that.

824
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,449
Of course, we'll sleep in separate rooms.

825
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:52,319
Goodness. I'm sorry.

826
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,860
A car cut in.

827
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,659
It's all right.

828
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,099
Can we arrive at the airport by 3pm?

829
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:05,130
Of course. We're getting out of Seoul now.

01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,289
- Hye Ji, I... - Hoo Young. Where are you?

834
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:34,099
I'm on my way to the airport.

835
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,960
Hong Ju got into a car accident.

836
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:39,328
- What? - She's being sent...

837
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,670
to the ER of Obok Hospital.

838
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,539
I'm her guardian. What do I do?

839
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,840
I'll head there now, but she is probably alone.

840
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:49,009
Can you go there before me?

841
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,409
Sir, turn the car.

842
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:52,308
Take me to Obok Hospital.

843
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,348
You'll miss the flight, then.

844
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:55,579
It doesn't matter. Hurry.

845
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:57,690
Sure.

846
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,860
You have left the course.

847
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:07,129
Searching another course.

(Instructions for the medical steps in the emergency room)

853
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,219
I'm here for a patient who came in after a car accident a while ago.

854
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:35,619
Just a moment.

855
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,429
Check one of the beds on the left over there.

856
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,190
Hong Ju.

857
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,400
Are you her guardian?

858
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:22,139
I...

859
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,010
Yes, I am.

860
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,030
Let's send Hong Ju...

861
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,929
to her father's family or an orphanage.

862
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,300
Honey. We've agreed not to say any more about this.

863
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,840
That's before you got pregnant.

864
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,440
Don't tell her.

865
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,550
I'll look into where to send her.

866
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,288
(Autumn of 2012 when Hong Ju was in 11th grade...)

867

(at the infirmary of Obok High School)

868
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,289
You better go see a doctor...

869
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:55,260
and rest up at home.

870
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,369

(Early-leave Pass, Lee Hong Ju)

872
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:02,639
Can I keep this for later?

873
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,369
Hong Ju. You have a high fever.

874
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,840
It's better you see a doctor.

875
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,440
Why must I see another doctor?

876
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:09,908
This is a hospital too.

877
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:12,079
It has medicine and a doctor.

878
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,510
I'm not a doctor.

879
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:16,480
- Are you a quack? - Hong Ju!

880
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:19,119
Goodness.

881
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:22,388
Please don't raise your voice. My head is spinning.

882
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:25,058
So go home and rest up at ease.

883
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:27,130
I feel more at ease here than home.

884
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:29,859
You change sheets every day, right?

885
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,369
This isn't a hotel room.

886
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,099
It's not like I can kick you out when you're sick.

887
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,539
Hold on.

888
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,179
Hey. Why don't you leave school early at least?

889
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,250
No, never mind. Just stay here a little more too.

890
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:01,730
Ma'am.

891
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,829
I'm sorry,

892
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,570
but could you give me some water?

893
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,889
Hong Ju. Are you awake?

894
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:45,739
Hoo Young?

895
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,579
This is...

896
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,280
Don't move. You were sent to this hospital after an accident.

897
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:58,750
I was?

898
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:04,829
I'm saved.

899
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,198
Anyway, what are you doing here?

900
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,368
Wait. I was told to call them when you wake up.

901
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:19,070
- You need a CT scan. - I'm okay.

902
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,639
I wasn't hit by a car. I tripped as I was dodging.

903
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,110
Why did they call you?

904
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,820
Anyway, you must be busy. I'm sorry. I'll take it from here.

905
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:31,489
Hong Ju.

906
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,249
I'm really fine. You can go.

907
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,190
Stop telling me to go. I'm not going anywhere.

908
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,630
Hey. There's no need to get worked up.

909
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,559
I didn't want to bother you for nothing.

910
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,769
"Nothing?"

911
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:06,619
Do you still think it's nothing?

912

(Serendipity's Embrace)

913
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:26,909
Once you're lost,

914
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:29,579
what's real begins.

915
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,579
Are you a fool?

916
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,448
Stop flirting with me.

917
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:12,519
- Hey. - You and I are...

918
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,489
not-so-close high school friends.

919
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,319
Nice catch.

920
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,528
I've always been serious.

921
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,529
(Producer Lee Hong Ju)

922
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,229
Both now and ten years ago.

923
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,029
What in the world is wrong with him?

924
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:26,229
You said...

925
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,970
you would never change.

926
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:32,069
I'm embarrassed that you keep witnessing my ruined romance.

927
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:33,970
I'm rather delighted...

928
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,180
that your romance is ruined.
