(The final episode)

8
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:02,969
Are you okay?

9
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,010
Why did you run like that?

10
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,109
I was going to go to you.

11
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,209
Hoo Young.

12
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,219
It's cold. Why are you wearing something like this?

13
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,060
I wanted to see you quickly.

14
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,930
Why are you not mad at me?

15
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,530
Because I'm not.

16
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,079
Why are you sorry?

18
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,609
I'm more sorry.

19
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,519
I'm really sorry.

20
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,989
You had every reason to be upset and angry.

21
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,189
It's not because I didn't trust you.

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,959
I projected my anxiety onto you and made it your responsibility.

23
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,370
Hong Ju, look at me.

24
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,479
It's all good. It's all good because I saw your face.

25
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,180
Hoo Young.

26
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,979
I like you.

27
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,120
I like you.

28
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,759
I know.

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,729
But I'm sure I like you more.

30
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,199
No. I like you much more.

31
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,669
It's nice and warm.

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,479
I'm home now.

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,250
You should go home quickly. Or you'll catch a cold.

34
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,080
Let me stay just a little bit more.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,719
You'll catch a cold. Go home quickly.

36
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,419
All right. Go in then.

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,889
Okay.

38
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,229
Well...

39
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,469
Do you want to eat ramyeon?

40
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,169
Yes.

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,279
I'm suggesting you eat ramyeon because it's cold.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,580
Just have ramyeon and go.

43
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,519
Warm up your body.

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,150
Would you like to stay under the blanket if it's cold? Never mind.

45
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,860
Well...

46
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,860
Cover yourself with this.

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,099
What's your favorite ramyeon?

48
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,240
I...

49
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,650
- like this one. - Okay. Let me cook it for you.

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Gosh!

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,490
"Gosh!" That's so harsh.

52
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,860
Why did you get so close?

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,219
I said we would just have ramyeon.

54
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,960
What are you thinking other than ramyeon?

55
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,829
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,399
If not, don't seduce me.

57
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,230
You make me look forward to it.

58
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,369
Can I use this pot?

59
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,370
Yes.

60
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,050
Here's water.

61
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,930
Let's sit down on the floor and eat.

62
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm light. Let's eat quickly.

63
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
Why?

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,019
Nothing.

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,269
Hoo Young.

66
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,040
You're good at cooking ramyeon too.

67
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,509
There's nothing you can't do.

68
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,180
Hong Ju, you keep...

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
You're good at many things.

70
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,850
You're good at your job and cool.

71
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,589
Wouldn't you be a better fit...

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,730
in the US where you were?

73
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
Hong Ju.

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,670
It's because I don't want you to give up...

75
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,699
what's precious to you because of me.

76
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,110
Hong Ju. I'm not good at playing games.

77
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,509
I'm a terrible singer too.

78
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,509
I broke as many as six earthen bowls in Sang Pil's restaurant.

79
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,910
When I'm with you,

80
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,379
I keep realizing what I can't do.

81
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,519
But I like it.

82
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,459
Because it makes me realize what I like and what I'm good at.

83
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,089
I've found things I want to do as well.

84
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,500
Things you want to do?

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Here.

86
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,139
Eating ramyeon with you after work.

87
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,339
Going to an arcade and winning all the games...

88
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,079
to humble you.

89
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,279
Taking you somewhere you've never been before...

90
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,579
to see how excited you are.

91
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,849
Watching the animated movie produced by you in a theater...

92
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,120
and taking a picture of your name.

93
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,459
Being in the same photo...

94
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,759
with you.

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,529
These are my dreams.

96
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,230
Do you think they will come true?

97
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:11,800
They will...

98
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,810
come true.

99
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,069
- Do you think so? - Yes.

100
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,779
Dreams always come true.

101
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,750
Hoo Young, are you okay?

102
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
Hong Ju.

103
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,149
Why? Do you have a headache?

104
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,819
Are you sure this is an accident?

105
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:33,860
I think you did it on purpose.

106
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,490
No, it's an accident.

107
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,100
Even if it's an accident, you should take responsibility.

108
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
Not before finishing the ramyeon.

109
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,939
After we eat ramyeon...

110
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,709
and brush our teeth,

111
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,480
I won't let go of you.

112
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:58,850
Me neither.

113
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,790
Let's finish it quickly.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,459
So your mother doesn't want you...

115
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,529
to stay in Korea?

116
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,139
Because my father is in Korea.

117
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,110
They got divorced when I was an 11th grader.

118
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,810
My father met another person...

119
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,680
and asked for forgiveness.

120
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,679
(10 years ago in the departure lounge...)

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,979
(at Incheon International Airport)

122
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,590
I think she couldn't forgive him.

123
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,559
We're never coming back.

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,100
(Republic of Korea)

125
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,909
I guess she was so hurt...

126
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,639
that she didn't want to come back to Korea ever again.

127
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,149
Yes. There is something that needs to be done urgently.

128
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,279
Please prepare for a video conference with the law firm.

129
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,340
Hey, you should've gone early in the morning, at least.

130
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,980
I couldn't go because you were holding my hand tight.

131
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,409
So it's because of me?

132
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,479
You're blaming others again.

133
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,809
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

134
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,990
Mom.

135
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,659
Good morning.

136
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,610
Let's go together. I'll take you to your office.

137
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,450
No, thanks. You should go inside and sleep more.

138
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,179
Why are you following me?

139
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm not following you.

140
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,519
Then...

141
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,629
Is this okay with you?

142
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,679
What are you trying to do with me?

143
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,450
I'm sorry for the last time, Mother.

144
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,950
Why am I your mother?

145
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,659
Should I call you Hoo Young's Mother then?

146
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,059
Madam?

147
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,629
Do Seon.

148
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Aunt?

149
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,960
Oh, right. Ma'am.

150
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,830
Just call me Ms. Baek.

151
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Doesn't it sound too formal,

152
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,139
considering our relationship?

153
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,870
What are we?

154
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,679
We both love Hoo Young.

155
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:53,319
Do you want to fight with me or something?

156
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,750
No, I'm just stating the fact.

157
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,460
I like him a lot.

158
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,429
And I'm going to like his mother too.

159
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,899
I hope we can get along well.

160
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,360
Have a good day.

161
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,639
(Peter's Pen)

162
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,639
(Peter's Pen)

163
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,779
Does she work...

164
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,990
(Peter's Pen)

165
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,659
Even I feel like it's destiny now.

166
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,429
Mr. Kang.

167
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,039
So you really were in Korea.

168
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,980
You said you weren't interested in coming back to Korea.

169
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
I guess I didn't know how I felt.

170
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:02,519
Don't you know that a rumor has spread even to Korea...

171
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,990
that Mr. Oh will offer you something amazing?

172
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,490
A smart man like you...

173
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,429
would never refuse an offer like that.

174
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,528
Why don't you make an offer better than that?

175
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,730
Gosh.

176
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,970
Does Ms. Baek know what you're doing?

177
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,669
Ms. Baek...

178
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,110
knows how good I am at this.

179
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,779
I like your well-founded confidence like this.

180
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,649
You should never meet...

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,490
anyone else other than me. All right?

182
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,289
I knew it!

183
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,199
He said he would get an investment.

184
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,970
It means he will go independent.

185
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,940
Why does he disobey his mother in such a constructive way?

186
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,870
He's indeed...

187
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,038
my son.

188
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,779
It's not the time to be impressed.

189
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,908
They will accept all the conditions he wants.

190
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,249
Why wouldn't they?

191
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,378
He didn't budge an inch when they tried to recruit him.

192
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,888
But now, he wants to join them of his own accord.

193
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,490
They will take our Hoo Young away.

194
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,220
- Be quiet. - How can I be quiet?

195
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,429
It's a do-or-die situation.

196
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,489
I don't know. You can't take him either.

197
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,860
I'll keep him by my side.

198
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,000
My goodness!

199
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,669
My gosh. I knew it.

200
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:28,809
- It was unexpected. - Oh, right.

201
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,240
My friend went to Ko Samui...

202
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,839
for honeymoon recently.

203
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,278
- I heard it was an amazing place. - Is it in Thailand?

204
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,909
Yes. It's in Thailand.

205
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,549
Mr. Son, have you ever thought about a honeymoon destination?

206
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,048
No, I haven't.

207
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,888
He doesn't even have a girlfriend. Why would you ask him that?

208
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,489
Come on. I don't even have a girlfriend.

209
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,999
You're going to get married someday. You should think about it.

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,959
Thinking about it now is useless.

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,869
You're going to go to a place...

212
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,600
your wife wants to go anyway.

213
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,799
That's shocking.

214
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,110
But I couldn't do that. It's so unfair.

215
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:02,809
Mr. Son.

216
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,440
Can we talk for a moment?

217
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,809
Sure.

218
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,460
Should we keep doing this?

219
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
Sorry?

220
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,159
Dating is not a crime. Why should we keep it a secret?

221
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,099
Ms. Kim. There are a lot of watching eyes in school.

222
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,439
What about them?

223
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,740
What? If the rumor spreads in school,

224
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,339
people will gossip about you as if it's nothing.

225
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,210
But what's this?

226
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,110
You talk to me less than before we were dating.

227
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,409
And you avoid me when you see me.

228
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,879
Well, that's...

229
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,490
because I'm bad at hiding it.

230
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,090
That's what I'm saying.

231
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,159
Let's not hide it anymore.

232
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,629
I don't mind if the rumor spreads.

233
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,029
I'm serious.

234
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,269
- Really? - Yes.

235
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,399
Why are your hands so warm?

236
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,500
- Did you warm them up beforehand? - Let go of me!

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,909
I said I was sorry.

238
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,038
You're always being like this.

239
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,409
I thought it was tomorrow.

240
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,580
I can't switch shifts with you no matter what.

241
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,080
Don't ask me something like that ever again.

242
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,120
I won't!

243
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,360
Don't argue with your friend and get along well. Okay?

244
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm reading a comic book.

245
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,580
Go on then.

246
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,519
Your face is more interesting to me.

247
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,460
I can't focus. Look at something else.

248
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,730
What are you doing?

249
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,069
(November 2013, Obok High School)

250
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,440
(My Career Plan, animation director)

251
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,009
"Core competencies?"

252
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,789
My love for animation?

253
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,490
Yes. That's the most important.

254
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,619
Right.

255
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,589
Then...

256
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,259
"Love."

257
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,429
(My love for animation)

258
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,369
Why do I need so many competencies?

259
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,369
What?

260
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,390
- Let's go. - Come on!

261
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,059
Oh, my.

262
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,529
How did someone so athletic...

263
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,529
fall into a pit?

264
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,839
- Pass the ball. - Hey.

265
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,240
- Let's go. - Let's go!

266
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,650
We got this!

267
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,019
Keep going!

268
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,619
- Hey! - Nice!

269
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,740
Hoo Young.

270
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,639
I was looking for you.

271
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,940
It's not time for you to be in the library.

272
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,779
Have you seen this?

273
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,619
("Secret Saints")

274
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:44,619
No.

275
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,319
I'll lend it to you after I finish it.

276
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,690
One of my classmates studies this genre in depth.

277
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,160
When I said I wanted to become an animation director,

278
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,430
she gave it to me as a gift.

279
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm fine.

280
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,130
What?

281
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,538
You said you wanted to become an animation director...

282
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,170
as if it was an incredibly precious dream...

283
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,680
you've never told anyone about.

284
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,338
Did you change your mind as soon as you gave me your dream?

285
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,308
Hey. Do you know which university Hoo Young is applying for?

286
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,809
Hey, what if you know? It's not like you'll be accepted.

287
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,079
If it didn't work out after following him for three years,

288
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,619
you should give up.

289
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,849
Yes.

290
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,960
You heard how the girl who studies liberal arts...

291
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,829
was rejected last time.

292
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,359
Yes. It was crazy in the library.

293
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,329
It's because Hoo Young has no eye for girls.

294
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,339
Hey. You'll become an adult soon.

295
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,210
You'll find a lot of guys who are cuter than him.

296
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,089
They're badmouthing you only.

297
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,829
Be quiet.

298
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,269
Why don't you read the comic book?

299
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,569
I can't help it. You're more handsome than these guys.

300
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,210
I can't refuse that.

301
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,910
I remembered something amazing just now.

302
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,750
But I'm not going to tell you.

303
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,819
Tell me. What's the amazing thing?

304
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:56,890
I won't.

305
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,220
- What is it? - I'm not going to tell you.

306
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,829
- You're not? - No.

307
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,700
- You're not? - Hey, it tickles. Don't do that.

308
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,500
I love you, Hong Ju.

309
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,940
Me too.

310
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:16,940
You do?

311
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,029
What?

312
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,670
It's snowing.

313
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,809
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,779
It's pretty.

315
00:22:58,779 --> 00:22:59,920
Hoo Young?

316
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,650
Hoo Young?

317
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,329
Are you not going to tell me to come in?

318
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,970
Come on in.

319
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,170
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to offer you.

320
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,210
I don't have much time either.

321
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,079
So...

322
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,809
I got this in a bit of a rush.

323
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,119
This is...

324
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,690
It'll be much better than what you expect.

325
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:21,130
I'm not saying I'll take it.

326
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,200
I'll just look inside.

327
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,930
You're here.

328
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,269
I thought I wouldn't get to see you.

329
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,900
The suitcase...

330
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,109
The head office needs one of us back.

331
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,880
Shall we eat together for once?

332
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Mom.

333
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,150
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

334
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,259
Hoo Young.

335
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,789
Do you know why...

336
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,430
I decided to move to the US ten years ago?

337
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,029
You don't think...

338
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,700
it was just because of your dad, do you?

339
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,210
It was...

340
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,049
because of the potential I saw there for us both.

341
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,150
And you never let me down.

342
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,890
Do you really think I dictated...

343
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,519
every decision in your life so far?

344
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,858
While you solved the problems you faced,

345
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,000
I didn't do anything at all.

346
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,930
There was nothing to do.

347
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,700
You solved everything on your own.

348
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,170
It was always you who wrote the final answer.

349
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,779
Mom.

350
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,079
Take it. It'll be my lawyer.

351
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,690
From now on,

352
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,529
I'm going to file a lawsuit against you.

353
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,059
I haven't yet accepted your resignation,

354
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,200
so you must know you're here on a business trip.

355
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,038
I heard you've been using inside information...

356
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,038
to secure investments.

357
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,439
What kind of nonsense...

358
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,940
Whether it's nonsense or not, we'll find out in time.

359
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,150
No one will invest in you with an ongoing lawsuit.

360
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,980
Time is money.

361
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:54,880
Shall we meet in ten days?

362
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,059
Mom.

363
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,759
- Why would you go this far? - I told you.

364
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,630
That I won't change my mind.

365
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,900
What mom would let her son ruin his life?

366
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,670
Even if you do this,

367
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,369
I won't change my mind either.

368
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
I know.

369
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,349
You're like me.

370
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,819
I look forward to seeing what you'll do.

371
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,720
And I worry too.

372
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,660
(Peter's Pen)

373
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,440
(Peter's Pen)

374
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,549
(Peter's Pen)

375
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,319
(Peter's Pen)

376
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,589
(Obok High School)

377
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,400
You were right.

378
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,140
My smart Hoo Young did the math.

379
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:55,170
He'll have chosen wisely.

380
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:56,910
I'm saying I like you too...

381
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,210
if you're the one Hoo Young chose.

382
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,910
So you mean...

383
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,279
Come to the US with him.

384
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,589
I don't have the time to help you pack or make travel arrangements.

385
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,160
That will cover the travel expenses.

386
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,559
You can't max it out, so don't worry.

387
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,900
How do you trust me?

388
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,940
Who knows what I could do with this?

389
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,970
I could buy all sorts of things.

390
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,140
Do you think it's you that I trust?

391
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,480
I trust Hoo Young.

392
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,220
I return to the US today.

393
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,920
Hoo Young and I will embark on a long fight.

394
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,559
Hoo Young would feel reassured if you were by his side.

395
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,369
I don't think I understood a word you said.

396
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,970
Once Hoo Young leaves this time,

397
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,140
he can't come back for a while.

398
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,940
Because I'm good at what I do.

399
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,150
So...

400
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,250
move to the US so we can live together.

401
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,259
My son made the decision...

402
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,190
to give up his good life to stay here with you.

403
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,130
You can't...

404
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,230
leave this stuff behind?

405
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,799
Or...

406
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,640
are you not that serious about him?

407
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,019
Lee Hong Ju?

408
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,059
Mr. Kim.

409
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,730
Why are you out like this in the cold?

410
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,399
You can't be out with wet hair.

411
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,200
You could get deathly sick.

412
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,910
I would rather die than listen to you nag.

413
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,980
Come with me. I'll buy you something hot.

414
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,279
Mr. Kim.

415
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,390
Can I treat you today?

416
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,430
No, it's fine.

417
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,099
I really wanted to use this today.

418
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,400
Put it on this card.

419
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,039
Stick it in the slot.

420
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,078
(Total: 37 dollars and 30 cents)

421
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,210
It's done.

422
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:52,049
You can't follow him there just like that.

423
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,079
The US isn't some next door neighborhood.

424
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,019
I know it's not.

425
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,920
But he likes me a lot.

426
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,358
When I say his name,

427
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,289
he says his heart might pop out of his chest.

428
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,099
I like him too, and I'd like to be with him.

429
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,970
Since it came to this,

430
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:15,509
it might be a good opportunity to see the outside world.

431
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,740
I'm thinking it could be my chance.

432
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,250
It's not an entirely bad idea, is it?

433
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,750
Then you can go.

434
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,789
Things will go one way or the other.

435
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,359
It's just another country where people live.

436
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,289
If it doesn't work out, you can come back.

437
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,960
Right. If it doesn't work out, I can come back.

438
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,470
Mr. Kim.

439
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,339
Should I really go?

440
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,849
Will you really do as I say?

441
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,818
You never did as I said in school.

442
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,130
Why would you listen to me now?

443
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,730
So...

444
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,759
Whatever it is,

445
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,569
you make the decision.

446
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,670
Think carefully what it really is that you want.

447
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,609
I don't worry about you.

448
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,078
I saw you make some decent decisions...

449
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,349
to get this far.

450
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,049
Lee Hong Ju.

451
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,920
As a teacher, I was always proud of you,

452
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,329
and you're my most treasured student.

453
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,930
Have some pride.

454
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,670
Mr. Kim.

455
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,670
Who's the guy you're seeing this time?

456
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,480
Do you remember him?

457
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,180
We went to school together. Kang Hoo Young.

458
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,349
Who?

459
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,590
Kang Hoo Young?

460
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,530
My most beloved math genius and pupil Kang Hoo Young?

461
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,130
He was a match genius,

462
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,698
but was he your beloved pupil?

463
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,230
No way! Why would he date you?

464
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,570
Did you tell him about me?

465
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,110
He must've wanted to see me.

466
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:35,178
If you'd told me about this sooner,

467
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,409
none of this would've happened.

468
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,518
How could you, Mr. Kim?

469
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,150
How could you, Hong Ju?

470
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,519
How come...

471
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,960
(Seoul Taxi)

472
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,030
(Reserved)

473
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,829
Call me when you land.

474
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,599
I will.

475
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,909
I talked to Ms. Lee.

476
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:05,269
You couldn't have said...

477
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,539
what you really wanted to say.

478
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,780
I hope to see you both in the US.

479
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Hong Ju.

480
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:37,909
Lee Hong Ju!

481
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,690
(Hoo Young)

482
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,408
(Kyung Taek)

483
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,779
(Mr. Son, are you here? I haven't seen you around.)

484
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,079
(You don't teach today. Shall we get dinner later?)

485
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,619
What's going on?

486
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,590
Why won't he reply when he has no class?

487
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,468
If you heard a school inspector will visit,

488
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,800
you should prepare ahead.

489
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,109
What would the inspector think of our school?

490
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,908
If we rush about...

491
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,980
after they get here, wouldn't they notice?

492
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,250
You people...

493
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,849
Am I even dating at all?

494
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,078
Why do I feel more lonely?

495
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,649
You should be prepared.

496
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,719
You fool.

497
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,219
What's wrong with you?

498
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,189
Can't you even see where to turn?

499
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,230
Are you okay?

500
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,710
Darn it.

501
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,880
How many times did I tell her not to wear shoes like that?

502
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,679
What a nuisance.

503
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,678
Why won't it come loose?

504
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,150
Who would ever want to marry that thing?

505
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,699
What?

506
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,969
They'll notice our secret relationship.

507
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,110
Hye Ji.

508
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,880
You'd better brace yourself.

509
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,820
What?

510
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,590
I've decided...

511
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,619
not to hide my feelings from anyone.

512
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,530
That's what I wanted.

513
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,369
Father.

514
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,980
I'll marry Hye Ji.

515
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,919
What's going on?

516
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,619
How could you and my daughter...

517
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,989
Do what you will, dear son-in-law.

518
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
Yes!

519
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:28,329
What's going on?

520
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,869
For real? I was the only one who didn't know?

521
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,868
At last.

522
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:36,969
Ms. Kim. We got permission at last.

523
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,980
Oh, gosh. Mr. Kim.

524
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,519
Here you go.

525
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,658
Excuse me. Your food's here.

526
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,359
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

527
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,530
(Grilling Meat Again Today)

528
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,369
- Welcome. - Gosh, it's busy.

529
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:12,909
Sit where you want and read the menu...

530
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,849
I want to sit over there.

531
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,809
Me, there.

532
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,388
Okay?

533
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:24,389
Okay.

534
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,889
(Reserved)

535
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,828
Sorry. This table's reserved.

536
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,089
- It's reserved? - Yes.

537
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,800
- Oh, dear. - The other tables are taken.

538
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,030
Bae Hye Sook.

539
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,570
You came here to eat too?

540
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,569
That's great. I was hungry...

541
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,469
and there were no seats. Can I join you?

542
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:47,409
Hey, wait.

543
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,050
Finish your food.

544
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,519
Hey.

545
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,019
Keep me company.

546
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,820
Don't leave me...

547
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:04,530
on my own today.

548
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,710
Just eat, then.

549
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,210
Of course I'll just eat.

550
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,980
Can I have a bowl of rice?

551
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,049
Why don't we eat together...

552
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,750
and have a drink too?

553
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,320
- Here's your rice. - Thanks.

554
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,500
You're two of my regulars.

555
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:42,099
I'd like to give just you...

556
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,999
Kwon Sang Pil's special delicacy,

557
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,469
spicy chicken feet.

558
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,969
Would you have some?

559
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,070
Yes. And a bottle of soju.

560
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,409
Sure.

561
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,679
Nice.

562
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,710
His chicken feet are good.

563
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,579
You liked spicy foods.

564
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,420
Here's the soju.

565
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
You...

566
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,059
remember that?

567
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,929
It was over 20 years ago.

568
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,260
Could I forget my first boyfriend who had bloody diarrhea...

569
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,969
after every date?

570
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,599
Thanks.

571
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,510
We haven't done this in a while.

572
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,639
Have a shot.

573
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,179
Shall we link arms and drink?

574
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,760
This is nice.

575
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,559
Isn't it, Hye Sook? Don't you remember the old times?

576
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,630
- Eat your food. - Okay.

577
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,730
Everyone's dating but me.

578
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,639
Do you know it's the first time...

579
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,880
we walked around school together?

580
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,449
It is.

581
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,460
It would've been nice if we'd met a little sooner.

582
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,690
Our freshman year would've been ideal.

583
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,289
The year after that would've worked too.

584
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,769
Spring of the year after would've been nice too.

585
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:07,780
Let's go to the US together.

586
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,880
I know it's not an easy decision to make,

587
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,119
but I don't think I can live without you.

588
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,030
I don't think I can part with you again.

589
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,829
Come with me.

590
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,579
Hong Ju. Look at me.

591
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,320
Hoo Young.

592
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,489
I like you.

593
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,690
I like you so much I'm worried...

594
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,030
how I'll manage.

595
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,070
I like you more and more,

596
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,900
and I don't want to be apart from you.

597
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,110
But...

598
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,349
I know.

599
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,519
Everything that's precious to you is here.

600
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,659
Everything you like and want to do.

601
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,570
What I have isn't enough...

602
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,239
to win you over.

603
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:58,820
I'm sorry.

604
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,130
Okay.

605
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,900
I feel better now.

606
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,969
You won't give in...

607
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,840
whoever comes your way.

608
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:21,039
No one can seduce you.

609
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,260
("My Avant-garde Lover")

610
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,659
I found it on the way.

611
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,760
("My Avant-garde Lover")

612
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:49,099
(A first love is special because there's only one in a lifetime.)

613
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,280
We have so many memories with this book.

614
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,219
How could you throw that out?

615
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,690
Hong Ju, keep chasing my dream for me.

616
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,670
Why do you keep crying?

617
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:24,440
I'll come back.

618
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,909
I'll come back to your world.

619
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,610
Okay.

620
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,650
When I come back,

621
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,579
I'll never let you go.

622
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,659
Hoo Young.

623
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,179
What should we do for fun now?

624
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,550
(Goblin Tteokbokki)

625
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,150
Kang Hoo Young. You have to ace this.

626
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,059
Okay.

627
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,489
She's coming.

628
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,800
Who did you bring today?

629
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,369
I'm indeed crazy.

630
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,139
I'm crazy about you.

631
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,019
Hey, that was really bad acting.

632
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,650
She doesn't believe you.

633
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:45,789
- You put him up to this, right? - No.

634
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,489
It's been a while.

635
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,730
- Enjoy your food. - Okay.

636
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,500
- Dig in. - Okay. Let's eat.

637
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,199
Should I hang it here?

638
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,710
Could you help me with this? Come on.

639
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Okay.

640
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,650
- There. - I'll turn on the lights.

641
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,949
Gosh, there it is. We're done.

642
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,019
How beautiful. Do you want to take a picture?

643
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,619
- I'll take it. - Okay.

644
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,889
One, two, three.

645
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,429
- What was that? - One, two, three.

646
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,940
What? Is there a problem?

647
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,340
You don't believe it?

648
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,269
This is fun.

649
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,179
She sort of looks like you.

650
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Is that so?

651
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,908
(Production producers: Lee Chun Mu, Kim Young Ji, Lee Hong Ju)

652
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,679
(Lee Hong Ju)

653
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,670
So how long will it take?

654
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,070
I don't know.

655
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,639
Six months if it gets wrapped fast. If it gets dragged out...

656
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:50,550
I doubt that his mom is really going to sue him.

657
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,909
I bet it's just a warning.

658
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:55,078
I can sense that she's capable of doing more.

659
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,420
No. I strongly believe she will make whatever she wants happen.

660
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,920
Then you'll just wait for him without knowing when he'll be back?

661
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,559
You can't even be sure if he will indeed come back.

662
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:08,099
Oddball.

663
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,070
Are you okay?

664
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:14,670
- Are you okay? - Gosh.

665
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:18,110
Why don't you beg him to stay then?

666
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,309
This isn't like you. Why are you acting so indifferent?

667
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:22,440
You know,

668
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:26,480
it might have been too much for him to insist on staying in Korea.

669
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,719
Then you should go.

670
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,849
He asked you to come with him.

671
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:36,559
If I do, who's going to hang out with you?

672
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:38,760
Who's going to peel Sang Pil's onions?

673
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,960
Peter's Pen will be in big trouble without me.

674
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,969
Kang Hoo Young is so annoying.

675
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,269
He should have never come back if he was going to leave like this.

676
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:51,369
He's leaving after making you fall for him?

677
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,840
Forget about him. You should just move on.

678
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:56,679
You should just dump that guy.

679
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,480
Ever since he came back, every day felt like some vacation.

680
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,718
"What will I do today?"

681
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,219
"What will happen today?" I looked forward to my days.

682
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,030
My heart tickled all day. It felt nice.

683
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,369
Hye Ji. I had so much fun with him.

684
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,599
But this is way too short of a vacation.

685
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,170
Maybe, it was just a spring break.

686
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,610
Spring breaks are the shortest but the most exciting.

687
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,909
Gosh.

688
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,179
I'll entertain you starting today.

689
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,979
I'll tickle you right here every day.

690
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,448
Hey, you should spend time with Mr. Son.

691
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:37,719
I'm going to spend time with you.

692
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,920
You just have to take some days off. I'm on a real break now.

693
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:44,829
What do you say?

694
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,500
Red wine typically has a high alcohol content.

695
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:53,598
That's all the more reason to drink white wine.

696
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,599
Right.

697
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:01,579
This is good.

698
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,609
(I'll be there soon after work. Hang out with them.)

699
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,210
(I have more work than I thought. Next week is the viewing.)

700
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:10,550
Are you all set to fly back to the US?

701
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:12,420
I didn't have much to pack anyway.

702
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,619
I was only supposed to stay here for ten days.

703
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,689
Why can't you go after Christmas?

704
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,889
What's the rush?

705
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,559
All right. Where should I put this?

706
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:21,860
Why isn't Hong Ju here already?

707
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,000
She texted us to let us know she was running late.

708
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,428
The viewing is next week.

709
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,269
Hey, does she think she owns a part of the company?

710
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,000
The viewing isn't important right now.

711
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,440
Of course, it is.

712
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,840
Work is the only thing she has right now.

713
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:35,079
She won't have her boyfriend. She'll be all alone now.

714
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,609
Come on, Hye Ji.

715
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,610
What?

716
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:41,519
What?

717
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,349
You'll use Kyung Taek as your shield?

718
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:45,449
Yes.

719
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,690
Gosh. I give up.

720
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,389
When is Uncle Wook coming?

721
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,429
He told us to count him out.

722
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,360
He's not going to join our party?

723
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,800
I bet he's seeing a woman.

724
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:18,590
Gosh, hey. Be careful.

725
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,860
What kind of woman would like to walk in the snow?

726
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,960
What? Don't you know this is a beautiful sight?

727
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,598
We dated in summer,

728
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,630
so we never got a chance to spend a snowy day.

729
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:34,670
We dated in winter.

730
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,670
You and I went snowboarding too.

731
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:40,840
Oh, that.

732
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:42,880
That wasn't you.

733
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,210
So you did go snowboarding with another woman.

734
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:51,420
What? Are you asking me to catch you right now?

735
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,219
You'll fall. Be careful.

736
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,760
Hey, our bones won't heal now. Wait up for me.

737
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:01,599
Speaking of which, who was your first love, Sang Pil?

738
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:03,868
Mine was Kang Hoo Young.

739
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:05,729
Kang Hoo Young's first love was Hong Ju.

740
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,900
Lee Hong Ju's first love was Bang Jun Ho.

741
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:12,739
But we don't know only your first love.

742
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,179
You don't know her.

743
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,150
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

744
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,280
I know every woman you know.

745
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:21,649
It must be that girl.

746
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,049
The one who dumped you when you went to serve in the military.

747
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,219
What was her name? Soo Ji?

748
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,389
It was Ji Soo.

749
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,920
Besides, she wasn't my first love.

750
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,389
My first love...

751
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,500
hasn't come yet.

752
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,099
The girl I fall in love with next will be my first love.

753
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,340
Loving her would mean...

754
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:47,309
I'd be in love for the first time.

755
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,250
Kyung Taek.

756
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,050
You're my first love too.

757
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,489
- You're mine too. - No.

758
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,859
Your first love was your elementary school teacher.

759
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Gosh.

760
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:03,530
Is she pretty?

761
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,530
She will turn 60 soon.

762
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,530
What's wrong with turning 60?

763
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,300
You don't think I'll be pretty when I turn 60?

764
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,900
Of course, you'll look gorgeous even when you're 60.

765
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,239
Kyung Taek. You'll be handsome even until the age of 100.

766
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,480
I'm going to set up...

767
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,709
a hideout like this before I turn 40.

768
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,919
I'll set up the kitchen here.

769
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,949
And the rest... Kyung Taek.

770
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,448
You take care of your own business.

771
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,988
What does Kyung Taek have to do with anything?

772
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:35,090
Hoo Young. I think I need to pull an all-nighter today.

773
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,260
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.

774
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,090
- I wouldn't even go if you did. - Gosh.

775
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,300
Where's he going?

776
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:03,750
(Hong Ju)

777
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:09,019
Hey, where are you?

778
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,659
You'd better come quickly.

779
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,558
I'm stuck here.

780
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,599
- Can you move that back a bit? Yes. - Is it too long?

781
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,969
Something seems off about this scene.

782
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,630
Up to this point.

783
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,928
Do we have another take?

784
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,199
You'd better come quickly.

785
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:23,239
- I'm stuck here. - Great.

786
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,109
The person you reached is unavailable.

787
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,638
You'll be directed to voicemail after the tone.

788
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,510
(Hong Ju)

789
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,059
Hong Ju is coming home pretty late.

790
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:48,099
She texted me to let me know she had to pull an all-nighter.

791
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:51,799
I heard you guys met...

792
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,070
because of Hye Ji's letters for you.

793
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,269
Actually, that morning,

794
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,969
we met by coincidence before the whole letter thing.

795
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,780
We met on the bus.

796
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,849
I see.

797
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,078
By the way, you know that...

798
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,449
I also played a part in helping you two meet again...

799
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,320
after you came back to Korea, right?

800
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:15,320
I picked the cafe for the blind date.

801
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,500
In the end, you two would have met in the building here.

802
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,670
But maybe, I contributed to making your reunion a bit more dramatic.

803
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,239
You're right.

804
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:36,780
Thanks to you, it was more dramatic.

805
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,779
I'm rooting...

806
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,179
for your relationship more than anyone.

807
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,489
I hope it snows a lot, so your flight gets canceled.

808
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,329
But your plane will have no problem taking off tomorrow.

809
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:04,739
I was just saying that you would be able to travel safely.

810
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,480
Right.

811
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,920
(Reserved)

812
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,760
Hey.

813
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,690
- What about Oddball? - She's at work.

814
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,929
At work? Gosh. She's unbelievable.

815
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,670
Who knows when he'll be back?

816
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,968
Let me give her a call.

817
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:36,440
- Wait. My phone... - Gosh.

818
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,539
We talked on the phone early in the morning.

819
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:45,980
Sang Pil, this feels weird.

820
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,690
You know what? Let me see you off at the airport.

821
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,159
You can't close your restaurant for two days in a row.

822
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,090
You should go to work too, Uncle.

823
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,829
- Have a safe flight. - Okay.

824
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,460
Hong Ju...

825
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:06,400
Never mind. I'm sure you two will work it out.

826
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:08,699
Hey.

827
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:12,139
Let's have another go at it when you come back.

828
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,210
I won't go easy on you then.

829
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:17,380
You should go to work now. You too, Sang Pil.

830
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,480
Bye.

831
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:21,679
Call me.

832
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,388
(Special Lecture: Meeting with Writer Bang Jun Ho)

833
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:32,158
(How to be a good writer)

834
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,599
We all become writers the moment we are brought into this world.

835
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:37,699
I bet you all lied at least once in your life when you were a kid.

836
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,099
- Right. - Right.

837
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,800
You ran through in your head what kind of story you would tell.

838
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:45,239
Then you expressed that in somewhat decent sentences.

839
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,280
That's what writers do.

840
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,579
I bet you all have written letters and kept a journal. Right?

841
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,579
- Right. - Right.

842
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,388
Read the journal you wrote and the letters you received...

843
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:58,949
from those days.

844
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,419
- How could he leave... - Your imagination and sentences...

845
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,820
without saying goodbye?

846
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:04,828
Perhaps, writers...

847
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:06,389
He'll come and visit you the next time he comes back.

848
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,230
See? This is what I mean. You know?

849
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,800
Even if you adore your students, it will be just one-sided love.

850
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,739
I'll end up getting hurt.

851
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:19,340
Just like me, if you...

852
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,579
My dear son-in-law.

853
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,650
I just need you, no one else.

854
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,150
Yes, Father.

855
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,719
I'm relying on you too, Father.

856
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:38,489
Lastly, does anyone have questions?

857
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,960
Could you tell us a little bit about your next novel?

858
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,300
I've never shared this anywhere.

859
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,869
I'm not sure if I should tell you guys.

860
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,509
- Please. - Please tell us.

861
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,840
- Please. - Please.

862
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:03,480
I'm thinking about writing a story of a man...

863
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:07,590
who loves a woman to death, but has to say goodbye to her.

864
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,219
Why do they have to break up?

865
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,730
Because the woman left him.

866
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,230
It's not based...

867
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,599
- on your experience, right? - What's the title?

868
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:21,840
What do you think?

869
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,070
Do you think I experienced such a heartbreaking love story?

870
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,409
Yes. I think so.

871
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,609
Who's that woman? That's crazy.

872
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,780
- It's your ex-girlfriend, right? - Mr. Bang.

873
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,380
Bang Jun Ho is still the same.

874
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,579
That was so mean.

875
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,789
- Come on. - Good luck.

876
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,690
- Who is she? Bring her here. - Hang in there.

877
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,090
Yes. You win.

878
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,650
(From Incheon to San Francisco)

879
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:10,579
Lee Hong Ju.

880
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,079
Hey. It's you, Kang Hoo Young.

881
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:19,719
What are you doing here?

882
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:23,590
Are you really surprised?

883
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:27,159
- You... - I have way too many vacation days.

884
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,329
You have to show me around this time.

885
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,570
Kang Hoo Young.

886
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,639
This isn't a coincidence.

887
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:40,570
I found you, so I could save you.

888
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,409
Thanks for saving me.

889
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,489
Hold on, look at me. I want to see your face.

890
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,859
I didn't even tell our friends...

891
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,760
to see this surprise look on your face.

892
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:03,260
I was itching to tell you, but I had to keep...

893
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,789
In life,

894
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:27,960
how many coincidences will we encounter?

895
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:52,409
Ma'am.

896
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,949
I'm sorry,

897
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,519
but could you give me some water?

898
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:09,760
Here's your water.

899
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,339
Sometimes, coincidences pass by without anyone realizing them.

900
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,149
You guys look great. Let me take the picture now.

901
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,749
Everyone, come closer.

902
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,519
- Here it goes. - Wait. Okay.

903
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,948
One, two...

904
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:33,389
Hey, let's go and buy the melon bread. Hurry up!

905
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:34,920
(Award)

906
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,530
Come on.

907
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,860
Hurry!

908
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:47,800
In life, how many coincidences will we encounter?

909
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:53,109
Sometimes, these mere coincidences...

910
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,110
change the direction of our lives.

911
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,550
What's clear is that behind every coincidence,

912
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:06,420
there was a fateful decision we made.

913
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,619
Does it mean we're fate?

914
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Goodness.

915
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:27,479
You can let go of me now.

916
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,079
Thank you.

917
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,479
I'm safe thanks to you.

918
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,189
Wait. Your leg... Are you okay?

919
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,430
Is he okay?

920
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,840
(Kang Hoo Young)

921
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,850
(Obok-dong, Obok University, Mapo Station)

922
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,109
Then we met and fell in love with each other. Does it mean...

923
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:36,979
it's a coincidence?

924
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:42,119
(Serendipity's Embrace)

925
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,419
Departing to San Francisco...

926
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,489
I can't believe my first trip abroad will be with you.

927
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,760
We're going to the US at that too. I'm so excited.

928
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:53,630
Let's eat some delicious food at the duty free shop.

929
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,259
Should we buy a present for your mom too?

930
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,460
- It's on me. - Okay.

931
01:09:58,899 --> 01:09:59,969
- Hong Ju. - Yes.

932
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,369
I'm asking you this just to be safe.

933
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,409
You got the visa, right?

934
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:06,640
Who do you think I am?

935
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:08,979
Hold on.

936
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,149
What visa?

937
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:15,720
- Visa... - What's "visa?"

938
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,949
You really didn't get it?

939
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:20,090
What is it?

940
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,890
Hey, you can't enter the US without a visa.

941
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,488
Do I need it? Does it mean I can't go?

942
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:26,659
You can't. You'll have to fly alone later.

943
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:34,369
