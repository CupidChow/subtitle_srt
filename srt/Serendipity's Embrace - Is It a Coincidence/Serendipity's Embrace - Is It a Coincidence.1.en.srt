(Serendipity's Embrace)

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,780
(Episode 1)

8
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,629
Hey.

9
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,729
Don't you think it's better to stay in a hotel?

10
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,030
It would be uncomfortable to stay here.

11
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,700
It's close to the office.

12
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:38,969
That's true.

13
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,640
But this is not a good environment to work.

14
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,579
All right.

15
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,518
You're the ace who came from the head office.

16
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,489
What can't I do for you?

17
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,819
Fine.

18
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,390
Welcome to my hideout!

19
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,290
Hoo Young.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,599
Do you think you can solve the issue with Roem in ten days?

21
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,869
- Why? - Ten days are too short.

22
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,770
You came to Korea after ten years. Why don't you stay longer?

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,568
- What for? - "What for?"

24
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,769
You should meet your friends...

25
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,770
and look around Seoul to see how much it has changed.

26
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,409
I don't have friends.

27
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,680
I don't have interest either.

28
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:23,479
It's old.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,750
So I renovated it a little bit.

30
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,490
Isn't it amazing?

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,789
Hey, this is my parents' house.

32
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,830
It's just that it's registered under your mother's name.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,629
It's not like you're going to live in Korea, right?

34
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,669
Aren't you hungry?

35
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,969
Do you want your uncle to take you to an amazing restaurant today?

36
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,300
I have plans.

37
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,039
Plans?

38
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,169
You just said you didn't have friends.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,340
Oh, you don't have friends but a woman?

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,879
So it's a woman.

41
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm wearing bright clothes.

42
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,419
Of course, I put on makeup too.

43
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,330
I put on lotion, foundation, and lip balm.

44
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,299
Oh, I filled in my eyebrows too.

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,860
The next step is called makeup.

46
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,999
Adding colors like red, pink, and peach.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,599
Colors.

48
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,979
All right. I'm going to add colors.

49
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,639
You're here for a blind date, aren't you?

50
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,509
Hello.

51
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,029
I'm Hye Ji's friend, Lee Hong Ju.

52
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,970
(Kang Hoo Young)

53
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,290
Lee Hong Ju?

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,819
Is that really you?

55
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Sorry?

56
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,529
Mr. Kang Hoo Young?

57
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,579
I mistook you for someone else.

58
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,680
Have a great time.

59
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,519
Hello.

60
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,790
Hello.

61
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,889
Are you Lee Hong Ju?

62
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,790
Hello.

63
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,490
I'm Mi So, Joseph's cousin.

64
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,829
Oh Mi So.

65
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,459
I'm Kang Hoo Young.

66
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,670
I know.

67
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,670
- Would you like to eat something? - Do you not recognize me?

68
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,110
We went to the same school.

69
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,980
We said hi at Joseph's wedding too.

70
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,209
We also ate at the same table.

71
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,519
I had the red dress on with brown curls.

72
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,420
Well, the past isn't important.

73
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,160
We can get to know each other from now on.

74
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,089
Then...

75
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,060
I'll have caramel macchiato.

76
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,560
What would you like to...

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,429
Was it...

78
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,430
Oh, yes.

79
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,509
Did you know her?

80
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,339
She's my high school friend.

81
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,839
Did you guys date?

82
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,480
Is she your ex?

83
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,980
I mean, you recognized her immediately.

84
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:55,850
She hasn't changed at all.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,019
I guess you've changed a lot then.

86
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,430
She didn't recognize you.

87
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,470
You should order first.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
What?

89
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,490
Did she really not recognize me?

90
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,779
What should we eat?

91
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,279
I booked a pasta place near here.

92
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,980
Ms. Kim recommended the place and said you would like it.

93
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,879
I see.

94
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,549
Instead of that place,

95
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,360
why don't we go to a really nice pork belly place I know?

96
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,289
Not many people know the place,

97
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,800
but I want to introduce it to you only.

98
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,970
Well...

99
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,170
Yes.

100
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,669
She said you would suggest...

101
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,670
going to a pork belly place.

102
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,310
She said I should never listen to you.

103
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,008
Hye Ji is a regular at the restaurant too.

104
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,680
She said she wasn't a regular.

105
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,619
It's a perfect day to eat pasta.

106
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,690
- Yes. We're going there. - Right.

107
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,299
Hoo Young, why don't we skip dinner...

108
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,470
and have a drink...

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,440
in a nice bar near my place?

110
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,798
I brought my car.

111
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,309
Let me drive you home.

112
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,539
No. I should stop by a place near here.

113
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,879
Still...

114
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
How about you?

115
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,950
I didn't bring my car.

116
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,950
Then...

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,519
Goodbye.

118
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,389
What?

119
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh, I don't know much about the roads in Seoul.

120
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,730
I had a good time today.

121
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,700
It was nice to meet you today.

122
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,610
Coming!

123
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,179
(Joseph Oh)

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,750
It's early in the morning.

125
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,449
That's because of you.

126
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,350
I woke up because of you.

127
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,250
Why did you dump her?

128
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't put it that way. It's all taken care of.

129
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,690
Hoo Young.

130
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,929
I wasn't asking your favor as a client.

131
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,389
I said that I was a friend.

132
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,929
If that was the case, I should've refused it.

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,029
Mi So is pretty, fit,

134
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,470
and has a good family background.

135
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,539
She even works in the States now. So why not?

136
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,439
I will add a provision about the privacy issue...

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,980
the first thing in our next contract.

138
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,219
Are you coming back before the company party?

139
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,778
- Yes. - How did you get permission...

140
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,519
for the family office from my dad?

141
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,090
You know he never leaves his money to someone else.

142
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,429
Anyway, you're good.

143
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,730
It's not decided yet.

144
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,960
It is.

145
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,100
And since you're totally involved now,

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,870
just make sure you see all the people you've missed before coming.

147
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,840
So you don't leave things behind your career. All right?

148
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,639
I'm Hye Ji's friend, Lee Hong Ju.

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,178
I came to work.

150
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,789
You have such a boring life.

151
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,649
Life is meant to be boring.

152
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,720
Back to sleep.

153
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,749
The next arriving buses...

154
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,259
are number 761, 6712,

155
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,789
and 7731.

156
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,360
Hong Ju?

157
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,059
Hey, she called you out.

158
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,870
What's going on?

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Are you not going to take it?

160
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,190
(From HJ)

161
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,259
Will you write a reply?

162
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,830
(From HJ)

163
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,269
Hong Ju!

164
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,120
Gosh.

165
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,950
I guess I took the wrong road.

166
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,138
Sir. Two portions of sundae to go, please.

167
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,669
- Half sundae and half organs. - Half and half. Okay.

168
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,779
Welcome.

169
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,950
What would you like to have, Mr. Handsome?

170
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,449
I'll have the same one with her.

171
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,888
She ordered one serving of tteokbokki, tempura...

172
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,058
And how many fishcakes did she have? One, two, three. She had three.

173
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,230
Would you like to have the same one?

174
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,758
I'll just have one serving of tteokbokki.

175
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,799
Sure.

176
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,409
Here.

177
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,850
Can I have some fishcake broth too?

178
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,100
Get me some tissue too.

179
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,740
- Hong Ju. - Why?

180
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,580
Do you not know me?

181
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,179
I know. You're Kang Hoo Young.

182
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,690
Why didn't you act like you knew me when you did?

183
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,019
Do I have to?

184
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,619
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

185
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,659
I see.

186
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,460
It's been that long?

187
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,929
By, the way, were you in Korea?

188
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,669
You emigrated to the US, didn't you?

189
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,340
I did.

190
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,240
I came to Korea briefly for work.

191
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,769
You came to Korea briefly for work, and you went on a blind date?

192
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,409
Did you recognize me at the cafe too?

193
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,980
I did. You look just the same as when you were in high school.

194
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,720
You haven't changed either.

195
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,850
Hey, that's an insult, isn't it?

196
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not sure.

197
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,820
Do you keep in contact with your friends?

198
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,759
No. You're the first one I met.

199
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,259
Is that so?

200
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,269
Aren't you curious about their news?

201
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,269
I'm curious now.

202
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,240
Give me your number then.

203
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,980
I don't have a Korean number, but I'm roaming.

204
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,850
Okay. Give me that one then.

205
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,418
I keep in contact with only a few.

206
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,590
But Hye Ji knows a lot.

207
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,759
They must be thrilled to see you.

208
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,359
How about you?

209
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,069
Are you not happy to see me?

210
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,269
I'm so sorry. I ruined your jacket.

211
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,539
I'm so sorry.

212
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,009
I mean...

213
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,980
You made me laugh with your nonsense.

214
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,789
Sir.

215
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,160
Give the change to him.

216
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,588
I'm really sorry.

217
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,259
Take the chance to wash your clothes.

218
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,259
My bus has come. Bye.

219
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,900
Sir.

220
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,309
- Yes. - Here's the change.

221
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,420
Here's the change.

222
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,229
What idiot parked their car in front of the bus stop?

223
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,359
It's getting towed away. Gosh.

224
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,960
Darn it.

225
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,139
(Towing Notice)

226
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,710
(State of the Car Before Towing)

227
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,289
(Chats)

228
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,920
She didn't even text me after leaving like that.

229
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,589
I'm not happy to see you at all either.

230
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,630
Who remembers what happened ten years ago?

231
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,419
This bus stop is Obok High School.

232
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,289
(10 years ago, Obok-dong, Seoul)

233
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,009
Hey.

234
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,210
Wake your friend up and get off with her.

235
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,579
The female student in the back.

236
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,019
- I don't know her. - It doesn't matter.

237
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,690
Just wake her up.

238
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,109
Who are you?

239
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
The driver said you should get off.

240
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,960
Thank you, sir.

241
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,960
Are you not getting off?

242
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,069
(In front of the gate of Obok High School, 8:29am)

243
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,069
Five, four,

244
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,769
three,

245
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,180
two, one.

246
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,079
Time's up. You're late.

247
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,779
You're late again?

248
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,420
You were late yesterday, weren't you?

249
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,519
You're late. On your knees.

250
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,859
Arms above your heads.

251
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,089
Next to your ears!

252
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,289
- What's a student's duty? - What are you doing?

253
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,899
- It's to come to school on time... - Hey.

254
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,229
- and study hard. - Let's stick together, comrade.

255
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,768
- To go to a good college... - Let go of me.

256
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:38,999
- and become... - Let's go.

257
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,539
A decent member of society.

258
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,470
You're constantly late.

259
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,880
Lee Hong Ju. Stop.

260
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,879
(Obok High School)

261
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,980
- You... - Yes?

262
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,390
You're late again.

263
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,420
I was late helping him.

264
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,730
We just met for the first time.

265
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,029
What are you saying?

266
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,829
We're real close.

267
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,799
You woke me this morning when I was fast asleep.

268
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,099
Sir. My arm will snap pretty soon.

269
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:13,900
Lee Hong Ju.

270
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,709
Let go of his arm.

271
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,279
Sir. Him and I are real friends.

272
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,779
- Do you know my name? - Your name?

273
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,779
You have no loyalty.

274
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,519
Why should I be loyal to someone...

275
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,019
who doesn't even know my name?

276
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,859
Hey, you. You can go.

277
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,799
Why? He was late too.

278
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't you see his leg?

279
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,239
Go ahead.

280
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Thank you.

281
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,869
Darn it.

282
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,339
- Let's see your backpack. - No!

283
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,109
Sir.

284
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:00,849
Sir.

285
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,289
- Oh, no. - You punk. Look at all this.

286
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,990
What are these?

287
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,890
Where are your textbooks?

288
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,930
These are my textbooks.

289
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,690
This is what I need to learn.

290
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,329
You don't know anything.

291
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Darn you.

292
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,529
That hurt.

293
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,069
Don't hit me on the head. You'll kill more brain cells.

294
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,470
You don't have any brain cells left to kill.

295
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,568
(Obok High School)

296
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,039
Hurry in and study.

297
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,680
You...

298
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
When Y...

299
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:39,989
(6th period, Math)

300
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,829
is TBD,

301
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,170
from integral one to zero, function X...

302
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,599
Solve for 2X.

303
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
There.

304
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,079
("My Avant-garde Lover")

305
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,308
Let's stick together, comrade.

306
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,410
("My Avant-garde Lover")

307
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,889
Underline "integral f(x) dx."

308
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,890
(A first love is special because there's only one in a lifetime.)

309
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,990
Solve that.

310
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,359
- Who can solve it? - How childish.

311
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,229
Whoever can solve this can save the world.

312
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,758
(Being unseen means you can't be loved.)

313
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,899
Did someone smear honey on your desks?

314
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,230
Why are you all looking down?

315
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Goodness.

316
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,000
(By Bang Jun Ho)

317
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
Kang Hoo Young.

318
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,210
Come up and solve this.

319
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,849
(Polynomial function f(x)...)

320
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,599
Wait.

321
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,170
The answer is 22?

322
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,670
Applause.

323
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,079
Correct.

324
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,309
This is how the best student solves a math problem.

325
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:12,880
Look at him.

326
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,720
He's handsome and smart.

327
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,150
He's smart and handsome.

328
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,660
Doesn't that make you want to work harder?

329
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,829
Wait and see.

330
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,598
You'll be grateful for things like math...

331
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,299
that have correct answers.

332
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,069
Life?

333
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,240
Life comes with so many options.

334
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,009
But...

335
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,849
it's possible none of them are the correct answer.

336
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Dreams?

337
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,420
They come with no answers at all.

338
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,250
What about love?

339
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:51,789
Love.

340
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,099
You might not even get a chance to solve a problem like love.

341
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,269
Sir.

342
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,200
Are you cursing us?

343
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,769
- Yes. - How could you?

344
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,109
Hey, it's Hoo Young.

345
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,430
(Ms. Kim)

346
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,930
Someone might call the police.

347
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,839
It was actually Kang Hoo Young?

348
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,240
Obok High's golden boy?

349
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,210
Yes, that Kang Hoo Young.

350
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,640
No way.

351
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,880
When did you meet? Where did you meet?

352
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,419
We met earlier in the day at a cafe,

353
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,720
and then in the street.

354
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,019
Well?

355
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,859
Is he the same?

356
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,259
Almost?

357
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,869
Are you that pleased?

358
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,000
Of course I am. It's Kang Hoo Young.

359
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,210
I wanted to know so bad how he was doing.

360
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,440
What does he do?

361
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,980
Is he doing okay? Does he live here?

362
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,109
Is he married?

363
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,220
I don't know. We didn't say much.

364
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,618
You ask him.

365
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,289
I can't ask him. He was my first love.

366
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,589
Right.

367
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,599
He was Kim Hye Ji's first love.

368
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,669
(Lunch break, Obok High playground)

369
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,369
Stop getting caught by my dad.

370
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,339
He says you make him regret becoming a teacher.

371
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,579
These days, I regret becoming a student.

372
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,848
(No to corporal punishment)

373
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,910
What?

374
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,380
I have high school senior disease.

375
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,690
You're too busy studying to hang out with me.

376
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,319
School is no longer fun. I just feel sleepy.

377
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:41,660
What's the point of being a student?

378
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,029
Isn't studying an option?

379
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,140
Oddball.

380
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:54,640
I have something to say.

381
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,009
Okay. Say it.

382
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,539
You know...

383
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,179
I don't feel like studying.

384
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,380
(No to corporal punishment)

385
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,579
And I have no appetite.

386
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,880
A schoolgirl with no appetite?

387
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,750
This is a sign of...

388
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,750
We study at the same academy.

389
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,659
You're embarking on a real romance at last.

390
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,190
Who's the guy?

391
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,059
His name is Kang Hoo Young.

392
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,559
Kang Hoo Young?

393
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,269
Who's that? I don't know the name.

394
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,739
He's the top student in our year.

395
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,599
Darn it. The top student?

396
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,170
Hey. You went from Brad Pitt to the top student.

397
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,980
Your standards have zero consistency.

398
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,180
What is it?

399
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,289
- Who is it? - Don't.

400
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,119
It'll look too obvious.

401
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,059
Just take a peek.

402
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,059
The guy with the leg cast.

403
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,160
The jerk this morning had a cast too.

404
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,900
If I see him again, I'll break his other...

405
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,509
Is that Kang Hoo Young?

406
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,538
Kim Hye Ji. That jerk's...

407
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,740
So handsome, right?

408
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,049
He's the guy who ditched me after I helped him.

409
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,509
He even laughed at me when I got told off.

410
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:15,849
Hey.

411
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,519
Can I tell him I like him?

412
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,799
Of course you can.

413
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,630
Tell him.

414
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,730
Hey.

415
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,309
I feel it.

416
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:37,839
What do you feel?

417
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,109
You and him will definitely be a couple.

418
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,839
Hey, it's Hoo Young.

419
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,309
Get over here, Hye Ji. It's Hoo Young.

420
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:21,879
(5pm)

421
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,849
(2nd floor hallway, senior boys' classrooms)

422
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,799
Oddball. I can't do this.

423
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,269
Why? Are you nervous?

424
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,769
I can't go.

425
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,009
I can't do it.

426
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,109
Oddball.

427
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,808
Could you give it to him for me?

428
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,409
No way. Give it to him yourself.

429
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,049
I can't.

430
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
I can't do it.

431
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,049
Just pass him the letter.

432
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,390
Just this once.

433
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,759
No.

434
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,329
You must confess yourself.

435
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,490
Bang Jun Ho's barracks address.

436
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,559
Deal?

437
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,869
I'll do it for you.

438
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,670
In the name of our love.

439
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,539
- You got this. - I got this.

440
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,710
Good luck.

441
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,309
Good luck.

442
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,079
(From HJ)

443
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,619
Will you write a reply?

444
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,789
It's from my friend Kim Hye Ji.

445
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,329
She likes you.

446
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,170
You have my book, don't you?

447
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,809
When did you put it in my...

448
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,278
- Who's there? - Shoot.

449
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,579
Who's the girl on the boys' floor?

450
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,319
Return the book with the reply.

451
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,018
- It's important. I need it back. - There's nothing to see.

452
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,019
Get back inside. Go, now!

453
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,430
Yes.

454
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,469
("Pong From the Sky")

455
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,700
("My Avant-garde Lover")

456
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,609
It was childish.

457
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,439
Snotty kids fall for...

458
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,680
just anyone as their first love.

459
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,680
Don't you dare forget you said that.

460
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,619
Don't forget you owe me ten beers and fried chickens.

461
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:37,689
Hey. Wasn't Mr. Son a nice guy?

462
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,619
Yes. He was nice.

463
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,259
I haven't met someone like him in a while.

464
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,759
He was like...

465
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,429
- a boulder. - Right?

466
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,868
Wasn't he the type that would stick next to you...

467
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,430
and protect you?

468
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,199
The first meeting...

469
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,239
dictates how a couple ends up.

470
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,039
It's all about how you feel at first.

471
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,910
I meant I don't think he'll ever roll my way.

472
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,980
I see.

473
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,849
Hey.

474
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:06,180
Should you judge a book by looking at the cover once?

475
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,679
You must meet at least three times to know the person.

476
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,819
You said you wouldn't bother me...

477
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,389
if I showed up just this once.

478
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,920
What are blind dates for, Oddball?

479
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,788
You need to date.

480
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,459
Your explosive appetite...

481
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,929
is caused by frustration due to the lack of love.

482
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,429
Buddy, I think that love...

483
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,198
and dating...

484
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,239
is forced on us these days.

485
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,539
It's a waste of time, money, and energy.

486
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,210
There's so much else we should do in the world.

487
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,610
The glaciers are melting.

488
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,280
The next generation might not have a planet to live on.

489
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,819
What happened to the friend who said love is the only method...

490
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,420
of human survival?

491
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,320
What about the friend who wants her first love's phone number?

492
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,230
Protect our planet. Save energy.

493
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,129
(Oddball)

494
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,369
Ms. Kim's first love. Good luck.

495
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,078
Tteokbokki, tempura, fishcake.

496
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,650
I ate a portion each.

497
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,849
That's 10 dollars and 50 cents.

498
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,519
Is it?

499
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,190
I paid for dry-cleaning, so I hope he doesn't complain.

500
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,559
Oh, whatever.

501
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,329
I can't be bothered to shower.

502
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,099
I don't want to move.

503
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,879
(2 portions of sundae, takeout)

504
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,979
(Tteokbokki, tempura, fishcake, 10.50 dollars)

505
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,308
(Sundae 9 dollars)

506
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,409
(Total 19.50 dollars)

507
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,329
Yes, that's fine.

508
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,468
Okay, I'll see you later.

509
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:05,539
Sure.

510
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,069
Okay.

511
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,138
Oh, he's here.

512
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,969
I'll call you later. Bye.

513
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,309
Good morning, everyone.

514
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,448
Sit back down.

515
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,280
You never stood up. Stay seated.

516
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,349
Why the weird faces?

517
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,218
You look surprised.

518
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,119
Why? What is it?

519
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,059
Is it because Mr. Kang here and I...

520
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,690
look so much alike?

521
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,329
All handsome guys look alike.

522
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,868
Let me introduce Kang Hoo Young here.

523
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,399
He could've become...

524
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,768
a professor of math at an Ivy League university...

525
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,939
many times over.

526
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
Mr. Baek.

527
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,109
He has great business acumen,

528
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,149
and he's the one who made Rock Asset...

529
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,409
a successful US business that targeted Koreans.

530
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,749
He's the one who set this company on the track to become...

531
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,889
a family office and professional private asset management company.

532
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,460
Applause.

533
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,359
The Roem case is a huge headache, I know.

534
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,570
Let's sort that one out with our ace here.

535
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,099
A short speech, Mr. Kang?

536
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,038
Mr. Kang?

537
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,079
- Fifty. - "Fifty?"

538
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,618
It should be minus 2,983,740 dollars.

539
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,250
The second total on the fourth page.

540
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,460
You used different formulas for each column.

541
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,530
You used Euro rates for the profit of the Singapore building sale...

542
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,230
and the Hong Kong back-door...

543
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,299
Isn't he amazing?

544
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,569
He's our ace for a reason.

545
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,868
This is how much he cares about work.

546
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,610
All the Roem materials.

547
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,539
Hand them over to me.

548
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,309
The head office will take it from here.

549
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,320
Hey. Hoo Young.

550
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,820
Why would the head...

551
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,558
It's okay. Wait right here.

552
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,360
I'll take care of... Set, set, set, Rock Asset.

553
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,139
Oh, gosh.

554
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,739
Hey. What was that?

555
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,110
Why would the head office take over?

556
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,980
It was decided before I came here.

557
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,650
Without a word to me?

558
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,519
I'm head of the Korea office.

559
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,348
So what if Baek Do Seon started the company?

560
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,820
This just isn't right...

561
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,360
It was your idea, Hoo Young.

562
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,629
It was.

563
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,428
I should've known when you came back when you never even visited.

564
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,299
- Why you darn... - It's for the best.

565
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,139
For the Korean office and for you.

566
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,940
Why are you becoming like Do Seon?

567
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,340
I have a long way to go to become like Mom.

568
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,179
Extend your business trip.

569
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,409
We can sort it out together during your stay.

570
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,319
If the head office takes our main client,

571
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,489
it'll ruin my staff's morale. They barely said the chant.

572
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,489
That's your problem.

573
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,159
Darn it.

574
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,369
Who are you waiting to hear from in this situation?

575
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,769
The woman you met yesterday?

576
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,969
- No. - It is.

577
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,739
I'm really hurt and upset, okay?

578
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:31,968
I'm really upset.

579
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,340
So be honest.

580
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,510
- Uncle. - Wait.

581
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,179
Goodness.

582
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,719
- What? - Sir.

583
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,118
You must leave now for your 2pm with Shin Hye Mi.

584
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,320
Okay.

585
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,460
Let's talk later.

586
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,559
You borrowed my car. Give me the key.

587
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,059
It got towed.

588
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,829
I'll get it back after work.

589
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,139
Why did it get towed?

590
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,380
Why would a month-old car get towed?

591
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,578
I parked it by the side of the road...

592
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,679
By a roadside?

593
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,619
Why did you park there?

594
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,090
I happened to meet a friend...

595
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,960
from high school.

596
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,829
Then...

597
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,699
Okay.

598
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,300
So you're saying...

599
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,670
you were driving along...

600
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,710
and you saw a high-school friend and you pulled over.

601
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:37,840
You were happy to meet.

602
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,579
She was still pretty.

603
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,039
Not pretty. Just the same.

604
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,780
She wasn't just a friend from school.

605
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,820
An ex-girlfriend? Your first love?

606
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,888
For real?

607
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,630
You happened to meet your first love?

608
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,329
You were driving along...

609
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,559
and noticed someone walking by...

610
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,928
and she was from your school...

611
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,570
- I'll get your car. - Hey!

612
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,639
My gosh.

613
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:11,039
He's capable of making that face?

614
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,750
- Hello? - Hi, Kang Hoo Young.

615
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,650
It's Hye Ji.

616
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,788
I wrote you a letter in our senior year.

617
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,590
We went to the same academy too.

618
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:26,590
Try to remember.

619
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,630
- Kim Hye Ji? - Yes.

620
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,159
I knew you'd remember me.

621
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,829
It's been a long time.

622
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,860
It has.

623
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,730
Are you married?

624
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,529
No, right?

625
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,539
Hey. You asked that first?

626
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,869
It's important.

627
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,769
No, I'm not.

628
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,380
I see.

629
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,409
When did you come back?

630
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,750
- Yesterday. - Yesterday?

631
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,750
Then you met Hong Ju by chance as soon as you arrived?

632
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,659
She gave me your number.

633
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,730
- Did she? - Yes.

634
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,329
Welcome back.

635
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:07,929
You're so welcome.

636
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,070
Welcome...

637
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,570
Yes, a welcome party.

638
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,400
We should throw a welcome party for you. We should meet.

639
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,940
Welcoming him turned into a welcome party?

640
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,409
Sure. Let's meet.

641
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,549
Hey, he wants to meet! I can't believe this!

642
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,679
Hey, he can hear everything!

643
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:27,219
Is Lee Hong Ju with you too?

644
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,349
How about this week?

645
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,789
Sang Pil, Hong Ju, and I were going to hang out together.

646
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,489
You remember Kwon Sang Pil, right?

647
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,789
Sang Pil? Yes, I do.

648
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,429
Yes. He's curious about how you've been as well.

649
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,159
I'll text you the time and the address.

650

Are there any days when you're unavailable?

651
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,170
- None. - I see.

652
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,099
I'll text you then, Hoo Young.

Yes!

656

I didn't even get to hear her voice.

657

663

Was it like the reunion scene in "Architect 101?"

664
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,150
Hey, be honest with me.

665
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,249
You never contacted her all these years? Not even once?

666

667

I'm just meeting some old high school friends.

Exactly.

669
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,429
Your first love is one of those high school friends. Right?

670
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,300
I need to get something from her.

671
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,869
You need to get something from her? What is it?

672
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,110
Is it love?

I have a blister because I'm wearing new heels today.

682
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,949
Hey, you're a schoolteacher. How could you wear high heels?

683
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,050
What? Is it against the law for schoolteachers to wear heels?

684
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,820
- Here. Put this in. - Okay.

685

00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,729
You know that we're having this "party,"

687
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,329
so Hoo Young and I can hit it off, right?

688

- What? - So watch what you say.

By the way, for him to recognize you,

691
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,840
shouldn't you look more like your old self from high school?

692
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,408

00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:50,920
Right.

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,949
By the way, you've gotten more handsome now.

711
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,820

736
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,670
I teach English at Obok High School.

737
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:50,968
Yes, you did.

738
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,110
You already said it over ten times. Don't you get sick of saying it?

739
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,409
- Sir. - Coming.

740
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:58,510
You're a financial planner.

741
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,119
In English, you're a financial planner.

742
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,158
Look at us. We all have great careers now.

743
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,888
Reuniting as successful adults...

744
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,159
makes me so happy.

745
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,460
We ought to drink on a day like today.

746
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,199
Cheers.

747
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,769
Cheers.

748
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,840
Hoo Young, don't leave me hanging.

749
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:26,170
You should drink this instead.

750
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,510
What did you just do?

751
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,909
I did have a good feeling about this.

752
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,690
By the way, I can't believe this.

753
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,590
I wonder how Oddball recognized you.

754
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,988
If I were to run into you on thes treet,

755
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,590
I probably wouldn't have been able to recognize you...

756
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:46,960
because you've gotten more handsome.

757
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,698
Right. Hong Ju...

758
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,170
must have a distinct memory of you because of me.

759
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,409
But what's taking her so long?

760
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,980
Let me call her.

761
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,309
Okay?

762
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,989
What's wrong with her?

763
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,689
Instead of asking me to watch what I say,

764
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,630
she should have watched the liquor going into her mouth.

765
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,709
Cheers!

766
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,409
- Cheers! - Yes!

767
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,280
Drink up.

768
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,649
Sir, congratulations on your movie.

769
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,380
- Hey, you're here. - Hello.

770
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,149
Ms. Bae couldn't make it today

771
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,590
She specifically told me to give this to you in person.

772
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:49,389
She didn't have to get me anything. Goodness.

773
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,730
Thank you.

774
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,259
You didn't have dinner yet, right? Join us.

775
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,959
- Have some food. - No, I'm all right.

776
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,698
Don't say that. Come here. Have some food before you go.

777
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,799
- Stay here for a bit. - Come here.

778
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,900
- Let's go. - Come and have some food.

779
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,268
("Special School")

780
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:01,840
- Gosh, I'm okay. - Come with me.

781
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,268
Let's drink to our dear writer, Mr. Bang Jun Ho! Cheers!

782
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,679
- Cheers! - Cheers!

783
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,179
Thank you.

784
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,119
- Excuse me. - Sure.

785
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,820
Mr. Bang.

786
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:18,619
How many copies of this book do you think will be sold?

787
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,989
Excuse me.

788
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,260
What is it?

789
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,000
What's wrong? Where are you going?

790
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,300
Is that a secret too?

791
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:32,230
Since I got to say hello to you, I should get going.

792
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,969
Why do you keep saying you want to leave?

793
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,570
Why don't you go and talk to Mr. Bang?

794
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,268
Aren't you guys close? Say hello to him.

795
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,070
Gosh, no. Not at all.

796
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,279
- I should get going. - Gosh, stop saying that.

797
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
Come here.

798
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,710
Come here. Yes.

799
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,789
(Thank you for your hard work.)

800
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,289
Have you been well?

801
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,900
She said she was coming, but she didn't come.

802
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:07,670
That's a bummer.

803
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,309
She said she was working. There's nothing we can do.

804
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,150
Kwon Sang Pil.

805
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:23,489
(Grilling Meat Again Today)

806
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,730
It's you, Kang Hoo Young. Funny running into you here.

807
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:38,969
How fascinating. We keep running into each other.

808
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,639
You seem to be everywhere I go.

809
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,840
How fascinating. Very fascinating indeed.

810
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:44,570
Why did you get so drunk?

811
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:47,679
Hye Ji.

812
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,409
My bestie, Kim Hye Ji. Your oddball is here.

813
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,848
You're here.

814
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:54,880
You grew into a fine woman.

815
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,518
My oddball!

816
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,190
My friend, oddball.

817
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,460
You grew into a fine woman too.

818
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,729
I don't call you a ball because you are...

819
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,030
- round. - Round.

820
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,198
You're such an oddball! That's why I call you that.

821
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,500
- You, an oddball. - You, an oddball.

822
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:13,500
My friend, oddball. You grew up so well.

823
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,400
What's wrong with you guys?

824
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,510
You're embarrassing me. Hoo Young is here.

825
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,039
- We're embarrassing you? - You're embarrassed of me?

826
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,309
Why? What about me is so embarrassing?

827
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,110
I'm Lee Hong Ju!

828
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,750
I hope you can be understanding.

829
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:28,750
Hong Ju went through a lot. So she's hopeless.

830
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,349
See? They keep laughing like that.

831
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,889
- Kwon Sang Pil. - Yes?

832
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,289
Beer.

833
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,589
Today, I need to drink beer.

834
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,828
What's gotten into you?

835
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:40,959
You got drunk at a different place.

836
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,730
Why must I deal with your drunk behavior? Why?

837
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:45,030
What?

838
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:51,170
It's okay to get drunk today.

839
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,940
Do you know whom I ran into today?

840
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,480
My first love...

841
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,809
Just eat this.

842
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,650
Hey, this is spicy.

843
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:07,559
It's my take on spicy chicken feet. What do you think?

844
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,519
The level of spiciness is pleasant, right? How is it?

845
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,359
- Gosh, that's spicy. - It's tasty.

846
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,629
It's tasty, right?

847
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,098
- Gosh. I knew it. - It's spicy.

848
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,360
- You can appreciate good food. - It's spicy.

849
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,599
It's so spicy!

850
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,809
Put this under your head.

851
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,909
Gosh, look at you. You're sleeping like a baby.

852
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,678
Have you guys stayed in touch even after the graduation?

853
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:34,780
Yes, pretty much.

854
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,280
It's my karma, I guess.

855
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,349
I don't know how I ended up with these lightweights.

856
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,960
Where are you staying?

857
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,659
It's so spicy.

858
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,300
Obok-dong.

859
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,599
That's great!

860
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,169
- Take that troublemaker with you. - It's spicy. So spicy.

861
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,469
She still lives in Obok-dong.

862
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,368
She'll find her house without a problem.

863
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:55,369
You just have to watch her go in.

864
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,538
- What about you? - I need to drop off...

865
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:58,969
this adorable troublemaker,

866
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:00,980
close the restaurant, and go home.

867
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,150
Hoo Young.

868
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,590
Don't leave without saying goodbye like you did all those years ago.

869
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,250
Goodness.

870
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,750
Let's stick together, comrade.

871
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,989
What is it with you?

872
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:20,860
I'm Lee Hong Ju.

873
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,090
Don't you remember? I went to Obok High School.

874
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,400
Right. Lee Hong Ju.

875
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,960
I wanted to see you today because...

876
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,500
That's because I needed to settle something with you.

877
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,469
- Last week, you... - What?

878
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,139
You're running away again?

879
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,849
(Obok High School)

880
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,920
Gosh. Come on.

881
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,750
Hey, we're late again because of you.

882
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,090
"Again?" I don't remember making us late to school.

883
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:58,789
Gosh. You're so brazen.

884
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,659
The day we met for the first time on the bus.

885
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,400
I woke you up and helped us get off the bus.

886
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,469
Then I helped you walk to the school gate.

887
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:15,179
Because you were injured, I took the blame for being late.

888
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
Are you sure about that?

889
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,420
I think so.

890
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,329
Wait.

891
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,460
You're not Kang Hoo Young, right?

892
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,199
What?

893
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:37,869
He doesn't smile like that.

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,699
He has no facial expressions. He has no loyalty as well.

895
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,739
He's got no heart too.

896
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:48,309
Kang Hoo Young is like a little kid with a smart brain. That's it.

897
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,179
He's not like you.

898
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:54,750
So you think I'm like a little kid?

899
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:56,820
You didn't know you were one?

900
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,050
How could you not know? Even I knew it.

901
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:02,760
You actually knew it too, right?

902
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,090
I bet you knew all about that.

903
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:12,730
Gosh.

904
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:17,940
I'm glad you're back.

905
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,510
Nice to see you again, Kang Hoo Young.

906
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,829
Yes, I won!

907
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,840
I'm the champion of staring contests at Obok High School!

908
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,670
Where were you? Why did you drink so much?

909
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,340
Right.

910
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,480
Where did I drink?

911
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,750
Did alcohol make you lose your memory?

912
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,550
Do you remember that?

913
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,718
I didn't want Mr. Kim to confiscate my book,

914
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,289
so I put my book in your backpack.

915
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:12,260
"My Avant-garde Lover?"

916
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,960
Gosh. Correct.

917
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,530
I guess you are Kang Hoo Young indeed.

918
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,199
There was this sentence in the book.

919
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,908
"A first love is special..."

920
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:28,239
"because there's only one in a lifetime."

921
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,550
So what is first love?

922
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,679
It's frozen food.

923
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,419
You must freeze it rock hard.

924
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,749
Then it will last a long time...

925
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,519
with that initial innocent feeling of love.

926
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,960
But what if we take it out and defrost it?

927
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,829
No. Never.

928
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,789
We should never defrost it.

929
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,130
What happens then?

930
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,769
Then...

931
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,909
our first love will reach the expiration date.

932
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,178
We will never be able to remember our first love...

933
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,710
with the initial feeling we had.

934
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,880
So what I'm saying is that...

935
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,750
you should never see your first love again.

936
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,940
Ramyeon is the best hangover cure.

937
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,050
Dumplings are the best pairing with ramyeon.

938
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,348
Make sure to put the dumplings in the freezer.

939
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:41,349
Freeze them rock hard.

940
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,420
Got it?

941
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,788
So they don't get defrosted?

942
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,419
There you go. Freeze them rock hard, so they don't get defrosted.

943
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,960
(K Food Dumplings)

944
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,658
Then goodbye, Hoo Young.

945
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,829
It was nice seeing you.

946
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,030
Okay. Lee Hong Ju. Get home safely...

947
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,440
Why did you follow me up here?

948
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:41,710
Do you live here?

949
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,579
What do you think?

950
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,050
Do you think I'm trying to break into someone else's home?

951
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,250
What?

952
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,590
Why do you keep laughing like that?

953
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:57,030
Because you're funny.

954
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,268
(K Food Dumplings)

955
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:07,669
(Don't freeze them again once defrosted.)

956
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,739
This is too bad.

957
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:12,809
Mine...

958
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:15,210
must have started to get defrosted already.

959
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:27,389
(Serendipity's Embrace)

960
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,110
I had never encountered this kind of question before.

961
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,709
I neither had time to study it in advance...

962
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,780
nor had the chance to skim through sample questions.

963
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,119
The bell had rung to signal the beginning.

964
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:34,159
Oddball, do you think you can spend some time with my nephew tomorrow?

965
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,559
I'm from upstairs.

966
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,690
- Gosh. What? - Gosh.

967
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:38,428
A grown man like you can't be coming out of there.

968
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:39,690
This is really you?

969
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,960
He's using me, so he can spend time with his first love.

970
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,630
No. Follow me.

971
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,669
Now, who's showing whom a good time?

972
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,739
(If you answer this call, you're basically a carp-head.)

973
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,300
Hong Ju won't answer my call.

974
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,969
He didn't answer your call because she's on a date with a guy.

975
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,880
I thought he was going to kiss me.

976
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:00,719
You're acting like this because you still have feelings for me.

977
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:02,679
I won't be able to make it tomorrow.

978
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:04,619
I liked you.

979
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:06,420
And I still do.
