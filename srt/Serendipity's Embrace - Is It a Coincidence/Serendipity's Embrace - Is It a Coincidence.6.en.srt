00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,880
(Kim So Hyun)

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,349
(Lee Hong Ju and Kang Hoo Young)

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,120
(Chae Jong Hyeop)

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,489
(Yun Ji On)

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,929
(Kim Da Som)

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,840
(Serendipity's Embrace)

7
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,420
Don't take it back.

8
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,969
Don't take it back.

9
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,640
Who said I would take it back?

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,579
It's just...

11
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,620
Thinking you and I would suddenly become a thing...

12
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,920
makes me a little uncomfortable, to be honest.

13
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,689
We reunited not long ago.

14
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,730
And we weren't very close either.

15
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:01,959
So...

16
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,530
I think I need some time to get used to it.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,039
I understand.

18
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,080
(Episode 6)

19
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,060
- Go ahead. - Okay.

20
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,500
Eat a lot.

21
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,639
So...

22
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,599
please look at something else so that I can eat a lot.

23
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,409
I got it.

24
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,810
Are you sure you got it?

25
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,050
Don't look at me. I'll have indigestion.

26
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,379
You can't have indigestion. I'll stop looking at you.

27
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
But...

28
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,979
you can just look at me.

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,050
I need to get used to it.

30
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,599
(Uncle Baek Wook)

31
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,740
(Decline)

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,879
Is he coming to Seoul or not?

33
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,949
Should I call Oddball?

34
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,889
No.

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,490
Why does he make such a big deal out of it?

36
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,990
Thank you for driving.

37
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,889
What would you like to have for dinner?

38
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
What?

39
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,189
I'm not hungry.

40
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,660
I'm hungry though.

41
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,970
You are?

42
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,540
Then I'll send you a list of nice restaurants.

43
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,350
Why?

44
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,720
What?

45
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,720
Do you think...

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,389
I want to have dinner with you...

47
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,399
because I'm actually hungry?

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,310
What are you guys doing?

49
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,040
What were you doing?

50
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,980
Keep going.

51
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,850
Keep going.

52
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,220
I guess your wish is granted.

53
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,490
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

54
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,620
I could've told you once I returned to Seoul.

55
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,189
Are you really going to quit your job?

56
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,129
Yes.

57
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,300
Gosh.

58
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,139
Your mother called me.

59
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,550
Hoo Young sent in his resignation.

60
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,649
What? What did you say?

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,860
You can't get up so suddenly.

62
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,319
I've never heard of it.

63
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,819
So you didn't know?

64
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,429
Okay then. I'll take care of it myself.

65
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,759
(Baek Wook)

66
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,529
She said she would take care of it herself. I'm scared.

67
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,069
I'm going to take a shower.

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,568
Resigning is too extreme.

69
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,209
There must be a better way. I'll find it.

70
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,609
If you go back to the US for a moment,

71
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,709
I'll take you out of there no matter what it takes.

72
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,709
Uncle. You were right.

73
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,350
Hong Ju was my problem.

74
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,550
Because of her, because I like her so much,

75
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't want to go back to the US.

76
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,759
Who are you? Where did you hide, Kang Hoo Young, my nephew?

77
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,729
Rock Asset's ace, the math genius,

78
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,730
the idiot who only knows numbers, the rude...

79
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,930
What?

80
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,939
You must be Hoo Young with those rude eyes.

81
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,869
I understand why Hong Ju and you are good friends.

82
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,938
All right. You didn't show it because of your personality,

83
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,138
but it must've been suffocating.

84
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,810
Your father couldn't stand it either.

85
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,949
Uncle.

86
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:25,050
What I'm trying to say is...

87
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,849
After what happened with your mother and your father,

88
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,119
she tried her best to make up for it.

89
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,990
You and Rock Asset are the result of it.

90
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,359
If you're doing this,

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
you're going to ruin both at the same time.

92
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,029
Your mother will never let you do that.

93
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,529
Don't tell Hong Ju that I quit my job.

94
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,170
I'm going to tell her when it's settled.

95
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm going to tell her.

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,410
This is leather.

97
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,480
Hoo Young, this is expensive leather.

98
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,818
This is leather.

99
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,649
I'll go out.

100
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,089
Hey.

101
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,490
I'm going to stay in the hideout for a while.

102
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,930
- No. - No?

103
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,028
Why not? This is my house.

104
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,198
My place.

105
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,699
I'm going to watch you here.

106
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,870
And this is leather.

107
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,200
You suck.

108
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,600
Have you seen the file?

109
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,870
You look happy, which makes me feel even worse.

110
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,169
Is that so?

111
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,440
You're laughing?

112
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,679
How could you abandon your client and just laugh?

113
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,049
Just letting you know the contract has expired.

114
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,389
Then what about opening our family office?

115
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,720
Don't worry about it.

116
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,758
I already sent you the plans.

117
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,559
So talk with Scarlet from now on.

118
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,059
We all met before, right?

119
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,090
You're going to be on your own in Korea.

120
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,299
Let me invest then.

121
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,730
Talk with Scarlet about that as well.

122
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,600
What on earth happened to you?

123
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,980
Coincidence.

124
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,179
Coincidence?

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,149
Yes.

126
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,250
Hoo Young, but why am I so curious...

127
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,919
about what your mother will say?

128
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,690
And I'm going to bet on you losing 100 percent.

129
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,059
But I'll throw the legit welcome back party for you.

130
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,259
Catch you later, man.

131
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,929
I guess everyone is more curious about what my mother will say.

132
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Is she sleeping?

133
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,668
(Lee Hong Ju)

134
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,740
Are you sleeping?

135
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,190
Not yet.

136
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,960
(Lee Hong Ju)

137
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,370
- Hoo Young? - I'm going up.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
Why? Did something happen?

139
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,039
I want to see you.

140
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,070
Hey, don't bother.

141
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,110
I already lay down to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

142
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,950
Are you really going to sleep?

143
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Yes.

144
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,950
I hadn't had a trip for a long time, so I'm so tired.

145
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,519
You should go to bed too.

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,590
All right. Sweet dreams.

147
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,860
You too.

148
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,500
- Hong Ju. - Yes?

149
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,769
Did I tell you...

150
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,139
that I like you?

151
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,049
Yes.

152
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,490
I think I heard it.

153
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,960
So I said it.

154
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes, you said it.

155
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,600
I like you.

156
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,379
Good night.

157
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,409
(Lee Hong Ju)

158
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,690
Gosh, I don't think I'll get used to this.

159
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,129
What do I do?

160
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,659
Did you stay up all night?

161
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,190
Yes. I couldn't sleep.

162
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Because you were worried?

163
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,429
Or because you were excited?

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,730
Tell Oddball to come down for breakfast.

165
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,470
Are you going to stay here too?

166
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,669
I should eat before going out, at least.

167
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,980
I've never felt so single in my life.

168
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,450
You punk.

169
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,679
Don't do bad things in my house.

170
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,559
- What are "bad things?" - You actually don't know?

171
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,289
Call her.

172
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,459
She must be up, right?

173
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,769
(Lee Hong Ju)

174
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,909
Did you sleep well?

175
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,409
Yes. How about you?

176
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Me too.

177
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,980
Would you like to come downstairs? Let's have breakfast together.

178
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm outside.

179
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Where?

180
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,690
A department store. I came shopping with Hye Ji.

181
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,889
Your legs aren't fully recovered. Why are you out shopping?

182
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,590
I'll call you later.

183
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,099
- Why? - She went to a department store...

184
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Let's have breakfast together.

185
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,399
She did?

186
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,139
Yesterday's ally is today's enemy, right?

187
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,309
Aren't you going to eat?

188
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,850
I'm not.

189
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,750
- Was it Hoo Young? - Yes. He wanted to eat together.

190
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,750
He waited for ten years. He could wait another day.

191
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,690
- Let's go. - Are we not going inside?

192
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,759
This is not our destination today. Let's go.

193
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:19,429
May I please have your attention?

194
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,200
Here it is.

195
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,168
- Is this the place? - Yes.

196
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,870
I didn't take Mr. Son's taste into consideration.

197
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm going to show him the best outfit tomorrow.

198
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:31,840
Let's go inside.

(Kang Hoo Young)

202
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,740
I was writing a message to you.

203
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,039
Did you finish looking around?

204
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,610
I'm in a beauty salon. Hye Ji is getting her hair done.

205
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,379
Oddball will hang out with me today.

206
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:15,720
How about in the evening?

207
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,889
Oddball, come here and take a look.

208

Don't worry about me and do your thing for today.

209
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,490
I'll see you tomorrow.

210
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,700
Come here.

211
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,960
- What do you think about this? - What?

212
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,480
They've hung out for ten years.

213
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,720
Do they have to meet today as well?

214
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,769

How come your face is always cute and adorable?

218
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,110
You look like her today.

219

220
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,820
Hermione.

221
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,089
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

222
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,289
You're a bit too much.

223
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,049
- Why? - You look like...

224
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,460

Please don't cause trouble when you drink.

232
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,649
I have other customers.

233
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,250
It's because I like my new hair.

234
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,518
Are you not going to call Hoo Young?

235
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,460
Don't you dare call him today.

236
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,289
- It's a girls' night. - Right.

237

Oh, yes.

Bang Jun Ho.

242
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,008
Why would he mention that jerk on a good day like this?

243
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,048
No. You heard it wrong.

Hey. Don't tell Hoo Young my new hairstyle looks good today.

250

(Chats, Kwon Sang Pil)

252
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,259
Hong Ju isn't the type that contacts her boyfriend often.

Oh, right. I should make a call.

No. Do it tomorrow. Or you'll regret it when you're sober.

Be careful.

If you're going to drink to the point of being unable...

323
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,489
to control your body,

324
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,690
you should quit drinking.

325
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,929
Yes. The person on the phone was worried too.

326
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,130
All right. Fine.

327
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,899
I'm enjoying my life too. Hey.

328
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,410
Wait. Oddball,

329
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,480
I told you many times.

330
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,649
First love is like frozen food.

331
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,049
As soon as you take it out of the freezer, it melts.

332
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,049
It's the same for you.

333
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,460
You're done with Bang Jun Ho.

334

It's the end. Okay?

335
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,029
Your first love is over. All right?

336
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,799
There are so many men in the world.

337
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,970
Hey, what do you think about Hoo Young?

338
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,339
He's smart,

339
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,298
competent,

340
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,740
and his appearance is...

341
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,279
Look. He's a good-looking guy because he takes after me.

342
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,019
- Let go of me. - But he's nothing too.

343
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:29,089
Actually, he's not going back to the US as he's afraid of his mother.

344
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,959
Hey. You can't throw him like this.

345
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,629
Hey, you can't leave him like that.

348
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,359
What about me? We haven't seen each other all day.

349
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,799
- My hair. - Hair?

350
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,069
My hair.

351
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,640
What's this?

352
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,480
What are you doing?

353
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,180
You got your hair done to show me anyway, didn't you?

354
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,349
I did it because I had time.

355
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,720
My hair will become straight again when I wash it.

356
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,589
Then I should take a good look today.

357
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,630
It suits you.

358
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,640
Are you going to leave me too?

359
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,910
Don't forget about me.

360
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,480
I miss you.

361
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,589
Pass.

362
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
This.

363
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,329
What should I wear?

364
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,079
Let's see.

365
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,059
Nice.

366
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,319
What's up with you?

367
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:47,119
Are you going hiking today?

368
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,329
You're not?

369
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Me?

370
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm not.

371
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,829
Why not?

372
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,630
You went hiking with Mr. Son every Sunday.

373
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,910
What else could I do? He called in sick.

374
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,439
He's sick because...

375
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,509
you stressed him out about the blind date.

376
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,250
Will you leave him alone?

377
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,920
Goodness.

378
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,419
He should put up with that much...

379
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,319
to become the future principal's son-in-law.

380
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,789
Who's a principal and who's a son-in-law?

381
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,259
You're getting ahead of yourself.

382
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,059
Hey.

383
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,130
Mr. Son will become my son-in-law.

384
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,739
Hye Ji.

385
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,769
You girls didn't listen to me because you were all grown up,

386
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,579
and your mom was busy traveling with her friends.

387
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,210
When I was all alone, Mr. Son was my only friend.

388
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,579
He was practically a son to me.

389
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,190
He's a good, upright man, and he's pretty manly too,

390
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,660
but he just can't stand his ground around women.

391
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,160
We should invite him for dinner...

392
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,130
when Hye Seon's off work.

393
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,700
He likes beef.

394
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,269
There's me too.

395
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,009
You?

396
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:12,880
What about you?

397
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,079
Well...

398
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,420
Mr. Son and I...

399
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,190
are closer.

400
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,430
My gosh... Save me.

401
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,569
I can't breathe.

402
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,269
Listen, Ms. Kim.

403
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,410
Forget it.

404
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,380
Come on.

405
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,379
You're jealous because...

406
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,250
I'm setting him up with your sister.

407
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,049
How funny.

408
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,650
Do you think I'm a kid? That I'm being jealous?

409
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,589
You don't know a thing.

410
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,058
Get out of the way. I can't see the TV.

411
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,460
Your head's huge.

412
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,630
I hate you.

413
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,730
Let's see.

414
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,549
Good.

415
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,720
Let's go.

416
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Hi.

417
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,349
Where are we going today?

418
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,819
Welcome.

419
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:08,660
An iced Americano and two hot chocolates.

420
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,630
This neighborhood is the problem.

421
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,029
- And three tiramisus. - Okay.

422
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,069
Forget the tiramisus.

423
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,269
Why? I'm craving sugar.

424
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,210
Hye Ji can't stay today.

425
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,650
Mr. Son's ill. We have no choice.

426
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,779
She's all dressed up.

427
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,118
(How do you feel?)

428
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,349
(Did you see a doctor and take medicine?)

429
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,259
(Medicine)

430
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,730
Thank you.

431
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,880
Are you handcuffed?

432
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,579
Your hands are stuck together.

433
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,990
Thanks to someone.

434
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,990
I don't feel well.

435
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,529
I feel worse because I'm jealous.

436
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,589
Is Mr. Son feeling okay?

437
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't know.

438
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,500
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

439
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,210
(Ms. Kim Hye Ji)

440
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,848
(Ms. Kim Hye Ji)

441
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,380
Mr. Son. How do you feel?

442
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,480
Did you see a doctor...

443
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,089
and take medicine? I'm worried.

444
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm sorry...

445
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,529
for causing concern.

446
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
(Ms. Kim Hye Ji)

447
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:38,910
I'm not so ill that you need to worry.

448
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:40,839
Send.

449
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,619
Are Mr. Son and I that unsuitable?

450
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,049
No.

451
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,049
Are we suitable?

452
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,618
Did someone say you're not?

453
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,390
My dad thinks so.

454
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,029
And Mr. Son seems to think so too.

455
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,430
I was sure he was attracted to me.

456
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,440
Is it because I'm the vice-principal's daughter?

457
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,640
Or is he afraid of dating a colleague?

458
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,339
Ask him yourself.

459
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,279
Right now?

460
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,980
The way to get rid of her is a date.

461
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,889
- Shall we visit him? - Visit him?

462
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,890
Yes.

463
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:26,358
He wasn't admitted.

464
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,558
Why would we visit?

465
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,329
You said he lived alone.

466
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,960
He might not have eaten well.

467
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,858
I felt lots of butterflies...

468
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,000
when I'd hurt my leg and Hoo Young got me food.

469
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,170
You felt butterflies?

470
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,039
Lots of them?

471
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,210
Do you know where he lives?

472
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,680
Yes.

473
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,579
But...

474
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,950
I can't go looking like this.

475
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,380
I don't like what I'm wearing. I won't go.

476
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,250
Kim Hye Ji.

477
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,139
(Tasty Pork Trotters)

478
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,609
There aren't any porridge places nearby.

479
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,269
We should've bought some on the way.

480
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,980
Where's the closest place?

481
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,509
No.

482
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,180
I saw a salad shop. I'll buy that instead.

483
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,019
- Will a salad be enough? - Yes.

484
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,789
I want to go now. I have a feeling I should.

485
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,220
Go ahead.

486
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,589
- See you. - Okay.

487
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,839
Hye Ji's so pretty.

488
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,869
Wasn't she timid in school?

489
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,818
Our Hye Ji discovered her real self...

490
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,279
after she dropped her uniform.

491
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,190
She's so pretty.

492
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,390
- She's like a celebrity. - Look at her hair.

493
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,670
Will you keep talking about her?

494
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,868
Oh, right.

495
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,769
How's your uncle? Did he have some hangover soup?

496
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,240
We should get far away from here.

497
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,480
So no one can get in the way.

498
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,309
Get going.

499
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,619
I'd like to change first, though.

500
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,319
- Why? - To look pretty.

501
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,990
Goodness.

502
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,420
Let's go.

503
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,400
Why do you want to take me elsewhere...

504
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,298
when you don't have a girl to visit?

505
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,500
I don't want you to catch my cold.

506
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,969
Don't worry about me.

507
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,309
Worry about your poor single self.

508
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,940
You're like this because you don't have someone.

509
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:03,150
Why would a girlfriend make a difference?

510
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,109
I'm fine on my own.

511
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,719
You shouldn't get used to doing everything on your own.

512
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,289
Wait here. I'll get you a taxi.

513
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,159
You're going to the second brother's place next, right?

514
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,590
Yes.

515
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,369
Mr. Son.

516
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Ms. Kim.

517
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
Your mother?

518
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,280
- Yes. - Hello.

519
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,389
Hello.

520
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,159
You're a teacher at the same school my Kyung Taek teaches at?

521
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,699
Yes. I heard Mr. Son wasn't feeling well,

522
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,198
so I came by to check on him...

523
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,669
as a colleague.

524
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,969
Oh, the teachers there are so nice and considerate.

525
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,909
I loved the name of the school as soon as I heard it.

526
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,480
"Obok." It means "five blessings."

527
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,250
- It has a great meaning. - It does.

528
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:14,449
Goodness.

529
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,849
How old are you?

530
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,250
Mom.

531
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,489
I'm right here.

532
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,289
I'm not dead yet. Get me that taxi.

533
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,659
Goodness.

534
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:28,030
I turned 29 this year.

535
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,170
Oh, that's perfect.

536
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,968
Are you married?

537
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,809
No, not yet.

538
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,609
That's just lovely.

539
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,909
How nice.

540
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:47,419
Oh, I come by very rarely.

541
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,550
I'm almost never here.

542
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,989
I came by only because he was ill.

543
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,319
Oh, dear. My goodness.

544
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,530
Thank you.

545
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,359
That's fine.

546
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,500
You shouldn't dress like this. You could get cold.

547
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,429
You'll struggle after you give birth.

548
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,968
The men in my family are very virile,

549
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:11,038
- and they father many kids. - Don't.

550
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,539
I had seven, you know.

551
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,480
Taxi!

552
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,880
Did you take the parcel that came for me?

553
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,420
Where is...

554
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,860
What's all this?

555
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Darn it.

556
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,869
Is this a bedroom or a market stall?

557
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,170
I wouldn't be surprised if this place were haunted.

558
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:43,139
What the earth?

559
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,848
- I hope to see you again, Ms. Kim. - Sure.

560
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:54,480
It would be even nicer if you'd visit.

561
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,089
- Okay. - Call when you get there.

562
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,690
Okay, I will.

563
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,159
Don't just leave now.

564
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,960
Stay for a chat, okay?

565
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,399
I left some food and fruit.

566
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,169
- Go upstairs... - Will you stop it, Mom?

567
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,699
Okay, fine.

568
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,139
She has nothing to do with me.

569
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,010
Really?

570
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,809
I went too far, then.

571
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,849
Ms. Kim.

572
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,848
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,019
It's fine.

574
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,920
Goodbye.

575
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,889
- Get in. - Oh, dear.

576
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,059
You fool.

577
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,559
- Darn you. - All right, now.

578
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,269
Bye.

579
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,539
I apologize.

580
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,909
My mother's old-fashioned.

581
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,820
I'm really sorry if she offended you.

582
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,849
You shouldn't have to apologize.

583
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,019
I should. I'm...

584
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,429
very sorry.

585
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Goodbye.

586
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,500
Oh, gosh.

587
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,230
I'm okay.

588
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,369
I shouldn't have come by.

589
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,210
I'm sorry for doing so when I have nothing to do with you.

590
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,579
What I meant is...

591
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,349
Go home and get some rest.

592
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,650
- I'll hail you a taxi... - No, it's fine.

593
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,750
I can walk.

594
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,460
I should've gotten porridge.

595
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,159
I wanted to show him this.

596
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,420
I called because I got some nice liquor.

597
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,420
It's not fun to drink alone at my age.

598
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,429
Gosh.

599
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,860
Did I disturb your busy schedule?

600
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,829
No. I was looking for a drink companion.

601
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,469
Will you give a special talk to my school seniors?

602
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,139
Call me when you set a date.

603
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,849
We should find a date that fits the famous writer's schedule.

604
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,110
Not at all.

605
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,489
Jun Ho.

606
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,300
I didn't bring this up last time because your aunt was here.

607
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,630
Everyone was worried when you suddenly moved abroad,

608
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,139
but I knew and believed you'd do fine.

609
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,940
You're back looking better than ever, so that's all good.

610
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,780
But...

611
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:25,150
Leave Hong Ju alone.

612
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:31,829
There was...

613
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,929
a reason why I had to leave like that.

614
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,829
You should've said something.

615
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,000
You should've asked her to wait for you or to break up.

616
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,380
If you'd talked before you hurt her, I'd have accepted it as a reason.

617
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,210
But once the damage is done,

618
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,110
it's nothing but an excuse.

619
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,049
- Uncle. - Do you know...

620
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,190
what I tell the kids until their ears bleed?

621
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,960
To never date a man like you...

622
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,219
who makes them cry.

623
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,389
My Hong Ju.

624
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,659
She isn't for you.

625
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,329
You won't get enough of me by glancing like that.

626
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,730
Can I ask you something?

627
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,599
Yes. What is it?

628
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,840
What do you like about me?

629
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,980
What?

630
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,719
What part of that question is funny?

631
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,019
Sorry. I wasn't expecting a question like that.

632
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,489
Why wouldn't you expect it?

633
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,929
It's a corny question.

634
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,199
Well...

635
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,369
I'll think about it.

636
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,639
You keep laughing.

637
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,309
Were you always like this?

638
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,110
I don't know.

639
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,679
I didn't know back then,

640
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,849
and I still don't know now.

641
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:39,050
You don't know?

642
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,019
What answer...

643
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,670
Where are we going that's so far?

644
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:51,269
What neighborhood is this?

645
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,840
You'll see.

646
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,460
Why does someone so smart not know something that easy?

647
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,360
What good is having a smart brain?

648
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,849
Kang Hoo Young.

649
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,750
How much longer will you keep the distance?

650
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:49,460
When you call out "Kang Hoo Young,"

651
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,159
my heart beats so fast it aches.

652
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,030
It beat so fast I got worried...

653
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:00,300
it would beat out of my chest.

654
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Kang Hoo Young.

655
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,840
This is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

656
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,309
Kang Hoo Young.

657
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,280
Kang Hoo Young.

658
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,750
Kang Hoo Young.

659
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,079
Kang Hoo Young, run.

660
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:12,820
Kang Hoo Young.

661
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,218
Give me your dream.

662
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:15,380
Hey, Kang Hoo Young.

663
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,050
Stay right where you are. I'll come over.

664
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:19,320
Wait.

665
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,260
I don't know when it started.

666
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,130
I just...

667
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,429
found myself waiting for you to call my name.

668
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,000
That's when I knew.

669
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,030
"I see."

670
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,670
"I must like her."

671
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:38,070
Hello, Kang Hoo Young.

672
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,980
I knew...

673
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,280
I still liked you.

674
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,530
I really don't know what I like about you...

675
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,400
or why I like you.

676
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,639
You never gave me time to get used to you.

677
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,809
Neither did you.

678
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,259
(Uncle Baek Wook)

679
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,900
The person you reached is unavailable.

680
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,599
Come on. Answer your phone!

681
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,940
Wasn't that Uncle Wook?

682
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,670
It's not important.

683
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,280
(Uncle Wook)

684
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,349
Hey.

685
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,289
It's an emergency!

686
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:01,690
Emergency!

687
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,070
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up at work.

688
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,739
- Okay. You should go now. - Okay.

689
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,340
I'll watch you go in first.

690
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:34,190
- Kang Hoo Young. - Yes.

691
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,159
Can you ask me what I'm doing tomorrow night?

692
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,429
What are you doing tomorrow night?

693
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,829
I'm going to see you.

694
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,530
What about the day after tomorrow?

695
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:45,869
I'm going to see you. What about you?

696
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,269
Same here.

697
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
You should go.

698
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:03,989
("My Avant-garde Lover")

699
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,050
("My Avant-garde Lover")

700
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,420
("My Avant-garde Lover")

701
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,030
("My Avant-garde Lover")

702
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,519
Right. I kept it in here.

703
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,789
(My Career Plan)

704
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,989
(Name: Lee Hong Ju, Kang Hoo Young)

705
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,849
(Lee Hong Ju)

706
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,449
Yes, it did.

707
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,260
My heart fluttered like that too.

708
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,039
I didn't think you would come to Korea.

709
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,239
I thought I could get some fresh air like you.

710
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,610
I'm sorry to make a big decision without giving you a heads-up.

711
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
A decision?

712
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,849
Nothing has been finalized yet.

713
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,980
Mom.

714
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,750
It felt surreal to come back to Korea. It's been so long.

715
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,489
I thought I had forgotten everything.

716
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,190
But even the air felt familiar.

717
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:26,460
Gosh, memories can be so fascinating.

718
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,400
Perhaps, we should have visited from time to time.

719
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,170
Please process my resignation.

720
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,139
I'll make sure the hand-off goes without a hitch.

721
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,539
Hoo Young.

722
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,679
Growing up, you had never...

723
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,349
caused any trouble or gone astray.

724
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,519
That always worried me.

725
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,719
You made the best decision for me.

726
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
And I believed that it was for the best.

727
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,099
But?

728
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:04,130
But I'll start making decisions for myself,

729
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,300
whether or not they're the best.

730
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,409
I had a long flight. I'm beat.

731
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,010
Let's finish this up tomorrow.

732
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,420
Hello.

733
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,529
- Hello. - Hi.

734
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,530
Hello.

735
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,730
Ms. Kim.

736
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,739
You dolled up more than usual today.

737
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,038
I stopped by the hair salon this morning.

738
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:45,909
I got my hair done yesterday, but I didn't like it.

739
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,440
Aren't you so diligent?

740
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,349
But men don't remember women's hairstyles.

741
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,809
It's either long straight hair or short hair for them.

742
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,550
Don't waste your money on that.

743
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,349
I can remember them.

744
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,718
I got a hippie perm done yesterday.

745
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,650
Today, I straightened my hair with big curls.

746
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:02,260
Guess what I'm going to do with my hair tomorrow.

747
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,289
What on earth...

Good morning.

750
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,269
Hello.

751
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,110
All right.

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,789
Good morning.

754
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:50,969
Thank you for lending them to me. I got them cleaned.

755
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,739
Thank you for your help. From Kim Hye Ji.

There you go!

00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,190
Great!

763
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,400
Hurry up. Next!

764
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,630
Mr. Son. Why are we running so much this morning?

765
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,000
All right. Left foot.

767
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,659
What?

768
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,530
Wait. Did he not come home last night?

769
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,639
(Kang Hoo Young)

770
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,239
(Kang Hoo Young)

771
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,739
So you've been thinking about me.

772
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,280
What?

773
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,110
You're not watching me, are you?

774
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,710
Where are you?

775
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,480
You didn't forget about your plan for tonight. Right?

776
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,949
No. See you after work later.

777
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,690
I wanted to drive her to work.

778
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Let's go.

779
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,349
The neighborhood looks the same, doesn't it?

780
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Does it?

781
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,969
It hasn't changed.

782
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,139
I can recognize it right away.

783
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,630
This is why I hate Seoul.

784
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,630
It's a small world.

785
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,409
He definitely deflected my question.

786
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,050
Something must be up with him.

787
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,889
Does he not want to talk about it?

788
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,059
No. First things first.

789
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,019
I must handle this first.

790
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:41,239
I'm okay.

791
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,840
I shouldn't have come by.

792
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,010
I'm sorry for doing so...

793
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,050
when I have nothing to do with you.

794
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
"Ms. Kim."

795
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,949
"Thank you for yesterday, and I'm sorry."

796
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,719
"I'm sorry."

797
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:01,960
"Are you free tonight?"

798
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,289
Okay. I got this!

799
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:20,440
Ms. Kim!

800
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,309
Hey.

801
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,409
Could you help us?

802
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:29,018
We're struggling with a grammar question.

803
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,250
Let's see.

804
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,820
This sentence is about what happened last month.

805
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,719
The past perfect tense is correct.

806
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:39,029
Right here. There was another clause starting with "before."

807
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,129
This cleared up...

808
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,400
the chronological order to the action.

809
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,699
In cases like this, you don't have to use the past perfect tense.

810
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,840
You can just use the simple past tense...

811
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:48,368
to express the same thing...

812
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:49,440
as if you used the past perfect tense.

813
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,569
- Did you get it? - Yes.

814
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,078
Then why don't you come up with five examples for this?

815
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,138
- Yes. - Five?

816
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,209
- Yes. Five. - Come on.

817
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,678
- Okay. I said five. - Thank you.

818
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,480
- Thank you. - Thank you.

819
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:09,159
- Are you okay? - Oh, no.

820
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:11,630
I'm sorry.

821
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,730
Ms. Kim.

822
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,150
Ms. Kim.

823
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,619
Were you sorry about yesterday?

824
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,719
What?

825
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,019
I clearly apologized to you yesterday.

826
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,960
Was my apology not enough?

827
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,000
No. That's not what I meant.

828
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,030
I meant to say...

829
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,670
Are you...

830
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:02,280
I'll stop bugging you now.

831
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:37,949
Come in.

832
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
You can sit there.

833
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,889
How do you want your coffee?

834
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:55,429
I'm good.

835
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,400
I'll make Americano.

836
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,039
Is your leg okay now?

837
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Yes.

838
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,429
I'm glad you're here, Hong Ju.

839
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:33,170
Your letters where you promised your unchanging love.

840
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,610
My book you couldn't praise enough.

841
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:50,019
The time when you and I were madly in love.

01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,059
The sad reason why I had to...

844
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,659
leave you.

845
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:03,429
This...

846
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,808
I can do better from now on.

(Psychotropic Drugs)

848
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,570
All right. Everyone, attention.

849
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:47,980
At ease.

850
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,380
Relax, everyone.

851
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:52,949
You guys don't...

852
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,050
have to be nervous.

853
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,349
I understand the CEO of the HQ is coming here today.

854
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,889
But you have nothing to worry about.

855
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,489
Just follow my lead. Okay?

856

(Rock Asset)

857
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,030
She's coming.

858
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:15,500
Attention.

859
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,000
- Hello. - Hello.

860
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:25,380
Hey.

861
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,150
Is she here because of the Roem case?

862
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:31,488
No.

863
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:33,789
I wrapped up the Roem case this morning with their legal team.

864
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:35,820
Good job. Then what is she doing here?

865
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,760
You didn't tell her about the house, right?

866
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,428
Don't let her come near the house.

867
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:42,428
If she finds out I renovated the place, she'll throw a fit.

868
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:43,500
I said I got it.

869
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:44,829
Hey.

870
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,670
Give that to me. I'll bring it in.

871
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,139
You got this.

872
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:54,939
- Set, set, set, Rock Asset. - Rock Asset.

873
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:55,980
Come on, guys.

874
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,619
You're the anime expert. What do you think?

875
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,750
Do we need to revise the scenario a lot?

876
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,059
Please take a look at this.

877
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,229
What's this?

878
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,159
I put together a file after reading the scenario.

879
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,500
Already?

880
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:20,269
We have a lot of time. What's the hurry?

881
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,768
A long time ago, I wrote down some things I wanted to see...

882
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:25,340
in the anime version. So I incorporated them.

883
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,510
That makes sense. You know this story better than me.

884
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,809
If you see anything useful, please consider them...

885
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,780
while you work on the script.

886
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,079
Sure.

887
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,250
I'll excuse myself from this project now.

888
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,158
Gosh. Do something.

889
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:48,460
The view is nice.

890
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,098
It's not nice at all. What do you mean?

891
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:53,468
It's nothing compared to the view in San Francisco.

892
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:54,840
Don't you agree, Hoo Young?

893
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,408
So tell me. Is my house vacant?

894
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,809
No. Gosh. Why would that be vacant?

895
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,238
Someone else lives there.

896
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,409
We have a great tenant.

897
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,820
Then find a business hotel closest from the office.

898
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,619
I'll work here starting tomorrow.

899
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,849
- Why? - Why?

900
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,289
Yes, why?

901
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,089
Well, let's just say...

902
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,730
I'm running an inspection on the Korean branch.

903
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,400
If you're doing this because of me,

904
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,210
let me just say that it won't change my mind.

905
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,210
My decision won't change either.

906
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,480
I won't go back alone.

907
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:47,989
(Kid 1)

908
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,500
- I'll get going. - Wait.

909
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,469
You won't even give me time to review them?

910
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,070
Contact me if you have any questions.

911
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,750
Mr. Bang.

912
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,349
Are you okay?

913
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
I'm okay.

914
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,150
I'm fine.

915
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,829
Don't come near me.

916
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,500
I'll read...

917
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,309
I'll read your feedback later. You should go now.

918
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,579
What's wrong, Jun Ho? Are you sick?

919
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,949
What if I am?

920
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,920
What if I left because I was sick?

921
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:02,900
Would you take me back?

Kang Hoo Young!

925
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,150
Stay right where you are. I'll come over right now.

926
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,489
Wait.

928
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,530
What? I told him to wait.

929
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,150
Are they yours?

01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,630
These are my favorites.

932
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,000
But they aren't mine.

933
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,400
I wonder to whom they belong. Did someone leave them behind?

934
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,909
They're yours.

935
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,078
You're not what I expected.

936
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,250
I didn't know my son had a thing for cute girls.

937
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,289
Pardon?

938
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,800
If the question I got wrong were to be presented again,

939
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:30,680
would I be able...

940
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,079
Would I be able...

941

- Give your all to what? - Causing trouble or going astray.

945
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,090
- Hey! - We have to run.

946
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:21,329
- What? You quit your job? - Lee Hong Ju, my arm.

947
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,260
Undergoing dramatic changes means they're nearing their end.

948
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:25,600
It must be because of that girl, Lee Hong Ju.

949
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,869
They are from your heart. You should throw them out.

950
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,239
Hong Ju, I want you to end things with Hoo Young.

951
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,539
Shouldn't you trust me before you trust anyone else?

952
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,439
What if you leave me without a word?

953
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,609
Must I be kept in the dark again...

954
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:41,380
and find out only after you leave?
