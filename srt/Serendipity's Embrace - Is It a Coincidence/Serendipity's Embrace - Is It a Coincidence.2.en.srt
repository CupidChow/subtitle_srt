(Serendipity's Embrace)

00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,939
(Episode 2)

8
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,890
Gosh.

9
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,189
Good grief. Oh, my head.

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,499
Gosh, if I drink like this again,

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,969
I might as well call myself a lunatic.

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,439
Have you been well?

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,249
- Good job. - Good job.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,180
You know what? There's always hope.

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,180
I kept going at it, and look where I am now.

16
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,348
- The same goes for you. Okay? - Of course.

17
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,318
You know, that's what I excel in.

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,958
Good luck, "Special School."

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,930
- Cheers! - Cheers!

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,090
Everyone, bottoms up!

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,340
Yes! I've been well!

22
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,370
So what?

23
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,879
It's you, Kang Hoo Young.

24
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,719
Kang Hoo Young is like a little kid with a smart brain. That's it.

25
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,359
Ramyeon is the best hangover cure.

26
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,459
Dumplings are the best pairing with ramyeon.

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,789
Make sure to put the dumplings in the freezer.

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,230
Freeze them rock hard. Got it?

29
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,329
What on earth happened yesterday?

30
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,629
This is too bad.

31
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,969
Mine must have started to get defrosted already.

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,810
Oh, no.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,310
Really?

34
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,120
Oh, no. Mine too.

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,219
It's okay. You won't die from it.

36
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,330
See you tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,860
"Tomorrow morning?"

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,580
Gosh, you startled me.

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,650
- You're here. - Why didn't you answer your phone?

40
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,110
Did my phone die?

41
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,318
- Come inside. - No.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,679
Get ready quickly and meet me outside.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,819
Let's go and have gamjatang.

44
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,419
Hurry up.

45
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,300
Gosh. It definitely paid off to live this long. You know?

46
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,060
I can't believe I'm having hangover soup you cooked.

47
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,330
By the way, how did I know I drank last night?

48
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,199
- Just eat. - Okay.

49
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,569
Gosh.

50
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,770
Goodness.

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,340
Gosh, it tastes amazing. It hits the spot!

52
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,710
Dumplings? This is random.

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,779
You must have missed dumplings.

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,150
They don't sell dumplings in the US, right?

55
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,620
How did it go with your first love yesterday?

56
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,860
Uncle, the soup is getting cold.

57
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,060
Okay. I should have it when it's hot.

58
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:48,169
Hey, can I invite a friend over?

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,300
- A friend? - She'll be here in a jiffy.

60
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,439
- She lives upstairs. - No!

61
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,139
Why did you scream like that?

62
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,680
You...

63
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,979
You know that I have a delicate heart.

64
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,319
I only cooked enough for two people.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,289
You should just enjoy the soup.

66
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,460
I'm certain the oddball drank last night too.

67
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,689
- Look at you. You finished it. - Yes.

68
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,360
I didn't say anything because no one should be disturbed while eating.

69
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,959
What is it?

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,198
Where and with whom did you drink so much...

71
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,360
to the point that you got wasted last night?

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,768
I was hungry. I felt nauseous too.

73
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,969
You know, it wasn't just us three last night.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,769
It was a welcome party for Kang Hoo Young. You know?

75
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,309
It was only the four of us. You said you'd come soon.

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,779
But you showed up drunk.

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,379
We were the ones who invited him. He must've thought it was rude.

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,719
- I'm sorry. - Don't apologize to me.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,449
You should say that to Kang Hoo Young.

80
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,518
Because you didn't show up last night,

81
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,519
I ended up drinking so much.

82
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,189
Did you drink to lighten the mood? You can barely hold your liquor.

83
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,629
Gosh. Hye Ji, I'm so sorry.

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,870
My dear Hye Ji. How are you so beautiful?

85
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,029
Whatever.

86
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,100
So why were you late yesterday?

87
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,810
Because of Jun Ho.

88
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,909
I must be a crazy woman.

89
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,509
You know what? I must've gone mad. I can't believe myself.

90
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,389
Pay for our food.

91
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,360
Do you want some bread too?

92
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,560
So when you went on an errand, you saw Bang Jun Ho there?

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,999
Gosh. I could have avoided him.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,769
But the director got a hold of me.

95
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,040
So what happened?

96
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,338
He asked me if I had been well. With a smile, at that too!

97
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,439
What on earth?

98
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,779
Gosh. There's nothing useful or good about that jerk.

99
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,409
I told you this was going to happen from the get-go, didn't I?

100
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,049
He's always been nothing...

101
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,278
but a self-centered, good-for-nothing jerk.

102
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,550
- I'm going to give him a call. - That's why I said,

103
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,189
"Yes, I've been well!"

104
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,660
Of course, I've been so well!

105
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,959
You too. You look good too.

106
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,629
Gosh. I had no idea that you came back to Korea.

107
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,230
Who knew I would run into you here?

108
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,740
Gosh, Ms. Park.

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,410
What did you think about the movie? Wasn't it great?

110
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,980
I really loved the ending. How did you...

111
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm sure I fooled him perfectly.

112
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,589
Naturally, I started to accept drinks people offered.

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,860
As if. I doubt you fooled him at all by accepting drinks from people.

114
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,759
Let me see.

115
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,359
Your eyes don't look puffy, though.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,459
Of course. Did you think I would cry?

117
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,769
What about you? Did you call Kang Hoo Young?

118
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,170
Not yet.

119
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,838
You know, he still looks so handsome.

120
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,680
But he's got a different vibe now.

121
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,680
He's a man now.

122
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,949
Is that so?

123
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,019
I get it, though. It's about time he grew up.

124
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,149
He was so annoying all those years ago.

125
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,220
He was? No.

126
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,860
"No?"

127
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,329
Don't you remember what he said?

128
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,859
What do you mean he's handsome?

129
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,398
He has a small face,

130
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,898
but he has big eyes and a high nose bridge...

131
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,600
for no good reason.

132
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,939
Those facial features make him handsome.

133
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,600
Gosh, you fool.

134
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,508
Hey, I already gave him ten letters.

135
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,810
(Men's Restroom)

136
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,620
- Gosh, you startled me. - Goodness.

137
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
What's she doing?

138
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,290
Kang Hoo Young. This is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

139
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,899
Kang Hoo Young! Hey!

140
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,279
Take this. It's from my friend, Hye Ji.

141
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,409
- Hey! - Hey!

142
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,778
- Hey, look. - Keep running.

143
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,819
(Kang Hoo Young)

144
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,200
Kang Hoo Young. This is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

145
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,669
I'm certain he's never had a crush on anyone.

146
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,370
How else could he explain not answering any of your letters?

147
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,139
Hye Ji. Forget about him.

148
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,009
Why don't you like someone else? Someone decent. You know?

149
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,450
Oddball.

150
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,320
Then do you think you can give up Bang Jun Ho?

151
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,019
Why should you give up?

152
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,959
Let's make it public this time,

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,460
so he can't avoid giving you an answer.

154
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,960
- Make it public? - Yes.

155
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,798
- Gosh. Look at this. - I can't believe this.

156
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,969
- My gosh, Kang Hoo Young. - Oh, my.

157
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,638
- Kang Hoo Young! - Look at that!

158
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,970
- Kang Hoo Young is here. - Gosh.

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,168
(Kang Hoo Young! I'm waiting for your answer.)

160
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,908
- What's going on? - Kang Hoo Young!

161
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:33,109
- Check this out! - Look!

162
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,279
- Give her an answer! - Kang Hoo Young!

163
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,580
- Wait. I didn't take a photo yet. - Hey!

164
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,220
- Gosh. Come on. - Kang Hoo Young!

165
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,690
- Come on. - Come on.

166
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,089
How could you erase that without even flinching?

167
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,889
That's a girl's heart on the blackboard.

168
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,730
Gosh. I must have been so angry. I remembered that right away.

169
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,128
Hey, a while ago, we got our fortune read.

170
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,399
Do you remember how she told me I was fated to live abroad?

171
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,639
Are you talking about...

172
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,178
the one who said you and your ex were the perfect match?

173
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,750
She got that wrong because he gave me the wrong birth time.

174
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,409
Think carefully.

175
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,919
How did my English proficiency improve so much?

176
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,850
I know. You were a huge fan of Brad Pitt.

177
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,120
That's it.

178
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,159
Since then, I thought...

179
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,759
I would get married and settle down in the US.

180
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,529
- That must mean... - That must mean...

181
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,029
- I have a good feeling about this. - I have a good feeling about this.

182
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,970
Are you close to her?

183
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,769
To whom?

184
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,570
Your upstair neighbor.

185
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,369
Oddball? We're tight.

186
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,779
We're besties. We've been known each other for a decade.

187
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,309
Then can you ask her to show me around?

188
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,649
Ask her to show you around? Around where?

189
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,918
I've been away from Korea for a long time.

190
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,250
I should at least do some sightseeing.

191
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,690
You're leaving next Tuesday.

192
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,259
You only have three days left.

193
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,360
You should just spend more time with your first love.

194
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:58,759
What?

195
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,629
Did you not have a good time yesterday?

196
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,779
Just tell her she has to show around your nephew from the US.

197
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,110
Don't give her any more detail.

198
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,979
Why do I get a sense that you're taking the initiative,

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,779
which is unlike you?

200
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,149
Is it just me?

201
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,190
You know nothing about her, though.

202
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,389
I saw her go upstairs yesterday.

203
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,759
So what?

204
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,299
Whatever. Forget it.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
You told me you were close to her. That was why.

206
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,940
I wanted to ask her for a favor without any pressure.

207
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,909
Is that such a hard favor to ask?

208
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,649
That's why you should date someone.

209
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,250
Dating isn't food.

210
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,320
Yes, it is. Dating is an essential part of people's lives.

211
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,288
You're not getting any of this essential component.

212
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,159
That's why your entire body is giving you signals.

213
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,799
It's basically saying, "I'm all pent up. It's an emergency."

214
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,629
(Uncle Wook)

215
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,299
- Hey, Uncle Wook. - Oddball.

216
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,669
- What are you doing tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

217
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,210
Nothing. Why do you ask?

218
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,649
You don't have a date with the guy you met on a blind date last week?

219
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,950
Could you please talk some sense into Hye Ji?

220
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,090
I'm not in any place to be dating. Right?

221
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,659
Right. Dating isn't your priority right now.

222
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,158
I know you're dating.

223
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,629
Why are you telling her she shouldn't date?

224
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,429
Ms. Kim.

225
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,700
You're 29 years old, right?

226
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,929
You went to Obok High School, didn't you?

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,169
Yes. Why do you ask?

228
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,440
Ms. Kim. Did you have a school reunion yesterday?

229
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,070
What are you doing?

230
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,878
Just get to the point.

231
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,139
Okay. Give it to me.

232
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,279
I can't believe you.

233
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,720
Oddball, can you spend some time with my relative tomorrow?

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,490
Your relative?

235
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,759
- Yes. The one in the photo? - Yes.

236
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,590
My relative came back to Korea a few days ago.

237
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,258
My relative hasn't been to many places.

238
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,759
So you can go wherever you want with my relative.

239
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,899
Sounds good to me.

240
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
Tell her to leave everything up to me.

241
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,730
- "Her?" - Okay.

242
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,100
Come to my place around 10am.

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,169
Okay. Thank you.

244
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,639
Bye.

245
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,710
- Happy now? - Uncle.

246
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,009
Did she look at my picture?

247
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,179
Yes.

248
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,379
What kind of picture?

249
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,249
How could she have...

250
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,990
such well-defined facial features at this age?

251
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,589
She'll be so beautiful when she grows up.

252
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,620
- Right? - Yes.

253
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,889
So cute.

254
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,490
Why do you have this photo?

255
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,929
I want to have a daughter who looks just like this.

256
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,799
Hey, I guess Oddball and Ms. Kim were your friends from school.

257
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,899
You must have had a drink yesterday when you guys met up.

258
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,339
I told you I saw her.

259
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,069
You said you didn't know her.

260
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,408
You pretended not to know her earlier.

261
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,639
- I did? - Yes, you. That's what you did.

262
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,580
You're using me, so you can spend time with your first love.

263
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,119
Hey, even if you ask me for a favor, I won't do it for you.

264
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,489
I have to go on a date soon.

265
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,059
Hey, where are my clothes?

266
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,119
- What clothes? - The outfit you wore to the date.

267
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,730
Since you wore it, I'm going to wear it too.

268
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,399
It must be somewhere around here. Go look for it.

269
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,460
Where is it? I couldn't find it.

270
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,269
You should look for it more carefully.

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,139
Gosh. I guess first love is a powerful memory.

272
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,909
The ice man, Kang Hoo Young, is getting clever to get a date.

273
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,279
But why did he only invite Oddball?

274
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:39,779
Who's that?

275
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,918
Oddball, make sure to bring Ms. Kim tomorrow too.

276
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,919
It's Uncle Wook.

277
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
He texted you to bring me tomorrow as well.

278
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,889
Is that so?

279
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,200
What do you want to eat tomorrow? What should we do?

280
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,399
Count me out.

281
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,669
Why?

282
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,169
I thought we were two inseparable friends.

283
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,940
Come on, hang out with us.

284
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,870
Kids should play with kids.

285
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,610
I, a grown-up, will have an important meeting tomorrow.

286
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,009
Sorry.

287
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,779
How should I entertain this little girl?

288
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,750
Let's see...

289
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,350
All right.

290
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,330
Hey, young lady.

291
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,830
Hey, young lady.

292
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,409
I'm from upstairs.

293
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
I'm coming out.

294
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,950
What?

295
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,519
I thought he had a niece.

296
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,490
- Gosh. What? - Goodness.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,330
What are you doing?

298
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,230
Wait. You're not the person I was expecting to see.

299
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,500
- Hey. Gosh. - Goodness.

300
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,200
Hey, why are you coming out of Uncle Wook's house?

301
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,399
Because he's my uncle.

302
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
No.

303
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,509
A grown man like you can't be coming out of there.

304
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,769
Yes, I can.

305
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,879
No, it can't be you.

306
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,580
I'm waiting for her.

307
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,220
Why do you have this picture?

308
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,350
I wanted to have a daughter who looked just like her.

309
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,519
This is really you in the picture?

310
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,559
It's from my kindergarten recital.

311
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,900
Come on, Uncle Wook. You're not some little kid.

312
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,930
Did you know I was coming today?

313
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,369
I walked you upstairs on Friday.

314
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,369
See you tomorrow morning.

315
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,309
So you were right about that too.

316
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,079
- You should stop drinking. - Mind your own business.

317
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,879
Hey, if you knew it was me, you should have said no to him.

318
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
He said his friend was going to entertain me. Why would I say no?

319
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,990
- You can entertain yourself. - Wait.

320
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,759
Hang out with me.

321
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,500
Are you breaking your promise again like you did on Friday?

322
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,170
Let's just go wherever it might be.

323
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,680
Hye Ji.

324
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,319
(Ms. Kim)

325
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,758
- The number you called is busy. - Gosh.

326
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,160
Hye Ji. Why today of all days?

327
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,490
Lee Hong Ju.

328
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:10,960
You can drive.

329
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,140
You're all booked out?

330
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,670
I don't need a full-body massage. Now even a foot massage?

331
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,809
Okay.

332
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,819
Gosh. Darn it!

333
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,920
Why is Kang Hoo Young busy?

334
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,159
I didn't make any plans on my precious Sunday,

335
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,960
so I could spend time with you.

336
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,829
Hold on. Oddball hasn't left yet. Right?

337
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,799
Kim Hye Ji!

338
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,170
Get dressed and come out now.

339
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,809
Run! Nature is calling me!

340
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,049
All right.

341
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,119
Is there a place you want to go?

342
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,829
You told my uncle to leave everything up to you.

343
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,700
I thought I would be meeting a tiny, adorable girl.

344
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,940
Right. I think I'll be fine with anything.

345
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,309
Then I'll do whatever I want.

346
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Sure.

347
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,869
It's the festival season now.

348
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,069
Let's go.

349
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,609
Isn't this fun?

350
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,099
No!

351
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,410
Why isn't she answering her phone?

352
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,890
Come on.

353
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,390
Seriously?

354
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,358
Could you slow down a bit?

355
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,430
(Oddball)

356
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,630
All right.

357
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,369
Come on!

358
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,710
(Uncle Baek Wook)

359
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,609
Are you having fun? Are you enjoying yourself?

360
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,910
Should I call Oddball?

361
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,750
So you can spend some romantic time with Ms. Kim.

362
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:55,349
Mind your own business.

363
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,589
I should've given her a heads-up.

364
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,019
I should've been smarter.

365
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,819
Is Uncle Wook going crazy?

366
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,690
What about Uncle Wook?

367
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:04,859
Oh, he told us...

368
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,599
to have fun.

369
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,500
He's your biggest fan.

370
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,669
(Nono Tablets)

371
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,730
Are you feeling okay?

372
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,569
Yes.

373
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,368
These rides are kind of lame.

374
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,940
Is there anything more hardcore?

375
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,539
You should go home. You're white as a sheet.

376
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,410
I didn't even use extra skincare.

377
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,319
Weirdo.

378
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,220
Crowded places are draining.

379
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,490
- Are you drained? - Yes.

380
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,890
I haven't been out in a long time.

381
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,259
I used all my energy working...

382
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,400
and had none left on weekends to go out.

383
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,869
But the energy to have fun must come from elsewhere.

384
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,170
Thanks to you, I feel like I'm traveling, and it's nice.

385
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,970
Let's go.

386
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,409
Where to?

387
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,039
We're not done. What's our next ride?

388
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,079
Young man.

389
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,420
Are you truly ready for the next stage?

390
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,519
(Fire Noodles)

391
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,089
- This is... - The essence of K-food.

392
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,059
I heard foreigners love it.

393
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,828
I'm Korean.

394
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,599
Then you'll love it even more, if you're not a loser to spice.

395
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,769
A loser to spice?

396
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,338
Try it and if it's too spicy, don't eat it.

397
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,400
You'll hurt your insides.

398
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,039
My first love...

399
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,609
Hey, this is spicy.

400
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,079
Shall we bet who finishes first?

401
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,519
Look who's so confident.

402
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,920
The winner gets a wish.

403
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,960
Go.

404
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,269
No.

405
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
(Mineral water)

406
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,490
Do you admit it's crazy spicy?

407
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,650
You can't handle spices.

408
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,190
Me? I love spicy food.

409
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,359
You couldn't handle Sang Pil's spicy chicken feet.

410
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,959
My sense of pain becomes more acute when I'm drunk.

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,500
The alcohol must wake my senses.

412
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,700
- Then this is void. - It's not void.

413
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,500
You must grant me a wish, then.

414
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,740
No.

415
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,440
(Daeseongjeon)

416
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,190
This is...

417
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,990
It's a must if you're visiting Korea.

418
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,130
I've never worn a hanbok before.

419
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,329
Why am I a eunuch?

420
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
How dare the loser complain?

421
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,410
Follow me.

422
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,740
Now, who's showing whom a good time?

423
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,848
What a beautiful mountain this is.

424
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,689
We should come here every week.

425
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,990
That's a great idea.

426
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,499
- Mr. Son. - Yes?

427
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,528
Did you reserve a table at the broiled chicken place?

428
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:28,768
Yes, I did.

429
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,740
Great. They sell the best makgeolli.

430
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,539
Once we're down there,

431
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,039
a long gulp of cold makgeolli...

432
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,339
Gosh.

433
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,880
There's nothing here to see but the sky and rocks.

434
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,250
Why did he want to come up here?

435
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,150
There are so many pretty things down there.

436
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Are you all right, Ms. Kim?

437
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,450
I'm fine.

438
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,019
Mount Bukhan is rocky, so you must watch your step.

439
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,019
There really are lots of rocks.

440
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,690
Oh, dear.

441
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,900
You're wearing running shoes.

442
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,409
Are you okay?

443
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,618
I'm so sorry.

444
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,750
No worries. I should've been more careful.

445
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,089
I didn't have an ulterior motive.

446
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,059
I didn't grab you by the hair for any other reason.

447
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,299
I just learned you have thick hair.

448
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
What?

449
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,930
Mr. Son!

450
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,298
Yes, sir!

451
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,969
Why are you so slow today?

452
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,769
Let's hurry down and get some makgeolli.

453
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,410
You go ahead. I'll rest here for a while.

454
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,609
I'm okay. You needn't mind me.

455
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,650
- You should do some brown-nosing. - Mr. Son!

456
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,650
You look just fine, but you must be so frail.

457
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,990
Will you hurry up?

458
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,690
I'll go ahead, then.

459
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:38,160
- Get over here now! - Yes, I'm coming!

460
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,869
My gosh.

461
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,970
What is this mess?

462
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,939
If I'd gotten my way,

463
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,240
I'd be planning my US trip to be with Hoo Young.

464
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,849
I have something important to tell about Mr. Baek's relative.

465
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,819
You'll be shocked. Call me.

466
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,690
Oddball. She's nothing but Mr. Baek's niece.

467
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,489
The only way to shock me...

468
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,460
is to tell me that person is Kang Hoo Young.

469
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,099
(Psycho Bang)

470
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,299
I flew in.

471
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,699
I'm coming to yours this evening.

472
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,839
You punk.

473
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,930
Ms. Kim!

474
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,729
Slow down. You must go downhill slowly.

475
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,569
You'll ruin your knees!

476
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,279
No.

477
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,750
Take a photo from down low to make my legs look longer.

478
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,150
Your legs aren't even visible.

479
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,490
I want my invisible legs to look longer, fool.

480
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,359
No, this isn't it.

481
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,630
Don't shoot my face. Take a full shot.

482
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,200
Make it look like me but not like me.

483
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,970
Here.

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,609
You'll keep snapping until we get the perfect shot.

485
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,180
She looks just fine.

486
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,630
Shoot.

487
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,000
Darn the wind.

488
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,829
Are you taking photos?

489
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,029
Yes.

490
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,670
Here goes.

491
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,079
Did you take one?

492
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,079
(If you answer this call, you're basically a carp-head.)

493
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,609
A call.

494
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,150
Yes, you must do what I call you to do.

495
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,890
The future of Joeson depends on me.

496
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,220
You got a call.

497
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,490
Is it Hye Ji?

498
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:57,529
You answer it. Let's surprise her.

499
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,700
- I don't think I should take it. - Why not?

500
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,029
You're a carp-head if you do.

501
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:11,339
(If you answer this call, you're basically a carp-head.)

502
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,539
Kim Hye Ji.

503
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,349
When did you change this?

504
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,989
What are you doing?

505
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,420
Preventing you from being a carp-head.

506
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,789
Okay. Hold onto my phone.

507
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,759
Don't ever give it to me.

508
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,729
Let's take photos by the pond.

509
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,059
I heard it's a great spot.

510
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:38,839
Let's not take any more.

511
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,700
Hurry up.

512
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,940
Come on.

513
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,549
My gosh.

514
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,559
Take them from down low. You're so darn stubborn.

515
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,259
You go stand over there.

516
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,670
You need to go down this low.

517
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,769
Okay. This is the shot.

518
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,970
How amazing is this?

519
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,279
My energy level is so low.

520
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,309
I took just a few photos, and I'm exhausted.

521
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,650
"Just a few?"

522
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,980
The weather's not good enough...

523
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,089
to go for the highlight.

524
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,859
There's a highlight?

525
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,789
Well...

526
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,960
Oh, no. Shoot.

527
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,269
Darn it.

528
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,410
Let me.

529
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,619
This is a great photo.

530
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,250
It's worthy of a period drama.

531
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,690
You had a great photographer.

532
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,460
Who do you think got you leveled up?

533
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,359
Look.

534
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,359
See the one I took of you? It's fantastic.

535
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,160
That was all me.

536
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:50,429
You said that yourself?

537
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,970
I can't lie, you see.

538
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,549
Thanks to you, I had a great time and didn't think about other stuff.

539
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,650
You should come back.

540
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,679
You talk like we won't see each other again.

541
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,860
It'll be at least a few years until we meet again.

542
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,190
That's what school reunions are like.

543
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,260
I'll send you all the photos.

544
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,670
- We can't turn right here. - We can.

545
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,710
The day's not over yet.

546
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,598
I'll get going, then.

547
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,599
- Sure. - Okay.

548
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,440
Show us your handsome face often.

549
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:01,840
- Don't forget your umbrella. - I won't.

550
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:04,340
It's raining too much for fall.

551
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,479
Good night.

552
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
- Okay. - Bye.

553
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,860
Hong Ju won't answer my call.

554
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,389
She drank a lot on Friday.

555
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:28,159
How dare you show yourself around Oddball?

556
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Was Hong Ju shocked?

557
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,269
Why would she be shocked?

558
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:37,369
She was doing just fine without you.

559
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,840
She didn't answer your call because she's on a date with a guy.

560
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,250
Don't let her see you again.

561
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,679
You're being...

562
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,718
overly protective.

563
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,320
Yes. I'll shield her with walls of steel.

564
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,789
I won't let you anywhere near Oddball.

565
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,289
Why?

566
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,690
- Because she still likes me? - You crazy...

567
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,230
It was over between you two three years ago.

568
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,969
You ditched her and left.

569
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Auntie seemed worried.

570
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,409
I like your new personality after you got this done.

571
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,739
Hey.

572
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,309
If Hong Ju's fine, then all is well.

573
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,079
I'm envious of your friendship whenever I get a taste of it.

574
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,289
That bastard.

575
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,859
What should I do...

576
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,159
with that good-for-nothing piece of scrap?

577
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,489
Should I kill him?

578
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,129
Who reads books written by someone like him?

579
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,929
He's a psycho narcissist.

580
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,039
I can't let Oddball fall for him again.

581
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,940
What should I do?

582
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,449
Fried chicken by the Han River...

583
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,389
was supposed to be the highlight.

584
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:00,119
We can't do that tonight.

585
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,289
No.

586
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,960
Let's go to the diner if you're hungry.

587
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,630
No.

588
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,300
I get to see what I wanted to see.

589
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,940
You wanted to see the Han River?

590
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,809
So what I'm saying is that...

591
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:19,010
you should never see your first love again.

592
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,380
Lee Hong Ju.

593
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,980
What you said to me on Friday.

594
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,949
I'm so sorry.

595
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,989
I crossed the line, didn't I?

596
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,519
I shouldn't have said that.

597
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,689
Do you know what...

598
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,289
How could I not know?

599
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,530
When did you realize?

600
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,269
When...

601
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,199
we first met?

602
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,739
It wasn't then.

603
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,139
I think it was then.

604
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,849
You knew and still acted like that?

605
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,480
I said I was sorry.

606
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,480
But think about it.

607
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,489
Half of what I said was praise.

608
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,159
"A little kid with a smart brain."

609
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,260
That means you're a genius.

610
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,288
You could be offended that I said "kid,"

611
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,800
which implies you're immature,

612
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,129
and that's what I want to apologize for.

613
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,239
Hang on. Wait.

614
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,340
So...

615
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,769
what you're saying you knew...

616
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,380
He has no facial expressions. He has no loyalty as well.

617
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,348
He's got no heart too. Kang Hoo Young is like...

618
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,480
a little kid with a smart brain. That's it.

619
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,420
Did I say something worse than that?

620
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,269
Are you glad half of what I said was praise?

621
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,409
This is a real nice car.

622
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,469
I've never been in Mr. Baek's new car.

623
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,309
There are lots of buttons to make up for the price.

624
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,699
Why are you opening the window?

625
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,169
How do you close it?

626
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,070
- Hey. - Why won't it move?

627
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,510
- Because you're fiddling with it. - Do something.

628
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,980
Keep still.

629
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,630
Can you move over?

630
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:01,739
Okay.

631
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,150
Hey.

632
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,250
Can you fix my seat?

633
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Okay.

634
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,829
Are we done looking? Let's go home.

635
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Okay.

636
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,400
There are tissues in the compartment.

637
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,110
I'll use a few.

638
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,820
Thanks.

639
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,880
Wait. I'll get an umbrella.

640
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,179
That's too much.

641
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,179
It's just a flight of stairs.

642
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,150
Bye.

643
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:12,969
Oh, no.

644
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,840
- Oh, dear. - Gosh.

645
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,570
Let me borrow this.

646
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,300
Bye.

647
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,139
Lee Hong Ju.

648
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,010
The fried chicken.

649
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,880
Let's have it together.

650
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:39,760
Why not?

651
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
Chicken...

652
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,190
"Let's have chicken together?"

653
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,900
You're pathetic, Kang Hoo Young.

654
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,920
How could suggesting eating fried chicken sound so nice?

655
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,960
Is it because he's good-looking?

656
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,079
I thought he was going to kiss me.

657
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,210
Oh, no.

658
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,050
I guess I'm sexually frustrated.

659
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,919
(10 years ago)

660
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,388
(The library at Obok High School on September 24, 2013)

661
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:20,819
- I'd like to return it. - Why is it impossible?

662
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,828
The school library...

663
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:25,388
only buy books that are helpful for students.

664
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,259
That's why I'm saying you must buy it.

665
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,400
Write proper reasons why you recommend it then.

666
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:31,269
This is not enough.

667
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,670
Why not?

668
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,169
"It's fun."

669
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,510
"It's so fun that you won't notice even when someone dies around you."

670
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:38,868
That's true, though.

671
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,309
Write at a level suitable for high school seniors.

672
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,349
I, a high school senior, wrote it. Of course, it's at a suitable level.

673
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,050
How can I write better than this?

674
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,519
Gosh.

675
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,359
You...

676
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,618
Why did you not reply?

677
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,229
If you're shy about it, send me a text.

678
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,829
If that's embarrassing too, say it.

679
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,598
You should say something at least...

680
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,059
when someone told you about her feelings.

681
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,829
Why are you telling me that?

682
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:07,900
Are you Hye Ji?

683
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:10,969
No response is still a response.

684
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:14,710
I don't have to explain what it means, right?

685
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,880
Hey, Kang Hoo Young.

686
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,750
This is a library.

687
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,519
It's because she likes you.

688
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,929
She's shy because she likes you.

689
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,289
Because she likes you,

690
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,329
she wants to pretend that she doesn't know what it means.

691
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,900
Have you ever liked someone?

692
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,670
Should I answer to such a childish question?

693
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,249
You think you're really smart, right?

694
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,849
No. You know nothing about love.

695
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,190
If I were her, I would never like someone like you.

696
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,960
I guess you're her spokesperson. Go tell her.

697
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,659
That she should study Korean if she has time to write a letter.

698
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,800
Darn it.

699
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,139
What I just said had nothing to do with her.

700
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,980
I've been excited and overreacting myself...

701
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,849
because she's my friend.

702
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,219
So don't misunderstand her.

703
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,289
Whatever your answer is, please tell her properly.

704
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,089
Is it true you spoke rudely to Hong Ju in the library...

705
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,429
and got kicked earlier?

706
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,699
Turn around.

707
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:22,539
Is it true you told her to study Korean instead of writing a letter?

708
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,309
No, there's no way you said that.

709
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,010
You're not that much of a jerk.

710
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,480
You said it. You did it.

711
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,610
But it's weird.

712
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,219
Why did you drag it so much this time?

713
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,320
You've never taken the letters the girls wrote for you.

714
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,519
You were good at refusing them too.

715
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,599
I thought you liked receiving the letter this time.

716
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,469
(Men's Room)

717
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,949
Hoo Young, she's here again.

718
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,299
- One, two, three, four, five. - Two, three, four.

719
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,829
You're good.

720
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,820
Hoo Young! Hey!

721
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,059
Hey, Hoo Young!

722
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:54,199
This. It's from my friend, Hye Ji.

723
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,030
Oh, my gosh.

724
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,130
Oh, my.

725
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,610
Hey. Hang in there.

726
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,909
Go.

727
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,230
Hoo Young.

728
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,429
This is from my friend, Hye Ji.

729
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,880

732
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:59,710
She studied so hard to write this?

733
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,979
The survival method of humanity that has been proved...

734
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,389
throughout its long history is undoubtedly love.

735
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,419
However, the education curriculum in Korea...

736
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,190
lacks sufficient discussion on this important topic.

737
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,130
The book must not be that important to talk about humanity.

(Book Recommendation)

739
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,489
Gosh, I slept again.

740
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,059
I was really going to finish writing it today.

741
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,239
Where did it go?

742
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,710
Did it fly away?

743
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,739
I'm sure I wrote something amazing.

744
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:39,210

753
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,070
It looks good.

754
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:35,000
Gosh.

755
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,519
When should we have fried chicken?

756
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,360
When should we?

759
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,690
Can't they read Korean?

Hello.

764
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,809
Good morning.

765
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,070
Ms. Lee, come to my office.

766
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,070
Why did she already call me in the morning?

767
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,039
What happened?

768
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,948
Why?

769
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,619
Why is everyone avoiding eye contact with me?

770
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,719
Should I clean up the mess again?

771
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:35,760
It felt so good in the morning.

772
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:43,869
Come quickly.

773
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,929
I have news you've been waiting for.

774
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,139
The animation for our tenth anniversary has been decided.

775
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:51,269
Really?

776
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:53,909
Sir.

777
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,579
She's our producer, Lee Hong Ju.

778
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:59,250
Hello, I'm Lee Hong Ju.

779
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:09,219
I know her well.

780
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:12,460
It's good to see you again.

782
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,079
Jun Ho.

783
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:28,780
Talk to me.

784
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,380
Jun Ho.

785
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,650
What did I do wrong?

786
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,079
I'll fix everything.

787
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,969
It was written as a movie scenario,

788
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,199
so it needs to be adapted to the target audience.

789
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:58,610
- Are you okay with that? - Sure.

790
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,780
You said you were writing a novel.

791
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,449
Let us dramatize it then.

792
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,980
No. I'll do it.

793
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,619
I'm sure...

794
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,690
Ms. Lee will help me.

795
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:17,929
Why would I?

796
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,400
I'm in charge of production.

797
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,269
So I'll never have the opportunity to talk with you.

798
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:38,408
Good morning, everyone.

799
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,709
- As always... - Good morning.

800
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,349
- Set, set, set, Rock Asset! - Set, set, set, Rock Asset!

801
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,420
Oh, gosh.

802
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:47,219
Set, set, set, Rock Asset

803
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:48,590
Set, set

804
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,769
What are you doing?

805
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:04,039
Thinking.

806
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,639
What are you thinking? You look scary.

807
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:10,309
- Uncle. - Yes? Why?

808
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:12,610
I can't go tomorrow.

809
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:14,750
Why not?

810
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,849
Because of work, of course.

811
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,090
What work? Roem?

812
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,959
It's all settled.

813
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,288
You transferred it to the head office in a week...

814
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:25,888
just like an ace would.

815
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,230
- Why can't you go? - No.

816
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,230
I'm not done yet.

817
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:31,969
Done with what?

818
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,429
My review.

819
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,238
I'd be happy if you stayed longer.

820
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,869
But I thought you had an important schedule in the US.

821
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:42,110
A week.

822
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,280
I can stay here for a week.

823
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:54,019
I'll talk about the contract with Min Woo Pictures.

824
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:56,719
Okay. I'll think about how I should dramatize it.

825
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,289
Goodbye then.

826
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,110
Hong Ju. Come to my office.

827
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,610
Let me pop into the restroom first.

828
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,239
Hey.

829
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,110
(Peter's Pen)

830
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:41,440
I'm back, Hong Ju.

831
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,079
I left for research for my novel.

832
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,610
That's not important anymore.

833
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,050
Were you upset?

834
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,849
"Upset?"

835
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:56,849
That's why...

836
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,349
I'm back like this.

837
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:07,059
The sole reason I asked you...

838
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:09,860
to meet me separately like this...

839
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,139
is to ask you to never talk about our past to my company.

840
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,610
Whether you work with Peter's Pen or not,

841
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,710
it doesn't matter to me at all.

842
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,940
If my novel gets adapted into an animated series,

843
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,849
I must work with you.

844
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,179
- That's what you said. - That's...

845
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,750
before we broke up, sir.

846
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,159
Hong Ju.

847
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,630
We never broke up.

848
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,900
I've always thought about you in the past three years.

849
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,369
And it's the same for you.

850
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,250
The words written here.

851
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,079
Are they all lies?

852
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,519
I'm sure you would never do that,

853
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,019
but I'm asking you just in case.

854
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,730
You didn't postpone your departure...

855
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,760
because of your first love, did you?

856
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,000
Ms. Kim isn't that attractive.

857
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,769
You can't stop out of nowhere, punk.

858
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,980
It's Oddball.

859
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,449
What?

860
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,250
Why is he there?

861
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:39,590
- Who is it? - He's the guy.

862
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,860
Her ex-boyfriend...

863
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,190
and first love. He's a jerk.

864
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:48,559
Oh, yes.

865
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,960
Hey, Oddball.

866
01:03:51,969 --> 01:03:52,969
Uncle Wook.

867
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,369
- Hoo Young? - When did he come back to Korea?

868
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,170
Why were you with him?

869
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,510
Hong Ju.

870
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,510
"Hong Ju?"

871
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,150
Uncle Wook.

872
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,250
Don't.

873
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,980
Goodbye, Mr. Bang.

874
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,860
If you really don't have any feelings for me,

875
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,289
there's no reason why you can't work with me on the project.

876
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,159
You're doing this...

877
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,900
because you still like me.

878
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:26,469
That guy is...

879
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,449
Hong Ju. I'm glad I met you.

880
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:42,550
The hair elastic you left last night. It's in my car.

881
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:45,920
Go get it.

882
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,420
Yes. It's my favorite.

883
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,460
Let's go.

(Ramyeon, gimbap)

887
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,949
I'm not leaving before I tell him about my feelings.

888
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:12,480
Don't tell him.

889
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:13,679
Why not?

890
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,250
Because I...

891
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,420
am going to report you.

892
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,719
That a student is dating a soldier.

893
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,489
Report me? Are you crazy?

894
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,329
Back then, we...

895
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,969
We were losers but adorable.

896
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:34,769
We were clumsy but passionate.

897
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,670
- Probably. - Probably.

898
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:06,328
He insists that I should work on the tenth-anniversary project.

899
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,440
It was written by Bang Jun Ho.

900
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,569
It was Bang Jun Ho?

("My Avant-garde Lover")

902
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:13,670
Hong Ju can't refuse it.

903
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,110
Are you dumb?

904
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:21,449
Is the memory of that day a painful one for you?

905
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:23,780
Everything related to Bang Jun Ho is bad.

906
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:25,949
