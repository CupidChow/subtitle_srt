(Episode 7)

8
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,710
I'll read your feedback later. You should go now.

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,880
What's wrong, Jun Ho? Are you sick?

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,320
What if I am?

11
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,359
What if I left because I was sick?

12
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,159
Would you take me back?

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,739
Get up first.

14
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,069
Do you think you can get up?

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,310
Hong Ju.

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,079
I've been very sick.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,650
I couldn't breathe.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,689
My hands shook.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,719
I couldn't even write a single word.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,030
I didn't know.

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,799
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,239
I didn't want you to see me like this.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,209
I had to leave you when you were crying.

24
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,810
How do you think I felt then?

25
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,719
We've known each other for a decade.

26
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,860
You had feelings for me for all those years.

27
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,159
You have always been special to me.

28
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Even when we were apart, it was the same.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,530
It was the same for you too.

30
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,509
I'll call Mr. Ju and ask him to come and check on you.

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,810
You should rest up.

32
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,210
Lee Hong Ju.

33
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,349
You're still going to leave?

34
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,520
How could you do this to me?

35
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,449
I was sick too!

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,960
Please forgive me.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,430
Actually,

38
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,969
I really wanted to know why you left.

39
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,599
For three years,

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,969
I beat myself up wondering what I had done...

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,710
or what I hadn't done.

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,750
With you gone,

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,349
I thought that it was my fault that everyone around me was leaving.

44
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,389
I told myself that again and again.

45
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,560
But now that I know why you left,

46
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm angry.

47
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,129
You would have left me anyway no matter what I did.

48
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,240
You were...

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,969
going to leave without explaining anything to me.

50
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,180
Forgive you?

51
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,550
Yes, I will. I think I can forgive you now.

52
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,679
You gave me the answer to a question...

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I had been struggling with my whole life.

54
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,489
That people who leave had a reason to do so.

55
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,520
And that...

56
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,319
isn't my fault.

57
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,689
I know that now thanks to you.

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,370
Hong Ju. Hear me out.

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,569
Right.

60
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,839
I must make something clear.

61
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,040
I have feelings for someone else.

62
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,040
I will probably...

63
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,709
end up liking him a lot more than now.

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
My decision won't change either.

65
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,779
I won't go back alone.

66
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,519
If you insist on having your way,

67
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,279
I'll give it my all this time.

68
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,290
- Give your all to what? - Everything I hadn't tried before.

69
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,220
Causing trouble or going astray.

70
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,699
Hoo Young.

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,529
Hey.

72
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,100
Do Seon. He's been acting weird lately, right?

73
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,209
He keeps surprising me these days.

74
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,109
Did he suddenly become someone else?

75
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,939
Or has he always been like that? Did he just hold back...

76
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,350
(Accident prone area, slow down)

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,990
I'll step down from the project.

78
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,959
Why?

79
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,759
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,160
I can't separate my private life from work.

81
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,560
Did Mr. Bang do something to you?

82
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,329
No.

83
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,129
Then did you?

84
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes. I did.

85
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,939
Okay. You can step down.

86
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,838
I don't want to force you to take on the project...

87
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,610
when you don't want to.

88
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,180
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,220
(Turn "My Avant-garde Lover" into an animated movie!)

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,420
I don't need this anymore. Take it.

91
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,198
(Please hire me as an employee of Peter's Pen.)

92

(Turn "My Avant-garde Lover" into an animated movie!)

94
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,709
I stayed up all night writing that for the first time in my life,

95
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,110
and I found a dream.

96
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,009
I want people like me...

97
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,079
to see our animated movies...

98
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,349
and have warm and fun dreams.

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,620
(Turn "My Avant-garde Lover" into an animated movie!)

100
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,290
Did you enjoy typing this up?

101
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,389
Yes.

102
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,860
How much?

103
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,259
Enough not to know I'd stayed up...

104
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,089
and that the sun had risen.

105
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,269
(Turn "My Avant-garde Lover" into an animated movie!)

106
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,410
Seriously. What's up with the PE teacher?

107
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,439
Our college entrance exam is over. Do we still have to go to school?

108
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,208
- Exactly. - Forget about him.

109
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,480
He's always been so annoying.

110
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,709
Hey, did you watch the drama?

111
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:58,980
The male supporting character is totally my type.

112
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,819
You guys are so lucky.

113
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,319
Pardon?

114
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,459
You can hang out with your friends from morning until night.

115
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,689
You can have your meals at proper times.

116
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,430
If you get sleepy, you can take a nap.

117
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
Then you can get up and eat some more.

118
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,828
Things were better when I was in school.

119
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,240
Are you describing a puppy kindergarten?

120
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,170
Hey, don't play along.

121
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,470
She's...

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,379
She's a weirdo. Don't talk to her.

123
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,279
Do I look like a weirdo?

124
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,779
In what ways?

125
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,919
Is it weird that I yelled at a sick guy?

126
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
Or is it weird that I turned down a great opportunity?

127
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,519
How am I weird?

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,059
Guys.

129
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,590
What's wrong with her?

130
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,230
- Hey, wait up. - Guys. Let's just talk.

131
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,769
I won.

132
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:57,309
Hong Ju.

133
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,909
Lee Hong Ju!

134
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,580
Kang Hoo Young.

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,950
Don't come here. Stay there for a second.

136
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,610
You're late.

137
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,879
I'm sorry. I hit traffic.

138
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,679
Did something happen to you?

139
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,750
I'll do whatever I want today no matter what.

140
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,740
Look at them.

141
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,610
- Gosh. - Hey.

142
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,009
You can't ride that together.

143
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,580
- Let's run! - Hey!

144
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,610
Hey!

145
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,149
(Spectator mode)

146
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,129
- Go. - Right.

147
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,599
- What's this? - Game over.

148
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
What?

149
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,509
That's understandable.

150
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,340
You have to aim their heads.

151
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,378
- There are so many heads. - Keep shooting at them.

152
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,379
I'm doing that.

153
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,389
- Game over. - My gun is a bit weird.

154
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,158
I stand next to her on purpose

155
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,159
But for some reason, I feel as if I'm not good enough

156
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,029
No, I'm good

157
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,928
You don't have to feel such pressure

158
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,369
I'm not seeing anyone right now anyway

159
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,440
But why can't you say

160
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,569
What was that? That was rude.

161
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,110
I'm sorry. I pressed it before I could stop myself.

162
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,710
I see. I've been hogging the microphone.

163
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,679
Here.

164
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,289
I think you'll be pretty surprised this time.

165
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,490
So you're quite the singer?

166
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,700
On a sunny day

167
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,570
Would you go on a trip with me?

168
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:49,509
To a very far place

169
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:55,590
So we don't have to come back

170
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,929
On a sunny day

171
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:07,970
Would you go on a trip with me?

172
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,870
To a very far place

173
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,879
So we don't have to come back

174
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,979
So no one can find us

175
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,590
Gosh, how can his voice sound so sexy?

176
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,529
So no one can find us

177
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,029
So we spent over 100 dollars at the arcade?

178
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,969
This is all because the consumer price index in Korea...

179
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,768
went up 5.3 percent this year.

180
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,970
It's because you were awful at those games.

181
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,070
I was?

182
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,409
You spent several dollars when I only spent 50 cents.

183
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,740
No way.

184
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,279
Being awful at games isn't a big deal. I had so much fun.

185
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,850
Same here.

186
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,620
I was in the mood for some arcade games today too.

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,350
- We were in the same boat. - Why?

188
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,860
Did you get stressed out at work?

189
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,529
Something like that.

190
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,959
That's unexpected. I didn't think you'd get stressed out at work.

191
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,259
So I quit my job.

192
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,699
Hey. What did you say? You quit your job?

193
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,970
Lee Hong Ju, my arm.

194
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,970
Hey, don't tell me it's because of me.

195
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,679
Because I told you not to go to the US?

196
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,210
It's not like that.

197
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,950
Then what? Why did you suddenly quit your job?

198
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:34,590
Lee Hong Ju.

199
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,889
You don't have to worry about this.

200
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm Kang Hoo Young.

201
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,669
You win.

202
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,070
Just trust me.

203
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,850
Okay.

204
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,620
From now on, I'm only going to trust you.

205
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,719

208
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,759
This is all because of Kang Hoo Young.

209
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,189
After getting turned down by him, I must have lost my mind.

210
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,200
(Ms. Kim)

211
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,230
I thought he had a big chest.

212
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,129
You said he had a big heart and was reliable.

213
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,970
What's the point of having a big chest?

214
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,470
A handsome face is what matters for men.

215
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,769
Well, I have to agree on that.

216
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,370
Exactly.

217
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,009
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,508
You should have stopped me.

219
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,480
I was clearly on the wrong path.

220
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,250
- You seemed happy. - What? As if.

221
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,690
Seriously. It was a close one.

222
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,518
I nearly abandoned...

223
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,789
the lifelong ideals and values I sought in men.

224
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,289
Darn it.

225
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,200
Darn it.

226
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,830
I'm done with dating.

227
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,539
I'm going to focus on my job for the time being. Seriously.

228
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,609
What are you talking about?

229
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,340
You should date. Dating is awesome.

230
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,950
Awesome, my foot.

231
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,308
It's emotionally draining,

232
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,480
and I'll have more things to worry about.

233
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,178
What if I fight with my boyfriend?

234
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,580
Then don't fight with him.

235
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,389
Besides, your job is more emotionally draining.

236
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,419
There are so many things you must handle for your students.

237
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,689
With my job, I'll at least get something out of it.

238
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,959
What will dating leave me?

240
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,399
You'll get love.

241
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,229
Gosh, you've changed.

242
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,398
That's not true.

243
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,169
I simply returned to my old self.

244
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,809
Gosh, whatever. I hate you. I'm hanging up.

245

Love, my foot.

Hiking boots aren't just for the mountains.

248
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,990
They are nice. They can protect my ankles.

249
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,519
Are they a bit heavy?

250
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,960
Great. They're perfect.

251
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,960
This is much better.

252
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,610
Darn it.

253
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,879

Hey, did you go for a run?

260
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,740
Yes. But I could exercise a bit more.

261
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,440
I might walk a bit more...

262
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,380
that way.

263
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,109
You and I are going in the same direction.

I'll walk with you.

265
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,049
Sounds good.

266
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:08,829
Mom?

267
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,089
"Mom?"

268
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,279
Hello. I'm Lee Hong Ju.

I'm Baek Do Seon.

270

I didn't know you were meeting a friend at this hour.

271
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,629
Mom, Hong Ju is...

272
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,299
Hoo Young hasn't come back to Korea for a very long time.

273
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,170
Thank you for showing him around.

274
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Sure.

275
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,339
She's my girlfriend.

276
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,119
Ms. Lee.

277
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,289
I need to talk to my son for a moment.

278
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,990
Could you give us some privacy?

279
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,119
- Mom. - Hoo Young.

280
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,089
I'll see you next time.

281
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,789
Uncle Wook. It's an emergency.

282
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,859
So you met her again.

283
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,430
You know her?

284
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,230
I know everything there is to know about you.

285
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,338
So tell me. Are you in the mood to cause trouble now?

286
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,640
My decision has nothing to do with Hong Ju.

287
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,809
It's my business. And I made the decision.

288
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:11,180
Okay. If you say so, then it must be true.

289
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,559
Gosh.

290
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
What?

291
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,029
How did you... Why...

292
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,829
What are you doing here?

293
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,799
The house looks very different.

294
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,039
I only asked you to manage the property.

295
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,839
You hated the house because it reminded you of your husband.

296
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,420
Hey.

297
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,549
What husband?

298
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,318
It's not like you're going to move back to Korea.

299
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,390
Don't book me a hotel room.

300
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,390
I'll live here while I stay in Korea.

301
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,059
Why?

302
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,630
Why?

303
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,200
No!

304
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:01,329
Leave, Baek Do Seon!

305
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Go back to the US!

306
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Leave!

307
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,038
We made an offer to adapt our animation series,

308
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,750
"The Airport Diary," into an animated movie.

309
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,779
The investor and distribution agency gave us positive feedback.

310
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,819
We'll have a meeting with the CEO sometime next week.

311
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,160
Alter. Kang Hoo Young's mother moved into the house.

312
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,990
Try to avoid her as much as possible. Your safety comes first!

313
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,730
How much progress have you made with "Flower That Blooms at Night?"

314
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,569
- What? - A status update on "FTBN."

315
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,109
Okay.

316
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,809
The director said Yeo Hwa's outfit in the beginning looked too plain.

317
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,479
The designers are revising the outfit.

318
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
It's a mourning dress. Of course, it must be plain, not flashy.

319
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,149
You can't accept all of his demands.

320
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,419
He said adding some white embroidery patterns...

321
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,750
on the collars or dress strips might be okay.

322
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,460
The director said you gave him the idea.

323
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,160
Next.

324
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,289
Was that everything?

325
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,329
All right then.

326
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
I have to pick a new main producer for "My Avant-garde Lover."

327
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
I know that you already have existing projects.

328
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:16,338
But this project will be a meaningful one...

329
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,839
to your career and our company.

330
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,538
Check your schedules.

331
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,579
If you're interested, come to my office.

332
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:27,419
If you're not sure you can handle the project,

333
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,950
don't even try to knock on my door.

334
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,028
Hey, you can't be here right now.

335
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,829
- Go home. - No, I won't.

336
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,670
I thought your mother was downstairs.

337
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,869
- Yes, she is. - Then...

338
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
Seriously?

339
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,890
We ran into my mom this morning. Did that startle you a lot?

340
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,529
You startled me even more just now.

341
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,660
Is your mother going to stay at the hideout?

342
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,369
Yes.

343
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,740
Should I stay somewhere else for a while, then?

344
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,599
I can stay at Hye Ji's.

345
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,309
Where would you go when I'll be here?

346
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,609
I'll feel uncomfortable.

347
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,339
I think your mother doesn't like me.

348
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,680
She's always like that.

349
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,220
- Are you sure? - Yes.

350
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:11,049
I wondered who you were like. You're like your mother.

351
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,660
I lack facial expressions and...

352
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,190
Hey. When did I say that?

353
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,329
So...

354
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,460
don't worry too much.

355
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,799
I'm partially responsible.

356
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,940
I'm that fatally charming.

357
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,309
What's this silence?

358
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,450
You're right.

359
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,819
You're fatally charming.

360
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,189
If you admit that so fast,

361
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,890
responsibility will become an issue.

362
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,289
I'm your responsibility.

363
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,230
You got shameless since you quit your job.

364
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Right.

365
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm jobless.

366
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,569
You're smiling. Are you pleased to be jobless?

367
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,910
I'm pleased that I have time to spend with you.

368
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,509
I don't like you much today.

369
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,680
You should go.

370
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,549
I don't want to.

371
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,319
I'll stay a bit longer.

372
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,690
No. I'll stay a lot longer.

373
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,559
Okay, then.

374
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,400
- What do you think? - Thank you.

375
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:33,839
Here you go.

376
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,549
Hey.

377
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,349
The lunch rush is crazy.

378
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,589
- I'll clean this table for you. - Okay.

379
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,720
- Why is it so crowded? - I don't know.

380
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,129
Welcome. A table for three?

381
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,589
- Yes. - Then...

382
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,160
You, move.

383
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,899
Sit over here. Study the menu and order.

384
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,969
- Excuse me. - Yes?

385
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,429
We're still waiting for our food.

386
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,970
It'll be right out. Please wait.

387
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,409
Shall we ask what's good?

388
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,549
Yes, let's.

389
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,950
Excuse me.

390
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,450
Excuse me.

391
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,089
Yes?

392
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,490
Is the kimchi jjigae any good?

393
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,329
- Yes. - What else is good here?

394
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,130
Everything's good.

395
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,369
Can we have two kimchi jjigae and spicy stir-fried pork?

396
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,970
Sure.

397
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,839
- Sang Pil. - Yes?

398
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,980
Two kimchi jjigae and spicy stir-fried pork.

399
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,420
- Sang Pil. - Yes?

400
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,690
- Thanks. - Goodbye.

401
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,519
- Gosh. - That was good.

402
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,759
Goodness.

403
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,869
Here goes.

404
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,259
I'm not used to the weight.

405
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,490
Could you please not do anything?

406
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:39,599
- We're ready to pay. - Okay.

407
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,199
Don't mind me. It's fine.

408
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,140
Don't say that. It's not fine.

409
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm not fine.

410
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,939
Do you know how many bowls you smashed?

411
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,509
Don't worry. I'm good with numbers.

412
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,940
I'll help you pay.

413
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,980
We enjoyed the food.

414
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,549
It was real tasty, and you're cute.

415
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,589
Don't.

416
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,018
- Thank you. - You're good-looking.

417
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,019
Stop it.

418
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,318
- Come by again. - Thank you.

419
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,930
- Thank you. - Thank you.

420
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,930
Eat on time.

421
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,569
Ask Sang Pil to cook you something nice.

422
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,199
- Okay. - Hey, can you do the dishes?

423
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
(Hong Ju)

424
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,569
Hoo Young?

425
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,740
You just stand still over there.

426
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,740
I'd much prefer that.

427
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,309
Sang Pil.

428
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,920
- Do you need help with anything? - No, stay on your phone.

429
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,950
(Quarterly Sales Report)

430
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,859
You lost three clients this year already.

431
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,219
One of them said...

432
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,960
they wanted to work with their main bank instead.

433
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
So what?

434
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,470
Did you say, "I understand. Goodbye?"

435
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,700
No. We tried to persuade them to stay with us, of course.

436
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,940
- Can you excuse us? - Yes.

437
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,319
(Rock Asset)

438
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,519
What are you doing?

439
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,088
What does it look like I'm doing?

440
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,430
Venting at us.

441
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,160
You can't control Hoo Young, so you're taking it out on us.

442
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,429
- That's right. - That's right?

443
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,439
You got sued for doing a crappy job,

444
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,639
so I sent someone over and you made him quit.

445
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,269
Wouldn't I want to vent?

446
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,980
The former was me, but not the latter.

447
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,210
That was...

448
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,150
Lee Hong Ju, I bet.

449
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:38,619
How do you know?

450
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,759
Do you remember Goblin Tteokbokki that was by our school?

451
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,259
I'm there having lunch.

452
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,959
What's crazy is, the lady here remembers you.

453
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,229
(Goblin Tteokbokki)

454
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,130
Hoo Young? Kang Hoo Young?

455
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,568
The handsome math genius.

456
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,970
I know him well.

457
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,269
He's still just the same. He's so cool.

458
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,339
And... This is a secret.

459
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,809
I'm dating him.

460
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,680
I told her we're dating.

461
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,579
Hong Ju. Lying so blatantly makes you look bad.

462
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,749
It's the truth. Why won't you believe me?

463
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,549
He's not crazy enough to date you.

464
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,088
- He might date me, though. - She didn't believe me.

465
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,819
She said you're not crazy enough to date me.

466
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,990
How could you?

467
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,200
- Let's eat. - Gosh.

468
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,299
You need to come here with me to prove you're crazy.

469
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,500
I'll come to Grilling Meat when I get off work at 6pm.

470
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,970
Let's have meat for dinner.

471
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,839
It's crazy having to deal with so many customers.

472
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,420
Are you loving it? You quit work to date.

473
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,589
Are you happy?

474
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Yes.

475
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,160
What? I'm scared of you now.

476
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,400
People die if they change so suddenly.

477
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,299
I'll come by at lunchtime for a while.

478
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,799
What?

479
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,598
I'm free during the day.

480
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,970
No, thanks. Stay free.

481
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:09,809
Darn it.

482
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:11,710
Six o'clock is so far off.

483
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,450
Darn Hoo Young.

484
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,650
He doesn't come to work...

485
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,119
or answer my calls.

486
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,720
Where is he doing and what?

487
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,019
My intestines are all twisted.

488
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,019
Is it my stomach?

489
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:29,160
It must be both. Darn.

490
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,630
Bae Hye Sook.

491
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,269
Are you leaving?

492
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,099
Did you have dinner?

493
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,240
I don't think we're close enough to ask each other such questions.

494
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,740
Why not?

495
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,109
Neighbors are close enough to ask each other such questions.

496
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,390
- Baek Wook. - Yes?

497
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,119
I won't park here anymore.

498
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:01,059
So stop drunk-dialing me.

499
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,730
Why should we do this when we're both in our 40s?

500
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,099
It's childish.

501
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,779
You.

502
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,390
What are you doing?

503
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,589
Now that you're in your 40s,

504
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,119
are you losing control?

505
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,569
Your dress got caught in the door.

506
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Why are you so clumsy?

507
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,009
Darn you!

508
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,049
Why would you touch my skirt?

509
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,420
I can't stand you. Get lost!

510
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,549
Hey, Bae Hye Sook.

511
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,960
Hey! You!

512
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,230
Your skirt was lodged in the door.

513
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,599
You could get hurt!

514
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,470
Why would you be so angry about that?

515
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,710
I couldn't handle today's outfit, so I came to get changed.

516
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,180
I'll come and get you.

517
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,980
Why bother when I can come over?

518
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,578
Cook some meat...

519
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,680
so I can eat as soon as I get there.

520
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,660
(To Jun Ho)

521
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,130
- The crazy... - What?

522
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,940
Get some meat on the grill. I'll be right there.

523
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,839
(To Jun Ho)

524
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,220
What are you doing, Mr. Bang?

525
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,019
I'm flying paper planes.

526
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,260
Why would you throw paper planes here...

527
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,759
that are made with these?

528
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,789
What should I do, then?

529
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,599
I don't want to keep these anymore.

530
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,329
It's too dangerous to burn them,

531
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,869
and throwing them in the trash...

532
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,099
would be too upsetting.

533
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,639
Throw them away with the other trash.

534
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,380
That's cold, Hong Ju.

535
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,289
I won't cling to you. Let's break up.

536
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,860
We broke up three years ago.

537
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,300
Yes. We broke up three years ago.

538
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,510
(My dear...)

539
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,219
The guy you're seeing.

540
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,849
Is he a nice guy?

541
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,719
Yes.

542
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,760
Okay.

543
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,889
Good.

544
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,230
But Hong Ju.

545
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,570
I don't think...

546
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,000
I believe in love anymore.

547
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,269
Breaking up.

548
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,480
I thought it was so painful that I'd die.

549
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,079
But I didn't die.

550
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,750
I survived, and now I'm in love again.

551
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,150
Like me, you'll feel better soon.

552
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,900
This is no fun.

553
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,969
This is your heart.

554
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,139
You throw it away.

555
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,630
Good for you, Bang Jun Ho.

556
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,360
You did good.

557
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,409
The planes.

558
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,489
He threw so many.

559
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,929
I wrote so many letters.

560
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,920
Hello.

561
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:30,219
I guess some kids threw paper planes.

562
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,299
I thought you were just cute.

563
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,630
(My dear...)

564
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,469
You must have a complicated love life.

565
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,389
Darn it.

566
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,190
Why are you both letting the meat burn?

567
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,558
I'm not in the mood to cook.

568
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,659
What's up with you?

569
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,360
Are you waiting for Hong Ju?

570
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,900
What a devoted boyfriend.

571
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Hye Ji.

572
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,250
Did Hong Ju tell you anything?

573
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,949
Like what?

574
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,750
(Hong Ju)

575
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,698
(I'll be there soon. Start without me.)

576
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll be there soon. Start without me.

577
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,030
Is that company crazy?

578
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,569
Why else...

579
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,599
would they ask Oddball to work with Bang Jun Ho?

580
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,969
And don't you say anything around Hoo Young.

581
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,238
Oddball won't do it. I know her.

582
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,380
You don't know anything.

583
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,380
Hong Ju had the face of someone dying to do it.

584
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,420
Hoo Young quit his job...

585
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,550
and spent the whole day here.

586
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,619
How could Hong Ju even consider that job?

587
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,118
Did she look like she wanted to do it or was she going to...

588
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,460
Why are you changing...

589
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,069
This is on you, Sang Pil.

590
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,170
What did I do?

591
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,210
I'll get Hong Ju.

592
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,380
What...

593
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,119
(Grilling Meat Again Today)

594
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,469
Hoo Young...

595
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,710
is best off not knowing about any of this, right?

596
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,908
I don't know what you saw but...

597
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,150
You don't have to explain.

598
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,279
I don't want my Hoo Young to get...

599
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,349
dragged into something that pathetic.

600
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,730
Ms. Lee.

601
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,230
I get that we're connected in an interesting way,

602
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,369
but don't waste pointless time.

603
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,369
My Hoo Young will take over Rock Asset's head office.

604
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,710
He could become much greater if he wants to.

605
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,650
Do you get what I'm saying?

606
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,650
No.

607
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,190
I came here to get him.

608
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,389
This isn't the place for him.

609
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Isn't that...

610
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,199
for Hoo Young to decide?

611
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,309
My decision is his decision.

612
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,638
- Hoo Young... - Hoo Young...

613
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,150
became a softie since he returned to this place.

614
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,579
He was never like that.

615
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,849
I'd like you...

616
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,289
to let him go.

617
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:30,590
I'm not keeping him here.

618
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,130
Then...

619
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,030
is my Hoo Young the clingy one?

620
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,670
- He's clinging to you? - Yes.

621
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,309
He was a total flirt.

622
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,769
I was in a car accident recently.

623
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,480
I told him not to, but he insisted on looking after me.

624
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,479
He said he was pleased I broke up...

625
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,050
and kissed me first.

626
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,919
He took me to the seaside.

627
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,219
I kept telling him no,

628
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,489
but he kept saying he wanted to, so...

629
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,630
So...

630
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,760
you gave in?

631
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,159
The cool and handsome Hoo Young was flirting with me.

632
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,170
How could I not give in?

633
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:17,769
You're right.

634
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:21,980
You must've had no choice but to fall for him.

635
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,010
But do you think...

636
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,250
you were the only one?

637
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,190
I'm worried that Hoo Young changes partners so frequently.

638
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,190
He made so many young girls cry.

639
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,059
But...

640
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,969
men fall in and out of love easily.

641
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,099
It might sound crass,

642
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,369
but I don't think my son's any different.

643
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,480
Before you get hurt,

644
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,750
I'd like you to end it.

645
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,619
If you're done, I'd like to go.

646
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,159
Did you...

647
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:15,699
stop to think what Hoo Young could lose because of you?

648
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,269
If the smart guy did the math and made up his mind,

649
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,809
doesn't that mean he thinks I'm worth more than all that?

650
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,750
(I'll love only Jun Ho forever.)

651
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,090
What are you doing here?

652
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,289
Why are you out in the cold?

653
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,599
I was thinking.

654
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,769
Is something wrong?

655
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,210
Sandra and Sarah.

656
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,510
Amanda. Selena.

657
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,510
Were any of your exes called that?

658
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,308
What?

659
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,579
You had lots of girlfriends in the US.

660
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,179
What on earth...

661
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,420
Did you meet my mom?

662
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,260
Yes. And she told me...

663
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,159
she was concerned that you made many girls cry.

664
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Hong Ju, that's...

665
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:31,070
Why should I hear about that from her?

666
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:33,840
Don't take what she says seriously.

667
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,239
Shouldn't I?

668
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,340
Then...

669
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,280
shouldn't I take it seriously that she said she came for you?

670
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,329
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Mom.

671
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,500
But I told you I won't go back.

672
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,969
What if you leave anyway?

673
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,300
Do I have to be left clueless...

674
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,869
and find out after the fact?

675
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,280
Instead of getting upset because of what my mom said,

676
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,309
shouldn't you trust me?

677
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,909
How can I trust you in this situation?

678
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,590
You didn't tell me about Bang Jun Ho because you didn't trust me?

679
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,159
Why would you mention him?

680
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,029
You don't have to worry about that.

681
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,960
How can I not worry about that?

682
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,860
I saw how much you cried because of him.

683
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,698
I know what you did,

684
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:38,769
so how could I...

685
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,440
How could I not care?

686
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,809
I ended it.

687
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,579
I'm over him.

688
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,710
You don't trust me either.

689
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,349
- Hong Ju. - Leave it.

690
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,988
You're the same.

691
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,519
- You always... - Not another word.

692
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,960
You always just up and leave.

693
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,429
I'd forgotten that.

694
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,130
Hong Ju.

695
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,039
Haven't you left for work yet?

696
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,840
Is this what you call...

697
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,110
"going astray?"

698
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,250
I couldn't sleep well.

699
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,750
I'll be lying down just a little more.

700
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,480
That's good!

701
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,879
- Let's go! - You can do it!

702
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,750
- Hey! - Hey!

703
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,789
Don't rush it.

704
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,619
Oh, no.

705
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,889
No one can do it. Oh, no.

706
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:25,729
(Obok High School)

707
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm hungry.

708
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,710
Hurry up. That was so hard.

709
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,639
Where should we go?

710
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:40,980
What is it?

711
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,018
Did you come here to visit someone?

712
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,019
No.

713
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,159
I came to confess.

714
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,659
I'm not leaving until I express my feelings for him.

715
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,900
My heart is overflowing.

716
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:00,170
I feel suffocated because it keeps overflowing.

717
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,300
It might kill me if I don't tell him.

718
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,869
We should meet again when Jun Ho is discharged from the military.

719
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,639
I'll make sure to show you our love then.

720
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,780
I completely forgot about it.

721
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,650
How can you forget that?

722
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,420
Is that day a bad memory for you?

723
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,019
How come it is related to Bang Jun Ho?

724
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,760
It's a memory related to me.

725
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,400
How can I not worry about that?

726
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,869
I saw how much you cried because of him.

727
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,170
I know what you did,

728
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,440
so how could I...

729
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,639
How could I not care?

730
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:52,489
Oddball.

731
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:55,090
Hye Ji, what do I do?

732
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,219
Why?

733
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,300
What on earth did I do in front of Hoo Young?

734
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:04,300
Gosh, I completely forgot about it.

735
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:06,800
Did you have a big argument yesterday?

736
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,440
What is that? Did you argue or not?

737
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,379
- I don't know. - It's okay.

738
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,940
A relationship consists of half love and half argument. Forget about it.

739
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,908
What should we eat? Let's go.

740
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,609
- I don't have... - Don't say you don't have appetite.

741
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,749
I even requested a permission to go out, which is rare.

742
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,820
Let's eat something delicious.

743
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:24,989
What do you want to have?

744
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,260
Gosh.

745
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,159
Hong Ju went on and on about the hideout.

746
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,500
And it really is a hideout.

747
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,800
I didn't know Mr. Baek was design-savvy and rich like this.

748
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,670
Gosh, I've been too rude to him.

749
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,880
I didn't contact you after I left yesterday. I'm sorry.

750
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,079
What?

751
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,510
I knew you wouldn't come back.

752
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,480
I knew you would have a drink.

753
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,179
But you drank too much.

754
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,920
I should've bought some fruits at least.

755
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,389
How about your restaurant?

756
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,860
I thought a lot after coming back from the beach trip.

757
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,630
"Why did I want to open a restaurant?"

758
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,969
"Was my goal success or happiness?"

759
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:48,440
I work without any days off.

760
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,639
I wondered if I was successful or happy.

761
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,590
Selena is Selena Gomez.

762
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,059
Is Sandra Bullock or Oh?

763
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,800
How did you even come up with that?

764
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,630
You're laughing too much.

765
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:21,000
You did well.

766
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:22,699
I ate a leg.

767
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,610
For today, you eat mine too.

768
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,840
You look worn out from everything you've been through.

769
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,679
Hoo Young must be even more upset.

770
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,820
Why? What did you say?

771
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,489
I said he would leave too.

772
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:40,460
Just like Jun Ho.

773
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,690
Are you out of your mind, Oddball?

774
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,698
His mother came to take him to the US. What do I do then?

775
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,529
He said he was not going to leave.

776
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,969
It's going to be fine then. What's the problem?

777
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,400
He did,

778
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,869
but I think...

779
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:57,739
he knows I was going to work with Jun Ho again.

780
00:53:58,739 --> 00:53:59,809
Oh, right.

781
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,849
Oddball, it upsets me even more.

782
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,710
Why didn't you tell me?

783
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,420
Why do you do it all by yourself?

784
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:10,389
I've been telling you how upsetting it is since before.

785
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,150
It's because I don't want you to worry.

786
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,919
After I solve the issue...

787
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,559
That's what I'm saying. You can take care of everything by yourself.

788
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,630
You're good at everything. So I don't have to worry, right?

789
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,900
You take care of it by yourself.

790
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,800
This is for you. I'm fine.

791
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:32,769
Eat.

792
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,250
So your attitude is all wrong.

793
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,619
You should've pretended you didn't know.

794
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,550
Just like Hong Ju is the only one in your life.

795
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,690
In the present, in the past, and in the future.

796
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,530
- She's the only one. - The only one?

797
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,960
No, that's not good.

798
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,429
The more loved ones you have, the better it is.

799
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,969
They say the more, the better. Don't you know it?

800
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,769
Let me show you something funny.

801
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,849
Before I show it to you,

802
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,149
you should never tell...

803
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,989
Hong Ju and Hye Ji that I showed you this.

804
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:22,559
It will end my life.

805
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:25,789
Gosh.

806
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,599
This is when I was on my final leave from the military.

807
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,308
Look at them.

808
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,939
Hye Ji was a mess, preparing for the teacher certification exam.

809
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,239
As for Hong Ju...

810
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,649
She had a heavy workload at work.

811
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,679
Because of them, I almost decided to become a professional soldier.

812
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,690
What's this?

813
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,989
Oh, this is the picture of Hong Ju's name.

814
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,760
It was her company's first animated movie.

815
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,929
She said her name was in the credit.

816
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,300
But it was so small and fast that I couldn't find it.

817
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,598
We had to watch the movie three times...

818
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,440
to take a picture of her name.

819
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:12,909
("The Airport Diary")

820
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,739
It was a day before the winter vacation ceremony.

821
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,948
Hong Ju had indigestion after eating tteokbokki.

822
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,949
Hye Ji and I were so shocked that day.

823
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,690
She was whining so much, saying she didn't want to see a doctor.

824
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,260
My goodness.

825
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:47,579
Hong Ju said this when she was drunk one day.

826
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,750
She's had the same nightmare since she was little.

827
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,179
She sees different places and people,

828
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,250
but she always chases them.

829
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,119
She thought about what kind of nightmare it was while chasing them.

830
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,289
They said they would come back...

831
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,929
and see her later.

832
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,099
But they left without saying goodbye,

833
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,670
so she didn't know it was the last moment, which scared her.

834
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,408
Hey, Hoo Young.

835
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:22,139
Wait right there. I'll be there soon.

836
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,340
Wait.

837
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,789
When are you going back to the US?

838
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,219
Come to think of it,

839
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,389
it's not like you've ever told me before leaving.

840
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:38,789
Must I be kept in the dark again...

841
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,530
and find out only after you leave?

842
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,730
You always just up and leave.

843
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,230
I'd forgotten that.

844
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,969
I asked...

845
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,639
what she wanted to do when she caught them.

846
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,010
She said she wanted to say goodbye.

847
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,409
Then she wouldn't have to keep waiting.

848
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,750
My bus has come. Bye.

849
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,550
Then goodbye, Hoo Young. It was nice seeing you.

850
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,059
Bye.

851
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,619
Goodbye.

852
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,659
Everyone...

853
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,230
has a painful spot.

854
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,610
Do it again.

855
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,509
Hey. Block it.

856
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,539
Hey.

857
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,710
Okay.

858
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,719
Be careful.

859
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,849
Pass the ball.

860
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,650
Go.

861
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,159
- Hey! - Hey!

862
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,630
Defend.

863
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,940
- Go! - Go!

864
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,980
Ms. Kim, dodge it!

865
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,039
Mr. Son?

866
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,440
It's a relief.

867
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,239
Mr. Son.

868
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:35,979
Mr. Son, are you all right?

869
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,149
Mr. Son. Oh, my gosh.

870
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,609
- Are you okay? - Get him up.

871
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,678
- Should we call the ambulance? - Try getting him up.

872
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,178
Mr. Son, are you okay?

873
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,289
Are you all right?

874
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,619
(Make a bed after waking up!)

875
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,369
It hurts.

876
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,519
Mr. Son.

877
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,559
I know you aren't sleeping.

878
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,400
Mr. Son.

879
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:34,199
Look at me. I want to see if your nose is okay.

880
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:39,869
I'm fine. This is...

881
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,139
nothing.

882
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,880
You don't look fine.

883
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:48,349
What's this? Your cute face has been all wounded.

884
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:08,039
Mr. Son.

885
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:11,809
Are you still going to say you don't like me?

886
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,050
From the beginning,

887
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,989
you were the only one for me.

888
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,429
I love you.

889
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,800
I mean... I love you.

890
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,150
I love you!

891
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:00,219
You don't have to say it many times.

892
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,860
I love you too.

893
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,750
(Teachers Only)

894
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:51,309
My gosh.

895
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,010
Oh, my.

896
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,119
Hello, ma'am.

897
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:09,519
Goodbye.

898
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,300
- Who are you? - Sorry?

899
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:17,000
Me?

900
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,139
I'm Hoo Young's best friend,

901
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,199
Kwon Sang Pil.

902
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,739
I was in the same class with him for three years in high school.

903
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,210
I'm his best friend.

904
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,650
I see.

905
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,980
By the way, where is Hoo Young?

906
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:37,219
Sorry?

907
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:39,789
He was here just now.

908
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,460
But he's not anymore.

909
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,659
I don't know then.

910
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,199
I'll get going.

911
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,570
What are you doing here?

912
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,639
The one who is living here.

913
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,840
I made her cry.

914
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:35,380
Let's go down. You'll catch a cold.

915
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,639
Mom.

916
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:40,579
Have you ever regretted leaving Korea?

917
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,349
No.

918
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,590
Have you ever missed the country?

919
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:47,019
Not even once.

920
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,530
You know what?

921
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,829
When I was tired and weary,

922
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,000
it came to my mind.

923
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:02,900
I don't have a lot of memories,

924
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,070
so it's always the same few moments.

925
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,610
But after thinking about those moments,

926
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:14,480
everything...

927
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,949
became better.

928
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,960
I didn't know the reason back then,

929
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,030
but now that I'm back,

930
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,559
I realized it.

931
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:32,599
I...

932
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,239
was missing this place.

933
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,739
I was missing her.

934
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,250
I miss her.

935
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,489
You go inside first.

936
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,159
See you tomorrow.

937
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,070
(Peter's Pen)

938
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,570
Are you okay?

939
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,239
Why did you run like that? I was going to go to you.

940
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,309
Hoo Young.

941
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:40,759
(Serendipity's Embrace)

942
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,530
(Goblin Tteokbokki)

943
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:50,239
So you're not really going to Europe with me?

944
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,610
I found a company I want to work for.

945
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,308
It's a winter vacation soon.

946
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:57,480
Why do you want to find a job so soon?

947
01:07:57,909 --> 01:07:59,280
I want to work for them so much.

948
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,749
They don't receive resumes.

949
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,719
They review project proposals instead.

950
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,090
I like the name too. "Peter's Pen."

951
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:10,289
My dad said he would pay for the trip for both of us.

952
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,888
I want to go with you.

953
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:13,929
Here.

954
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,600
Send me a lot of pictures. Okay?

955
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,970
- Hello. - Hi.

956
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,340
Why is it so cold?

957
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:26,409
You ordered a lot. This is awesome.

958
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:30,379
Why do you keep calling him?

959
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,379
I didn't. I thought you called him.

960
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,749
Why is that important?

961
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,979
What's important is that we have similar tastes.

962
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,589
It would've been even better with Hoo Young.

963
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,090
Why are you looking for someone who emigrated?

964
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,520
But it does make me sad.

965
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,119
I wish he had graduated with us.

966
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,760
Do you think you're as upset as me?

967
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,130
I'm more upset.

968
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,960
He didn't even say goodbye before he left.

969
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:52,229
"See you tomorrow." Then he fled to the US.

970
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,430
- He did? - Yes.

971
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:54,739
He doesn't even pick up his phone.

972
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,449
What's the matter, Oddball? Why are you crying? What happened?

973
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,420
I'm not crying.

974
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:13,090
Am I crying?

975
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:16,220
It happened many times when I was younger.

976
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,590
Did you make her cry?

977
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,028
How can I make her cry?

978
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,359
I came just now. I didn't even eat a lot of food.

979
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,930
I feel a pain here.

980
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,238
I didn't know the name of the emotion I had.

981
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:30,640
I didn't know the reason either.

982
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:32,109
Do you feel a pain here?

983
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,770
Is it indigestion?

984
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:35,909
You shouldn't have eaten so much.

985
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:37,479
Come on!

986
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,579
Do you want me to get you medicines?

987
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,979
Or do you want to go to a hospital?

988
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:44,449
I don't like hospitals.

989
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,750
I don't...

990
01:09:46,489 --> 01:09:47,520
want to go.

991
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,890
Who made Hong Ju cry?

992
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,658
Don't cry.

993
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:55,899
I thought I didn't know because I was young.

994
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:00,728
But I still have moments like that even when I'm grown up.

995
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,670
(Goblin Tteokbokki)

996
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,710
(Special thanks to Kim Jung Nan for the cameo appearance)

997
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,569
Do you want to eat ramyeon?

998
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,299
I said we would just have ramyeon.

999
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,439
What are you thinking?

1000
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,399
- Hey. - Why? Do you have a headache?

1001
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,810
Ever since he came back, every day felt like some vacation.

1002
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,350
Good morning.

1003
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,350
What are we?

1004
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,350
We both love Hoo Young.

1005
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,220
- Hoo Young? - From now on,

1006
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,060
I'm going to file a lawsuit against you.

1007
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,729
I know it's not an easy decision to make,

1008
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:00,560
but I don't think I can live without you.

1009
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,760
Let's go to the US together.
