(1 missed call: Mom)

11
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,129
(Mom)

12
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,899
Hello?

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,139
I'm near your school. Will you wait?

14
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,269
- No, it's okay. - Is it?

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,609
Then come home quick. I have important news.

16
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,450
What is it?

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,849
We're moving to the US this month.

18
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,290
What about school?

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,989
You can stop going, so don't worry.

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,829
Mom.

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,930
Hoo Young.

22
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,469
Did I ever go back on a decision?

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Come home.

24
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,538
Kang Hoo Young! Stay right where you are.

25
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,969
I'll come over right now.

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,340
Wait.

27
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,060
Lee Hong Ju.

28
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,060
Kang Hoo Young. Wait there.

29
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,990
I'm happy...

30
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,120
that your romance failed.

31
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,139
Sitting down here...

32
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,039
reminds me of the night we fell into the pit.

33
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,909
Stop bringing back the past I want to forget about.

34
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,090
Lee Hong Ju.

35
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,459
Recover quickly...

36
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,470
with your leg injury and your heartache.

37
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,709
Hey.

38
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
Shoot.

39
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,180
Are you out of your mind?

40
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,620
You could've moved away.

41
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,120
I was too surprised to.

42
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,560
Don't pull a prank like that again.

43
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,360
It was never a prank. Not now or ten years ago.

44
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,730
I liked you then, and I like you now.

45
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,579
It took me too long to say that.

46
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,720
Breathe, Hong Ju.

47
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
What?

48
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,970
You. I'll make this very clear.

49
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,769
I didn't like you then, and I don't like you now.

50
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,370
And I won't ever like you.

51
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,438
You can say that about the past,

52
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,180
but don't be so sure of the future.

53
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,279
We're friends.

54
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,779
We even kissed. How are we friends?

55
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,449
Didn't you say you were conservative?

56
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,319
I should go.

57
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,959
Think about it seriously starting now.

58
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,259
If we're just friends and nothing else.

59
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,889
I wonder if Oddball is having fun with Hoo Young.

60
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,000
Did he not see me?

61
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,110
I should return the sneakers.

62
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,109
- Hello. - Hi.

63
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,579
(Vice-Principal's Office)

64
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,819
Mr. Son.

65
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,318
- I... - I have to dash.

66
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,360
Sorry.

67
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,959
Hey. Mr. Son.

68
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,729
(Stay to the right)

69
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,800
Why...

70
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Goodness.

71
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,190
(Teachers Only)

72
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,259
I swear I saw him go this way.

73
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Was I wrong?

74
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,250
(Break Time, Please wait)

75
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,639
Darn it. You scared me.

76
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,240
You should've called out.

77
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,668
Why are you just standing there?

78
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,370
- I did call out. - You did?

79
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,980
Was I too focused?

80
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,279
Give me a pair of goggles.

81
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,750
Get lost. You'll only be in the way.

82
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,149
Do you know how sensitive a task prepping ingredients is?

83
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,590
No. I need to do something right now.

84
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,830
- Hey! - What?

85
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,049
Stop peeling that.

86
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,019
You turned an onion into a head of garlic.

87
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
What?

88
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,460
When did it get that small?

89
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,000
- Kwon Sang Pil. - What?

90
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,169
Why don't you date anyone?

91
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,899
You think it's a choice?

92
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,638
You and Hye Ji...

93
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,779
both ignored me when I asked you to set me up.

94
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,980
That was because we thought you'd be wasted.

95
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,980
I don't care anymore.

96
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,320
Until my restaurant's on track,

97
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,389
I won't date anyone.

98
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,389
Yes.

99
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,799
Yes, what?

100
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,769
What is it? Are you seeing someone?

101
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,440
Get more onions.

102
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,179
I'll peel them all for you.

103
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:12,940
Okay!

104
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,379
Here come the onions.

105
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,128
The person you reached is unavailable.

106
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,500
Transferring to voicemail after the tone.

107
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,899
Why won't he come to work or answer his phone?

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,269
What's he up to?

109
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,278
(No Parking)

110
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,009
She parked her darn car here again.

111
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:52,148
This is madness.

112
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,120
(This Woman)

113
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,960
Hello? Hel...

114
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,559
Bae Hye...

115
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,669
Ms. Bae.

116
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,898
I think I told you...

117
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,240
over a thousand times not to park in front of my building.

118
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,709
I don't think it was over a thousand times.

119
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,378
I don't think that's the point of the issue.

120
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,288
For someone who works with numbers, you tend to exaggerate them.

121
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,949
I don't think I can trust you.

122
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,120
- How is that related to... - And to be exact,

123
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,229
I didn't park in front of this building.

124
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,200
I parked in front of that building.

125
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,100
He allowed me to do so.

126
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,070
Unlike some narrow-minded man.

127
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,669
"Narrow-minded?"

128
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,070
I'm narrow-minded?

129
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,080
I don't believe this.

130
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,548
Why does Ms. Bae...

131
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,809
- always park here? - You're closer to here than there.

132
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,919
- There are other spots. - Move it...

133
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,250
Well,

134
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,019
Ms. Bae wanted for a long time to buy that building.

135
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,059
But three years ago, that man showed up...

136
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,929
- and beat her to it. - I'm narrow-minded?

137
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,129
She never lets go of something she wants.

138
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,929
I see why she has a grudge.

139
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,399
Right?

140
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,799
Then is that why...

141
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,509
Are you doing this...

142
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,710
because I'm your first love and you never got over me?

143
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,149
That's how you feel about me.

144
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,990
You were pathetic back then, but at least...

145
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,590
you were young and cute.

146
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,360
Now...

147
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,090
You're just pathetic.

148
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,960
Please don't pester me anymore.

149
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,029
I'm pathetic? I pester you?

150
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,639
Bae Hye Sook, you're not my first love!

151
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,809
And don't park by my building!

152
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,509
Look at where...

153
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,350
More than half your car's on this side!

154
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,129
I liked you then, and I like you now.

155
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
It took me too long to say that.

156
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,909
Goodness.

157
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,190
Are you happy?

158
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,649
Yes.

159
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm happy and relieved.

160
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,889
I don't think you have time for that.

161
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,729
Why not?

162
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,370
I tried to use the Roem case to extend your stay,

163
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,470
but the head office said no.

164
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,309
Did you talk to your mom?

165
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,809
She won't pick up.

166
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,648
Why don't you fly back?

167
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,778
Sign the project contract...

168
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,018
and set it up.

169
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,148
If you talk it out with your mom,

170
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,049
maybe you can come back...

171
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,519
in the form of a transfer.

172
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,159
How long will that take?

173
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,490
A month?

174
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,529
A month and a half? Two months?

175
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,299
That's why. No.

176
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,769
No? So what if it's a no?

177
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,299
Will you quit or something?

178
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,469
There's no guarantee it'll work out with Oddball.

179
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,210
What's first love anyway that you'd risk everything for it?

180
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,710
Is something wrong, Uncle?

181
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,710
I'm worried for you, okay?

182
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,879
Oh, whatever. Do what you want.

183
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,519
I won't care anymore.

184
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,990
You think this is the love of a century.

185
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,059
You're not the only one with a first love.

186
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,389
I have one too.

187
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,389
What's up with him?

188
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,450
- Min Seok. - Yes?

189
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,378
Did Mr. Son go up to his class?

190
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,850
- No, he's with the vice-principal. - Why?

191
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,889
He's been asking to see Mr. Son a lot today.

192
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,220
- Really? - Yes.

193
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,490
Mr. Son.

194
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,980
I barely got to see you today.

195
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,979
I looked for you everywhere.

196
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,519
I apologize.

197
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,850
The vice-principal asked to see me.

198
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,519
The thing is...

199
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,720
The vice-principal said...

200
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,058
this weekend...

201
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,558
Dad wants to go hiking again?

202
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,900
No, it's not that.

203
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,130
This weekend, he suggested...

204
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,569
a da...

205
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,809
- A da... - What?

206
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,779
A day out with the teachers...

207
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,609
so we could all go hiking.

208
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,180
Isn't it boring to climb the same mountain?

209
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,219
Dad wants to do stuff with you every weekend...

210
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,019
because you're up for anything.

211
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,730
My sister and I appreciated it,

212
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,730
but this is a bit too much.

213
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,059
You should start saying no sometimes.

214
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,028
I'll try.

215
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,099
Good. What do you do tomorrow?

216
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,170
- Me? - Yes.

217
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,539
Why?

218
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,710
We get off after the fourth period.

219
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,608
Let's get something nice to eat. On me.

220
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,879
No, it's fine.

221
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,709
I want to thank you, that's all. No pressure.

222
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,079
No. I didn't do anything to be thanked for.

223
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,589
You helped me out.

224
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,690
If it hadn't been for you,

225
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,689
I'd have become a thick-faced girl...

226
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,619
who interfered in her friend's love life.

227
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,559
Do you have other plans?

228
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,529
No, I don't.

229
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,329
Then your afternoon tomorrow belongs to me.

230
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,670
This is perfect.

234
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,609
There.

235

Who is Carp Head?

236
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,920
I don't know.

237
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,730
I don't even know if he's the guy I used to know.

238
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,430
How am I to tell my boss?

239
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,470
What are you saying? Swallow the food first.

240
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,338
Hey.

241
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,008
I ate meat,

242
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,079
so why do I only taste onions?

243
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,819
Hong Ju. I think your head...

244
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,519
has a few cracks.

245
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,690
- Are you okay? - Hands off.

246
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,289
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,329

Hey.

251
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,899
Why did you call him over?

252
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,538
He's my friend too. Why can't I call...

253
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,599
Hey.

254
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,709
I can't even eat meat in peace because of him.

255
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,740
Wait.

263

264

It's fun to drive this car on the expressway.

371
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,299
Hoo Young.

372
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,400
Let me recline the chair a bit.

373
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,630
Okay.

374
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:25,298
Are you not well?

375
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,939
Don't talk to me right now.

376
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,039
I'm feeling sad. Don't talk to me.

377
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,940
Let me recline a bit more.

378
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
A bit more.

379
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,809
- Love? - Gosh.

380
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,779
Darn love.

381
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,059
What's going on between you two?

382
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,759
One might think there's something going on.

383
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,469
I mean it. You'd better shut your mouth...

384
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,829
before I strike your neck.

385
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,500
Okay. Got it.

386
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,940
Gosh. This is nice.

387
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:17,950
I'll go and buy some drinks and snacks.

388
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,690
Let me come with you.

389
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,589
Hey.

390
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,230
Wait here.

391
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,200
Kwon. Let me go with you!

392
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,170
Hey!

393
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,880
I'll pretend nothing happened yesterday.

394
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,220
Pretend what never happened?

395
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,990
That I kissed you?

396
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,259
Or how I told you I had feelings for you?

397
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,460
All of it.

398
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,559
- I don't want that. - Why not?

399
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,470
We're friends.

400
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,069
I had so much fun when you and I checked out Seoul together.

401
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,469
But look at us now.

402
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,309
It's so awkward and uncomfortable. How could we have any fun together?

403
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,940
I'm having more fun now.

404
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,509
I'm on your mind now.

405
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,618
I like spending time with you while you feel uncomfortable...

406
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,089
because I'm on your mind.

407
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,230
- I'm going to use the restroom. - Let me help you.

408
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,200
Just hold this for me.

409
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,299
- But still. - No.

410
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,369
Stay away.

411
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,799
Goodness.

412
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,349
What's wrong with him, seriously?

413
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,480
Why does he keep saying he likes this?

414
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,720
Fine. Let's have fun.

415
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,258
I'll stop paying attention to Kang Hoo Young.

416
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,259
I'll just have fun.

417
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,369
- Are you okay? - Yes.

418
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,838
I'll drive.

419
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,569
You must have closed the restaurant late last night.

420
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,109
Nice. I was getting tired. This is great.

421
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,349
Are you trying to get us all killed?

422
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,649
I've been driving for ten years.

423
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,119
I can drive even with only my big toe.

424
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,019
Sit in the back.

425
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Fine.

426
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,930
Uncle Wook, sit in the front.

427
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,130
The sun is hurting my eyes!

428
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,769
(Carp Head)

429
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,970
Gosh.

430
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,969
(If you don't answer my calls, I'll kick you out of the project.)

431
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,268
(Lee Hong Ju! Come on. What you did was wrong too.)

432
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,069
I was way too emotional yesterday.

433
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,809
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,709
Let's have a formal meeting...

435
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,250
to talk about what to do with the project.

436
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:32,180
I'll wait for your call.

437
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,289
Can I get some walnut cakes?

438
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:45,359
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm driving.

440
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,269
(Fresh Walnut Cake)

441
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,150
There's only one left.

442
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,319
If you don't grab it, I'll eat it.

443
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,199
Walnut cakes are the best snack to get at the rest stop.

444
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,730
Are there walnut cakes at rest stops in the US?

445
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,570
I don't think so.

446
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,099
- Sausage and rice cake skewers? - What do you think?

447
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:30,610
Then let's eat some more on our way back.

448
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,780
You should eat a lot of them before you go back to the US.

449
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,320
It's the sea!

450
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,349
Kang Hoo Young, there's the sea.

451
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,788
Kwon Sang Pil. Uncle Wook. Get up.

452
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:46,860
- We're almost here. - What?

453
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,388
There's the sea.

454
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,530
- The sea? - Yes.

455
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,730
Where?

456
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,329
Let's go. Uncle Wook!

457
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,099
No. I mean, Mr. Baek. We should go fishing.

458
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,429
- Gosh. - Goodness.

459
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,099
This is very nice.

460
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,468
Very nice.

461
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,539
Really?

462
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,038
You know what?

463
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,079
I'm going to catch a big fish for our dinner.

464
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,880
Let's slice it for sashimi, so we can have a dreamy dinner.

465
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,690
Gosh. This place is nice.

466
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,590
- Gosh. - Goodness. Hey.

467
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,130
Gosh, this is crazy. It faces the ocean!

468
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Hold on.

469
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,730
What's in here?

470
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,539
I see. We can grill meat here later.

471
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,710
What's that?

472
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,780
Sang Pil packed some ingredients for food.

473
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,829
Click.

474
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,869
"It is discipline in the equality of man..."

475
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,570
"for all men are equal before fish."

476
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,480
The 31st US President,

477
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,309
Herbert Hoover.

478
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,550
Bang.

479
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
"Fishing..."

480
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,559
"is all about the heart."

481
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,960
Lee Gyeong Gyu from "The Fishermen and the City."

482
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,268
Gosh. He was dying to have some fun.

483
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,900
Imagine if you didn't come back to Korea.

484
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,570
What?

485
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,510
You should join them and go fishing. I'll sort things out here.

486
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,250
Let's do it together and join them together.

487
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,019
You're on your own.

488
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,360
Gosh.

489
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,969
(Ms. Kim)

490
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,239
Are you there?

491
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,079
Hye Ji.

492
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,480
Come quickly. I desperately need you.

493
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,250
Hang out with Kang Hoo Young.

494
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,250
No. I hate him!

495
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:32,920
You hate him?

496
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,389
I can sense strong affection behind your strong denial.

497
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,030
No.

498
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,529
What about you? You're coming with Mr. Son, right?

499
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,570
Yes.

500
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:45,269
Right. I forgot to mention that we're sleeping over.

501
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,170
Sir.

502
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,510
I'm really grateful that you think highly of me.

503
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,679
But that's not for me.

504
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,579
Gosh, no.

505
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,449
You're the perfect person for it.

506
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,288
I've never been wrong about these things.

507
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,989
Gosh, no. I really can't do it.

508
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,059
Gosh.

509
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Okay.

510
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,530
Fine. I can't force you to do it when you don't want to.

511
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,369
I understand.

512
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,710
All right. Then you should just have a casual date. Okay?

513
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,340
I'll give her your number.

514
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
Come on.

515
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,750
Sir!

516
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,320
What?

517
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,820
Hey, Mr. Son.

518
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,159
Hi.

519
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,400
What are you doing there?

520
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:14,219
What? They didn't catch anything.

521
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,190
- You're here. - Gosh.

522
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,130
Hong Ju, there's a fishing rod next to you.

523
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,360
Let's go and fish at the seawall.

524
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,170
Take Kang Hoo Young with you.

525
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,500
You've never done it before, right?

526
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,800
I've gone fishing a few times with my friends.

527
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,139
Gosh. You know what? As a good friend,

528
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,110
I ought to show him the proper way of fishing. Let's go.

529
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,309
Come on. Let's go.

530
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,550
What are you doing? Take it.

531
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,849
Come on. Grab it.

532
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,158
Okay. We'll be back, Hong Ju.

533
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,360
- Okay. - Let's go.

534
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,090
Bye.

535
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,429
- Keep an eye on him. - Okay.

536
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,380
Wait for me.

537
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,150
Hurry up!

538
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,219
"Peter's Pen will have all the production rights."

539
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm sure you know that the resource management right...

540
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,460
is included in the rights.

541
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm just giving you my opinion.

542
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,999
No good will come out of it...

543
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,599
if Mr. Bang and Ms. Lee work together.

544
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,980
Please change the producer...

545
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,519
for the movie.

546
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,650
Do you know what makes animation interesting?

547
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,719
There are no barriers to imaginations or expressions.

548
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:59,429
From colours, shapes, and even the shapes of the eyes,

549
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,159
every single detail is chosen by the creators.

550
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,969
To execute this, it's imperative...

551
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,699
to deliver this precise world we want to paint...

552
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,940
to everyone involved in the project.

553
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,339
The people who have the best understanding...

554
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,150
of the world of "My Avant-garde Lover" are...

555
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,380
Mr. Bang and Ms. Lee, aren't they?

556
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,449
They are...

557
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,349
the best people for the project.

558
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,619
And Ms. Lee...

559
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,960
is professional,

560
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:32,659
not an amateur who can't separate her private life from work.

561
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,070
I guess my writer isn't professional.

562
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,070
But you can't replace the writer.

563
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,840
Then how about this?

564
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:53,649
This is so random. What do you mean?

565
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,119
Starting next week, work in Mr. Bang's studio.

566
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,118
Why would I do that?

567
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,360
We agreed to finalize the adaptation in a month.

568
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,929
Keep a close working relationship and bring me the best script...

569
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,460
because we're professional.

570
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,429
What? Ms. Bae.

571
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,199
I'm far from being professional.

572
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,869
Ms. Bae.

573
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,670
What did the head office say again?

574
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:19,809
Did they give you an earful again?

575
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,849
Gosh.

576
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:35,719
- What? - What?

577
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,389
What's this?

578
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,559
Did you put glue on your bait?

579
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,460
How come every throw leads to a fish for you?

580
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,829
My client used to be a fishing enthusiast.

581
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,139
I only watched next to him.

582
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,039
Gosh.

583
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,170
You're so annoying. You're good at everything.

584
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,039
Don't worry. I can't clean the fish.

585
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,739
Gosh.

586
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,150
All right.

587
00:42:58,949 --> 00:42:59,980
There.

588
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:01,480
Gosh.

589
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,469
Goodness.

590
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,170
What's the point of catching 100 halibuts?

591
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,509
You can't seem to catch the heart of your first love.

592
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,539
Oh, dear.

593
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,849
You don't have to go back to your fishing enthusiast client?

594
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,319
No.

595
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,179
What did your mom say? Did she say you could do whatever you wanted?

596
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,420
When you told your mom you wanted to run a restaurant,

597
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,360
what did she say?

598
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,130
She told me to try something at least.

599
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,960
She didn't have any expectations of me, to begin with.

600
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,000
You can't understand that...

601
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,670
since you're good at everything. Right?

602
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,869
My mother has no expectations of me either.

603
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,809
She plans what I'm supposed to show her...

604
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,480
before asking me first.

605
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,579
I wonder if this was a part of her plan.

606
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,449
Hey, isn't that Hong Ju's hat?

607
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:14,519
The tide will be coming in soon.

608
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,960
Hong Ju!

609
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,960
Get out!

610
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,630
The tide will be coming in soon. Get out of there!

611
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,230
Hong Ju... Hey!

612
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,599
Hey! Come on!

613
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,829
I wonder if I can catch any.

614
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,639
You need to be careful.

615
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,239
Seriously. I almost fell in.

616
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:03,309
The tide will come in soon.

617
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:04,769
You'll catch a cold if you get wet.

618
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,109
Hey, look at this.

619
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,579
Hurry. Look.

620
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,679
Right here. Can you see?

621
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,948
- What am I looking at? - Right here.

622
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:14,150
Isn't this a sea cucumber?

623
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,650
- So what? - Grab it.

624
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,690
No.

625
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:23,030
We caught a lot of fish, so we don't have to eat that.

626
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:28,000
Hey, fish is one thing. But sea cucumbers are different.

627
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,130
Are you scared?

628
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,070
It's just gross.

629
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,300
I get it. Gross things can be scary.

630
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,969
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

631
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,340
- Hey. - Gosh.

632
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,269
I can touch it.

633
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,029
- What do I do with it? - What do we do? This?

634
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,139
Hong Ju. Here.

635
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,670
- Hey, put it in here. - Gosh.

636
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:11,369
Gosh.

637
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:13,440
Happy now? Let's go.

638
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,780
Is there more?

639
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,379
The tide will come in soon.

640
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,849
I heard we could catch long-legged octopuses here too.

641
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,719
Gosh, long-legged octopuses?

642
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,690
Gosh. The weather is great.

643
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,960
- Right? - Yes.

644
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,429
It's our first time spending time outside school, right?

645
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,968
We were at Mount Bukhan once.

646
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,400
Gosh, that doesn't count.

647
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,468
I just threw on some random clothes that day.

648
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,309
That didn't matter. You still looked beautiful.

649
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,909
I did?

650
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,739
So it was okay that day too.

651
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,679
Excuse me for a moment.

652
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,619
Hey, Hye Seon.

653
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,190
I said I wouldn't go home today.

654
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,860
Dad? I didn't tell him.

655
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:03,388
If he asks about it, please tell him...

656
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,889
that I'm going out with Hong Ju.

657
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,329
What?

658
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:09,969
Whose picture?

659
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,539
Why do you need his picture?

660
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:16,869
Yes.

661
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,210
I see.

662
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,110
Is that so?

663
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,949
I don't have his picture.

664
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,590
I'll get back to you later.

665
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,690
Okay.

666
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,329
By any chance, with my older sister...

667
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,840
So you're going on a blind date with her.

668
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,650
She wants to see your picture.

669
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,250
If there's a good one, send it to me.

670
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,260
No. I'll take a picture of you with the sea in the back.

671
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,190
Well, Ms. Kim.

672
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:12,530
I...

673
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,239
Hey. Go over there.

674
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,119
Did you find it?

675
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,219
It's so big.

676
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,059
Put it in.

677
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,559
- Gosh. - Yes.

678
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,400
- It's here. - There's another one over there?

679
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,308
You're good at this.

680
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,610
Whenever I put my hands into the water, I find one.

681
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,250
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

682
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,730
We should really go now. Everyone left too.

683
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,400
You said you wanted to have a long-legged octopus.

684
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,440
What?

685
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:31,369
Why?

686
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,210
Come here.

687
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,739
It's a long-legged octopus.

688
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,710
- A long-legged octopus? - Yes.

689
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:47,389
You're right. Can I try catching it?

690
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,860
Sure.

691
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,599
Gosh, I think it's really strong. It's completely stuck.

692
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,000
Hold it tight. I'll help you.

693
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,329
Here we go.

694
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:08,139
Sorry. Are you okay?

695
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,690
We missed the long-legged octopus. Let's go now.

696
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,090
You tried to kiss me just now, didn't you?

697
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,360
What are you saying?

698
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,300
- Hong Ju. - I said I didn't!

699
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,039
Where is your hat?

700
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,739
My hat? It's here.

701
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,550
It was here.

702
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,920
Hong Ju!

703
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,559
Go and get them all.

704
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,299
I said I was sorry.

705
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,530
Hong Ju. Stop there, will you?

706
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,230
- I said I was sorry. - Hey!

707
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,549
I told you to mince the garlic,

708
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,090
not juice it.

709
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,889
Ms. Kim.

710
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:06,429
You're here, Oddball.

711
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,429
Yes. I'm here, but what are you doing?

712
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:12,030
I'm preparing dinner.

713
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,039
Stop it! Give it to her.

714
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,840
Let go of it.

715
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,940
- I have four more left. - It's okay. He'll do it.

716
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,409
No. Let go of it. Let's go.

717
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,179
Let's go out for some fresh air.

718
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,550
Gosh.

719
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,760
What's the matter with her?

720
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,960
I don't know.

721
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,360
I've never seen her being so mad after her ex-boyfriend cheated...

722
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:49,769
Well, you wanted to have a great time with your friends.

723
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm sorry I ruined the atmosphere.

724
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,079
She made a fuss. Don't worry about it.

725
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,909
Hoo Young, come here and mince the garlic.

726
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,679
- Is there anything I can help with? - No.

727
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:01,980
Take a rest.

728
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,118
Just dance blues...

729
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,949
with the drunk man over there if you have time.

730
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,119
Okay.

731
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,789
You know how to mince garlic, right?

732
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,190
Yes.

733
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,610
Did you argue with Mr. Son?

734
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:29,480
We're not close enough to argue.

735
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,750
We're not dating.

736
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,320
Did you guys break up already?

737
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,320
No.

738
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,750
We've never been in a relationship.

739
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,689
I lied because I didn't want you...

740
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,260
to push Hoo Young away because of me.

741
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,769
Hey. Don't make that face.

742
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,840
It means my feelings for Hoo Young weren't that serious.

743
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:58,309
I like you much more than him.

744
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:01,909
Me too.

745
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,610
So what happened today?

746
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,119
- I was dumped. - What?

747
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,190
Who dumped who?

748
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,599
So what my father suggested you this time...

749
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:28,639
is going on a blind date, not hiking mountains.

750
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,039
I'm sorry.

751
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,569
Did you say you wanted to meet my sister?

752
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,579
What?

753
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,639
No, I never said so.

754
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,609
I should've made it clearer...

755
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,150
that I don't want to go on a blind date.

756
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,260
I...

757
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,869
will explain it to Mr. Kim and your sister again.

758
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,099
I'm...

759
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,809
truly sorry for making you uncomfortable.

760
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,420
Mr. Son.

761
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,599
Do you want to go out with me?

762
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:37,769
You look so surprised.

763
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,239
I'm sorry.

764
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,179
Well...

765
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,780
Your joke surprised me.

766
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,420
I wasn't joking.

767
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:58,489
You're interested in me too.

768
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:05,570
I've never had such feelings for you.

769
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,469
Not even once.

770
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,539
You haven't?

771
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,289
Stop.

772
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,219
I don't understand.

773
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,690
Why do you suddenly like him?

774
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:33,559
Well...

775
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,928
Actually...

776
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,698
Where is the girl...

777
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:39,429
who said she would like good-looking guys only?

778
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,099
Mr. Son...

779
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,409
has a big chest.

780
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:47,980
Right.

781
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,109
I know he has a big heart.

782
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,679
No. He really has a big chest.

783
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,449
It's firm.

784
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,650
You can tell he's a reliable guy just by looking at him.

785
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:00,090
You fell for him just because of that?

786
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,559
Yes. I like him.

787
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:05,289
I think I like him.

788
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,760
Don't you think...

789
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:11,030
I would know why I want to meet him if I keep meeting him?

790
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,010
So you want to start dating him that easily?

791
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,670
There's nothing complicated about it.

792
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,039
At the end of the day, dating is one person meeting another person.

793
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,050
But why was I rejected?

794
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,750
I really had a good feeling this time.

795
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,519
What is that?

796
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,489
Gosh, you surely know when we're going to eat.

797
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,230
Yes.

798
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,299
Oh, my gosh. This is nice.

799
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,399
Yes.

800
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,129
- Thank you for inviting me. - No worries.

801
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,170
Have a drink.

802
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,869
- Do you drink a lot? - No, I don't.

803
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,269
Aren't you afraid?

804
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,809
You might lose everything,

805
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,539
including the good relationship with him, memories, and even him.

806
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,179
I'm afraid.

807
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,510
But...

808
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,510
I should try despite everything.

809
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,190
Despite everything.

810
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:21,769
That's my seat.

811
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,440
- Sit somewhere else. - You always do whatever you want.

812
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,159
You must be hungry.

813
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:47,729
Since everyone is here, shall we start eating?

814
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,800
Wait. We should take a picture.

815
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,739
Here.

816
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:56,739
You won't be in the picture if you do that.

817
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,170
Okay.

818
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:00,909
Okay. Just a little closer.

819
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,908
Despite everything...

820
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:05,610
I'll take a picture. In 1, 2, 3.

821
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,719
In 1, 2, 3.

822
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,788
- One more time. - I hope...

823
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:13,219
our relationship changes.

824
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:15,489
It looks good.

825
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,288
- Can I eat now? - Yes.

826
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:19,859
I can't believe I have to stay with you guys on a nice day like this.

827
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,558
- Come on. - What are you talking about?

828
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,698
We're hanging out with you because you broke up with your girlfriend.

829
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:26,300
Leave him be. He will start dating another woman soon.

830
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:27,899
He's addicted to dating.

831
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,569
Gosh, we could've had octopus soup...

832
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,408
if we had caught a long-legged octopus earlier, right?

833
00:59:31,409 --> 00:59:33,340
Do you think that's the only thing we can't eat?

834
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,238
- Thank you for the food. - Cheers!

835
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,249
Cheers!

836
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,649
For everyone's love!

837
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,119
Cheers!

838
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,090
Don't eat with them.

839
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,289
Right.

840
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,059
We're gathered here. Is there anything fun for us to do?

841
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,659
I'm not sure.

842
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,500
- No, thank you! - No, thank you!

843
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:00,699
We tried to win stuffed animals in claw machines many times.

844
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,939
Oh, gosh.

845
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,908
How about we play hide-and-seek?

846
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:05,110
I'll get going.

847
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:06,710
Stay at home.

848
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:08,280
Can I go with you?

849
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,038
No.

850
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,980
Then let's play hide-and-seek.

851
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,489
Mom.

852
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,860
I want to go with you.

853
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:33,000
Mom.

854
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:34,800
Mom.

855
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:38,710
Mom...

856
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,179
Aunt.

857
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,079
Aunt!

858
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,488
When can I see my cousin?

859
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:56,389
Later. Much later.

860
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,199
Aunt. Wait for me.

861
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,550
Aunt.

862
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,230
Jun Ho.

863
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,860
Talk with me.

864
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,199
Jun Ho.

865
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,650
Hey, you jerk!

866
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,489
Don't ever show up in my dreams.

867
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,889
Starting from today, you're not allowed to appear in my dreams.

868
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,030
Okay. Cut.

869
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,039
Why are you in my dream?

870
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:16,500
Because I'm happy...

871
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:18,610
that your romance is ruined.

872
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,539
Shut it.

873
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,489
Are you going somewhere?

874
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,349
I should go back.

875
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,489
You won't hold me back.

876
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,469
Should I really go?

877
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,280
He's going to leave anyway. Why did he ask?

878
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,289
Wake up, Hye Ji. We're supposed to make breakfast.

879
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,239
Hye Ji.

880
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,309
Did she go somewhere?

881
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,440
Sang Pil. Are you guys up?

882
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,029
You stayed up late with us...

883
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,969
even though you didn't drink.

884
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,400
I'm worried you might've not had a good time.

885
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,670
No, I had fun thanks to you.

886
01:03:57,139 --> 01:03:58,539
I liked your friends too.

887
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,340
I enjoyed it.

888
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,440
I'm glad to hear that.

889
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,150
I also had a great time.

890
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,449
We should hang out often.

891
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,760
Gosh.

892
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,789
My head keeps ringing.

893
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:19,960
Your head is ringing?

894
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,929
You can't tolerate alcohol well anymore.

895
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,969
You're different from the old Kwon Sang Pil.

896
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:27,469
That is not what I want to hear from you.

897
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,400
Would you like to drink this?

898
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,670
- No? - My head hurts so much.

899
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,408
It's vibrating.

900
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:38,908
- Hey. - Yes.

901
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:39,980
Here.

902
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:42,049
- Is this mine? - Yes.

903
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,550
Hello, this is Baek Wook.

904
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:51,828
What? What did you say?

905
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:53,689
You can't get up so suddenly.

906
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,429
I've never heard of it.

907
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,429
Sis.

908
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Do Seon.

909
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:03,170
What was that? Did something happen?

910
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:05,409
Speed up.

911
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:07,908
- Sorry? - Let's go back quickly.

912
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:09,239
I got you.

913
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,090
(Ms. Kim)

914
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:20,389
Where is everyone?

915
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,789
They won't pick up their phones.

916
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:31,599
You're here.

917
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,139
Where did you go? Why did you not pick up your phone?

918
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:38,969
Sorry. I left my phone.

919
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,880
What about the other guys?

920
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,480
They went back to Seoul.

921
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,409
Let's go inside. I got coffee and scones.

922
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,150
They went to Seoul?

923
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,449
They should go to work.

924
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,880
What about us?

925
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,590
We have time.

926
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:53,590
You said it was your day off.

927
01:05:57,789 --> 01:05:58,829
You might bump into it.

928
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,329
Let's have breakfast after checking out.

929
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,900
There's a famous grilled fish restaurant near here.

930
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,019
Should I really go?

931
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:26,289
Don't go.

932
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:36,760
I don't want you to go back to the US.

933
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:48,940
I'm not going.

934
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,719
Don't take it back.

935
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,199
(Caution: Hot Beverage)

936
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:57,550
(Serendipity's Embrace)

937
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:07,789
Jun Ho. Talk with me.

938
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,960
Jun Ho.

939
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:14,260
I'll make sure to come back after writing a great novel.

940
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,470
Please...

941
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,500
wait just a little bit, Hong Ju.

942
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:52,699
Does love change?

943
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,399
Or is it the people that change?

944
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:08,250
(Special thanks to Kim Jung Nan for the cameo appearance)

945
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,039
I don't know when it started.

946
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,809
I just found myself waiting for you to call my name.

947
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,949
What are you guys doing? Keep going.

948
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:41,119
What do I do?

949
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:43,250
You haven't changed.

950
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,850
I could recognize you right away.

951
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:46,550
It was my decision.

952
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:48,260
It has nothing to do with Hong Ju.

953
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:50,319
Hong Ju.

954
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,260
I was very sick.

955
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:55,060
It's not your concern.

956
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,529
I saw how you cried because of that jerk.

957
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:00,670
How can I not be concerned about him?
