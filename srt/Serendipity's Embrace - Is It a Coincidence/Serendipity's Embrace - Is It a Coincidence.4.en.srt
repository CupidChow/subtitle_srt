(Serendipity's Embrace)

7
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,479
I'm okay.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,850
I wasn't hit by a car. I tripped as I was dodging.

9
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,149
Why did they call you?

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,920
Anyway, you must be busy. I'm sorry. I'll take it from here.

11
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:49,718
Hong Ju.

12
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,459
I'm really fine. You can go.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,289
Stop telling me to go. I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,829
Hey. There's no need to get worked up.

15
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,770
I didn't want to bother you for nothing.

16
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,969
"Nothing?"

17
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:24,719
Do you still think it's nothing?

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Excuse me.

19
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm the one who should listen to people's heartbeat here.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Oh, yes.

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,040
Doctor.

22
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,180
Please listen after he leaves.

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,219
I was very shocked because of the accident.

24
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,060
(Obok Hospital)

25
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,650
Why did he do that all of a sudden?

26
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,319
He was speaking rudely yesterday.

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,259
Was it because he was sorry?

28
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,969
No way.

29
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,770
Hong Ju, that's a foolish delusion.

30
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,009
You're Hye Ji's friend. I'm warning you for being like this.

31
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,550
My gosh.

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,119
(Caution, MRI Scan Room)

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,719
Ma'am, don't move your head.

34
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,819
Okay. I'm sorry.

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,400
Mr. Kim.

36
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,068
Yes, Ms. Kim.

37
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,299
Please give a closing message to my class.

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,900
Why? What's the matter?

39
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,409
Hong Ju got into a car accident. She's in a hospital.

40
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,139
What? Was she hurt badly?

41
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,008
Where is the hospital? I'll get going.

42
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,978
You said you had plans this evening, Dad.

43
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,089
Hong Ju woke up and is getting a check-up now.

44
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,520
How did she get into an accident?

45
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,060
The aftereffects of a car accident are so terrifying.

46
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,830
- Mr. Son. - Yes.

47
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,698
- Did you bring your car? - Yes, I did.

48
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,930
Then please go to a hospital with Ms. Kim.

49
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,900
One of our graduates got into an accident...

50
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,270
- and was sent to a hospital. - Oh, my.

51
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,038
No, Mr. Son. I can go by myself.

52
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,079
Hey, what's important about a car accident...

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,509
is that you should take care of the aftermath properly.

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,180
If it's just two girls, they might look down on you and ignore you.

55
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,949
Mr. Kim.

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,819
We're not girls. We're grown women.

57
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,250
Please go to my class and wrap up the day for my students.

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,689
You don't need to worry, Mr. Son.

59
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,830
What?

60
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,459
It's not like they've handled the aftermath of a car accident before.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,670
Let me drive you there.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,149
Oh, yes.

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,589
I called you just a while ago.

64
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,089
The security room?

65
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,060
Yes. Thank you. Okay.

66
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,930
Why did he abandon the suitcase...

67
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,170
and come to a hospital all of a sudden?

68
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,319
Ms. Kim!

69
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,529
Oh, gosh. I'm saved.

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,730
You saved my life again, Mr...

71
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,939
Where did he go?

72
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,709
Change into sneakers.

73
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,620
They won't be too big if I tie the shoelaces.

74
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,290
I washed them. They're clean.

75
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,800
They're big,

76
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,870
but thank you.

77
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,439
I'll call you after parking the car.

78
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,209
Okay. Call me.

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,709
Mr. Baek.

80
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,949
Ms. Kim.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,689
Please stay in the waiting room until I call her name.

82
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Okay. Thank you.

83
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,129
(Obok Hospital)

84
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,339
Anyway, thank you, Hoo Young.

85
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,100
You must be sorry for what you said yesterday.

86
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,170
I accept your apology.

87
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,040
You can take care of your friend in the hospital now.

88
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,040
Why would you come up with the reason for me?

89
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,278
Will you keep... Oh, gosh.

90
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,420
Look to the front.

91
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,620
Make sure to tell the doctor that your neck hurts.

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,198
Is she all right? Where is she?

93
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,268
He said there were no major issues, and they're coming to the lobby.

94
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,008
She should just be hospitalized.

95
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,278
I know.

96
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,578
But you know she hates hospitals.

97
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,649
My goodness.

98
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,120
Mr. Baek.

99
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,750
You knew it, didn't you?

100
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,318
I know she hates it when they call for a guardian in a hospital.

101
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,360
But she has guardians, including me and you.

102
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,159
Not that.

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,329
What, then?

104
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,360
Hoo Young likes her.

105
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,069
Honestly, I didn't know he liked her this much.

106
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,969
I think he's never been so reckless...

107
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,509
in his life. My gosh.

108
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,910
He's so reckless.

109
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,149
Mr. Baek.

110
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,980
Would you like to be on the same side as me?

111
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,990
Is Hye Ji here?

112
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,959
- I said we were coming down. - I see.

113
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,990
Did you have fun with Hye Ji yesterday?

114
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,499
There are so many guys who like her.

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,930
It's an honour for you.

116
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,170
Hong Ju.

117
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,939
Hye Ji and I...

118
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,240
I should keep pretending to know nothing about this too, right?

119
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:14,929
This is crazy.

120
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,259
Why?

121
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,159
No. It's nothing.

122
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,919
Hoo Young. Let's talk for a moment.

123
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,759
I have a favour to ask.

124
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,200
Please don't take it too personally.

125
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,070
Do you want me to leave again?

126
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,139
Stop flirting with me.

127
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,440
Stop doing what?

128
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,779
It might be because you lived in the US. It became your habit.

129
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,179
But people might misunderstand your behaviour.

130
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Of course, I'm not saying I misunderstood you.

131
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,689
It's just that I'm quite conservative...

132
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,250
and it makes me very uncomfortable.

133
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,759
Hey.

134
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,330
So please be careful.

135
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,899
Hye Ji.

136
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,870
Oddball.

137
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
"Flirting?"

138
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,139
"Flirting?"

139
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,009
Oddball.

140
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,710
You look like a mess.

141
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,950
It's not a minor accident.

142
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,809
You're even wearing a cast.

143
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,620
Hye Ji, why did you come only now?

144
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,320
The car ran into me.

146
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,989
A car as big as this ran into me at full speed.

147
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,090
I avoided it like this, but I had serious leg cramps.

148
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,730
Look at my forehead too.

149
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,460
It hurt so much. Look.

150
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,799
Which jerk scratched my best friend's forehead?

151
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,100
Who drives like that?

152
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,240
It was so scary.

153
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,610
Oh, my. It must've been so painful.

154
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,379
Gosh.

155
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,809
Hoo Young!

156
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,080
It's Uncle Wook.

157
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,149
Uncle.

158
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,289
Why did you abandon your suitcase?

159
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,788
It's okay. Wash it with hydrogen peroxide.

160
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,089
- It will become clean. - I was busy flirting.

161
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,090
This is driving me crazy.

162
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,559
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

163
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,230
It hurts.

164
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,799
Where is that jerk? Did they run?

165
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,470
Gosh.

166
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,480
By the way, why did you call Hoo Young?

167
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,419
I had no choice. I couldn't go right away because of class.

168
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,950
You could've called Sang Pil.

169
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,690
I don't know. Hoo Young just popped into my mind at that moment.

170
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,129
My goodness.

171
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,330
Anyway, I'm done being your Cupid.

172
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,929
You guys meet on your own from now on.

173
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,059
Well...

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,970
The thing is...

175
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,879
Kyung Taek.

176
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,820
Kyung Taek.

177
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,789
What's going on?

178
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,529
I wasn't going to tell you like this.

179
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,659
But I'm...

180
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,000
dating him.

181
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,129
What?

182
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,470
I mean...

183
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,340
What about Hoo Young?

184
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,808
Why do you ask?

185
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,179
He's my first love. That's all.

186
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,649
Kyung Taek likes me very much.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,220
Right?

188
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,090
Yes, I do.

189
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,100
I've been liking her very much for a long time.

190
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,058
I went on a blind date to hide it.

191
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,230
I'm so sorry, Hong Ju.

192
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry for what he did.

193
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,970
No.

194
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,169
You don't have to apologize to me.

195
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,610
I told Hoo Young yesterday. He knows.

196
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,678
I was also going to tell you yesterday,

197
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,048
but you just left.

198
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,919
- I want you to congratulate me. - Congratulate you on what?

199
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,789
Let's talk on our way.

200
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,759
Isn't it more convenient for you to get in his car?

201
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,928
No.

202
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,529
Hoo Young, you said you were going home, right?

203
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,729
Yes. Why?

204
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,628
Please let my Oddball stay in your place then.

205
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:46,729
She can't get up and down the rooftop...

206
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,798
with her legs in this state.

207
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,529
Your place has many rooms.

208
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,139
- Hye Ji. - It's a good idea.

209
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,909
I was worried about leaving you alone. It's a good idea.

210
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,209
Go to his place and take a rest.

211
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,679
Why are you guys acting like this? I can take care of myself.

212
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,148
Uncle Wook, let me go home quickly.

213
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,648
I'm tired just standing like this.

214
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,119
Okay. Let's go. Get in the car quickly.

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Mr. Baek.

216
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,590
Didn't you say you should go back to your office?

217
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,919
We're going to school. We can drive you to your office.

218
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,028
It would be inconvenient to stop by his place.

219
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,860
Why would it be inconvenient? It's right over...

220
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,229
I have something urgent at work, so I think I should head back first.

221
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,729
Hoo Young, take care of Oddball.

222
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,398
Oddball, you take care of your body.

223
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,798
I'll buy you meat later.

224
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,038
We'll get going. Let's go.

225
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,069
- What? - Let's go.

226
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,070
Uncle Wook.

227
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,940
Oddball, this is an important moment. Good luck.

228
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
I mean...

229
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,649
Bye.

230
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,449
- Hey. - Travel safely.

231
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,820
Hey, take good care of your body. All right?

232
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,029
What's up with everyone?

233
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,100
Let's go home.

234
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,899
I'm so uncomfortable with him.

235
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,080
- Gosh. - Let's go.

236
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,639
It seems like an important call. Why don't you pick it up?

237
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:46,580
The vibration is so loud that I woke up.

238
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,220
Yes, Ms. Bae. How was the meeting?

239
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,240
Do you like her that much?

240
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,769
Congratulations.

241
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,110
Sorry?

242
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,450
Yes, I like her very much.

243
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,379
Mr. Son, you can stop now.

244
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,789
We're not dating at all.

245
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,629
I'm sorry. You were perplexed, right?

246
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,090
No, I wasn't.

247
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,129
I tried my best.

248
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,429
But I don't think she would believe that I'm your boyfriend.

249
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,299
Well, I believed it.

250
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,970
What you believe doesn't matter.

251
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,210
I mean...

252
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,340
What's this?

253
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,378
You said you wanted to help Hoo Young and Oddball date.

254
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,710
Why did you lie that you guys were dating?

255
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,990
Ms. Kim lied so that your nephew doesn't misunderstand...

256
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,789
that something is going on between Hong Ju and me.

257
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,259
I went on a blind date with her.

258
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,700
Hong Ju and who?

259
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,430
Me.

260
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,299
You...

261
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,369
Wait.

262
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,309
So he's the one?

263
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes.

264
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,079
You totally got me.

265
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,250
I really thought you liked Ms. Kim.

266
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,220
You're a good actor.

267
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,349
- You're a good actor. My gosh. - I got it, Uncle Wook.

268
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,139
I sent the version revised by the design team...

269
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,509
to the director.

270
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,609
No. Of course, I'll take care of it until the end.

271
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,579
The new project is just starting its planning stages, so it's fine.

272
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,819
Since I can't go today, I'll go next week.

273
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,089
Yes.

274
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,149
I can still check it,

275
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,720
so please send me the edited version.

276
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Okay.

277
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,200
(Watch "My Home, My Mother.")

278
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,809
(Mother)

279
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,849
(Decline)

280
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,549
Pick it up if you need to.

281
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,319
I'm done with my call now.

282
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,558
It's not urgent.

283
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
I was supposed to attend a meeting,

284
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,829
but everyone was concerned because they couldn't reach me.

285
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,460
Do you not play hooky anymore?

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
How can I play hooky when it's my job?

287
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,130
You used to play hooky a lot.

288
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,299
You played hooky and stayed up all night with me.

289
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,740
When did we do that?

290
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,710
You're making things up.

291
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,079
Don't you remember?

292
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,710
The day we went to Cheorwon.

293
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,579
I'm not sleeping with you.

294
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,150
I never said that.

295
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,719
Of course, we'll sleep in separate rooms.

296
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,088
(November 14, 2013, 9:10pm)

297
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,489
(Reed field in Gangpo-ri, Cheorwon)

298
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,558
Let's go to the main street to hail a cab.

299
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,160
We can take a cab to go to the bus terminal.

300
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,400
So you do know how to think with your brain.

301
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,470
I wonder how well your brain works for you to be here right now.

302
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,589
Today, I wanted to show you what true love is.

303
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,230
But the timing was bad.

304
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,029
We should meet again when Jun Ho is discharged from the military.

305
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,869
I'll make sure to show you our love then.

306
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,740
Hoo Young?

307
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:08,680
Hey.

308
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,920
Where are you?

309
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,789
This is not funny. Come out.

310
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,390
Hong Ju.

311
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Hoo Young.

312
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,579
Hey, why are you in there?

313
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,479
(Caution: Fall Hazard)

314
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
It's too muddy.

315
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,979
I don't think I can go up on my own.

316
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,819
Do you see a strap or a stick around you?

317
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,230
Hey, look at you.

318
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,799
Are you dumb?

319
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,630
Will you keep laughing?

320
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,710
I'll try to find something useful.

321
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,690
Darn it.

322
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,869
I will never...

323
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,140
get into anything with you again.

324
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,480
(Caution: Fall Hazard)

325
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,589
Hong Ju?

326
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,759
Hong Ju.

327
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,900
Hong Ju!

328
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,099
What?

329
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,740
Hurry up and find something.

330
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,970
I'm searching.

331
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,079
- Hong Ju. - What now?

332
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,279
Don't leave me behind.

333
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,750
I've been trying not to do it since earlier.

334
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,099
My gosh.

335
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,539
(Caution: Fall Hazard)

336
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,440
(30 minutes later)

337
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:54,579
Hong Ju.

338
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,380
Are you dumb?

339
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,779
Did you...

340
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,750
Did you think you could pull someone up with this?

341
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,220
They say a drowning man will grasp at straws.

342
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,559
That means they'll do anything including something pointless.

343
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,259
Does it?

344
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,430
"Does it?"

345
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,799
What are you doing down here anyway?

346
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,230
You even left your bag and phone up there.

347
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,769
Only someone stupid would think of jumping in.

348
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,539
Yes, I'm stupid.

349
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,679
I'm so stupid...

350
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,779
I couldn't think of what to do, okay?

351
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,680
I called, and you didn't answer,

352
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,680
and I thought you were drowning or something.

353
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,890
- Pull. - Climb higher.

354
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,359
Keep pulling.

355
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,460
Hey.

356
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,170
(Safety First)

357
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,210
Kang Hoo Young.

358
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,980
Are you okay?

359
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,609
Are you okay?

360
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:05,880
Hey!

361
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,049
Oh, no.

362
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Kang Hoo Young.

363
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,059
Kang Hoo Young!

364
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,900
You should've called for help first.

365
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,839
I know that.

366
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,769
I know I'm stupid, and I don't think.

367
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,240
I didn't say you didn't think.

368
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,210
Hey, is your head okay?

369
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:39,950
Yes, it's okay.

370
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,750
What about you? Were you hurt?

371
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,420
No.

372
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,328
We don't have to worry.

373
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,559
The ground is firm. It's not a swamp.

374
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,900
What if it were a swamp?

375
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,470
Why worry what if it were when it's not?

376
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,269
Aren't you scared of being in a place like this?

377
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,640
Why would I be when you're here too?

378
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,180
It was worse trying to look for something to save you with.

379
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,078
A frog screamed right into my year.

380
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,880
Ribbit, ribbit.

381
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,990
Why would you be scared of a frog?

382
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,509
What a chicken.

383
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,720
You must remember.

384
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,989
We climbed out after sunrise...

385
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,390
when the soldiers found us.

386
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,859
You trembled in fear all night.

387
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,329
I did not.

388
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,000
I just remembered everything.

389
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,899
You meant to go somewhere else that day.

390
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,339
Where was it?

391
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,640
- Seoul National University. - Yes, there.

392
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,609
Why were you going to go there?

393
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,509
- For an interview. - Right, an interview.

394
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,210
An interview? What interview?

395
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,779
An interview on since when, why, and how...

396
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,519
I got so good at math.

397
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:25,819
I see.

398
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,490
So that happened.

399
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,660
I'd forgotten completely.

400
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,130
How could you forget that?

401
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,069
I forget bad memories easily.

402
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,839
Was that day a bad memory to you?

403
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,680
Everything related to Bang Jun Ho is bad.

404
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,910
How is that related to Bang Jun Ho?

405
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,980
That memory was about us.

406
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,220
Don't.

407
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,019
I can manage.

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,160
Is that flirting too?

409
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,259
I know you mean to help, but I'm fine.

410
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,170
I should be able to manage on my own.

411
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,829
I can't rely on your help.

412
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,980
It's okay to let me help when I'm around.

413
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,220
I guess so?

414
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,089
Thanks, anyway.

415
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:08,289
I'll make it up to you with a fried chicken voucher.

416
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,049
You're going to climb the stairs like that?

417
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,450
You bet.

418
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,619
- Do you want a piggyback? - Forget it.

419
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,359
Should I carry you instead?

420
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,029
Shut your mouth before I...

421
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,019
Nice catch.

422
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,789
Oh, dear.

423
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,559
Thanks for sparing me.

424
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:23,298
I'll spend my second life to eat more...

425
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,670
and play more.

426
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,140
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

427
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,509
Three fried chicken vouchers.

428
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,480
Who says fried chicken will cut it?

429
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,919
Give me the prescription. I'll get your medicine.

430
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,750
Leave it. I'll get it myself tomorrow.

431
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,190
The prescription.

432
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:01,699
What do you want for dinner?

433
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,339
No, I'm fine.

434
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,838
I'll leave after a short break.

435
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,710
Don't you dare say "I'm fine" again.

436
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,410
Rest up while I get some groceries.

437
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,519
What's up with him?

438
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,089
Oh, I don't know. I'm starving.

439
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,359
I'm so hungry I feel nauseous.

440
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,529
Goodness.

441
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:40,809
What a lovely sight.

442
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,809
You're looking after each other until the end.

443
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,279
How about a toast?

444
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,879
Good job today.

445
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,189
(Grilling Meat Again Today)

446
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,420
What a weird combination this is.

447
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,788
Kim Hye Ji,

448
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,859
Hong Ju's landlord minus Hong Ju...

449
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,559
Who's he?

450
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,258
He's...

451
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,598
Oddball's blind date...

452
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,429
and Ms. Kim's boyfriend for the day.

453
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,470
Well...

454
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,568
Oh, you're into weird chicks, bro.

455
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,768
I'll move my clothes.

456
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,269
He's not your bro. He's a teacher.

457
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,808
A teacher?

458
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,380
I'm Son Kyung Taek. I teach PE at Obok High School.

459
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,079
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

460
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,879
May I pour you a shot of soju?

461
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,049
Yes, sure.

462
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,990
He deserves a new introduction.

463
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,789
I know the landlord. Why?

464
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,420
He's Kang Hoo Young's uncle.

465
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:29,589
What?

466
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,900
No way. They don't look alike at all.

467
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,470
Mr. Kwon.

468
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,399
That hurts.

469
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,269
We do look alike. Look carefully.

470
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,009
Hey.

471
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,509
- You do look alike. - Right?

472
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,379
- With Hoo Young's mom. - Darn you.

473
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,548
I'm his mom's brother,

474
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,379
- so that would be true. - How strange.

475
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,848
- But Hoo Young and I... - No.

476
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,818
- have the same nose and mouth. - We all live in Obok-dong.

477
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,288
Then Kang Hoo Young's staying at...

478
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,419
The house right below Oddball.

479
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,519
What? Are they shooting a melodrama?

480
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,160
They parted suddenly in high school...

481
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,900
only for a fateful reunion...

482
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,200
Sit.

483
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,940
You knew.

484
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,880
Then you should've told me Hoo Young liked Oddball.

485
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,910
Hey.

486
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,649
How could I tell you something...

487
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,980
Hoo Young hadn't told anyone himself?

488
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,079
I did what was right and loyal.

489
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,250
You were too slow to pick up on it.

490
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,019
Even a passing dog would notice now.

491
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,119
Hey, give me your glass.

492
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,730
Forget your first love.

493
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,329
You and Hoo Young were never meant to be.

494
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:43,099
Hey.

495
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,170
Wait.

496
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,039
Ms. Kim's first love is Hoo Young?

497
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,440
- Yes. - For real?

498
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Yes.

499
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:56,809
Why don't you act loyal or do right by me?

500
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,750
Mr. Son, is the meat...

501
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,048
to your liking?

502
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,819
Yes. It's delicious.

503
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,220
That's good to hear.

504
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,059
Back in high school.

505
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:12,160
Hoo Young was my first love,

506
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,930
and he told me my best friend is his first love.

507
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:17,670
But so what?

508
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,700
This was never a secret,

509
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,299
and I got over it just fine.

510
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,470
I even pretended to be dating Mr. Son.

511
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,480
The rest is up to them.

512
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,109
- Right? - Yes.

513
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,720
It's okay. It's fine.

514
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,480
Darn you.

515
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,029
Why did you go and do that?

516
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,240
What?

517
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,069
Oh, that?

518
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,309
Because Hong Ju graduated from Obok High too.

519
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,450
That school serves their students for so many years.

520
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,090
I wonder if Hoo Young is taking good care of Oddball.

521
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,239
You're back.

522
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,070
What's for dinner?

523
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,539
You.

524
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,409
You're crazy, Hong Ju.

525
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,750
Get out of me, you evil spirit.

526
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,489
Is sexual frustration this scary?

527
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,730
I should go home.

528
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,329
I have chills.

529
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,320
Would it be easier to crawl?

530
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,130
Okay.

531
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,309
You really don't listen.

532
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,659
Are you Kang Hoo Young?

533
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:29,928
What do you mean?

534
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,389
Evil spirit or Hoo Young, whatever you are,

535
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,599
don't mind me and go on your way.

536
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,199
What's going on?

537
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,139
What are you doing? Put me down.

538
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,280
Move and we'll both fall.

539
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,460
Wait here for a bit.

540
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,280
(Porridge)

541
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,289
I found a porridge place, so I got you some.

542
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,659
You had a bad scare, so get some rest.

543
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,960
And take your medicine.

544
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,559
See you in the morning.

545
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,559
Hoo Young.

546
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,039
Thanks.

547
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,340
Sure.

548
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,539
You're such a good guy.

549
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,550
I guess my memories of you were twisted.

550
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,320
But then,

551
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,150
we never were that close in school.

552
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,460
I'd have forgotten you if it hadn't been for Hye Ji.

553
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,420
You too, right?

554
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,900
To be honest, we're Friend Three to each other, aren't we?

555
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,239
Call me when you're up. See you.

556
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:35,420
Was he offended?

557
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,090
No. That's his fault.

558
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,360
Why would he get flirty?

559
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,530
What are you doing? Put me down.

560
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,860
- Move and we'll both fall. - See?

561
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,570
He crossed the line first.

562
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,679
Get lost.

563
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,010

How many times can she dump me before I even tell her?

569
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Hey. Aren't you supposed to be on the plane right now?

570
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,869
Why are you still in Korea?

571
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,469
When will you be back?

572
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
I'll be there.

573
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,039
Get over here now.

574
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,349
I'm not asking for a favour. I'm demanding as a client.

Well, you know...

582
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,940
I was wondering if that was my seat.

583
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,510
I thought you were going to say you'd fallen for me at first sight,

584
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,549
or if I were free after school,

585
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,880
or something like that. It's a shame you didn't.

586

- Put the chair over here. - Okay.

591
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,960
I'd like this to be the backdrop for the interview.

592
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,869
Mr. Bang can sit here, and I'll sit here.

593
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:05,969
Sounds good.

You didn't have to come.

596

You said you worked all night.

597
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:28,059
I said I'd be your stylist for the day.

598
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,489
You look pretty good.

599
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,530

No.

It's Mr. Bang the writer's first interview after winning.

605
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:48,539
I have to be here.

606

Plus, if you have someone...

607
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,250
in your corner, it's extra reassuring.

608
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,519
Yes.

609
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,589

Hey.

611
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:03,260
Mr. Bang. Will you sit down?

612
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,529
Okay.

613
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,099
Do your best. Good luck.

614
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,400
Thanks.

615
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,969
What did you do first after learning...

616
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,900
you'd won the award?

617
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,409
What did I do first?

618
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,849
I called an acquaintance who always reads my works first.

619
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,119
I see.

620
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,690
Who is that acquaintance?

621
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,329
Oh, dear.

622
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,429
My trusted number one fan who loved everything...

623
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,199
I ever wrote.

624
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,639
My rough and ragged stories that just entered the world...

625
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,880
slowly became refined with each expression...

626
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,079
that person made.

627
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:01,719
That person helped me a lot this time as well.

628
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,349
When I called and said I'd won the Young Writer Award,

629
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:06,960
they burst into tears.

630
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,130
I was the one who wanted to cry.

631
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,699
I couldn't because I had to console them.

632
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,130
Gosh.

633
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,869
- Thanks so much for today. - Not at all.

634
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,239
- Thank you. - Good job.

635
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,408

That's what you ask first when I just negotiated a deal?

651
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,610
She didn't answer her phone all day today.

652
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,110
Does she really not want to work with me?

653
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,280
If you'd told her the truth back then,

654
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,678
she wouldn't have cried,

655
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,219
and you'd be fine and all would be well.

656
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:50,449

657
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:54,119
That I had panic attacks and couldn't write a word?

658
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,329
That countless breaches of contracts had left me penniless?

659
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,828
She thinks I'm the best writer in the world.

660
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:02,929
How could I tell her the truth?

661
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,630
Don't people who truly love each other...

00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,039
stay together when one of them hits rock bottom?

663
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,809
I didn't want to drag her down just to stay with me.

664
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,880
Of course, not.

665
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:23,389

If the secret is lame, you get a finger flick.

681

693
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,760

You're not getting away with it. Spill.

696
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,710

You really are a genius.

698
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,630
I got one question wrong.

699
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,659
I was once ranked last in the whole school.

700
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,230
That time, I went with number two...

701
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:53,599
for all of my answers on the English exam.

702
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,099
But none of the answers was number two. I'm not lying.

703
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,968
I went to the English teacher to complain...

704
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,309
how it could be possible.

705
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:02,139
There were 40 questions and had 5 multiple choices.

706
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,579
Shouldn't each choice be correct at least for eight questions?

707
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,479
Are you surprised? Are you shocked?

708
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,489
Yes.

709
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,319
I'm also shocked by that ridiculous reasoning of yours.

710
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,960
Right? Yes!

711
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,489
It's your turn now.

712
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,929
Just hit me.

713
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,659
I don't have a secret that's more shocking than that.

714
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:22,130
Spill.

715
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,199
I don't have one.

716
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,840
Well,

717
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,550
I have...

718
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,380
never told anyone about this.

719
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,760
I wanted to be an animation director.

720
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,230
Really?

721
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,059
Did that chase away sleep?

722
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,269
You just made that up, didn't you?

723
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,800
But you don't look like the anime type.

724
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,840
I'm serious.

725
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,309
Really?

726
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,909
I love anime too!

727
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:10,380
You watched the shows too, right?

728
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,049
When we were kids,

729
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,250
there were cartoon TV shows throughout the day.

730
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:15,719
I watched every single one!

731
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,550
I learned about the world through cartoons.

732
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,789
You'll need to learn more through another method.

733
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,929
How come it's in the past tense?

734
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,559
You don't want to be one now?

735
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:39,110
Dreams don't always come true.

736
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,710
Right.

737
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,579
Well, it's the same as the Santa not existing.

738
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:48,079
Santa doesn't exist, but people say he does.

739
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,050
Dreams don't come true, but people say they do.

740
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,360
Did the anime teach you that too?

741
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,130
Hoo Young. Let me take your dream job.

742
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,530
- What? - I'll be an animation director.

743
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,399
My homeroom teacher keeps asking me what I want to be...

744
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,210
and bugging me to write a plan for my future career.

745
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,610
But I don't have one.

746
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,380
I just solved my problem.

747
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,679
It's difficult to become an animation director.

748
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:21,150
Nothing is easy in life. You just go for it.

749
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,090
What? You don't want me to take it?

750
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,789
It's not that.

751
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,530
Okay. I recognize your input.

752
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,630
Then I will give you...

753
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,800
five percent of my salary.

754
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,070
- Really? - Yes.

755
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,650
(Ms. Kim)

756
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,288
(Should I say it's a morning full of love?)

757
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,360
Should I say it's a morning full of love?

758
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:11,369
Yes, thanks to you.

759
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,030
Did you sleep well?

760
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,769
How could she when there's a guy in the house?

761
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,269
What nonsense is that?

762
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,409
If there was a guy, I would've known about him.

763
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,710
Gosh, be quiet.

764
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,739
Don't ruin it. You stay out of it.

765
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,679
What about work, Oddball?

766
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,449
I'm taking the week off. I'm not feeling well.

767
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,518
I only had porridge yesterday. I'm starving.

768
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:33,960
(Ms. Kim invited Kang Hoo Young.)

769
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,289
Darn it. Why did she invite Kang Hoo Young?

770
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,900
Come down. Let's have breakfast.

771
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:46,500
Why would I do that?

772
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,699
Then should I come upstairs?

773
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,150
- I can... - Sit down.

774
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,219
You walking around like that inconveniences me more.

775
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,590
Is that so? Okay. I'm a guest, after all.

776
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,260
How's the food?

777
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,900
It's not too salty. It's good.

778
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,070
Hong Ju doesn't like salty food.

779
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,610
Make sure to serve her meat as one of the side dishes.

780
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:05,509
You'll have desserts after the meal, right?

781
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,380
Gosh. That would be too much. I'm good.

782
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,289
If you want to have tiramisu, I have to take it out now.

783
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,590
Here's my tip.

784
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,159
Oddball is crazy about tiramisu.

785
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,659
If you have it, you can take it out.

786
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,599
Okay.

787
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:40,750
Thanks for the food.

788
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,420
You made time to look after your school friend.

789
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,050
You're a good person.

790
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,590
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

791
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,559
- I'll get going then. - Wait.

792
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,800
We have unfinished business to settle.

793
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,099
I don't have anything else to say.

794
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,469
Five percent.

795
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,099
Five percent?

796
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,510
Five percent of your salary.

797
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:12,179
For my input. Don't you remember?

798
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,920
What input did you have for my salary? That's absurd.

799
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,150
Okay. I recognize your input.

800
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,849
Then I will give you...

801
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,090
five percent of my salary.

802
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,829
What are you talking about?

803
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:28,800
Five percent?

804
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,530
It's the promise you made...

805
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,329
to this Friend Three from the same school.

806
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:36,239
You said you remembered everything that happened that day.

807
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,538
Hey, but that's...

808
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:41,109
I wonder how much money I would be entitled to...

809
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,010
if you've been working for ten years.

810
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:46,480
Gosh. You worked hard, Hong Ju.

811
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,050
Here. Enjoy it.

812
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,820
I'll run the numbers for us. You remember, right?

813
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,989
That I'm good at math.

814
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,199
It won't be easy to win Hong Ju over.

815
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,030
That's not because you're my first love.

816
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,969
You don't have the right to know what kind of relationship...

817
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,900
she had before meeting you.

818
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,480
But some jerk went abroad without telling her.

819
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,980
So Hong Ju had the worst breakup ever.

820
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,749
She was utterly appalled by any kind of romantic relationship.

821
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,650
I barely managed to get her to go on a blind date.

822
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,719
But then she met you.

823
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:24,849
Is that so?

824
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,860
I don't know what happened between you guys in the past.

825
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:33,389
I want Hong Ju to be happy.

826
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:37,070
But as of yesterday, you passed.

827
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:39,900
That's reassuring.

828
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:41,369
Did you tell her how you feel?

829
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:44,340
She told me that I was just...

830
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,739
Friend Three from the same school.

831
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:48,309
Friend Three?

832
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,809
But she doesn't know anyone from school.

833
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,309
So what will you do?

834
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,750
I should be her close friend first.

835
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:01,519
Well, I only said that...

836
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,658
because I fell into the pit because of you.

837
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,189
I wasn't thinking straight then.

838
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,800
That's not legally binding.

839
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,670
I don't remember us losing our minds when we talked.

840
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,739
Gosh, we were.

841
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:15,638
We fell into the pit and had nowhere to go.

842
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,969
Of course, I was losing it.

843
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,340
Well, I wasn't.

844
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,139
But I was.

845
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,079
People just blab about stuff they don't mean before dying.

846
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:25,110
Besides, let's keep things clear.

847
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,980
I said I would do that if I were to become a director.

848
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,178
But I'm not a director.

849
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,449
I'm just a lowly employee at an animation production company.

850
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:32,650
So that promise is invalid. Got that?

851
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,989
You're laughing?

852
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,629
Gosh. I had no idea you would be this serious...

853
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,059
about giving me excuses.

854
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:43,730
Hong Ju. You are...

855
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,070
What?

856
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,840
Hey. Kang Hoo Young. You...

857
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,280
I was serious about this because you asked.

858
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,780
I thought you wanted to take my salary as your asset.

859
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,209
You're such a heartless guy.

860
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,880
You're nothing but a little kid!

861
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,019
You're more than capable of doing that!

862
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,348
If you add up ten years' worth of your salary,

863
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,718
will it be somewhere around ten million dollars?

864
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,389
I don't work with any asset that's lower than that.

865
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:12,229
Taking 5 percent of that would give me a mere 500,000 dollars.

866
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,389
I see.

867
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,360
You must be so successful then.

868
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,539
How's work? Is it fun?

869
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,710
Oh, stop it.

870
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,380
Besides, how can work be fun?

871
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,110
Watching anime is only fun.

872
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,050
You have no idea how much work there is.

873
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,289
When I started my job, I was the receipt girl.

874
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,859
I don't get paid a lot, but I still worked hard for it.

875
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,360
How could you mock me by talking about taking a cut?

876
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,960
I was just happy about your job.

877
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:48,599
I had no idea you would be making anime.

878
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,230
I told you that was my plan.

879
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,099
I doubt I could be a director.

880
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,639
But I'll join a project as a main producer this time.

881
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,510
Impressive.

882
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,880
You transcend my expectations every time.

883
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,519
Well, I tend to do that.

884
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:14,289
If you have time, do you want to watch the movies we worked on?

885
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,360
You can see my name on the end credits.

886
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:18,389
Let's watch it now.

887
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,860
Let me finish this first.

888
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,170
Eat a lot.

889
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,039
("Cloud Bread 3")

890
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,369
Hello.

891
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:46,420
Excuse me.

892
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,489
Where's Ms. Lee Hong Ju?

893
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,119
Ms. Lee?

894
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
Gosh, this is exhausting.

895
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,440
Hey, I'll go and bring my laptop.

896
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,010
- You want me to carry you again? - No.

897
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,079
It's better to climb up without the crutches.

898
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,679
I'll jump on one leg.

899
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:15,750
Keep your distance.

900
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,590
Gosh.

901
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:23,389
Lee Hong Ju.

902
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,079
What brings you here, Mr. Bang?

903
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,449
I heard the meeting got delayed because of an accident.

904
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:49,650
I guess I heard wrong.

905
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,618
I'm sorry that the project got delayed because of me.

906
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,159
This is all your career means to you?

907
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,800
If you're not going to give it your all,

908
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,429
I'll have to reconsider...

909
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:05,900
working with you.

910
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,170
You...

911
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:24,750
Then kick me out.

912
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:29,690
Hong Ju... Why are you acting like this?

913
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,960
If you don't know the answer to that, I'll be really angry.

914
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,969
You said you would always love me.

915
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,269
You told me you would never change.

916
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,469
That's what you told me.

917
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:46,840
I did?

918
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,409
I'm sorry to break it to you.

919
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,550
But I've changed.

920
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,280
Do you understand why I'm acting like this?

921
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:58,590
Then could you leave?

922
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,820
I'm not done talking to you yet.

923
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,429
If you grab my hand again,

924
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,659
I'll really slap you.

925
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,650
What are you doing here?

926
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,659
I'm in pain.

927
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,090
You said you would jump on one leg.

928
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,960
Why did you walk up on your own? Did you want to look that tough?

929
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:02,179
Does it hurt a lot?

930
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:03,880
Like crazy.

931
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,250
And it's embarrassing.

932
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,789
I'm embarrassed that you keep witnessing my ruined romance.

933
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,889
Then I'm going to feel bad...

934
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:18,960
because I'm happy...

935
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,130
that your romance failed.

936
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:33,808
Sitting down here...

937
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:35,440
reminds me of the night we fell into the pit.

938
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,380
Stop bringing back the past I want to forget about.

939
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,260
Lee Hong Ju.

940
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,730
Recover quickly...

941
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,000
with your leg injury and your heartache.

942
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:42,279
(Serendipity's Embrace)

943
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,710
(Obok High School)

944
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,130
Memories are unstable...

945
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,869
because some memories are remembered only by one person.

946
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,480
(Caution: Fall Hazard)

947
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,789
Kang Hoo Young.

948
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:06,260
What was that just now?

949
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,429
Just now, my heart...

950
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,829
skipped a beat.

951
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:18,070
(Lee Hong Ju)

952
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:37,659
I guess only I was startled.

953
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:44,929
Memories are unstable.

954
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,500
Think about it seriously starting now.

955
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,039
If we're just friends and nothing else.

956
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:29,880
- I feel awkward around him. - Hoo Young!

957
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,680
I'm having more fun now.

958
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,909
I'm on your mind now. Aren't I?

959
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,719
I'll stop feeling self-conscious around Kang Hoo Young.

960
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,819
I'll just have fun.

961
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,390
You were about to kiss me just now, right?

962
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:45,529
I'm here to take Hoo Young with me.

963
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:47,829
Are you going somewhere?

964
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,529
Should I really go?
