2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,870
[Episode 1]

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,900
Legend has it
that all things have spirits,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,980
be it flowers, plants, insects,
frogs, or birds and beasts,

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,780
absorbing the essence
of heaven and earth,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,780
they can transform into human forms.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,220
Master Jixiang
is of the Qilin royal family,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,180
inherently powerful,
ruling over all spirits,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,940
revered as the master
of myriad spirits.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,540
Her nature is pure,

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,300
yet her heart is immensely lonely.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,460
Myriad Spirits Pearl,

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,980
why am I the only one without friends?

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,420
Why is everyone afraid of me?

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,460
In this world,
only you are not afraid of me.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,420
Grant me a friend, okay?

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,780
Spirits have a pure and kind nature,

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,380
coexisting peacefully with humans,

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,620
leaving behind many beautiful tales.

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,740
Nonsense.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,540
You've painted it wrong.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,220
All spirits are evil.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,540
Who are you?

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,780
I'm Ye Zhou,

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,940
from the Baichuan Sect.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,780
Baichuan Sect

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,580
captures evil spirits
to protect the human realm.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,980
Are you a spirit hunter?

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,260
I'm just a humble painter.

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,060
You've got the wrong person.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm searching for a wolf spirit.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,420
This is the Spirit Testing Potion.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,380
It's ineffective against humans,

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,740
but once consumed by a spirit,

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,340
it will reveal its true form.

36
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,020
Please.

37
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,540
Okay.

38
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,820
Baichuan Sect is quite a bully indeed.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,300
Guess you prefer the hard way.

40
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,500
I'd like to see

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,140
what kind of creature you are.

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,020
Making groundless judgments
of good and evil,

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,740
unable to distinguish
between right and wrong.

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,540
It is you who are the villains.

45
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,660
A mere wild dog

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,420
dares to howl at the sky.

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
This is truly a lame fight
between losers.

48
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,060
Today, I will surely
kill you dog spirit.

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,500
You always cause trouble for me.

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,380
Move aside.

51
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,140
So hot.

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,580
Qilin royal family.
Are you perhaps Master Jixiang?

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,420
I'm traveling incognito.

54
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,340
Keep it low-key.

55
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,860
Scram.

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,580
What's going on

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,620
with you two?

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,660
Don't you know he belongs to me?

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,700
I can sense

60
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,660
that the Myriad Spirits Pearl is on him.

61
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,220
I saved your life.

62
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,620
That day, I met a god.

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,420
From today onward, you are mine.

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,140
But the god said to me...

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,460
Wait for me.

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,220
I'll come back later
and take you to eat something good.

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,020
Father, I have a friend now.

68
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,740
Where is the Myriad Spirits Pearl?

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,900
It is the spirit pearl
born alongside you,

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,300
the treasure of our tribe.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,900
Come on, don't worry.

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,740
I won't lose it anyway.

73
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,180
[Ten days later]
I won't lose it anyway.

74
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,700
If it's lost, it's lost.

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,000
[Ten days later]

76
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,500
With so many powerful elders around,

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,140
just casually sending one out

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
can help retrieve it.

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,300
How dare you talk back?

80
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,660
Losing the Myriad Spirits Pearl
will stir up chaos.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,670
As a member of the royal family,

82
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,980
you should bear the responsibility.

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,860
It's only been ten days
since I last saw you,

84
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,860
and you've grown so much already.

85
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,940
You seem to have forgotten,
Young Master,

86
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,260
one day in the Spirit Mountain

87
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,300
equals one year in the human realm.

88
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,740
The Spirit King
must have mentioned it.

89
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,980
Father has mentioned many things before.

90
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,860
How can I remember everything he said?

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,380
He looks handsome enough.

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,660
What if there's a mistake?

93
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,060
Get out.

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm dealing with important matters.

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,620
The door!

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,660
So cold.

97
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
He's freezing.

98
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,460
How strange,
I sensed the Myriad Spirits Pearl,

99
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,580
it's supposed to be on him.
Where could it be?

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,140
His whole body is freezing,
luckily he still has a heartbeat.

101
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Otherwise, he would be like...

102
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,500
A dead person.

I saved your life.

113
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,740
Is this how you treat your savior?

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,420
I have a body of extreme cold.

115
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,540
Most people,
when near me within three chi,

116
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,660
would shiver all over,

117
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,180
yet you seem to be fine.

118
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,300
That's great.

119
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,140
I have a body of extreme heat.

120
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,860
Everyone is afraid of me.

121
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,100
I was afraid of burning you.

122
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,980
What about that dog spirit?

123
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,980
I scared him away.

124
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,780
Don't joke around.

125
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,460
This place is dangerous.

126
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,820
There may be spirits lurking around.

127
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,780
I felt like I stepped on something
and slipped just now.

128
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,740
Did you see anything?

129
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,700
Really?

130
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,860
I didn't see anything.

131
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,860
Never mind.

132
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm going to search
for that dog spirit now.

133
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,340
Goodbye.

134
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,220
You took my pearl.

135
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
Give it back to me.

136
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,500
Miss,

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
this is our first encounter.

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,740
Why would I take your things?

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,060
Ten days...

140
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,740
I mean, ten years ago,

141
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,660
we met each other.

142
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,500
Forget it,

143
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,860
you probably don't remember.

144
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,260
But I really did save your life.

145
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,220
What does your thing look like then?

146
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,220
It's about...

147
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,820
this...

148
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,620
this big.

149
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,660
It's round and silver-colored.

150
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,060
It's very rare
and precious in the world.

151
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,100
Everyone wants it.

152
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,460
I see.

153
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,940
It's getting late,

154
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,140
you should go back early.

155
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,340
Don't let your parents worry.

156
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,940
Farewell.

157
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,620
You returned it so quickly.

158
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,820
Guess you are not bad, after all.

159
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,420
Cheat!

160
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,580
You darn cheat!
What I want is the Myriad Spirits Pearl!
