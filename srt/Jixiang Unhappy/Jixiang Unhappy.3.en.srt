00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,060
Are you done yet?!

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,000
Coming into my room
in the middle of the night

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,660
to grab my hand.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,940
Are you going to let me sleep or not?!

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,660
Miss Jixiang, please forgive me. I...

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,100
This guy is quite clever.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,980
Sooner or later, he'll figure it out.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,980
I need to quickly come up with a plan.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,420
Then take the pearl and go back.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,060
Is there a chance,

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,580
Young Master,

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,420
that we've got the wrong person
altogether?

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,020
Who said you could drink tea?!

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
You don't believe me, huh?

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,740
I'll make the pearl reveal itself
and show that you are wrong!

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,620
When was the last time
the pearl showed any abnormalities?

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
The last time

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,460
was during the sudden fire
at Spirit Mountain.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,860
Luckily, the Myriad Spirits Pearl
gave an early warning.

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,980
Fire attack.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,540
Use fire to burn him.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,340
Can he withstand it?

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,900
External fire is not suitable,

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,300
internal fire is better,

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,940
for example...

28
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,780
Last night, there was indeed
a spirit around here, I saw it.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,860
It appeared near the chili warehouse.

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,340
When I spotted it,

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,580
it was licking its claws,

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,020
seeming content.

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,820
I guess it must love spicy food.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,460
I heard from the villagers
that this spirit is quite strange,

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,700
resembling a horse but not quite,

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,900
resembling a cow but not quite either.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,100
Its mouth is like a hanging basin,
and its body is covered in scales.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,420
It's like
the legendary undefined creature.

39
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,300
[Undefined creature]

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,020
It's clearly a Qilin, alright.

41
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Anyway,

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,020
if we want to lure it out,

43
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,340
we need to figure out
which type of chili it likes to eat.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,660
How about this?

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,620
You eat,

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,020
and I'll judge the color and taste
of the chili on your mouth.

47
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,140
Is it really a reliable method?

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,580
It is.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
We are friends,

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,180
right?

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Don't you think it's spicy?

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,260
It's alright.

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm from Chongqing.

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,940
So spicy.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,020
This isn't working.

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,500
I still have another lead.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,180
If the fire attack doesn't work.

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,980
Let's flood it with water.

59
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,500
Spirit Mountain

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,100
once suffered
from drought for several years,

61
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,720
and it was only through the guidance

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,420
of the Myriad Spirits Pearl
that we found the water source.

63
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,700
If the pearl is submerged in water,
it will surely emerge.

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,500
That demonic spirit

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,580
has both fins and scales,

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
so it obviously lives by the water.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,860
This lake covers
an area of ​​a hundred li

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,620
and is the only place
where it could hide.

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,100
The water in this lake
is indeed bottomless,

70
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
making it a perfect hiding spot
for the demonic spirit.

71
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,020
However, how should we

72
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,300
go about searching for it?

73
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,140
Of course...

74
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,940
You...

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,860
Careful.

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,180
However,

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,420
what you said makes sense.

78
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,060
I must find a way

79
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,580
to drain this lake.

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,620
Just a moment ago, the sky was clear,

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,420
and now it's raining heavily.
What's going on?

82
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah,

83
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,100
how come it's raining?

84
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,420
It's okay,

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm a guy, no big deal.

86
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,340
Friends

87
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,700
should take care of each other.

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
It's Young Master Jixiang. Let's leave.

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,780
Haha, caught you.

90
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,540
Young Master Jixiang.

91
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,420
Why are you afraid of me?

92
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,140
Young Master,

93
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,300
you are a Qilin,

94
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,820
possessing the Pure Yang Body.

95
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,540
If you get angry,

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,020
you'll burn us.

97
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,740
Myriad Spirits Pearl,

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,060
why am I the only one without friends?

99
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,260
Why is everyone afraid of me?

100
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,660
In this world,
only you are not afraid of me.

101
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,300
Grant me a friend, okay?

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,820
Since we're friends,

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,980
I'll stay and get soaked with you.

104
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Sure.

105
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,060
Are you not cold?

106
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,660
Have you forgotten

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,220
that I have a body of extreme cold?

108
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,260
Then let my body of extreme heat

109
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,780

of the Myriad Spirits Pearl.

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,420
Surprisingly,
it's coming from within him.

It's so clear,

almost as if it's also longing for me.

121

During these days out,

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,380
I've had no news of how Master is doing.

123

Please return promptly.

126

and am burdened
with a body of extreme cold,

I am not sure how long I could live.

Sorry, Miss Jixiang.

130
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,100
From now on,

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,980
I'll continue to be Ye Zhou.

132
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,340
Ye Zhou,

133
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,460
let's go out and play.

134
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,900
Ye Zhou?

135
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,700
The search for the demonic spirit
is probably just a pretext.

136
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,620
You only want me
to accompany you for fun.

137
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,820
But these days
have been the happiest I've ever had.

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
I have important matters to attend to

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,420
and cannot get involved
in a romantic relationship.

140
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
Take good care of yourself
in the future.

141
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,020
From Ye Zhou.

142
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,580
This big liar.

143
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,100
What does it have to do with good food,

144
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,540
having fun,

145
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,260
and a romantic relationship?

146
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,180
What I want is the Myriad Spirits Pearl!

147
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,100
Who told you to follow me?

148

Who's following whom?

149
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm walking ahead of you.

150
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,140
Don't follow me.
