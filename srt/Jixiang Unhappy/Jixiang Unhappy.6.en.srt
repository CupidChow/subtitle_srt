[Episode 6]

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,500
Master,

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,620
you haven't mentioned my assignment yet.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,660
Come on,

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,980
even though we are master and disciple,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,620
in my heart, we're brothers.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,260
It's been ten years

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,580
since the last attack
by the demonic wolf.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,620
I still haven't been able
to cure your problem

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,380
of getting chills all over your body.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,620
I feel guilty about it.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,780
According to this map,

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,740
we just found the village
of the spirit tribe,

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
but the demonic wolf

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,180
isn't there.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,540
Zhou,

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,220
your strength is outstanding,
and you've repeatedly risked your life.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,940
This time,

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,140
with all the elites out,

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
you'll guard the sect.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,860
But this

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,500
is really dangerous.

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,660
Are you worried about the newcomers
encountering danger,

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,780
or are you worried about Jixiang
encountering danger?

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,860
Master,

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,540
why do you let her enter the sect?

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,380
She was born with formidable strength,
capable of taking on ten foes at once.

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,460
With a little training,

30
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,300
she could become your right-hand woman.

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,660
You tend to be solitary

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,540
and have no friends.

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,340
Jixiang is lively and cheerful.

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,300
You two seem a match.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,580
Master, why are you also...?

36
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,540
Anyway, she must be eliminated.

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,300
I really think you two are a match!

38
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,140
Did the person in charge criticize you?

39
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,180
No.

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,460
Why aren't you leading the team then?

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,380
I'm feeling restless.

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,460
Wait.

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,700
Why is that any of your concerns?

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,180
That's great.

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,060
Without you,

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,700
I will definitely pass smoothly,

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,620
and then I'll teach you a lesson
every day.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,260
What do you mean by that?

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm hungry.

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,460
Tell me then.

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,460
How much do you want?

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,140
Give it all to me.

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,740
Why did I let her get her way again?

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,940
Martial Brother Zhou,

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,740
are you annoyed?

56
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,140
I think Miss Jixiang

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,980
dropped something here.

58
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,340
What did she drop?

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,820
Affection.

60
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,900
Don't.

61
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,780
No need to blush, Martial Brother Zhou.

62
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,860
Alright, alright.

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm being serious here.

64
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,940
Keep a close eye on her for me.

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,740
You rarely ask me for a favor.

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,660
Consider it done;

67
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,420
I'll take care of it.

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,860
Come here.

69
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,180
You'd better figure out a way
to eliminate her.

70
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,700
Eliminate?

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,340
Are you dropping me a hint here?

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,380
I'll make sure she comes out on top.

73
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,700
I didn't mean it that way.

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,980
I understand.

75
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,100
You don't need to test me.

76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,180
I'll definitely

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,460
keep it a secret!

78
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,380
Martial Brother Zhou
still isn't reassured,

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,540
keeping an eye on things remotely.

80
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,500
I must do my best.

81
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,100
Jixiang,

82
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,340
stay close to me.

83
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,180
I must make him owe me this favor.

84
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm sorry, Master.

85
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,060
I simply cannot let Jixiang
join the Baichuan Sect.

86
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,060
If they are all acting suspiciously,
there must be a problem.

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,260
Whether or not they are up to no good,

88
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,740
before we reach the village,

89
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll get rid of them all.

90
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,380
Quickly inform
the spirits in the village

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,660
that people
from the Baichuan Sect are coming

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,420
and tell them to leave.

93
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,820
And what about you, Young Master?

94
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,940
Have you forgotten?

95
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,620
I'm now
one of the Baichuan Sect's people.

96
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
What about the martial arts exam then?

97
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,140
If we truly have no other options,

98
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
couldn't you just show up
and let me beat you up?

99
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
He's the one asking,

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,420
why does it have to be me?

101
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,500
You are not willing?

102
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,660
There are two of us here,

103
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,460
why is it always me who gets unlucky?

104
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,780
It should be his turn for once.

105
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,580
Wise choice, Young Master.

106
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,540
Shut up.

107
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,340
Jixiang?

108
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,420
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,620
I got a little lost.

110
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,140
It's okay, I'll take you back.

111
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,060
You have to be careful
in these mountains;

112
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,740
there are evil spirits.

113
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,660
Wait a moment,

114
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,860
these footprints are fresh.

115
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,620
Jixiang,

116
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,660
you go hide first,

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,140
I'll go take a look.

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,700
What's going on?
Why haven't you left yet?

119
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,580
They might catch you soon.

120
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,780
The scent of this spirit
is rather strange.

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,020
Don't be afraid.

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm here.

123
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,140
It's been ten years.
Do you still remember me?

124
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,940
I killed your whole family.

125
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,900
It's been ten years.

126
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,980
I finally found you.

127
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
All spirits are evil.

128
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,780
Why do you have such a strong hatred
towards the spirits?

129
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,580
So this is why.

130
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,220
Are you injured?

131
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,100
Before I die, it can't hurt you.
Come again.

132
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,020
The Myriad Spirits Pearl
is consuming his life.
