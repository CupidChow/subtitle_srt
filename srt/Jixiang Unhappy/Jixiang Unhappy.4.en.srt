00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,260
Hey.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,420
Who are you?

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,220
Why did you follow me here?

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Following you for food, of course.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,340
One meal won't do.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,180
I have to eat every day.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,380

Hey, don't leave.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,580
You're my long-term meal ticket.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,820
I have no other choice.

15

Let's part ways here.

00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,300
Baichuan Sect doesn't support idlers.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,460
Go beg elsewhere.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,780
You jerk!

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,180
Begging for food?

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,020
Your whole family begs for food!

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,140
Pretending that you don't know me, huh?

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,980
You're really

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,940

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,580
Young Master,

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,220
I'm furious too!

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,940
I'll go and raze
that whatever sect it is to the ground.

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,100
I'll bring back Ye Zhou.

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,180
Take it easy.

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740

We better go

the exam papers to the candidate.

once caught.
