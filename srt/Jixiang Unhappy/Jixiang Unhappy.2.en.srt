[Episode 2]

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,660
Where is the demonic wolf?

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,220
Talk!

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,420
You tricked me.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,620
How come it's you again?

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,180
I hate it most when people trick me.

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:42,940
Miss,

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,580
who exactly are you?

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,020
You tricked me for the second time.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm furious!

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,460
Stop right there!

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,700
I don't even know you.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,340
You are as treacherous as one can be!

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,620
Paste... Oh, yes.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,500
Watch out!

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,740
It's so sticky.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,860
Stop!

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,340
Don't go!

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,740
Are you going to let go of me?

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,660
I'm not!

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,300
I won't waste my breath with you.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,660
What are you doing?

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,500
Hands, our hands.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,260
It's all because of you
that I fell down.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,220
It's all your fault!

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,900
Oh, my statue is worshiped here.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,860
Looks pretty good.

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,220
Darn spirit.

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,340
What are you planning to do?

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,580
All spirits are evil.

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,660
I'm going to smash it.

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,180
Don't.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,620
Why do you have such a strong hatred
towards the spirit tribe?

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,060
What are you doing?

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
We're stuck together now.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,940
If you want to get out,
we'll have to cooperate.

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,220
You're in a hurry, but I'm not.

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,740
Apologize to me.

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,420
Demonic wolf?

41
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,020
This is bad.

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,900
Careful!

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,100
Don't worry.

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,900
I will definitely get you up there.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,260
This little guy seems pretty nice.

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,860
Later,

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,180
I'll crouch down,

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,620
and you step on my shoulders.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,700
Then try to see
if you can reach the top.

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,180
If it really doesn't work,

51
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,060
then we'll bring that thing over here.

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,300
The situation is urgent right now,

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,740
so you need to protect yourself
as well as possible.

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,540
Shut up.

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,420
No need for all this trouble.

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,700
Move aside.

57
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,780
Now, I've truly saved your life.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Thank you, Miss.

59
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,460
Your strength is not like that
of an ordinary person.

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,660
You repeatedly interfered
in my business,

61
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,780
released that dog spirit,

62
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,260
and also showed considerable concern
for that Qilin statue.

63
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,740
Could it be that you...?

64
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,380
Why do you talk so much?

65
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,900
What's this?

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,700
It's quite tasty.

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,140
This is Spirit Testing Potion.

68
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,420
As long as a spirit drinks it,

69
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,540
they will reveal
their true form in no time.

70
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,180
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,420
I'm hungry.

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,500
Miss Jixiang,
you were born with divine power,

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,900
that's truly admirable.

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,420
Today's encounter
has brought us together;

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,940
guess we can be considered friends now.

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
Friends?

77
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,380
Yes.

78
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,060
Don't worry,

79
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,780
from now on, I've got your back.

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,940
Interesting.

81
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,460
I'm full.

82
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,140
Let's get down to business.

83
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,900
She has superhuman strength,
as well as an astonishing appetite,

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,940
and she also disrupted
my investigation of the dog spirit.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,350
Could it be
that the Spirit Testing Potion

86
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,940
is taking effect?

87
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,260
Where is the restroom?

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,100
Huh?

89
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,300
This is the map left by the dog spirit.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,060
Our only hope of finding
the demonic wolf lies here.

91
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,900
We must ensure it reaches
the hands of our master.

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,060
Yes, Martial Brother Zhou.

93
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,060
Young Master,

94
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,780
do you remember the instructions
from the Spirit King?

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,940
First,

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,660
you must not reveal
your true identity as a spirit.

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,380
Second,

98
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,180
you must not provoke conflicts
between the two tribes

99
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,580
or disrupt the order of the human realm.

100
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,820
Third,

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,140
you must never harm anyone's life.

102
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,940
Don't be so agitated,

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,740
it's all

104
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,340
- for your own good.
- for your own good.

105
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,300
If anything happens to you,

106
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,420
we'll have no choice

107
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,700
- but sacrifice ourselves
- but sacrifice ourselves

108
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,340
- to repay the Spirit King.
- to repay the Spirit King.

109
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
So annoying!

110
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,620
Why did he send
two chatterboxes to protect me?

111
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,580
Don't be annoyed.

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,140
The Spirit King
highly appreciates both of us.

113
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,060
Ah!

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,660
Wasn't it supposed
to take effect in no time?

115
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,580
Why did I have stomach troubles all day

116
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,220
and only now it's taking effect?

117
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,660
You're of royal descent;

118
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,420
your resistance is too strong.

119
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,660
Miss Jixiang,

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm coming in.

121
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,180
No,

122
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,340
what are you doing?

123
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,620
Miss Jixiang, are you okay?

124
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,260
What are you doing up so late?

125
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,540
I'm going to bed.

126
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,940
No fever.

127
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,020
Then why so much sweat?

128
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,900
Is it because you got scared?

129
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,420
Miss Jixiang,

130
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,500
there was unusual activity
among the spirits today,

131
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,300
so I came to check on you.

132
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,580
What do you mean?

133
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,220
Are you suspecting me again?

134
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,500
Not at all.

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused

136
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,460
because of
the Spirit Testing Potion today.

137
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
So I came here specifically
to apologize to you.

138
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,220
Your hand...

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,940
Um...

140
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,700
My arm...

141
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,820
My arm hurts.

142
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,100
Should I take a look for you?

143
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,580
No need.

144
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
It'll be fine

145
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,620
in a moment.

146
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,780
You may leave now.

147
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
Okay.

148
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,260
Good night.

149
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
There's another possibility:

150
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,940
what's behind you

151
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,300
isn't just a hand,

152
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,140
but

153
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,500
a claw!
