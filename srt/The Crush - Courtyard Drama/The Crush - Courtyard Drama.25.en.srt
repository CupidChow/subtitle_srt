14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,120
- Mr. Lin!
- Mr. Lin!

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Mr. Lin, are you okay?

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,600
- Mr. Lin!
- Mr. Lin!

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Mr. Lin.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
What happened, Mr. Lin?

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,400
Mr. Lin, are you alright?

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Say something.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,760
Mr. Lin, please speak.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
Exactly.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,840
Mr. Lin, please speak.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,720
What's going on?

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Well...

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,360
I...

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
I never believed in stories before.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
But just now,

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,160
I had a dream.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,680
A dream?

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
A very long dream.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,880
Like living an entirely different life.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
Yet when I woke up,

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,680
everything vanished.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
You just said

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,920
that this was a business strategy game
about managing a tea estate.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
But what I want to tell you is,

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
this is a game about love.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
Love?

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
At first, I also thought

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,400
it was about business rivalry.

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,680
But gradually, I realized

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
it's actually about two people

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
discovering themselves

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,800
and finding the guiding light
within their hearts.

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,600
Perhaps

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
only through the warm story

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,120
can we

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
dissect this cold material world.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,400
Mr. Lin.

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,520
Let's take a photo of you.

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,200
- Mr. Lin, please.
- Mr. Lin, please.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,280
Mr. Lin, don't leave!
Say a few more words!

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,000
(Should Li Zixuan go find Wei Xiaotang?)

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Long time no see.

58
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,720
(With kindred spirits,)

59
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,120
(we keep our promise.)

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
(Whatever happens,)

61
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
(we work hand in hand.)

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,360
(From this moment on,)

63
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
(you and I are in the same boat.)

64
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
(Winning the Top Tea title)

65
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,000
(is good for us both.)

66
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,000
But if we earn the Top Tea title,

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
you'll leave.

68
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
Since she can come to this world
and meet you,

69
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,680
you can go to her world too.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
(Li Zixuan.)

71
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
(Make a wish too.)

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
(I pray)

73
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,600
(that Wei Xiaotang and I
may stay together forever.)

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,080
(If one day)

75
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,960
(you have to leave,)

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
(please let me)

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,120
(find you in your world.)

78
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
(Do you know you're late?)

79
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,960
(If you want to meet someone,)

80
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,720
(there's always a way.)

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
(Whatever happens,)

82
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
(we work hand in hand.)

83
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,040
My dear, do you think

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
we're living a life

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,840
or a dream?

86
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,666
(In the sixth year of the Yuanfeng era,
after taking a nap,)

87
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,872
(Wei Xiaotang realized
she wasn't a woman)

88
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,222
(but a man named Lin Yuhao
from another world.)

89
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,122
(Determined, she sought to return
to her own world.)

90
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:29,542
(Her tale defied belief,
yet her wisdom proved true.)

91
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,488
(Her unconventional ways
often stunned people.)

92
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,492
(She pioneered tea arts,
popularized milk tea,)

93
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,872
(and changed
the Li family's old traditions.)

94
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:35,962
(Thus, she united hearts and minds,
turning evil to good in the end.)

95
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,912
(Everything went smoothly.)

96
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,522
(Li Zixuan was a devoted husband.)

97
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,504
(Though he loved Xiaotang, he finally
let Xiaotang go back to her world.)

98
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,742
(Upon returning, Lin Yuhao
shared his story with outsiders.)

99
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:45,522
(As he finished speaking,
Li Zixuan showed up before him.)

100
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:48,032
(Suddenly, Wei Xiaotang appeared again.)

101
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,328
(Xiaotang came to Lin Yuhao's dream, not
that Yuhao became her in his dream.)

102
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:55,968
(The End)

103
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,472
(Got you again!)

104
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:59,360
(Next comes a Q&A session.)

105
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,864
(Do you like this TV series? Yes or No.)
