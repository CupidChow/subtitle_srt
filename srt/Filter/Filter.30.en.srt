- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Now that Tang and Gu are here,

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,480
I'll serve you some fine wine.

It's my treasure.

8

Your mom

11

can't bear to let me drink it.

Okay.

16
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,880
- Thanks, Mr. Su.
- For the guests?

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,230
You want to drink it, don't you?

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,040
Thanks, Mr. Su. I'll help myself.

19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,270
Chengcheng told me

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,360
you can't drink a lot.

21
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,360
Not as good as Gu Yu.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
But I'm happy,

23
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,830
so I can drink a little.

Fine wine indeed.

31
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,520

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,160
you were worried about me,

35
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,240
but you needed to pretend to be happy

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,390
to comfort me.

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,710
Sorry for the trouble.

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll finish this one.

Where's Su Chengcheng? I can't see her.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,950
Did she disappear again?

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,080
That's right. Where is she?

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,080
Is she back in her room?

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll check her room.

46

Help us look for her.

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
I'll check over there.

50

You caught us so fast.

62

- Yes.
- So boring.

63

Here's my confession.

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,440
I was just cooperating with them.

- No.

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,720
and a supporting bestie.

190
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,910
Why would I doubt myself

191
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,280
for what others say?

192
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm convinced
that you're obsessed with me

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,750
because I'm a great person.

194
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,470
It's 100 percent true.

195
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,590
Give me the key. I'll drive.

196
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,910
My dad said you came so early

197
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,440
and didn't have breakfast,

198
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,510
so he prepared soy milk
and meat pie

199
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,040
and asked me to give them to you.

200
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
That's too kind of him.

201
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,110
Let's go.

215

I have.

216
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Well, although I commented
your Moments

217
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
last night,

218
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,480
I still need to tell you this in person.

219
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,350
Congratulations.

220
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,470

Chengcheng.

225
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,750
I didn't peek at you

226
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,280
because you found a boyfriend.

227
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,470
I already knew it,
so I wasn't surprised.

228
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,990
I was wondering

229
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,320
why you didn't wear makeup
or even put lipstick on,

230
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,800
for it's a big day.

231
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,400
Can't I come without make-up?

232
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,080
You can.

233
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,630
Are you serious?

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,590
You can't leave her even at work.

235
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,720
Are you serious?

236
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,230
You can't leave me even at work.

237
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,470
I'm serious.

238
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,920
I'll treat you and Chengcheng

239
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,630
to dinner after work.

240
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,160
Tell me what happened.

241
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,510
Last night, Yuan got angry,

242
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,270
and she wouldn't reply to me.

243
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,480
I want Su Chengcheng to ask her out

244
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,550
and have dinner with us.

245
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,120
She'll move on quickly after having fun.

246
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,710
Why did she get angry?

247
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,750
For Chengcheng?

248
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,750
Not exactly.

249
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,240
She was already in a bad mood

250
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,520
and acting on a whim.

251
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,150
That digital chameleon

252
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,800
was one of her crazy ideas.

253
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,720
Breakfast is in the fridge.

254
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,040
Heat the bread first.

255
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,060
(Yuan, remember to have breakfast.)

256
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,980
This is a leopard
from the African savannah.

257
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,210
Right now, it's enjoying a great meal.

258
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,810
It's eating a pony.

259
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,650
The pony was careless

260
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,720
and was caught by a leopard
that had been hungry for days,

261
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,310
so now, as you can see...

262
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,040
Are you done with your friend's matters?

263
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,480
Can you start drawing now?

264
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm done with that.

265
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,190
But I have no passion for drawing.

266
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,800
Aren't you in a relationship?

267
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,640
That's great material.

268
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
How can you have no passion?

269
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,750
Maybe because I'm in a relationship,

270
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,630
I'm not in the mood for work.

271
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Why don't you try to
persuade me to break up with him?

272
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,000
What happened?

273
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Nothing.

274
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,590
Everything's fine.

275
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,150
But I've been lazy.

276
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,150
I only want to be a couch potato.

277
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll visit you after work.

278
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,240
No need.

279
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,150
It's a deal.

280
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,720
China has the most advanced

281
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,480
e-commerce industry.

282
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,240
Our online channels

283
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,800
have the advantage
of low investment and low cost.

284
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,350
However, in real stores,

285
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,200
customers can see and touch
our products

286
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,110
and feel our service.

287
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,350
If we want them to truly understand us,

288
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
we must improve the layouts
of our channels

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,670
to make the customers
feel closer to our products.

290
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
Therefore,

291
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,750
after discussing it
with Mr. Tang and Mr. Tang,

292
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,910
we decided

293
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,560
to open our first offline store.

294
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,110
Since its establishment,

295
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,110
TBC has been valuing product R&D.

296
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Compared to other brands,

297
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,160
we've invested much more money

298
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,000
into product R&D.

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,200
The feedback of our customers
over the past three years

300
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,080
has proven the high quality
of our products.

301
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
In the future, I will continue
to work with the R&D Department

302
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,390
to provide high-quality products
with low prices for our customers.

303
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
Over the past few years,

304
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,400
TBC has seen great progress

305
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,390
in online sales.

306
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,590
However, I think we still need
a turning point

307
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,190
to make TBC viral.

308
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,110
Opening our first offline store
at this point

309
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,320
is a decision based on
our long-term development.

310
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,310
It can not only

311
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,240
secure the long-term value of our brand

312
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,680
but promote it to more people.

313
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,080
We're not going to promote

314
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,590
one product at different times.

315
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,560
This is a long-term promotion

316
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,930
with integrated products
and prolonged brand effect.

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,640
Marketing Department, I hope

318
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,960
you can try your best

319
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,830
to complete the promotion program

320
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,320
with the biggest investment ever.

321
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,720
I hope all our departments
can work together

322
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,800
to make our first offline store
a great success,

323
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,160
so as to break the boundary
between online and offline sales,

324
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,720
reach more consumers,

325
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
and make TBC grow
in a sustainable and healthy way.

326
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,040
- Great!
- Great!

327
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,440
At the meeting, Yi said there are

328
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,590
14 offline stores from 7 brands

329
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,590
established in 2022.

330
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,510
We can do some research

331
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,590
to find out the customers' feedback

332
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,640
on these stores.

333
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay. I'm good at this.

334
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
I was in charge of product distribution,

335
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,010
so I'm familiar with
the business districts in the city.

336
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,920
Yi,

337
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,750
let's visit other brands' offline stores

338
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,960
to learn from them,

339
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,240
and we'll figure out

340
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,520
what locations are more suitable.

341
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Yi, I'll go with Zhao Yunjie.

342
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,190
No need.

343
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,720
We'll open an offline store,

344
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,280
so we also need new products
to support it.

345
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,480
You should stay and communicate
with the R&D Department

346
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,960
to confirm the flagship product

347
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,110
of our offline store.

348
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,830
Intervening in marketing
from the beginning

349
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
will be more efficient.

350
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,670
Okay.

351
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,190
Mr. Tang,

352
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,270
according to the sales data,

353
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,960
the best-selling product of our company

354
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,910
is perfume.

355
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,110
Why don't we focus on
the perfume series?

356
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,640
We can set up a perfume

357
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
experience area in the store.

358
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,670
Besides, girls are sensitive to smells.

359
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,110
If they smell the fragrance
when passing by,

360
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,190
they'll definitely come in
out of curiosity.

361
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,280
I think

362
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,910
we can also set up a special area
for lipsticks.

363
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,510
An entire wall of lipstick

364
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,400
is colorful and eye-catching.

365
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
People will definitely be attracted.

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,430
Besides, isn't there the lipstick effect
in economics?

367
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,040
As the world is experiencing
economic downturns,

368
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,080
consumers will definitely
favor lipsticks.

369
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,720
The pure plant-extracted lipstick

370
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,080
we recently developed is very suitable.

371
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,040
Su Chengcheng, what's your opinion?

372
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,270
All the developed brands

373
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,280
have their flagship products

374
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,630
such as mascara, foundation,
eyeshadow, and perfume.

375
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,150
For consumers,

376
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,920
our products are not

377
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,720
unique enough to compete with

378
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,000
those of the big brands.

379
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,350
In my opinion,

380
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,590
if we want to attract

381
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,190
more consumers
in a short period of time,

382
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,160
we need to diversify our products

383
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,800
as well as our marketing plans.

384
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,430
I know we need to be different.

385
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,750
But there are only limited kinds

386
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,830
of cosmetic products.

387
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,920
If we can't choose Mascara,
loose powder, foundation, perfume,

388
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,190
lipstick, or eyeshadow
to be our flagship product,

389
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
what should we do?

390
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,750
I know it's a difficult question.

391
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,750
However, in terms of supply and demand,

392
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,480
I think this is the best way.

393
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,110
I'm just telling the truth.

394
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,910
It's too difficult.

395
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,480
But I already have an idea.

396
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,190
Mr. Tang, what is it?

397
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,350
You'll know in the afternoon.

398
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,310
Sorry, I fell asleep

399
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,960
and didn't hear the doorbell.

400
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,750
I packed your favorite half-ripe cheese

401
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,350
on my way here.

402
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,110
Thanks.

403
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,760
Tell me what happened.

404
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,960
You've never lacked

405
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,480
passion for drawing since I knew you.

406
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,910
Did you eat this in the morning?

407
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,350
My breakfast.

408
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
You didn't have breakfast?

409
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
I did, but I didn't finish it.

410
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,350
No wonder you don't have
the energy to draw.

411
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,550
Eat some cakes first.

412
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,560
I'll order take-outs.

413
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,830
For my interview videos in the future,

414
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,440
don't use filters or Photoshop.

415
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,520
Is that okay?

416
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,880
Why don't you

417
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,280
go to interviews

418
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,080
without makeup?

419
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,830
Fine, I can do that.

420
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,830
Isn't it nice to let the readers
see what I really look like?

421
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,960
Besides,

422
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,280
I'm counting on my ability
instead of my face.

423
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,430
Fine.

424
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,190
Your rival Xiaoya will be so delighted.

425
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,430
Is that really necessary?

426
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,760
You threw up before I could finish.

427
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,040
Are you okay?

428
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,350
Is something wrong with the cake?

429
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,720
Why does it taste strange?

430
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,450
Go away.

431
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,520
I watched them bake it when I bought it.

432
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,590
Something's wrong with your taste.

433
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
What?

434
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,670
No passion for work, no appetite,

435
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,870
drowsiness,

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,390
- a sudden change of taste...
- Stop!

437
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,240
You're not a doctor,
so don't diagnose me.

438
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,320
I've been preparing to get pregnant.

439
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,160
Take this

440
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,040
and do a test.

441
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,590
If you haven't forgotten
middle-school Physics,

442
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,630
you should know

443
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,870
photo imaging is based on
the principles of optics,

444
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,350
that is, the propagation
and refraction of light.

445
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,800
When light passes through
a lens into a camera,

446
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,720
it experiences loss and refraction.

447
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,110
Therefore, every optical lens

448
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,630
has some degree of distortion.

449
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,200
Telephoto lenses or
the telephoto end of zoom lenses

450
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,270
have pincushion distortion,

451
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,590
while wide-angle lenses or
the wide-angle end of zoom lenses

452
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,430
have barrel distortion.

453
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,390
I've never known

454
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,960
that photo-editing is actually

455
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,430
the right and just thing to do.

456
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,910
It's restoring reality
instead of faking it.

457
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,520
It's the reality that people see

458
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,870
and think is true.

459
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,390
What do you mean?

460
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,150
Do you have time?

461
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,110
No.

462
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,830
Do you think the video is clear?

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,430
Very clear. Now I understand it.

464
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,880
I want to edit all the

465
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,910
distorted photos on my phone right now

466
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,350
to restore my beauty.

468
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,940
(Sending)

469
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,870
I can't argue with them
like Lin Yuan did.

470
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,870
I can only talk about the facts.

471
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,680
I didn't have much time,

472
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,720
so I made a simple version.

473
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,320
I'll make a detailed one with models.

474
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,670
Detailed version?

475
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,480
I think Su Chengcheng will envy me.

476
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,190
Good coffee.

477
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
How's that possible?

478
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,520
We used protection every time.

479
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,430
What should I do?

(Inspiration Provider)

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,300
(Dear Cheng)

482
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,040
Chengcheng, something big happened.

483
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,870
Mr. Gu,

484
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,590
here's the list of products.

485
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,350
Oh my god!

486
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,190
What?

487
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,080
Nothing.

488
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,670
What should I do?

489
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,150
I don't want to get married
or have children!

490
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,520
From Yuan?

491
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,540
You're so nervous.

492
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,220
Is she saying bad things about me

493
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,420
behind my back?

494
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,420
Or good things?

495
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,060
Neither bad nor good?

496
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,860
What did she say to you?

497
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,420
Well...

498
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
She said...

499
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
You're capable!

500
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,420
Mr. Gu, read the files.

501
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,340
I have to go.

502
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
Su Chengcheng.

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,420
Your WeChat...

504
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,740
You blocked the alumni group and

505
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,140
didn't receive the messages, right?

506
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,260
Check it out.

507
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,740
Tang Qi sent a file.

508
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,420
Okay, I'll check it.

509
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,860
Come in.

510
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,420
Mr. Gu.

511
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,770
What's wrong?

512
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,940
I want to take a day off.

513
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,220
For what?

514
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,060
Personal matter or illness?

515
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,220
Personal... illness.

516
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,340
I'm not feeling well.

517
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,980
I want to take a sick leave.

518
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,740
Okay.

519
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,180
Go back and get some rest.

520
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,060
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

(Mom)

522
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,380
Hello.

523
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,420
Okay, I'll pick you up.

524
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,380
Can you feel anything?

525
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,060
It's not different from before.

526
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,700
Are you mistaken?

527
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,700
Sometimes pregnancy tests can go wrong.

528
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,180
Well, it can't be wrong.

529
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,740
You're really pregnant.

530
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,020
Do you want to discuss it

531
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,820
with Gu Yu?

532
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,980
After all...

533
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
You don't have to.

534
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,100
I've never expected to have a child

535
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,020
or wanted to be a mom.

536
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,700
I know.

537
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,420
If I don't want this child,

538
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,340
will you think I'm cruel?

539
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,500
Really?

540
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,980
It's hard enough to

541
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,180
live a good life for myself.

542
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,620
I...

543
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,300
I don't think I can raise a child.

544
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,660
When I was little,

545
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,460
I really wanted to ask my parents.

546
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,740
Why would they bring me

547
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,180
into this world
before thinking it through?

548
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,420
Why couldn't they be

549
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,300
good parents

550
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,100
after having me?

551
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,300
Why would they abandon me?

552
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,780
I know.

553
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,060
This is your body and your life.

554
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,420
Whether to keep this child or not

555
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,540
is up to you.

556
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,420
No matter what you do,

557
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,380
I'll always be

558
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
by your side.

Your health is the priority.

560

No matter what,

561
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,420
let's do a physical examination,

562
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,500
okay?

563
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
I'll be there.

564
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,100
Okay.

565
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,380
Strong heartbeat. The baby is healthy.

566
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,060
Wipe it.

567
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,700
According to your test results,

568
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,060
everything is normal.

Given

570
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,060
your last period, it's about six weeks.

571
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,580
In the early stage, women will have
differentiated symptoms.

572
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,940
Most people will

573
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,460
be back to normal after three months.

(Health Handbook for Pregnancy)

575
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,460
Doctor,

576
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,980
if I don't want this child,

577
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,700
can I schedule an abortion procedure?

578
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,020
For healthy mother and child,

579
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,700
we don't recommend abortion.

580
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,860
But if you really want to do it,

581
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,620
for your health, you should

582
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,220
do it as soon as possible.

583
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,060
It's best to do it before 14 weeks.

584
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,300
Thanks, doctor.

585
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,620
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

586
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,060
(1st Floor, D Region)
Are you hungry?

587
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,380
Do you want to eat something?

588
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,660
I don't think I need
a follow-up examination.

589
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,060
I think I'm fine.

590
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,700
It can help me rest assured.

591
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,180
You have a lot of work to do.

592
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
Mr. Gu.

593
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,080
What a coincidence.

594
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,380
I... I accompanied Chengcheng
to see a doctor.

595
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,420
I know.

596
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,740
She took a sick leave.

597
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,740
My mom will see a doctor.

598
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,260
Yuan, let me introduce.

599
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,380
This is my mom.

600
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,580
Mom,

601
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,020
this is Lin Yuan, my girlfriend.

602
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,100
Hello, Mrs. Gu.

603
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,940
Hello.

604
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,220
This is Su Chengcheng,
Lin Yuan's friend.

605
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,220
She's Tang's girlfriend.

606
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,500
- Hello, Mrs. Gu.
- Hello.

607
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,140
Yu rarely accompanies me.

608
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,340
I didn't expect to be so lucky

609
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,740
to meet you.

610
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,100
Come to my house when you have time.

611
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,580
Tang should also come.

612
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,260
Okay.

613
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,740
Su Chengcheng, are you okay?

614
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,140
The doctor said it was gastroenteritis

615
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,060
and gave me some medicine.
It's not serious.

616
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,260
Good.

617
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,060
Well, Yuan,

618
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,580
we'll see the doctor first.

619
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,620
I'll pick you up later.

620
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,140
I told Tang to have dinner

621
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,500
with us tonight.

622
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

623
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,660
- Bye, Mrs. Gu.
- Bye.

624
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,580
Bye, Mrs. Gu.

625
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,740
- Bye.
- Mom, over here.

626
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,300
Do you think he found out?

627
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
No.

628
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,820
It's a big hospital.

629
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,900
Even if he's smart,

630
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,780
he can't figure out what disease it is.

631
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,420
Don't overthink it.

632
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,820
I'm so confused right now.

633
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,460
I don't want him to know.

634
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,140
Don't worry. He won't know.

635
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,620
You're so good at keeping secrets.

636
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,540
When did you meet her?

637
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,100
It's a long story.

638
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,420
I'll tell you when I have time.

639
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,740
What's wrong?

640
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,380
Mr. Gu.

641
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,420
Mom, there's a friend.

642
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,940
I'll chat with her. Wait a minute.

643
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,060
Okay, go ahead.

644
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,060
I'll head to the doctor.

645
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,900
Okay.

646
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,740
Hello, please wait a second.

647
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,660
Can you tell me
where you got this handbook?

648
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
Do you mean
the handbook for pregnancy?

649
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,620
In the OBGYN Department.

650
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,100
Just ask the nurse.

651
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,180
Thanks.

652
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,220
Handbook for pregnancy?

653
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,580
I'll send you to your company
before I head home.

654
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,460
I'll go home with you.

655
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,380
Su Chengcheng, I'm just pregnant

656
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,660
instead of having cancer.

657
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,780
I haven't decided
whether I'll keep this child or not.

658
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,340
Even if I decide to keep it,

659
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,500
will you stay with me

660
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,100
24 hours a day during my pregnancy?

661
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,020
I'll be annoyed, okay?

662
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,380
Just do what you need to do.

663
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,980
Okay.

664
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,300
I'll get back to work,

665
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,940
and you'll start drawing.

666
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,780
Don't worry.

667
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,460
I'm serious about my health.

668
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,740
I'll take care of myself.

669
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,980
Tell me if anything happens.

670
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,700
If you can't find me,

671
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,900
you can call my family.

672
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,660
You know they treat you
like family, right?

673
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,620
Normal emotional fluctuations
during pregnancy.

674
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,980
I know. It's okay.

675
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,060
I'm leaving.

676
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,980
Take care. Don't overthink it.

677
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,300
Bye.

678
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,380
Doctor,

679
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,820
if I don't want this child,

680
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,580
can I schedule an abortion procedure?

681
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,340
Have you ever cared about us?

682
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,140
Can't you be helpful sometimes?

683
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,660
Stop living in a dream!

684
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,780
What's the use of all this?

685
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,180
Am I really not helpful?

686
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,180
Have you ever made breakfast

687
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,300
or picked up our daughter?

688
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,660
I'm an artist!

689
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,620
I've told you this a million times!

690
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,540
A million times? What have you told me?
What have you done?

691
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,980
I... This is my job!

692
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,260
My job!

693
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,700
You don't understand!

694
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,780
You're always holding these!

What's the use?

696
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,060
Don't throw them!

697
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,660
Don't throw them!

698
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,180
I want a divorce!

699
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,500
Then do it!
