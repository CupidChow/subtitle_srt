00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll go to the flower shops

Metro Station.

5
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,510
I heard many flower shops

6
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,600
got their goods from there.

7
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,190
Okay. Tell me if you find anything.

8
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,950
Then I'll hang up. Bye.

9
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
You're up.

10
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,240
Breakfast is ready.

11
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Let's eat.

12
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
It's your favorite.

13
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,830
Chicken cutlet sandwich with fried egg.

14
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
You're welcome.

15
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,670
Just eat.

16
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
After we finish breakfast,

17
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll look for the old lady.

18
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,680
Wait for me at home.

19
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,190
I'll keep you informed.

20
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm going with you.

21
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
I can handle it.

22
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,510
Just rest at home.

23
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Okay.

24
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
Are you worried

25
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
that if we get separated,

26
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,920
you won't be able to find me?

27
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,680
I forgot the juice I made.

28
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,830
If you get bored,

29
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,070
you can watch TV shows

30
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110

Okay. I'm leaving.

Text me if you need anything.

50
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
It's not serious.

51
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
She'll be back in a few days.

52
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,390

63
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,870
Can you hear me?

64
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,080
I can't hear you.

65
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,230
Hello.

66
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
I'm fine.

67
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,960
(Dear Cheng)
Can't talk right now.

68
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,870
Glad to know you're fine.

69
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,200
In what circumstances

70
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,390
do you think
someone will become invisible?

71
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,420
(Dear Cheng)

72
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,120
Ghost in My Office is
an out-of-body experience.

73
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,720
Invisible Man
is due to unknown medicine.

74
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,150
In the comics, the character
ate the invisible fruit by accident.

75
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,360
If something like this

76
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,630
happens to your characters,

77
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
what will you do?

78
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,380
(Dear Cheng)

79
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,320
Humans fear consequences,
while bodhisattva fears causes.

80
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,750
If you want to solve a problem,

81
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,960
you need to face
the cause you created.

82
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,550
If you want to solve a problem,

83
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,510
you need to face
the cause you created.

84
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,240
Why are you asking
such a strange question?

85
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,200
What happened?

86
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,190
(Dear Cheng)
Something happened.

87
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,360
I need to face it right now.

94
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,480

urgent happened?

95

96
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Okay.

97
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320

98

102

of an invisible person.)

103
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,870

I don't know the person.

109
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,630
Please think carefully.

110
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,390
For better bookkeeping,

111
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,790
we will record

112
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,720
every purchaser's detailed information.

113
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,390
I've checked the names one by one.

114
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,360
There's no such a person.

115
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,550
Could it be that you forgot it?

116
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,790
You said she's a deaf old lady.

117
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,870
Yes.

118
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,510
She's old and deaf.

119
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,670
I wouldn't forget such a person.

120
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,270
There are other flower shops

121
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,510
doing wholesale business.

122
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,270
Maybe I can take you there.

123
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
I've asked all of them.

124
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,390

Yes, it's her.

193
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,920
Are you sure?

194
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,350
Yes.

195
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,550
I remember clearly

196
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,200
that she gave me the filter bracelet.

197
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,390
Yes.

198
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,550
She often came to our area

199
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,480
and sold small stuff.

200
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,850
But...

201
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,560
What's wrong?

202
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,680
She died of disease two years ago.

203
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,620
(Death Certificate, Liu Xiangping)

204
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,220
(Death Certificate, Liu Xiangping)

205
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,830
Thanks, officer.

206
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,110
If she passed away two years ago,

207
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,350
who could the person I met be?

208
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,590
You can use the filter
to become Fang Jin,

209
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,350
so someone else can

210
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,960
also use it to become the old lady.

211
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,550
The person who gave it to me

212
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
might be a man,

213
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,270
a woman,

214
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,000
an old lady,

215
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,110
or a young girl.

216
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,440
She can be anyone.

217
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,160
But I don't even know
what she looks like.

218
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,350
Where can I find her?

219
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,000
It's okay if we can't find her.

220
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,590
We've got the stuff.

221
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
We can study the object

222
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,760
to solve the problem.

223
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,640
The filter product you mentioned

224
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,790
can not only transform one's appearance
through visual deception

225
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,550
but also block someone

226
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,030
and make them invisible.

227
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,550
It's feasible in theory,

228
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,750
but in fact,

229
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,550
there are many problems
to be solved.

230
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
As far as I know,

231
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,070
there's no such product

232
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,790
throughout the world right now.

233
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,680
However, I'm not sure

234
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
if a private-funded lab

235
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
has similar products.

236
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,240
Okay.

237
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,070
Thank you, Professor He.

238
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,590
You're welcome.

239
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,550
You can ask me anything.

240
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll ask my friends
and classmates abroad.

241
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe I can find something.

242
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,350
What labs have the ability
to produce it?

243
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,240
I have an idea.

244
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,440
It's simple but effective.

245
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,150
What is it?

246
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,930
My friend is on vacation right now.

247
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll give you the password.

248
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,160
Go there with Su Chengcheng. I'm coming.

249
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,670
Okay.

250
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,110
Tell me the truth.

251
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,590
Why is she taking days off?

252
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,750
What problems does she need to solve?

253
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,030
I'll take you to see her right now.

254
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,960
What exactly happened?

255
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
I'll tell you later.

256
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,190
How's it going?

257
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,440
What material is this?

258
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,160
There's not a single scratch.

259
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,000
Chengcheng.

260
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,680
Not a single scratch.

261
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
As for the common metals
used to make bracelets,

262
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,440
silver's hardness is between 2.5 and 4,

263
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,070
and gold's hardness
is between 2.5 and 3.

264
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,640
The hardness of the filter material
is probably 7.

265
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,790
Only professionals can cut it

266
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,160
with a cutter.

267
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,110
But...

268
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,880
But it's on your wrist.

269
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,270
Even if we can see it,
we need to be very careful.

270
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,110
Otherwise, your hand might get hurt.

271
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,350
We shouldn't do it unless

272
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,590
we have no other choices.

273
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,960
I get it.

274
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,550
If we insist on cutting the bracelet

275
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,240
when we can't see it,

276
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,640
we might cut off my hand.

277
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,080
Chengcheng.

278
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,190
Chengcheng.

279
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,680
Let's find another way.

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,840
Chengcheng.

281
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,960
The filter is more complicated
than the invisible fruit.

282
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,200
It seems like it has

283
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,750
created a permanently sealed realm

284
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
and trapped Chengcheng in there.

285
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,550
In the 2D world,

286
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,720
no realms can be sealed forever.

287
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,270
So, in the 3D world,

288
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,160
no bracelets can be stuck
on one's hand forever.

289
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,510
We should find the right way

290
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,590
like the 2D characters.

291
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
What way?

292
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,390
I don't know,

293
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,350
but there's got to be a way.

294
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,030
Yuan is right.

295
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,810
It's made of a special material.

296
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,070
If we use force,

297
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,270
we might hurt Su Chengcheng.

298
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,790
It can't be the right way.

299
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,190
However,

300
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,110
if we find the key to the lock,

301
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,400
it might loosen and fall off.

302
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,520
Chengcheng.

303
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,110
Did you get hurt?

304
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What happened?

305
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,560
Chengcheng.

306
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,200
I can't see it.

307
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,830
But you must be honest.

308
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,670
Is it serious?

309
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,830
Wait here. I'll buy the medicine.

310
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,720
Cover yourself with this

311
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,560
so that others won't

312
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,960
sit on you by accident.

313
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,440
Wait here. I'll be right back.

314
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,920
Hello, it's 32.6 yuan in total.

315
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,080
Okay.

316
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,350
Please enter your passcode.

317
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,160
My son said

318
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,830
he transferred the money to my phone.

319
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,440
You just need to scan my code, right?

320
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes, I scanned it.

321
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
You just need to enter the passcode.

322
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,070
Pass...

323
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,590
Is it the phone's passcode?

324
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
No, it's not.

325
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,550
- Tomboy!
- You're a tomboy!

326
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,390
You're a tomboy!

327
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,510
You're a tomboy!

328
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,270
- You're a tomboy!
- Tomboy!

329
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,030
You lost to a girl!

330
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,160
So what?

331
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,110
You're a tomboy!

332
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,310
Big strength! Tomboy!

333
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,960
Big strength! Tomboy!

334
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,510
- Big strength!
- Tomboy!

335
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,590
Tomboy, don't run.

336
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,830
Tomboy, you're a tomboy.

337
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,550
Do you think you can escape?

338
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,440
- Tomboy.
- Yes, tomboy.

339
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm a girl! You lost!

340
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,640
We lost, so what?

341
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,200
Aren't you a tomboy?

342
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,240
Tom...

343
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,910
It hurts!

344
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,440
Don't be so rude. Be friendly.

345
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,000
Wh-What's wrong?

346
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,200
Monster.

347
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,680
Where is the monster?

348
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,200
Who... Who flicked my forehead?

349
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Show up!

350
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,350
- It hurts!
- Who is it?

351
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,480
Is there really a monster?

352
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,480

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,350
Chengcheng!

380
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,680
Chengcheng!

381
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,640
Chengcheng!

382
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,550
(She knew I was at the pharmacy.)

383
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,550
(She wouldn't leave
without saying a word.)

384
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,510
(She must be around.)

385
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,150
(Her phone is not turned off.)

386
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,550
(It still has power.)

387
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,280
(What happened?)

388
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,230
(She's still around)

389
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,710
(but won't answer me)

390
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,840
(or take my calls.)

391
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,230
(She's unconscious and can't hear me.)

392
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,710
(Even if she hears me, she can't move)

393
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,550
(or answer me.)

394
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,440
It's an optical illusion.

395
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,030
She must be around.

396
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,550
You're a tetrachromat

397
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,110
who can see 100 times

398
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,590
more colors than others do,

399
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,030
and you're sensitive to light.

400
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,190
You must protect your eyes.

401
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,070
Are you crazy?

402
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,840
You can die, but don't harm others.

403
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,030
Psycho.

404
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,350
Chengcheng.

405
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,320
Chengcheng!

406
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,870
Chengcheng!

407
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,200
Chengcheng!

408
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,760
Su Chengcheng!

409
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,480
Chengcheng! Chengcheng...

410
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,590
Don't worry. I'm okay.

411
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,320
It's okay.

412
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,320
It's okay.

413
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,030
I'm fine.

414
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,240
Don't worry.

415
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,150
It's okay.

416
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,110
I was freaked out.

417
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,320
Do you think

418
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,480
love is related to appearance?

419
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,880
There's one thing I can't figure out.

420
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,470
What?

421
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,760
Humans evolved from animals.

422
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,550
According to the laws of animals,

423
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,280
males should try harder

424
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,590
to look more charming.

425
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,000
Why is it completely
different for humans?

426
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,840
Women need to wear makeup,

427
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,070
high heels,

428
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,360
jewels, and fancy clothes

429
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,030
to make them more beautiful.

430
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,960
Perhaps it's because

431
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,190
women evolved faster than men

432
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,190
and have seen through
the essence of love.

433
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,030
Maybe human's love and appearance

434
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,440
are related and not related
at the same time.

435
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,760
Humans are just one species
in the planet.

436
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,630
However, we not only look up to the sky

437
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,030
but explore the space

438
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,630
and even fly to

439
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,030
another planet.

440
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,960
Due to the nature of animals,

441
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,400
we will be attracted

442
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,880
by others' appearance.

443
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
However,

444
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,030
love is the resonance between souls.

445
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
It's beyond appearance.

446
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,240
What about you?

447
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,150
How far have you evolved?

448
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,480
I need

449
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,710
a lifetime to answer this question.

450
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,240
Well,

451
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,360
what about Tang Qi?

452
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,630
Can his love transcend appearance?

453
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,630
Are you worried about her?

454
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,110
I trust my friend.

455
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,230
You should also trust your friend.

456
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,070
When Chengcheng is back,

457
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,150
ask her to invite Yuan

458
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,400
and her boyfriend over for dinner.

459
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,110
No need to wait.

460
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
Invite Yuan over this weekend.

461
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,250
Yuan is shy.

462
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,070
Chengcheng can keep her company.

463
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,710
Qingli told me that her boyfriend

464
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,880
is Chengcheng's boss.

465
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,960
More people, more fun.

466
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
It's up to you.

467
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,390
Who is it?

468
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,840
Let me see.

469
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,400
Coming.

470
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,030
Who are you?

471
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,030
Hello, Mr. Su.

472
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,840
We're Su Chengcheng's colleagues.

473
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,630
Her colleagues?

474
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,480
Come on in.

475
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,640
Come in.

476
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,440
Have some tea.

477
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,710
Mr. Gu said Su Chengcheng was ill.

478
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,070
We're here to visit her.

479
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,440
She's not at home.

480
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,280
Is she in the hospital?

481
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,550
Are you here to visit her?

482
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
Yes.

483
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,670
Aren't you on a business trip?

484
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,840
No one is on business trips right now.

485
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,070
Are you in the same department?

486
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,280
Yes?

487
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,720
Yes.

488
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
What's your favorite food?

489
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,760
Ice cream is my favorite.

490
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
Okay.

491
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,670
I'll buy more for you, okay?

492
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,680
Okay.

493
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,550
They've been waiting. Hurry.

494
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,390
Okay.

495
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,320
In TV series,

496
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,230
invisible people can do
whatever they want.

497
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,360
However,

498
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,920
I can't even leave the house.

499
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,070
People will be freaked out
when they see me eating potato chips.

500
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,230
Come in. Put it in the middle
of the yard.

501
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,760
Chengcheng.

502
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,510
Chengcheng.

503
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,760
I ordered a going-out gift for you.

504
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,030
- Here.
- Cheng...

505
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,320
Okay.

506
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,390
Then we're leaving.

507
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,800
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

508
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,870
Here.

509
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,390
Thanks.

510
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,400
What going-out gift?

511
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,500
(Mom)

512
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,030
I'm meeting with a client. What's wrong?

513
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,800
Chengcheng, come back now.

514
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,760
Your dad fell off in the bathroom.

515
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,590
Where's Su Chengcheng?

516
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,400
She's in the car.

517
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,550
This...

518
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,360
The filter suddenly malfunctioned

519
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,070
and turned her invisible.

520
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,000
