3
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,870
Is this the product you want to promote

4
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,560
as the theme
for the first physical store?

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,400
A blush with rich colors?

6
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,310
Colors are electromagnetic waves.

7
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,030
Light with different wavelengths

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
acts on the human visual organs,

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,870
producing color perception,

10
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,480
which leads to corresponding
psychological activities,

11
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,080
thereby affecting mood.

12
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,430
I hope

13
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,280
that when customers open our product
in the morning,

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,710
they will see colors
that make them feel happy.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,710
Though it's just a blush,

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,120
when they use the product,

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,520
it's like coloring a new day.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,710
These blushes are so beautiful.

19
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,470
If they're displayed in a physical store
with proper lighting,

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,350
they'll definitely catch
people's attention.

21
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,400
It's indeed beautiful.

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,150
What's this?

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,180
It's Plum Dye.

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,190
It's made with red plum blossoms,

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
so it's called Plum Dye.

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,150
In ancient books, tucao is bitter.

27
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,080
Rubus rosifolius's flowers are white,

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,180
so it's called Rubus White.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
What's this?

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,550
It looks like the color of chestnuts
fallen to the ground in autumn,

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,110
so it's called Falling Chestnut.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Suo comes from sappanwood.

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
It's a very important red dye,

34
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,310
so it's called Suo.

35
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,750
What does this mean?

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,470
Pleased as persimmons?

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,310
Light Persimmon.

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,010
It comes from an ancient term.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,400
This...

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,030
Is this a rhododendron?

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
Azalea.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Rhododendrons are also known as azaleas.

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,850
Do you want to try it on your face?

44
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,190
Only after using it yourself

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,800
can you understand
the customer's feelings.

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,630
OK, I'll try it on my face.

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,190
When you put on the blush,

48
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,590
the foundation plays

49
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,710
a critical role.

50
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,000
If you want to better understand
the product,

51
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,870
it's best to apply full makeup first.

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,190
If you don't understand the product,
you can't do well in marketing.

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,920
OK, I'll wear my makeup.

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
It's all for work.

55
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,790
Mr. Gu.

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,830
Could you leave us?

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,370
I need to discuss something
with Mr. Tang and Su Chengcheng.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
What's going on?

59
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,150
Su Chengcheng.

60
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,870
I asked you to open the class group

61
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,630
and watch the video file from Tang Qi.

62
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,470
Did you watch it?

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,270
The video file?

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,310
I watched it.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,950
What do you think
about the way Tang Qi treats you?

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,070
Tang Qi is pretty good to me.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
He just suggested you do your makeup.

68
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,830
Why were you so hesitant?

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,160
I just don't want to wear makeup.

70
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,250
Why don't you want to wear makeup?

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
I...

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
What do you think?

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,680
Tang Qi, aren't you really smart?

74
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,000
Why didn't you notice
your girlfriend's odd behavior?

75
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,170
I ran into Su Chengcheng
at the hospital today.

76
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,590
Why did you go to the hospital?

77
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,270
Are you sick?

78
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,390
I've never met anyone so clueless.

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Su Chengcheng...

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Su Chengcheng went to see
an obstetrician.

81
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
She's pregnant.

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,720
You're pregnant?

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,070
I'm pregnant?

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,200
How did you get pregnant?

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,270
Yeah, how did I get pregnant?

86
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,710
Is it

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
me?

88
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,310
Tang Qi, how can you say that?

89
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,270
Of course, it's you.

90
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,800
Right, of course, it's you.

91
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
You can leave.

92
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,190
I'll solve this

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,510
with Chengcheng.

94
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
Talk properly.

95
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,600
So, Lin Yuan is pregnant,

96
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,540
and you went with her
for the prenatal checkup?

97
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Yes.

98
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,040
No, I...

99
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,510
Lin Yuan is pregnant,

100
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,510
and she doesn't want others to know,

101
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,390
especially Gu Yu.

102
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
Why?

103
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,920
She hasn't decided
if she wants this child.

104
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,790
Mr. Gu, I'll get back to work now.

105
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,470
Tang,

106
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,870
why the long face?

107
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,030
Who are you mad at?

108
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,870
Su Chengcheng is pregnant
but hasn't told you.

109
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,340
You should reflect on yourself.

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,790
Why didn't your girlfriend tell you

111
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,430
she's pregnant?

112
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,940
It's a matter between the two of you,

113
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,750
but she'd rather carry it alone

114
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,670
than tell you.

115
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,750
What does this mean?

116
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,390
It means your girlfriend
doesn't trust you.

117
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,840
You should reflect on your actions.

118
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,630
Have you been caring enough?

119
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,960
Do you deserve her trust?

120
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Have you...

121
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,000
Su Chengcheng

122
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,320
still acts recklessly.

123
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,350
Could it be
that she doesn't want this child?

124
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,350
You...

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
I...

126
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,790
As your friend,

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
this is all I can do.

128
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,870
Next, you'll have
to solve this yourself.

129
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,750
Gu Yu.

130
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,750
What?

131
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,910
I don't know what to do.

132
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,320
What else can you do?

133
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,510
Just get married and have the child.

134
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,630
Tonight,

135
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,550
go to see Lin Yuan,

136
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,360
and have a private, good,

137
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,770
and patient conversation.

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
Got it.

139
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,100
You and Su Chengcheng
need to talk, right?

140
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't worry. Lin Yuan and I
will never disturb you.

141
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Good luck.

142
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,720
Time to leave.

143
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
Goodbye. Let's go.

144
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,230
Bye-bye.

145
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm leaving, Chengcheng. Bye-bye.

146
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Bye-bye.

147
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,990
Mr. Tang.

148
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
Sorry.

149
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,120
I can't stay with you tonight.

150
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,480
I had my dad cook some soup,

151
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,750
and I'm taking it to Lin Yuan

152
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,990
to help her with some nutrition.

153
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
Don't go.

154
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
Let Gu Yu take the soup to Lin Yuan.

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,030
No, Gu Yu is too smart,

156
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,300
and he'll definitely guess that.

157
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,820
If so, Lin Yuan would be mad at me.

158
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,240
From my perspective,

159
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,270
I should've told Gu Yu.

160
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,270
No, you...

161
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,070
But I promised you
I wouldn't say anything.

162
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,440
You have to keep your word.

163
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,630
Tonight,

164
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,200
let's both do nothing

165
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,550
and leave it to Gu Yu and Lin Yuan,

166
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,110
okay?

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
I bought the best ingredients.

168
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,640
We'll have dinner at home tonight.

169
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,960
Where are Chengcheng and Tang Qi?

170
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,870
They have something to do,

171
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,750
so they won't join us.

172
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,270
Pan-seared steak

173
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,080
and avocado salad are quick dishes.

174
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,450
It'll be done in half an hour.

175
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,550
What do Chengcheng
and Tang Qi need to do?

176
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,030
Tang Qi knows Su Chengcheng
is pregnant.

177
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,630
Chengcheng is pregnant?

178
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,080
That's their business.

179
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,320
Don't worry about it.

180
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,550
Let them handle it.

181
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,030
I'm about to pan-sear the steak,

182
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,180
and there will be some smoke.

183
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,120
Why don't you go upstairs for a while?

184
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,470
I...

185
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,470
I'll take you up.

186
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,670
This way, please.

187
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,230
For the steak,
how do you want it cooked?

188
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,960
Medium, medium-well, or well-done?

189
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,080
Yuan, dinner's ready.

190
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm driving home tonight,

191
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,760
so I didn't prepare wine.

192
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
OK.

193
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,960
The soup Mr. Su made
is really delicious.

194
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
Uncle's cooking is really good.

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Then try my cooking.

196
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,480
Here, have a shrimp.

197
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,720
You have a good appetite tonight.

198
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,480
I didn't have lunch,
so I'm a bit hungry.

199
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,960
Are you upset

200
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,300
because you wanted to keep it a secret,

201
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,120
but I told Tang Qi

202
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,470
that Su Chengcheng is pregnant?

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Why did you do that?

204
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,150
Being pregnant involves them both.

205
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,000
I think Tang Qi has the right to know.

206
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,150
This is Su Chengcheng
and Tang Qi's issue.

207
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,510
We don't need to get angry

208
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,440
or argue over it.

209
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,480
Anyway, this won't happen to us.

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,040
I don't want to get married
or have kids right now.

211
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,480
Can you really accept that?

212
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,670
I only want you.

213
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,510
But can your mom accept it

214
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,200
if you never get married or have kids?

215
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,150
This is my life,

216
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,840
not my mom's life.

217
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,350
Alright.

218
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,070
If Su Chengcheng wants to get pregnant,
get married, and have kids,

219
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,030
that's her life.

220
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,760
You are you.

221
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,200
There's no need to question yourself

222
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,350
or doubt me because of her.

223
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,000
We have our own lives.

224
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,310
Maybe

225
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,240
they'll be a little different
from most people's lives,

226
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,440
but we'll still live
fulfilling and happy lives.

227
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,750
I don't know
what's wrong with my mom.

228
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,550
She suddenly called me home

229
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,880
and insisted I bring you along.

230
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,680
There's a misunderstanding between us.

231
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,070
We can clear that up.

232
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
What misunderstanding?

233
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,750
Let's go upstairs first.

234
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Dad, Mom,

235
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,590
feel free to say it if you want to.

236
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,440
Why are you staring at us like this?

237
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,670
Go ahead.

238
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,240
When are you getting married?

239
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,190
Getting married?

240
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,510
I've checked the dates.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,720
There's a good day for marriage
next week.

242
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,640
Didn't you always say I was young

243
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,720
and not in a hurry?

244
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,410
Why the sudden rush
for me to get married?

245
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,110
We're not in a hurry,

246
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,200
but can that child wait?

247
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,190
Child?

248
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,920
What child?

249
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,350
Do you think I'm pregnant?

250
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,030
You misunderstood. I'm not.

251
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,440
You still won't admit it, huh?

252
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,510
Your sister heard it.

253
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,020
Do you still want to hide it from us?

254
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
It's really not me.

255
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,040
Not you?

256
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,070
Chengcheng isn't pregnant.

257
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,880
Who's pregnant then?

258
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,350
Who is it?

259
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,110
Who?

260
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,520
Uncle, Aunt.

261
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
It's Lin Yuan.

262
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,960
Lin Yuan isn't sure what to do.

263
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,260
She asked Chengcheng
to keep it a secret.

264
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,270
But accidentally,
Gu Yu misunderstood it,

265
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,760
thinking

266
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,690
Chengcheng was pregnant with my child.

267
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,200
It's not Chengcheng; it's Yuan.

268
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Yuan?

269
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,550
That's more serious.

270
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Call her and have her come over.

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,110
Otherwise, she'll make a fuss.

272
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,320
Dad, Dad.

273
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
No need to call her.

274
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Let's go there

275
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,550
and talk everything through
face-to-face.

276
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,240
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

277
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,200
Don't be impulsive. Let's talk slowly.

278
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,000
Usually, what you and Yuan do

279
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,110
is between you two.

280
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,480
Your dad and I don't get involved.

281
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,550
Now, this is between me and Yuan.

282
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm her mother,

283
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,300
so you shouldn't get involved.

284
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
Dad.

285
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,920
You can't go like this.
Gu Yu doesn't know yet.

286
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,550
Then we'll clear things up.

287
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,440
You've always told us about boundaries.

288
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,200
Now, you need to have
some boundaries too.

289
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,790
Don't interfere in our matters.

290
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,040
I...

291
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,110
Sis...

292
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,000
Look at them.
Do you think I can stop them?

293
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,030
Dad! Mom!

294
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,430
Here.

295
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,190
Don't move.

296
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
Did you get hurt?

297
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,240
Stand still.

298
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,940
Hold onto my shoulder.

299
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,350
Left foot.

300
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,630
Right foot.

301
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Alright, you can move now.

302
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,640
Sit on the sofa for a while.

303
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
Gu Yu,

304
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm pregnant.

305
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,160
It's not Chengcheng; it's me.

306
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,720
She just accompanied me for my checkup.

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
The doctor said everything was fine.

308
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,310
Sorry.

309
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
I didn't know how to tell you.

310
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,190
I...

311
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,880
I don't know.

312
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,960
If you're angry, I totally understand.

313
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,500
You should reflect on yourself.

314
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,090
Why didn't your girlfriend tell you

315
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,740
she's pregnant?

316
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,390
It's a matter between the two of you,

317
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
but she'd rather carry it alone

318
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,160
than tell you.

319
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
What does this mean?

320
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,270
It means your girlfriend
doesn't trust you.

321
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,200
You should reflect on your actions.

322
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,000
Have you been caring enough?

323
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,160
Do you deserve her trust?

324
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,640
It's okay.

325
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,750
You've told me now.

326
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,510
I don't feel confident
about being a mom,

327
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,830
and I don't know how to raise a child.

328
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm so scared.

329
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,270
I'm scared too.

330
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm scared
that I haven't done well enough,

331
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,590
so you don't trust me enough.

332
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm scared that I'll disappoint you.

333
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,680
I'm scared that after some time,

334
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,030
you'll get tired of me.

335
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,110
But up until today,

336
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,360
haven't we been getting along

337
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
pretty well?

338
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,480
Did you like the steak I made tonight?

339
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,200
Will you still be
my girlfriend tomorrow?

340
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,640
Will you still be my girlfriend
the day after tomorrow?

341
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,030
If you don't have confidence
about the future,

342
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,510
then let's not consider the future.

343
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,340
Let's just focus on the present.

344
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,270
Tomorrow, let's live like today.

345
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,480
The day after tomorrow,
let's live like tomorrow.

346
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,070
Let's take it one day at a time.

347
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,070
We'll leave the future
to decide when it comes.

348
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,300
(Chengcheng's Mom)

349
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,270
Everything looks fine.

350
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,020
Why does it say
the tire pressure is wrong?

351
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
I've been too busy with work

352
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,030
to have time for maintenance in a while.

353
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,830
Safety is the top priority.

354
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,340
You can't let this happen again.

355
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,960
Got it, Dad. It won't happen next time.

356
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,960
Why won't Yuan pick up the phone?

357
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
I just sent
a WeChat message to Chengcheng

358
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,440
to have her tell Lin Yuan

359
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,440
to come home tomorrow or the day after.

360
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,790
Can we leave now, Su?

361
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,320
Alright.

362
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,590
Mom, it's already nine.

363
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,070
With this car problem,
I can't drive too fast.

364
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,000
It'll be late when we arrive
at Lin Yuan's place.

365
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,240
Pregnant women
shouldn't stay up too late.

366
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,640
Right, safety first.

367
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,510
Fine, let's head home.

368
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,590
Alright.

369
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,720
Dad, get in the car.

370
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,400
I'll send Mom and Dad home.

371
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,880
You and Lin Yuan owe me a favor.

372
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,030
Thanks to my sister
at this critical moment.

373
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,090
Something's wrong
with your sister's tires?

374
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,440
Shall we go pick them up?

375
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,720
My sister is very careful with her life.

376
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,750
How could she make
such a simple mistake?

377
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,920
She's already had it checked.

378
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,350
They said it was a false alarm.

379
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,500
The car's onboard computer had a glitch,

380
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,510
and the tire was actually fine.

381
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,750
We've scheduled

382
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,610
a repair for this weekend
to clear the glitch,

383
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,160
but this happened tonight,

384
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,920
so she cleverly made use of it.

385
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
That's good.

386
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,790
You didn't eat much for dinner.
Are you hungry?

387
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes.

388
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,750
Come to my place.
I'll make you some wonton.

389
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,950
OK.

390
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,480
Gu Yu asked me to check the class group

391
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,920
and said you posted a video.

392
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,560
(Experimental Middle School
Alumni Association)

393
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,920
If the edges of the image shrink inward,
forming a pillow shape,

394
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,510
it's called pillow distortion.

395
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,750
If the edges of the image bulge outward,
forming a barrel shape,

396
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,590
it's called barrel distortion.

397
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,550
The focal length of the human eye
is about 50 mm.

398
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
If we treat the human eye
as the standard,

399
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,750
the most standard
shooting focal length is 50 mm.

400
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,680
However, the common focal lengths
for front-facing cameras

401
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,590
are 24 mm and 28 mm,

402
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,710
which are shorter
than the human eye's focal length,

403
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,400
so the images are severely distorted.

404
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,790
As for the rear-facing cameras,

405
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,160
it's hard for non-professionals

406
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,060
to control composition
and distance accurately,

407
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,340
so it'd still lead
to different levels of distortion

408
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
due to deviation
from the 50 mm focal length.

409
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,920
From an optical perspective,

410
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,270
moderate retouching

411
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,830
only restores
what the human eye truly sees,

412
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,930
so it's not falsification.

413
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,400
So, this is why
I don't look good in photos.

414
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
No wonder I always think

415
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,670
I look uglier in photos
than in the mirror.

416
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,550
So, it's not just an illusion,

417
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,880
and it has scientific backing.

418
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,560
So,

419
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,750
if you want to edit a photo, go ahead;

420
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
if you don't want to, don't.

421
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,070
Since this technology was invented,

422
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,030
it's meant to be used.

423
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,550
I know

424
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,000
you're trying to avoid filters now

425
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,830
after the filter bracelet incident,

426
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,270
and you even refuse to wear makeup.

427
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,000
But technologies aren't wrong.

428
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
What's wrong is overusing them.

429
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,750
As long as you know the limits
and use them properly,

430
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,980
the progress of science and technology

431
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,580
is ultimately for the benefit of humans.

432
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
When we get home,

433
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,030
I want to show you another video I made.

434
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
What video?

435
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
What's it about?

436
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,440
Squids and octopuses

437
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,350
are cephalopods among mollusks,

438
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,480
meaning their legs
are attached to their heads.

439
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,350
The difference is
that octopuses have eight legs,

440
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,550
while squids,
in addition to the eight legs,

441
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,310
also have two very long tentacles.

442
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,880
So, they look
like they have ten legs sometimes.

443
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,350
Both squids and octopuses

444
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,240
are very ferocious predators.

445
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,070
They can prey on fish, shellfish,

446
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,680
and shrimp that are smaller than them.

447
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,350
The most amazing part is

448
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,830
that squids and octopuses
can change color and shape.

449
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
Look.

450
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,640
This octopus was originally black,

451
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,850
but it can instantly change its color

452
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,830
and blend perfectly with the coral reef

453
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,670
behind it.

454
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,790
There's an octopus hidden
in each of the four pictures.

455
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,750
Can you find it?

456
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,550
I can't tell. Where is it?

457
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,680
Compared to them,
chameleons are too weak.

458
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,510
Squids and octopuses can change shape

459
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,730
to hide;

460
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,200
they can also change color
to communicate with their kind,

461
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,240
scare off enemies,

462
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,720
and even mimic other animals.

463
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,320
This mimic octopus gathers all its legs

464
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,030
and pretends to be a flounder.

465
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,510
That one

466
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,710
is acting

467
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,150
like a venomous lionfish.

468
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,870
And this one

469
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,070
hides in a hole

470
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,710
and only sticks out its two hands,

471
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,360
pretending to be a sea snake.

472
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,280
As it turns out, the mimic octopus

473
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,440
is the world's greatest actor.

474
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,000
If all the disguises are uncovered,

475
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,960
they have one last trick to escape.

476
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,640
What is it?

477
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Squids spit ink to escape.

478
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,710
The ink blob they spit

479
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,190
is about the same size as their body.

480
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
At the same time,

481
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,190
they make themselves
completely transparent

482
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,920
and escape in the opposite direction

483
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,360
so you can't see them.

484
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
Squids can also disappear invisibly.

485
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,440
I always thought

486
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,800
the filter bracelet
didn't make you invisible

487
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,280
to punish you.

488
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,110
Squid can spit out ink
and become transparent.

489
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,320
Do you think the evolution of this skill

490
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,110
is a punishment

491
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,320
or a reward?

492
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,360
It's just for survival.

493
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,870
Yes.

494
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,030
Invisibility isn't a punishment,

495
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
and nor is it a reward.

496
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,280
Are you saying I'm over-interpreting it?

497
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,840
The wind didn't move,
and nor did the flag.

498
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,000
It was the heart of the wise that moved.

499
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,030
I don't understand.

500
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,190
The advancement of science is not wrong.

501
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,630
We shouldn't overuse filters

502
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,760
to do illegal things or harm others.

503
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440
But it's perfectly fine

504
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,590
to use filters to modify yourself.

505
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,070
Just like makeup.

506
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Maybe you just want to please yourself.

507
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,070
Maybe you want
to attract someone you like.

508
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,670
Maybe you want to boost your confidence.

509
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,150
Maybe you want
to intimidate your enemies.

510
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,320
No matter the reason,

511
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,590
makeup itself is not wrong.

Morning.

524
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,110
You look beautiful today.

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,190
You look beautiful too.

526
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,010
Can you see my dark circles?

527
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,480
Last night, my kid had a stomach ache,

528
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,290
so my husband and I
stayed up half the night.

529
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,760
The hard-working moms
are the prettiest.

530
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,880
Women with sweet words
are also the prettiest.

531
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,440
You two are both pretty.

532
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,480
Confident women are the prettiest.

533
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
Men who can cheer people up
are the second pretties.

534
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,680
Praise me a little.

535
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,070
You're pretty. You're the prettiest.

536
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,960
Look at Chengcheng.

537
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,000
People who work hard
and make money are pretty.

538
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
Get ready for the meeting.

539
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,880
- OK.
- OK, pretty boss.

540
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,340
The origin of huadian

541
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,590
can be traced back
to the Spring and Autumn period.

542
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,230
The face of a painted female figurine

543
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,550
found in a tomb in Changsha

544
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,590
had three rows of trapezoidal dots.

545
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,190
According to Chinese Notes
to Things Old and New,

546
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,550
Qin Shi Huang loved immortals

547
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,800
and often ordered his maids
to style their hair,

548
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,330
put colorful dots on their faces,

549
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,590
and wear phoenix-like makeup.

550
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,000
Those dots are huadian.

551
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,190
By the Three Kingdoms period,
the dots on dimples became popular.

552
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Then Princess Shouyang invented
the plum blossom makeup.

553
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,840
In the Tang Dynasty, it was revived
because of Shangguan Wan'er.

554
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,330
It continued to be popular
during the Ten Kingdoms period.

555
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,680
Everyone,

556
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,550
when our first
physical experience store opens,

557
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,400
I want to combine our blush,

558
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,960
which is the rouge,

559
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,630
with traditional
Chinese huadian patterns.

560
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,280
Besides the cheeks,

561
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,110
it can also embellish eyebrows, eyes,

562
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,110
nose, lips, and other parts of the face,

563
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,110
allowing customers
to experience Chinese beauty

564
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,710
with modern cosmetics.

565
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,800
Wang Yi.

566
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,460
The location of the store
has been decided?

567
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,290
And the main products for the opening
have been chosen?

568
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,550
Now, all that's left
is the marketing plan.

569
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,350
Su Chengcheng.

570
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,070
Imagine a customer

571
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,480
walking into our physical store

572
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,190
and seeing the dazzling array
of rouge on the shelves.

573
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,240
At this point,

574
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,030
she might want to try Falling Chestnut

575
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,630
and Plum Dye at the same time.

576
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,190
I'd suggest she try one color

577
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,760
on each cheek

578
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,190
so she can compare them.

579
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,230
But if she also wants to try

580
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,630
Rubus White and Light Persimmon?

581
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Or if she wants to try

582
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,980
the blue huadian
from Court Ladies Preparing Silk

583
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,000
and the red huadian

584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
from Court Ladies with Peach Blossoms?

585
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,590
We have so many colors

586
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,840
and so many patterns.

587
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,880
The customer might want to try them all.

588
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,760
Though we have
the most professional staff

589
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,360
to help them select the right one,

590
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,070
hearing is still not the same
as seeing, right?

591
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,190
How can that be? That's too greedy.

592
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,510
Frequent makeup application and removal

593
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,070
would not only waste time

594
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,440
but also harm the skin.

595
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,400
Even if we're willing
to provide this service,

596
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,380
the customer can't afford

597
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,030
the time or harm to her skin.

598
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
This is a new program

599
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,190
developed by Xiuxiu Tech,

600
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,440
which can scan

601
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,670
the customer's facial data
in 3D on the spot.

602
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,360
Combined with a preset program,

603
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,090
through voice recognition
and interaction,

604
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,680
it can customize the makeup
according to the customer's request,

605
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,710
allowing the customer to experience

606
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,190
various makeup styles in a short time.

607
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,670
I hope that when the customer walks out

608
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,710
of our physical experience store,

609
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,150
she'll get the most suitable color

610
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,710
and realize that beauty
has no boundaries.

611
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,320
Great!

612
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,710
This experience plan is excellent.

613
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,360
Combining traditional Chinese culture

614
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,710
with modern technology,

615
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,400
it's made beauty both fashionable
and classical.

616
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,190
Very good. Well done.

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,140
