=Episode 26=

3
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,790
Good morning, Mr. Tang.

4
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,910
Good morning.

5
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,790
Why did you come up
from the underground garage?

6
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Did you buy a car?

7
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,870
No.

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
I got it.

9
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Someone gave you a ride.

10
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,600
I gave...

11
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,310
It must be your sister, right?

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,150
Your sister is so kind.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,150
You're so smart.

14
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,470
Thank you.

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
(In my heart,)

16
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,310
(Dr. Tang is the smartest person
in our company.)

17
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,430
Mr. Tang.

18
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,080
Don't be so polite. If I make a mistake,

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,190
you can just scold me.

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,910
Su Chengcheng, right?

21
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,560
Yes.

22
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,240
(Hahaha,)

23
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,910
(the extrovert person was freaked out
by the introverted person.)

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Su Chengcheng!

25
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
I think something big is happening.

26
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
Mr. Tang is so strange.

27
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,310
Young man, don't overthink it.

28
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,680
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Gu.

29
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,190
As you know,

30
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,360
Mr. Zhou and I

31
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,310
just visited Bai Mingzhu's team.

32
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,360
There's good news and bad news.

33
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,120
Which one do you want to know first?

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
The bad news is

35
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,270
starting today,

36
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,560
you have to work overtime.

37
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,000
I knew it.

38
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,310
Mr. Zhou, what's the good news?

39
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,870
The good news is

40
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,750
Ms. Bai Mingzhu...

41
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,870
agreed to be our brand ambassador!

42
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,370
Really?

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
That's the art of speaking.

44
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,870
See? They're happy to work overtime.

45
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,000
Ms. Bai is picky about products.

46
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
It's really rare for her
to accept our invitation.

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,480
So, I hope you try your best

48
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,360
and don't let Ms. Bai down.

49
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,680
- No problem!
- Absolutely!

50
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Try your best!

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,390
Try our best!

52
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,800
We're planning to use technology

53
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
to go back in time.

54
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,950
We'll use the phantom imaging technology
in holographic projection

55
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,120
to present middle-aged
and younger versions of Ms. Bai.

56
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,270
The VR technology

57
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,310
will let the audience see Ms. Bai

58
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,870
perform on the stage

59
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,160
with different versions of her
at the ages of 22 and 42.

60
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Younger version.

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
- Middle-aged version.
- Yes.

62
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,480
If we make it happen,

63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,600
not only Ms. Bai will like it,

64
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,000
but Ms. Bai's fans will be

65
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,750
so excited.

66
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,830
I want to talk to
the technical director alone.

67
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,790
Okay.

68
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

69
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Why are you here?

70
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,510
To check on you.

71
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,680
You've been standing all day.

72
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,790
You must be tired.

73
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,350
I brought you shoes.

74
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,870
I can do it myself.

75
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,110
Thanks.

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,750
You should wear comfortable shoes

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
when participating in activities.

78
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,390
It's tiring to wear high heels.

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,160
But we sell beauty.

80
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,430
Will Wang Yi and Zhao Yunjie

81
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,870
think you're not serious about work

82
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,720
just because you wear flat shoes?

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
Of course not.

84
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,360
I understand.

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,270
When you first came,

86
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,720
you were worried they'd judge

87
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,510
your capability by your appearance.

88
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,270
But you should be
confident in yourself now.

89
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,950
You've proved yourself
with your hard work.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,560
That's such a cliche.

91
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,910
I...

92
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,870
I'm not good at this.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,790
I feel much better now.
It's comfortable.

94
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,750
Thanks.

95
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,350
How will you thank me?

96
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,160
Tang...

97
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,750
Mr. Tang.

98
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Well...

99
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,510
You're so neat.

100
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,510
The mop...

101
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
You need to use the mop...

102
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes, to clean up.

103
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,720
If you say so.

104
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,030
Well, I'll...

105
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,870
leave you alone.

106
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,870
Go ahead.

107
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,790
Is he under a lot of pressure?

108
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,670
Sorry.

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm not ready.

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,910
I don't know how to face my colleagues.

111
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
It's okay.

112
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,550
We have plenty of time.

113
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
No need to rush.

114
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,510
Su Chengcheng, Su Chengcheng.

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
Go ahead.

116
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,670
Then I'm leaving.

117
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

118
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,960
Astragalus and Siberian ginseng

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,670
can help you relax.

120
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,550
Drink it in the morning

121
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,150
instead of at night.

122
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,630
Thanks.

123
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,630
Go back to rest.

124
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,670
They're hugging!

125
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,550
Is it a little bit fast?

126
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,910
Not at all.

127
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,150
It's normal for young couples

128
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,480
to hug each other.

129
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,910
Otherwise, something must be wrong.

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Then I'm leaving.

131
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,230
Bye.

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,840
Bye.

133
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,870
This is too much.

134
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,270
Not at all.

135
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't want to leave.

136
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
Well...

137
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,870
I'll walk you upstairs.

138
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,150
Chengcheng's boyfriend
is going to visit us.

139
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,510
This is too fast!

140
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,790
But he brought a gift.

141
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,390
We can't embarrass Chengcheng.

142
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,790
- Oh, no!
- Let's get prepared!

143
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,790
Get prepared!

144
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,750
Let's get changed.

145
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,120
Are you going out?

146
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,350
No.

147
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,270
Are you alone?

148
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,870
Didn't anyone come back with you?

149
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,910
Who's supposed to come back with me?

150
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
We're talking about Yuan.

151
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,600
Didn't Yuan come with you?

152
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,910
No.

153
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,720
Are these for us?

154
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,590
No.

155
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,670
This is my shoes.

156
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
And this is

157
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,000
the herb tea from my colleague.

158
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,510
Do you know something?

159
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Oh, no. We don't know anything.

160
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Su, do you know something?

161
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I don't know.

162
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,510
Chengcheng, should we

163
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,510
know something?

164
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,350
No.

165
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's get changed.

166
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,150
It's so tight.

167
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,720
Rest early.

168
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,910
Lin Yuan, you traitor!

169
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,230
Hello.

170
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,670
My parents...

171
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,480
Do they know

172
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,870
I'm in a relationship with Tang Qi?

173
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,870
They were beside me when I received

174
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,390
your WeChat message.

175
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,270
I didn't mean to.

176
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,630
Don't tell them

177
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,320
I know they already know it.

178
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
Otherwise, I'll tell them

179
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
Gu Yu and you are in a relationship.

180
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you think they don't know?

181
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,670
We're both doom...

182
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,200
It's just a matter

183
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,510
of time.

184
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,270
None of us can get away.

185
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,000
I want to stall for time
as long as I can.

186
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,080
Anyway, don't let them find out

187
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,510
I know they already know it,

188
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,350
okay?

189
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
Okay.

190
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,080
Tang Qi and I kissed.

191
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,960
What about you?

192
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,000

Not yet?

194
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,390
Gu Yu looks so skilled at this.

195
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,910
Why is he acting innocent?

196
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,360
I have something important to do.

197
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,790
Where are you?

198
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,230
At home.

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,960
Is Gu Yu with you?

200
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,080
What a mesmerizing night!

201
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,150
Do you know how to spell that word?

202
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,320
I don't know.

203
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,480
But I know how to spell "bed."

204
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't want to talk to you. Bye.

205
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,120
Shall we go on with the movie?

206
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,480

This...

211
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,270
The left part is missing.

212
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
And the right part too.

213
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,830
Sorry, I was so clumsy.

214
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,790
I was curious about the device.

215
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,070
I didn't know this could happen.

216
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
It has happened.

217
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
We should find a way.

218
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,640
Please try again.

219
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,920

We're trying to fix it.

227
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,400
But we need to adjust
the performance order.

228
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,880
Can you get on the stage first
to stall for time?

229
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,040
What?

230
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,270
How could this happen?

231
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,720
Okay, no problem.

Tell us more, please!

380
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,740
Come on!

381
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,940
- It's too wild to talk about in public.
- Yogurt.

382
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,940
- Let's drink.
- Tell us.

383
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,660
Don't drink too much.

384
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,820
I'm happy.

385
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Well, that night, we...

386
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,030
It's coming. Come on.

387
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,900
There's more.

388
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,620
Su Chengcheng,

389
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,220
our perfume has gone viral!

390
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,500
Come on!

391
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,140
Since last night, it has

392
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,500
- got five hot topics.
- Let me see.

393
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,180
Now it's still in the top 3!

394
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,060
Look at this.

395
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,460
In Perfume Rankings,

396
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,980
White Pony is the winner.

397
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,020
The sales volume of our

398
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,900
flagship store is now
the third place in all kinds.

399
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,700
The credit goes to everyone.

400
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
Thanks.

401
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,060
Thanks.

402
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,940
Thanks!

403
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,420
It's like an imitation show.

404
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,260
She's not sincere.

405
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,130
What?

406
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,870
Thanks, thank you so much!

407
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,260
You look happy.

408
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,220
There's something better.

409
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,580
Here's the extra reward for you.

410
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,940
It's real money.

411
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,260
3000-yuan voucher for everyone.

412
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,020
You can use it
or give it to your family.

413
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,900
Thanks, Mr. Gu!

414
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Hand them out.

415
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,940
What a coincidence.

416
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,900
Indeed. Allow me.

417
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,540
Thanks.

418
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,100
Mr. Tang.

419
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,740
I also want to drink
your handmade coffee.

420
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,500
Help yourself.

421
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,420
Mr. Tang doesn't like me.

422
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,580
It'd be strange if he liked you.

423
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,340
Su Chengcheng,
I need to tell you something.

424
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,940
What?

425
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,500
I...

426
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,300
I...

427
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,180
I was clumsy and broke the controller.

428
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,420
I almost ruined everything.

429
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,260
Thank you for not telling Mr. Gu

430
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,100
about my mistake.

431
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
I'll be very careful next time.
It won't happen again.

432
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,100
It's okay. It's hard
to avoid making mistakes.

433
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
As colleagues,

434
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,660
we should help each other.

435
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,380
- Bye.
- Wait a minute.

436
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,460
I want to find you a boyfriend.

437
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,940
My friends are all single.

438
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860
They like sports.

439
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,340
Choose someone you like.

440
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,660
I'll set up a date

441
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,980
for you this weekend.

442
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,380
You're so kind.

443
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,580
But

444
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,300
I already have a boyfriend.

445
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,700
You have a boyfriend?

446
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,980
When?

447
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,260
Not long ago.

448
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,780
What's he like?

449
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,700
He's always in the lab,

450
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,300
doesn't like socializing,

451
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,300
and is very serious

452
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,780
about work.

453
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,380
Mr. Tang.

454
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,180
Did you forget something?

455
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,180
I left my girlfriend here.

456
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,380
Let me introduce.

457
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,340
This is my boyfriend.

458
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,860
I've noticed Mr. Tang
has been acting strange.

459
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,180
Well...

460
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,980
The other day, in the elevator,

461
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,860
you... I...

462
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,220
I... You...

463
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,580
I'll leave you alone.

464
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,650
He forgot to make coffee.

465
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,460
No rush.

466
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,500
We have plenty of time.

467
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,980
We chose the wrong restaurant.

468
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,020
Everyone is here.

469
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,860
Hurry up and leave.

470
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,420
Look at the camera.

471
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,060
Let's focus on the meal.

472
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Just ignore them.

473
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,180
When I was little,
I went out with my sister,

474
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,540
and people would judge me.

475
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,540
We were clearly

476
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,220
wearing the same clothes.

477
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,940
But she was tall and slim,

478
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,060
while I was

479
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,860
short and dirty.

480
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,980
They even asked me

481
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,460
if we were real sisters.

482
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,300
My mom was so pissed off.

483
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,140
Are you worried
that they're talking about us?

484
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,660
You're such a good guy.

485
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,700
Now that we're together,

486
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,420
maybe people are also wondering

487
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,140
if we're really in a relationship.

488
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,780
In this world,

489
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,540
there are all kinds of people

490
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,780
and all kinds of opinions.

491
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
There are bad ones

492
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,820
as well as good ones.

493
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,020
I believe there are more good people.

494
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,580
I think more people would think

495
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,620
that this good guy

496
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,340
loves this girl so much

497
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,140
because she's also a great person.

498
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
This world can be changed.

499
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,100
No matter what they used to think,

500
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,260
we can change their opinions.

501
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,900
Aren't you ashamed of
flattering yourself?

502
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,740
Am I not great?

503
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,860
You're great.

504
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,100
But I'm also great.

505
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,380
I'm great, and so are you.

506
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,860
It's a fact

507
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,660
that cannot be denied.

508
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,500
Shall we share a table with them?

509
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,740
You must've known this.

510
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,580
However,

511
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,500
I still need to say this formally.

512
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,020
We are in a relationship.

513
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,940
Then I'll also introduce him.

514
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,220
This is Tang Qi, my boyfriend.

515
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,300
Hope you like him
as much as you like me.

516
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,900
If you don't like him, it's okay.

517
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,620
After all, he's got my love.

518
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,780
Mr. Tang.

519
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,580
Here's to you and Chengcheng.

520
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Hope you can always be happy and sweet

521
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
like today.

522
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,540
- That's right.
- Thanks.

523
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
Wish you happiness.

524
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,460
Thank you.

525
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,660
Thank you so much.

526
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Thanks.

527
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,460
You can't drink. Give it to me.

528
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,060
They're very kind to me.

529
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
I want to drink.

530
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,220
Okay.

531
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,820
Sit down.

532
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,420
Come on.

533
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,380
It hasn't been easy for him to get you.

534
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,260
Mr. Tang, we want to drink with you.

535
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,660
Yes. Congratulations, Mr. Tang.

536
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,260
I've never seen him so happy like this.

537
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,900
Mr. Tang, when did it happen?

538
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,460
Why didn't we know anything?

539
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,540
The first time I met you and Chengcheng,

540
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,780
I knew you'd be a great couple.

541
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,900
- Absolutely!
- Right?

542
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,900
Tell us.

543
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,940
(It turns out we can really change)

544
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,420
(what others think of us.)

545
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
It's getting cold.

546
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,740
Let's eat.

547
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,980
We're home.

548
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,060
Don't throw me down.

549
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,820
Don't throw me down.

550
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,330
Throw you down?

551
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,060
You still remember that?

552
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
Su Chengcheng!

553
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,300
What's wrong?

554
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,020
Are you not feeling well?

555
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,740
I like you.

556
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,500
I like you, too.

557
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,340
Go to sleep.

558
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,460
Su Chengcheng!

559
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,940
I'm here.

560
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,700
I like you.

561
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,740
I like you, too.

562
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,460
Go to sleep.

563
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,900
Su Chengcheng!

564
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,740
I...

565
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,420
Su Chengcheng.

566
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,500
I... I like you.

567
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
I want a hug.

568
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Okay, hug.

569
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,740
Should I let you drink or not?

570
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,020
I love you.

571
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,780
I love you, too.

572
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,020
Not on weekdays.

573
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,780
We can drink on weekends.

574
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,660
Let me go.

575
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,660
No.

576
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,100
Sleep together.

577
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,820
Forget it. Not on weekends either.

578
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,220
I want to go to the bathroom.

579
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,780
Then go.

580
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,900
I'm too weak to get up.

581
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,940
You should definitely quit drinking.
