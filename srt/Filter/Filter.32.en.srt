3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,920
I need to ask you
and Su Chengcheng a favor.

4
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
Go ahead.

5
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,200
Help me keep Uncle and Aunt

6
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,840
from mentioning the baby

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
to Yuan.

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,760
Pretend you know nothing.

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,230
Don't put pressure on her.

10
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,000
I thought you wanted Uncle and Aunt

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,910
to convince Lin Yuan to keep the baby.

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
I did consider that.

13
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,000
But after thinking it through last night…

14
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,630
Yuan's already under great pressure.

15
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,430
I can't let her make hasty decisions

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,030
under more stress.

17
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,080
That would backfire.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
We'll do our best.

19
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,150
We should buy you some time.

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Thanks.

21
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,470
You really want this child.

22
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,270
Of course.

23
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,310
Chengcheng said you promised to

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,890
respect Lin Yuan's decision.

25
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,630
I will respect her choice.

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
But I can

27
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
still proactively

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,910
influence her decision.

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
May you succeed.

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,150
That sounded a bit odd,

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
but not wrong.

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Alright, I'm leaving.

33
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,430
You seem to be doing quite well
on your own.

34
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,240
I feel myself hanging in mid-air,

35
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,750
neither up nor down,

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
unable to do anything.

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
I have to make a decision.

38
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,100
I hope you didn't skip work today

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,030
just because you found out I'm pregnant,

40
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,560
coming here to show me some warmth.

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
No.

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,750
I have an urgent task,

43
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,630
and I need your help.

44
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,920
That's why I came here.

45
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,070
We're opening our first physical store.

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
I've heard about it.

47
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,390
Tang wants to do a themed promotion

48
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,920
using blush, or rouge,

49
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,950
on the opening day.

50
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,270
Here's the information.

51
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,820
(Plum Dye, Robus White, Falling Chestnut,
Suo, Light Persimmon, Azalea)

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,070
The names are beautiful.

53
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,720
What do you want me to do?

54
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
You can see that

55
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,120
the plant illustrations for each rouge above

56
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
were all found online.

57
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,070
The styles and formats

58
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
are inconsistent.

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
We'd like you to help us

60
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,480
draw botanical illustrations
for all the rouges.

61
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,160
They need to be true
to the actual plants

62
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,360
and have a Chinese aesthetic.

63
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,070
And the artistic style
should be consistent.

64
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Ideally, after the artistic processing,

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,070
they can reflect the mood of each name.

66
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,000
In simple terms...

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
Got it.

68
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,720
For example, Plum Dye can just be

69
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,390
plum blossoms. It has to be Plum Dye.

70
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,350
Yes,

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
exactly.

72
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,600
We're short on time

73
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
and the requirements are high.

74
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,920
Hiring a random artist online

75
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
wouldn't be reliable.

76
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
That's why I thought of you.

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
I need your help.

78
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,070
This job isn't too hard,

79
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,720
but not too simple either.

80
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,270
With creativity,

81
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,920
it can be done quickly.

82
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,000
My own work's hit a rut lately.

83
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,390
I can help with your project!

84
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,070
I can provide

85
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,870
all kinds of creative materials.

86
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,270
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

87
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,360
Relax.

88
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,560
I meant

89
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,480
since I'm having a creative block,

90
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,270
taking side jobs

91
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,190
could refresh my mood.

92
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,070
It's perfect

93
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,160
that you'd like to help.

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,190
I'll whip up something in the kitchen.

95
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,120
You brainstorm first.

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
See if any ideas come up.

97
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,590
Okay.

98
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Yuan, dinner's ready.

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
Coming.

100
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,140
I just used whatever was in the fridge.

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,510
Here, try it.

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
You really just threw something together.

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
Just try it first.

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,630
You can even make fried rice with seaweed?

105
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,360
- How is it?
- Pretty good.

106
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,310
This is called mixed fried rice.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,950
It's the first dish I ever learned.

108
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,480
Let me think… I could make it
when I was seven.

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
How could your parents let you cook so early?

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,070
When I was six,

111
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,750
my dad passed away from liver cancer.

112
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,360
My mom worked at the hydropower plant,

113
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,680
working three shifts a day.

114
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,750
She had to be both mom and dad.

115
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,750
To make sure I didn't go hungry,

116
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,120
she taught me how to make this

117
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,390
when I was really young.

118
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,150
I…

119
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,870
I didn't know.

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,270
You didn't ask,
so I never brought it up.

121
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,480
Don't get me wrong,

122
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,840
my mom spoiled me.

123
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't suffer much.

124
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,630
At first,

125
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,720
my mom would chop all the vegetables

126
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,440
and put them on a small plate for me.

127
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,480
When I got home,
I'd just put the rice, eggs,

128
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
and the pre-chopped veggies

129
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,870
into the pan and stir-fry them.

130
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,790
Later,

131
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,000
when I could chop vegetables myself,

132
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,120
she stopped preparing anything.

133
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,320
She just left it to me,

134
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,270
letting me put in whatever I wanted.

135
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,550
Did your mom remarry later?

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
No.

137
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,150
She said she was too busy,

138
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
too overwhelmed taking care of us all.

139
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,080
She didn't want to marry again

140
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,510
and care for another man.

141
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,120
All of you?

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,030
Oh, she adored pets.

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Back then,

144
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,480
she was the sole breadwinner.

145
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,790
We still kept a cat,

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
a dog,

147
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,670
two parrots and a tank of fish.

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,790
We even had a chicken once.

149
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,480
A relative gave us eggs
from the countryside,

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,080
and a chick hatched unexpectedly.

151
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,030
So we raised it.

152
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,240
No wonder you love animals so much.

153
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,790
You take after your mom.

154
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,670
Mom says I take after my dad.

155
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,600
She first noticed him

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
when he nursed a bird

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
with a hurt leg.

158
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,100
People at the factory said

159
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,670
wild things couldn't survive,

160
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,320
but my dad saved it anyway.

161
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
After my mom retired,

162
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,870
she opened a pet store

163
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,200
with a friend.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,720
I didn't take you there earlier

165
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,750
to avoid making you nervous.

166
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,360
Instead, I took you

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
to the shops run by her friends.

168
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,200
Next time, if you're willing,

169
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,120
how about visiting my mom's shop?

170
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,600
I know why you're telling me all this.

171
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,030
You want me to keep the baby.

172
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,710
I…

173
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
I think…

174
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
I feel like…

175
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
we can try to embrace a new life

176
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,720
full of warmth and love.

177
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,910
Marriage won't become our burden.

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
I believe

179
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,150
you'll definitely be a great mom.

180
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,720
And I'll work hard to be a good dad.

181
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,550
And my mom,

182
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,510
she'll definitely
be a great grandma.

183
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
The baby…

184
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,030
will be loved by so many people.

185
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,390
It'll definitely have a happy childhood.

186
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
Yuan.

187
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,230
Gu Yu.

188
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,910
I've made up my mind.

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,840
I've decided to keep the baby.

190
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,960

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,980
(Clothing & Accessories)

379
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,840
How about this one?

380
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,000
Cute.

381
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,430
It is, right?

382
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,070
But what if it's a boy?

383
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,840
You're right.

384
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
But it's best to

385
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,000
buy a lot for both boys and girls.

386
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,760
How about this one?

387
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,070
Okay, let's get this.

388
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,400
They say not to buy too many baby clothes.

389
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,070
Babies grow so fast, changing every day.

390
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,510
They can't wear all of them.

391
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,830
It's fine, there's Chengcheng too.

392
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,920
Chengcheng?

393
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,070
If your child can't wear it,

394
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,110
Chengcheng's child can.

395
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,590
This one...

396
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,310
This one's adorable.

397
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,630
What do you think?

398
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,200
Who's that person?

399
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,520
Do you know her?

400
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,590
Gu Yu's mom.

401
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,920
Should we sneak away

402
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
and come back tomorrow?

403
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
No need.

404
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Let's...

405
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,640
go say hello.

406
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
Okay.

407
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
Let's go.

408
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,180
Auntie!

409
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,390
Yuan!

410
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,590
What a coincidence!

411
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,110
You're here too?

412
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,790
Yes, for baby stuff.

413
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
And this is…?

414
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,720
Godmother.

415
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,270
Hello, hello!

416
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,740
Though she calls me "Auntie",

417
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,310
I'm actually her godmother.

418
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,720
Yuan is like a daughter to me.

419
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,110
That's so nice.

420
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
Uh…

421
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,960
Well, you two go ahead and shop.

422
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll go take a look over there.

423
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,590
Auntie,

424
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,310
if you're not busy,

425
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,920
why don't we shop together?

426
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,190
Sure!

427
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,550
We're all here for baby stuff anyway.

428
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,750
- Right, right.
- Exactly, exactly.

429
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,160
Come on, let's go together.

430
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,240
- Look!
- Over there.

431
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,510
There are some cute little clothes.

432
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,110
How are you going to thank me?

433
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,730
I'll cover all your baby's essentials.

434
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,460
(Maternity & Baby Product Market)

435
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,750
Just kidding!

436
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,390
What do you want?

437
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
I want Yuan to be happy.

438
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,100
I'll work hard for that.

439
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,790
I also want to be happy myself.

440
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,680
Did you know?

441
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,820
In Chinese, "happiness" is symmetrical,

442
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,280
like two people standing side by side.

443
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,020
That's the meaning of it.

444
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,200
I've remembered everything

445
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,000
you've said.

446
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,720
I'm leaving now.

447
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,110
It seems like we only need
one of these.

448
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,000
No, no, no.

449
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,750
Take them all, take them all.

450
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,070
When the baby is as beautiful as Yuan...

451
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,160
Okay, let's start.

452
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you going camping?

453
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,780
Aren't you working overtime this weekend?

454
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,160
Try it out first.

455
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,110
So I'll be familiar with it when we go out.

456
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,070
Looks pretty good.

457
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,720
Want to take a look inside?

458
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,630
Sure.

459
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
I have a gift for you.

460
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,480
Is this...?

461
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,110
Su Miao's SIM card,

462
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,480
Fang Jin's SIM card,

463
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,790
and Quan Shengtang's SIM card.

464
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,610
Did you check the messages?

465
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,800
No.

466
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,070
Did you send them messages

467
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
after they died?

468
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,920
They're different versions of you, right?

469
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,960
If I send them messages,

470
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
it's just like talking to you.

471
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
Take it.

472
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,750
When you want me to see it,

473
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,040
let's check it together.

474
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay.

475
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,430
I...

476
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,790
I also prepared a gift for you.

477
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,760
What gift?

478
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,280
Earlier…

479
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,000
you said it looked pretty good, right?

480
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,960
What I meant was

481
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,000
this tent looked pretty good.

482
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,550
It probably cost a lot.

483
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,030
You knew it wasn't set up properly?

484
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,070
Then why did you still come in?

485
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,070
I thought it would hold up for an hour or so.

486
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,590
We just need to get out in time.

487
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,800
I didn't expect…

488
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
Here,

489
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
give me your hand.

490
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,920
What did you say you wanted to give me?

491
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,180
Never mind.

492
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,320
Let's clean up first.

493
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:21,760
I'll handle it.

494
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,430
What's wrong?

495
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,200
Nothing.

496
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
Let's eat first.

497
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
Did you find what you were looking for?

498
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,870
I did.

499
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,730
It's right where it's supposed to be.

500
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,590
When the tent collapsed,
it fell right on me.

501
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,550
I secretly tried it on,

502
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,000
and it fits pretty well.

503
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,550
Why did you prepare a ring for me?

504
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,110
Last time when I proposed to you,

505
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,840
you were hidden by the filter.

506
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,760
I couldn't see you.

507
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,960
I wanted to ask you face to face.

508
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,950
Tang Qi,

509
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,710
will you spend
the rest of your life with me?

510
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,070
I will.

511
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,320

We attend the same wedding,

526
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
and we still run into each other.

527
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,710

- Hurry.

00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,000
If I can't bully you,

567
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,230
can't I bully your weakness?

568
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,030
This is a wedding.

569
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
She's right.

570
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,960
Everyone, listen up!

571
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,230
Since the atmosphere is so lively,

572
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,710
let's move on to the next activity.

573
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,960
A game session.

574
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,110
Our first game is

575
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,590
arm wrestling
between the bride and groom!

576
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,550
Arm wrestling?

577
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,480
Arm... wrestling?

578
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,440
Listen carefully,

579
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,710
the winner of this game gets a reward,

580
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,800
but the loser gets a punishment.

581
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,110
Well, isn't this...

582
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,110
obviously forcing me to be a gentleman?

583
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,280
Go Chengcheng, go Chengcheng!

584
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,400
Go, go, go!

585
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:53,110
- Go Chengcheng, go Chengcheng!
- Go, go, go!

586
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,080
Go, go, go!

587
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,920
Down!

588
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Impressive!

589
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,840
Everyone, listen up!

590
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,400
I completely didn't expect this.

591
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,920
Let me announce the reward and punishment.

592
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
The winning side gets to kiss the losing side.

593
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,320
What kind of reward is that?

594
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,110
The groom's favorite reward!

595
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,110
Don't believe me?

596
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,800
- Mr. Tang, do you like it?
- I do.

597
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,640
See?

598
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

599
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,630
What… what kind of kiss is this?

600
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,480
Come on, you…

601
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,920
A pure goodnight kiss?

602
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:38,950
A real kiss!

603
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,110
Yes, yes, a real kiss!

604
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:51,630
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

605
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,480
(Time passes.)

606
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,280
(When we look back at the past,)

607
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,840
(we see moments in life)

608
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,550
(being recorded)

609
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,670
(cherished, and remembered.)

610
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,000
(The most touching part
isn't how beautiful we were,)

611
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,710
(how perfect we were,)

612
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,710
(or how young we were.)

613
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,400
(But that we were real.)

614
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,150
(We were truly living.)

615
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,440
(There were highlights.)

616
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,590
(dark moments,)

617
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,590
(beautiful moments,)

618
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,230
(and messy moments.)

619
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,960
(All these moments come together
to form our memories,)

620
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,840
(creating a life that's uniquely ours.)

621
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,060

to the ordinary you and me.)
