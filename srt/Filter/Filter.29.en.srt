00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,680
Hurry, hurry.

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,510
Who's here?

5
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,000
Uncle, let's go to the hospital
for a check-up.

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
He said he was too big

7
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,560
for us to move him.

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,190
He insisted on waiting for Chengcheng.

9
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,910
I brought my boyfriend to help.

10
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,750
Uncle, let's go to the hospital first.

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,430
You're Gu Yu, right?

12
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,150
Where is Chengcheng?

13
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,560
I've fallen,

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
and she's not even here to check on me.

15
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,960
Chengcheng, she...

16
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,190
Chengcheng is on her way back.

17
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,590
You're Chengcheng's boss, right?

18
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me.

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
Where exactly is Su Chengcheng?

20
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,560
Where was Dad hurt?

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,680
Why are you standing here?

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,150
Why haven't you gone to the hospital?

23
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,150
Why are you the only one who came back?

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
Didn't Chengcheng contact you?

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,910
Uncle insisted on waiting
for Chengcheng.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,680
I called an ambulance.

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
No need.

28
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,310
Let's wait for Chengcheng.

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't call.

30
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,870
Your dad's fine.

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,190
He's just upset
that Chengcheng lied to us.

32
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,750
Your dad wants to see her.

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Su Chengcheng, Tang Qi,

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
and you, Lin Yuan,

35
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,000
including Gu Yu.

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,030
You all told me

37
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,390
that Chengcheng was on a business trip.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
But two hours ago,

39
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,510
Chengcheng's colleague came here

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,430
and said she hadn't been
on any business trip.

41
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,470
She just took sick leave.

42
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,360
You were all just fooling me.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,630
She's not at home

44
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,560
and not at work.

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
Where has she gone?

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,800
Come out.

47
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,870
Uncle, Aunt.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,180
As soon as Chengcheng got the news,

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,760
she told me to come here at once.

50
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,720
What's with you?

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,870
Why are you dressed like this?

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,070
Take off that outfit.

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,950
I won't scold you.

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,430
Dad, Mom.

55
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,190
There's something

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
I need to tell you.

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,390
Chengcheng got

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,310
a filter that can change her appearance,

59
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,190
but it's made her invisible now?

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,510
Chengcheng is inside this doll,

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,750
but without her outer clothes,

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,390
we can't see her?

63
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
Yes.

64
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,510
Whatever she looks like,

65
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,050
she's still my daughter.

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,270
It's okay, Chengcheng.

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
Let me see you.

68
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Chengcheng...

69
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,110
Chengcheng.

70
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,150
Mom.

71
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
- Dad.
- Chengcheng.

72
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Don't be afraid.

73
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
We'll find a way.

74
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
There must be a way to solve it.

75
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,750
Dad, Mom.

76
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,800
The filter blocked Chengcheng's voice.

77
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,720
She can only communicate

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
by WeChat or by writing.

79
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,000
If you keep holding her like this,

80
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,950
she won't be able to say anything.

81
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Sit down first.

82
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Chengcheng.

83
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,750
Tell us whatever you want to say.

84
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,680
You can write it down.

85
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,040
Dad, Mom.

86
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,310
I've made you worry.

88
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,350
It's okay.

89
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,750
Don't be afraid.

90
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,680
How could this happen?

91
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,510
I've been reflecting on this these days.

92
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
The filter has always been unstable,

93
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,600
but why do I only

94
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,270
want to take off the filter today

95
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,000
when no one can see me?

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
When everyone

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,960
could still see me,

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,270
why didn't I make up my mind
to take it off?

99
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Even though I knew it wasn't right,

100
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,910
why did I keep using the filter

101
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,120
and letting it upgrade each time?

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Everything with you is wrong.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
What more do we need to ask you?

104
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,150
Don't delay our next interview.

105
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Su Chengcheng,

106
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
we know the result now.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,080
You can go home now.

108
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,280
Ladies first.

109
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,510
Thank you.

110
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,200
I pretended not to care,

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,080
but in reality,

112
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,870
I've always been dissatisfied
with my appearance.

113
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,910
I wanted to look
like other pretty girls,

114
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,270
not be ignored by anyone,

115
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,550
and gain the affection and respect
of people my age.

116
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,670
Because of my anxiety
about my appearance,

117
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,750
I could never give up the filter,

118
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,390
which led to today's outcome.

119
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,870
The filter kept upgrading,

120
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,720
slowly devouring my true self.

121
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,000
Now, no one can see me.

122
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,870
It's us who have failed you.

123
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,390
Though we've always said
we didn't care about your looks,

124
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,150
we've always thought

125
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,120
you didn't look as good as your sister,

126
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,220
and it'd be hard for you to get married.

127
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,750
But we didn't mean any harm.

128
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,790
It was all for your good.

129
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,200
But we didn't expect this good intention

130
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,320
to put a lot of pressure on you.

131
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Qingli,

132
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,200
introduce a boyfriend to Chengcheng.

133
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,910
Your sister hasn't even had a crush

134
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,120
since she was little.

135
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,550
I know you worry about me
because you love me.

136
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,840
I've never blamed you.

137
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,150
Did the interviewer criticize

138
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,670
the photo I edited for you?

139
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,870
Isn't this outfit too eye-catching?

140
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,240
Do you think others won't dress up?

141
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Everyone will dress up

142
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
to save face, spending all they have.

143
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,200
Are these skirt pants too short?

144
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,790
This is called healthy.

145
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Looking like a stick isn't beautiful.

146
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,390
That's sickly.

147
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,510
Chengcheng,

148
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,390
I've always comforted you
not to care about appearance

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,150
and sometimes purposely
looked unattractive

150
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,200
to show that I'm in this with you.

151
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,630
But if I didn't think
appearance mattered,

152
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,600
why would I do such things?

153
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,550
I'm also one of those
who created appearance anxiety for you.

154
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,080
Sorry.

155
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,360
During interviews,

156
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,270
I have judged people
based on their looks.

157
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,350
Sorry.

158
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,720
Beauty products sell beauty.

159
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,420
I hope the Marketing Department staff

160
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,500
can not only work hard

161
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,140
but also have a good appearance,

162
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,540
so they can be persuasive
when meeting clients.

163
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,820
I'll return to the palace.

164
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,660
Goodbye, Your Highness.

165
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
As my sister,

166
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,800
you've carried a lot of pressure

167
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,660
regarding appearance
since you were little.

168
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,700
Don't just dress up your doll
and do makeup for it.

169
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,300
You should put on makeup
and dress up too.

170
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,420
Look at you,

171
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,260
not even bothering to tidy yourself up.

172
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,820
Your face is oily enough to fry food.

173
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,100
Since you're at home unemployed,

174
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,220
you should study how to dress up.

175
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,460
Dress yourself up.

176
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,340
It's fine if you can't find a man,

177
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,340
but it's deadly if you can't find a job.

178
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,060
Being pretty isn't my fault,

179
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,900
so I don't want to say sorry.

180
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,340
But...

181
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Sorry.

182
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,620
Don't be upset or feel guilty.

183
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,740
It's me who wasn't confident
or brave enough.

184
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,820
Now, I understand

185
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,140
I can change how others see me.

186
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,540
I really like the person I am now.

187
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,820
Chengcheng.

188
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,420
Mom.

189
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,060
Chengcheng.

190
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Dad.

191
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,460
Uncle, Aunt.

192
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,140
Chengcheng is not alone this time.

193
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,760
We're in this together.

194
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,460
We'll definitely find a way
to remove the filter.

195
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,660
(Don't lose your happiness
to unimportant people.)

196
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,700
Chengcheng,
let's sleep together tonight.

197
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,260
You must be hungry.

198
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,260
I made some late-night snacks for you.

199
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
It's here.

200
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,660
The gloves are for Chengcheng.

201
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,340
Thank you.

202
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm thanking you on her behalf.

203
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,740
No.

204
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,860
Chengcheng would say,

205
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,900
"Thank you, my dear mom."

206
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,380
So childish.

207
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,500
Alright, eat then.

208
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,260
If it's not enough, I'll make more.

209
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
It's enough.

210
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,900
They can't eat too much at night.

211
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,180
It's bad for digestion.

212
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,060
Right.

213
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,020
Eat then.

214
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,860
Congrats on Su Chengcheng
for finding someone.

215
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Thank you.

216
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,940
With you all here,

217
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,620
even if I'm invisible forever,

218
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,140
I won't be afraid.

219
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,820
Can't you drink?

220
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,620
Chengcheng must be moved

221
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,060
to have such a good friend like me

222
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,200
and such a beautiful sister

223
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,020
like you.

224
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,500
Tonight,

225
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I'll sleep in my room.

226
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,860
Let's eat, everyone.

227
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,140
Time to eat.

228
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,820
Wear the gloves to eat.

229
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,980
I don't want to.

230
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,180
(My Mom)

231
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,220
My mom is invisible.

232
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,220
No one can see her

233
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,820
or hear her.

234
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Every time our family goes on a trip,

235
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,860
everyone can only see me and Dad,

236
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,340
but I know,

237
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,900
Mom has always been with us.

238
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,020
She loves me and Dad so much.

239
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,860
She often performs magic for me.

240
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,180
Tang Yuwen, you're lying.

241
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,460
You don't have a mom.

242
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, you're lying.
You don't have a mom.

243
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,060
- You're lying to us.
- I have a mom.

244
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,620
You don't have a mom.

245
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,820
- Tang Yuwen, you're lying.
- I do.

246
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,820
You don't have a mom.

247
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
You're lying.

248
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
You don't have a mom.

249
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,460
I have a mom!

250
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,660
A bunch of stupid kids.

251
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Tang Yuwen?

252
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,420
My son is a Tang?

253
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,060
I married Tang Qi?

254
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,540
(Tang Qi)
If I'm trapped by this filter

255
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,060
and remain invisible,

256
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,980
can you really accept

257
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,620
an invisible girlfriend?

258
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,300
Are you anxious
about your appearance again?

259
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm talking about being invisible.

260
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,340
That's different

261
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,520
from thinking I'm not pretty.

262
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,300
I guess this is the benefit
of being invisible.

263
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
Miss Su,

264
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,060
may I ask if you're free today?

265
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,460
What could I possibly be busy with?

266
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm free.

267
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,100
(Tang Qi)

268
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,180
Half an hour later,

269
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,460
I'll pick you up downstairs.

270
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,140
Let's have a date.

271
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,340
OK.

272
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,980
Keep walking.

273
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,460
I had a dream last night.

274
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,740
I dreamed our son was
in elementary school.

275
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,820
Do you know what our son's name is?

276
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,500
He's called Tang Yuwen (Chinese).

277
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,500
Why isn't he called Tang Tiyu (Sports)?

278
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,460
What are you talking about?

279
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,420
How did you know I was speaking?

280
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,260
Your facial muscles were moving.

281
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,700
Come on, let's keep walking.

282
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,860
OK, slow down.

283
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,740
We're here.

this is a special place.

288
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,220
The first time I waited joyfully

What is this?

322
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,060
When molten glass drips into cold water,

323
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,060
it'll solidify into a droplet

324
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,900
under gravity.

325
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,060
Named after the discoverer,

326
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,180
it's called Prince Rupert's drops.

327
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,340
It may seem simple in shape,

328
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,660
but its structure is special.

329
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,740
It's extremely hard.

330
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,900
Even when subjected
to eight tons of pressure

331
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,340
or shot with a bullet, it won't break.

332
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,180
It must be the hardest glass
in the world.

333
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,700
It can withstand eight tons of pressure,

334
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,640
and even bullets can't shatter it.

335
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,700
But if you pinch its critical point,

336
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,300
that is, this little tail...

337
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,860
You just need to pinch it a little hard,

338
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,740
and the whole drop

339
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,860
will shatter into pieces instantly

340
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,300
and completely crushed.

341
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,420
As it is both incredibly hard
and fragile,

342
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,100
Westerners often consider it

343
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,820
as a symbol of love.

344
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,500
This is the love you made then.

345
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,100
I will accept it.

346
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,780
Carry it with you when you go out.

347
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,860
Others can't see it,

348
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,300
but when you have an emergency,

349
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,500
you can pinch its tail.

350
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,900
No matter where you are,

351
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,460
I will be able to find you.

352
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,660
Your dad, mom, sister,

353
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,540
and Lin Yuan

354
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,900
will also be able to find you.

355
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,460
This time,

356
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,020
I'll never lose sight of you again.

357
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,060
Su Chengcheng,

358
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,340
will you marry me?

359
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,940

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,780

364
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,780
Yes.

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,900

♪Singing in harmony,

381
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Yuan always talks about you guys.

382
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,500
I should've come earlier,

383
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,380
but I only paid
my first official visit today.

384
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,300
It's my fault.

385
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
It's okay.

386
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,940
We originally wanted
to wait for Chengcheng

387
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,060
but she suddenly...

388
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,060
So, we couldn't manage it.

389
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,340
Aunt, Uncle, don't worry.

390
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,660
Tang is contacting the lab in Beijing.

391
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,270
With professional cutting tools,

392
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,800
they will definitely remove the filter.

393
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,900
Really?

394
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,750
Yes.

395
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,380
But it's special,

396
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,860
so Tang said it'd take some time
to arrange.

397
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,860
Those high-end experts

398
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,780
can even send such a big thing to Mars.

399
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,140
Surely, they can remove a bracelet.

400
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
Don't worry.

401
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,980
That's great.

402
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,180
Tang is

403
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,760
a reliable young man.

404
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,620
By the way,

405
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,080
I have a friend from the Qin Mountains.

406
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,760
I asked him
to buy some local specialties

407
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,860
from his fellow villagers.

408
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,260
This is...

409
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,780
Ferns. So tender.

410
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,180
You can't find
such tender ferns outside.

411
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,340
- Yeah.
- Good stuff.

412
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,230
This is...

413
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,100
I know this one too.

414
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,020
Walnut flowers,

415
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
also called longevity vegetables.

416
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,340
We haven't had this in years.

417
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,980
Hurry.

418
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,540
Go to the kitchen and soak it in water.

419
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,300
We'll stir-fry it tonight.

420
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,060
Alright, you chat.

421
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,300
I'll go soak it.

422
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,140
Alright.

423
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,560
These are wild mushrooms
from the mountains.

424
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,420
They just dried whatever they picked.

425
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,060
There are all sorts
of mushrooms.

426
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Smells so good.

427
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,500
I just bought a chicken this morning.

428
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,060
We can make a mushroom stew
with chicken tonight.

429
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,080
These are ginkgo nuts.

430
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Ginkgo nuts.

431
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,100
I've been watching a show lately
where they eat these.

432
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,100
I'll cook them for you tonight.

433
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,940
I promise

434
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,160
they'll taste better
than what you saw in the show.

435
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,060
Alright.

436
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,040
These are Chinese hickories
that my friend grows.

437
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,180
Yuan, take these to your aunt.

438
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
Help her clean up.

439
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,740
Some things are sensitive to moisture,

440
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,700
so package them up.

441
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,610
I'll help you.

442
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,230
Leave the walnuts.

443
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,580
Sit down and drink tea.

444
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,140
Drink some tea.

445
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,020
Walnuts.

446
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,340
I lost control

447
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,900
and used too much strength.

448
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,700
Gu,

449
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,860
Yuan's last name is Lin,

450
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,900
not Su like me,

451
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,940
but your aunt and I

452
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,660
have watched her grow up.

453
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,860
To us, she's like Chengcheng

454
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,460
and Qingli.

455
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,460
She suffered a lot when she was little.

456
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,860
If you're dating,

457
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,580
date seriously.

458
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,860
Even if things don't work out one day,

459
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,140
just be honest about it.

460
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,540
If there's anything sneaky,
making things complicated,

461
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,580
I'll be angry.

462
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,410
Don't worry, Uncle.

463
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,030
I'll remember that.

464
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,860
Good.

465
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,780
Have some tea and walnuts.

466
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,980
Sometimes, women don't need to know

467
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,180
some things men have discussed.

468
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,500
Yuan won't know.

469
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,260
Eat.

470
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,380
Try it.

471
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,220
Are these walnuts easy to crack?

472
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,500
It takes skill.

473
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,340
Decades of skill.

474
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,800
Give this to Chengcheng.

475
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,740
Give her more of this.

476
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,020
- Is it good?
- Yes.

477
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,240
You eat it.

478
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,060
Mom, I don't want it.
Please don't add more.

479
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,900
You eat it.

480
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,500
Just eat.

481
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,220
Cheers, everyone.

482
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,700
Come on.

483
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,180
Welcome Tang and Gu
to our home for dinner.

484
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,100
Is Chengcheng still here?

485
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,810
Eat more.

486
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,620
Come on.

487
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,950
Come on.

488
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,890
Eat more.

489
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,180
Come on, cheers.

490
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
Thank you, Uncle, Aunt,

491
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,740
for preparing so many goodies for us.

492
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,960
No wonder Yuan always says

493
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,260
that the food outside is never
as good as what you make.

494
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,230
Alright.

495
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,500
Thank you, Uncle, Aunt.

496
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,580
It's fine.

497
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,420
Don't be so polite.

498
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Eat more.

499
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,330
OK.

500
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,940
Tang Qi, you should just

501
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,780
copy whatever Gu Yu says

502
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,900
in the future,

503
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,500
and you won't make any mistakes.

504
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,380
Uncle, I'll toast to you again.

505
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,620
Alright.

506
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,500
Uncle,

507
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,220
cheers.

508
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,560
- Let's drink together.
- Come on!

509
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,820
What did I just say?

510
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,980
Eat this.

511
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
Thank you, Aunt.

512
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,220
- Try it.
- Everyone, try it.

513
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,220
Here, have some of this.

514
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,740
The dried tofu is delicious.

515
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,260
I love you all.

516
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,500
Not mine.

517
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,220
It's not mine either.

518
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,220
Chengcheng?

519
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,780
I didn't bring it.

520
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,040
Chengcheng.

521
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,760
Is it the filter?

522
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,940
(Answer)

523
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,920
Hello?

524
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,460
Don't you like the filter?

525
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,300
No.

526
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Don't you like doing whatever you like

527
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,220
and become more beautiful and charming?

528
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,580
I do,

529
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,220
but I like being myself more.

530
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,580
My friends,

531
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,340
my boyfriend,

532
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,060
my parents, and my sister...

533
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,180
They like me,

534
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,140
not Su Miao,

535
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,860
Fang Jin,

536
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,980
or Quan Shengtang.

537
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,020
I just want to be myself.

538
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,420
See you tomorrow night
at the same place.

539
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,500
Don't be nervous.

540
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,460
Since she contacted you,

541
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,800
she must be willing to solve it too.

542
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,060
That stuff there is really great.

543
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,900
Really?

544
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,180
I'll take you there next time.

545
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,060
Great.

546
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,220
Are we almost there?

547
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,940
Yes, almost.

548
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,460
- Sorry, Miss.
- Sorry, Miss.

549
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,860
How could you be so careless?

550
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,320
I wasn't paying attention.

551
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,060
She can see me.

552
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,020
I can see you too.

553
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,460
You can see me too?

554
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,600
Can you see her?

555
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,940
- This is my girlfriend.
- Yes.

556
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,780
My girlfriend.

557
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,380
Can you see her? This is my girlfriend.

558
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,980
- How pretty.
- This is my girlfriend.

559
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,460
See? This is my girlfriend.

560
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes. She's really pretty.

561
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,380
Yes, we all saw her.

562
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,470
Your girlfriend.

563
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,340
Granny.

564
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,490
Seems like you really like
the way you are now.

565
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,220
Thank you for participating
in our filter experiment.

566
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,860
This filter is for you.

567
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,060
I don't want it.

568
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,780
I just want to stay true to myself.

569
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,780
This filter is powerful,

570
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,860
especially after this test.

571
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,940
It will be even more stable.

572
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,840
Are you really willing to give it up?

573
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,700
I just want to be my true self

574
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,500
every day of my future.

575
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,860
Then give it back to me.

576
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,620
Goodbye.

577
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,940
Goodbye.

578
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,420
Granny, who are you?

579
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,700
Goodbye.

580
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,740
Your girlfriend no longer
has special powers.

581
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,260
Now, she's an ordinary girl.

582
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,620
I can rest easy now.

583
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,540
In the past, scientists thought
chameleons changed color

584
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,260
because of pigment cells
in their bodies,

585
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,180
but recently it's been discovered
that chameleons have a layer

586
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,540
of nanocrystals on their skin.

587
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,860
So, they change color

588
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,060
by adjusting the nanocrystals

589
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,940
to alter the light's refraction.

590
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,140
Qingli,

591
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,860
aren't you curious why it doesn't change

592
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,420
to a color like a rock?

593
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,060
I'm curious.

594
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Go ahead. Tell me why.

595
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,940
When chameleons want to avoid predators

596
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,620
or chase prey,

597
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,940
they change their colors to blend

598
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,860
with their surroundings.

599
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,140
But most of the time,

600
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,380
chameleons change their colors
to send messages.

601
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,990
Since they can't hear or smell,

602
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,300
they rely on their colors

603
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,540
to communicate with their kind.

604
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,390
For example,

605
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,980
when other animals

606
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,460
enter their territory,

607
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,980
they turn to bright colors

608
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,500
like red or yellow

609
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,300
to warn them.

610
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,460
Just now, it was anxious,

611
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,860
treating us as enemies,

612
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,140
so it changed colors so often,

613
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,980
trying to hide itself.

614
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,860
To protect its territory,

615
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,980
it had no choice
but to turn bright to scare us.

616
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,660
Don't be scared. We're friends,

617
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,580
not enemies.

618
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,420
Is this the gift you want
to give to Chengcheng?

619
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,780
Don't you think it looks like a girl?

620
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,740
Sometimes, it disguises itself

621
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,460
and pretends to be flashy

622
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,380
only to cover up its insecurity

623
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,020
and encourage itself to be confident.

624
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,420
Sometimes, it disguises itself

625
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,980
to fit in like everyone else,

626
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,620
instead of being eliminated by nature.

627
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,240
It's indeed like a girl.

628
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,440
I just want Chengcheng to see

629
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,020
that the world is full of diversity,

630
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,780
and she's not the only one
who can change.

631
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,380
Even if she can't take the filter off,

632
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,620
she can still live vibrantly,

633
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,940
like a chameleon.

634
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,340
How considerate of you.

635
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,540
See?

636
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,940
I told you Qingli and Chengcheng
would love it.

637
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,140
Let me check the time.

638
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,540
It's not what I'm thinking.

639
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,020
I want to send Chengcheng a message.

640
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,500
Don't worry.

641
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,500
We've found the old lady.

642
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,260
There must be a solution.

643
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,320
The door has opened.

644
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,260
She's back?

645
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,220
Chengcheng's back?

646
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,060
Uncle, Aunt.

647
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,380
You must be hungry.

648
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,780
Let's get the rice.

649
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,680
I'm stir-frying some vegetables.

650
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,820
Get ready to eat.

651
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,280
Dad, Mom.

652
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,380
Chengcheng!

653
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm back to normal.

654
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,900
My goodness!

655
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,780
- We can finally see and touch you.
- Dad.

656
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,700
- You bad girl.
- Mom.

657
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,500
It took so long.

658
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Sorry for worrying you.

659
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Let me take a look.

660
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,100
You bad girl, how dare you scare us!

661
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,140
If it happens again,

662
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,500
I'll really deal with you.

663
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,900
Mom, Su Qingli is threatening me.

664
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,060
Such a tattletale.

665
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Alright.

666
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,100
Go serve the dishes.

667
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
Be helpful, okay?

668
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,100
I'll go grab the cutlery.

669
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,500
And you.

670
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,060
Take off this clumsy

671
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,940
and annoying thing.

672
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,540
You look like a big bear.

673
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,700
Su, hurry up. They're hungry.

674
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,740
Alright, alright.

675
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,300
Uncle, how about I make the last dish?

676
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,620
I'd love to show you my cooking.

677
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,660
Yes, yes.

678
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,740
No need, you're guests.

679
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,860
I'll do it.

680
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,900
Alright.

681
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,940
Just bring out the dining table.

682
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,660
Mr. Gu, you're really capable.

683
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,020
Not at all.
It's all thanks to my weak peer.

684
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,780
