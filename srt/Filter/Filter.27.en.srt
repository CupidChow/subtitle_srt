3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
It's done?

4
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Then

5
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
I'll head back now.

6
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,880
Be careful on the way.

7
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Stay safe.

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
OK.

9
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Gu Yu.

10
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,630
What's wrong?

11
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,440
I bought a bottle of wine.

12
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,790
Do you want to have some?

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Sure.

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,300
Welcome home.

15
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,510
He finally got a girlfriend.

16
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,630
Alright. Get up, get up.

17
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,720
I can't. I'm sleepy.

18
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
If you don't get up...

19
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,670
I...

20
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,310
How can you do this?

21
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

22
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,270
Mom.

23
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,990
Why are you here?

24
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,990
Did I come at the wrong time?

25
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,240
Don't worry. I won't be a third wheel.

26
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,450
I'll leave as soon as I'm done.

27
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Mom,

28
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,830
I have a girlfriend now.

29
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,870
Her name is Su Chengcheng.

30
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,550
Last night, I got drunk,

31
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,280
and she took me home.

32
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
I'll introduce you to her later.

33
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,670
Great.

34
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,600
Time to eat.

35
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,760
Mom, this is my girlfriend, Su...

36
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,110
Chengcheng.

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
Mrs. Tang.

38
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,910
Chengcheng and I raised this alpaca.

39
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,470
(I've become an alpaca again?)

40
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,470
(Why is the filter acting crazy again?)

41
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,230
Go ahead.

42
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,980
(3D Printing)

43
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,820
(Alpaca)

44
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,350
This alpaca can speak human language?

45
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,670
It called me Mrs. Tang.

46
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,310
You must've heard wrong, Mom.

47
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,430
The alpaca has a very unique voice.

48
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Sometimes it makes sounds

49
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,990
like ah-yee-tang.

50
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,950
Just now, you mistook that

51
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,160
for Mrs. Tang.

52
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,430
Oh, that's fine.

53
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,720
It scared me.

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
Get ready to eat.

55
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,960
(Did Chengcheng accidentally
hit the filter?)

56
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,160
He...

57
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,840
He can't be Su Chengcheng, right?

58
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Of course not.

59
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,240
He's Quan Shengtang.

60
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,790
He's our friend, Quan Shengtang.

61
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,430
He can't talk?

62
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,470
He...

63
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,110
His tonsils are inflamed.

64
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
His throat is damaged.

65
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,160
He can't speak now.

66
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,060
Your girlfriend

67
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,790
and your friend

68
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,590
are in your bedroom?

69
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,120
Mom, I'll explain it later.

70
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
You go home first.

71
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,160
No.

72
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,710
I need to figure this out today.

73
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,000
- Mom, please go home.
- Don't stop me.

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,280
Mom, don't disturb them.

75
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,910
This must be

76
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,120
Su Chengcheng, right?

77
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
No.

78
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,430
She's Su Chengcheng's friend,

79
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,390
Fang Jin.

80
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,670
Hello.

81
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,950
So, where's your girlfriend?

82
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
And the other guy?

83
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
Where's the alpaca?

84
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,040
Are they inside?

85
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,360
Mom, Mom...

86
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
Could they be in there?

87
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,120
Chengcheng can't see you right now.

88
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll introduce you next time.

89
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,000
Mrs. Tang,

90
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,710
we are studying the faux fur of alpacas.

91
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Right.

92
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Right.

93
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,160
When Chengcheng was
taking care of the alpaca,

94
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,440
she was accidentally kicked in the face.

95
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,980
She's too embarrassed to meet you.

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,280
Is the injury serious?

97
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
No.

98
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,970
Her left cheek is swollen,

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,790
but it's not a big deal.

100
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,160
It just looks bad right now,

101
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,480
so she can't see you.

102
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,190
Girls care about their image.

103
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,720
I understand.

104
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
Well,

105
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,790
I won't see her this time.

106
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Chengcheng,

107
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,550
I'm leaving now.

108
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,720
Take care of your injury.

109
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
We'll talk next time.

110
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,120
Yeah, next time.

111
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,710
Goodbye, Mrs. Tang.

112
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,510
Goodbye. I...

113
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,590
Mom, I'll walk you out.

114
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,670
Well.

115
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,790
You can meet her next time.

116
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,710
Why do you always mess up
at crucial moments?

117
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,440
Mom.

118
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,510
Dating isn't like doing an experiment.

119
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,910
Don't be so rigid about everything.

120
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,830
You need to say some sweet things.

121
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,040
You need to pamper your girlfriend.

122
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
Got it, Mom.

123
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,040
Here, I'll book you a ride.

124
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,210
I'm your emergency contact now.

125
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,080
Once you're home,

126
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll get a notification right away.

127
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
OK.

128
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,230
Alright.

129
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,120
I'll see you off.

130
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,830
When Chengcheng's recovered,

131
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,480
and it's convenient for you,

132
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,670
we should set a time

133
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,120
for a proper meeting.

134
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Got it, Mom.

135
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
It's all you talked about on the way.

136
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
Hurry up and go back.

137
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Remember this.

138
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,950
You're rushing me again.

139
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,310
Slow down.

140
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Go home.

141
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
(Voice Change, Beauty Filter,
Outfit, Effect, Auto)

142
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,420
(3D Creation, Full Screen,
Hide, 3D Printing)

143
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,520
The filter hasn't been updated.

144
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,310
The weather's fine too.

145
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,280
No thunder, no rain.

146
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,790
Nothing's wrong.

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,840
Chengcheng.

148
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,880
It's so weird.

149
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,710
I keep changing,

150
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,880
but it's normal without any problems.

151
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,670
Has the filter changed like this before?

152
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,670
Except for system updates,

153
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,520
it only becomes unstable
during thunders.

154
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,910
Usually, it works fine.

155
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,550
You really like me, don't you?

156
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,790
You've become me.

157
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,070
Isn't it cute?

158
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,920
It's cute.

159
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,240
How shameless.
You're flattering yourself.

160
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
You're not cute then.

161
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,950
How can you say I'm not cute?

162
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,880
No matter what Su Chengcheng looks like,

163
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,140
she's always the cutest.

164
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,950
There's nothing wrong.

165
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,960
Why did it go wrong

166
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,310
when I needed to meet your mom?

167
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,810
Let's have breakfast first.

168
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
We can figure out
how to take it off later

169
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,590
and try to use it less.

170
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,750
OK.

171
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Thanks.

172
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Is it good?

173
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
My mom used to dislike cooking

174
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,650
and wasn't good at it either.

175
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,190
Now that she's retired,

176
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,310
she actually enjoys cooking.

177
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,310
So, remember:

178
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,870
When she invites you for a meal,

179
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,950
make sure to suggest

180
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,070
going to a restaurant.

181
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,590
Got it.

182
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,310
Did I scare your mom today?

183
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,910
She was a bit startled,

184
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,830
but with the huge surprise,

185
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,670
she was too happy to notice.

186
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,040
A huge surprise?

187
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
Her son finally has a girlfriend.

188
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,580
(Angry Sister)

189
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
It's my sister.

190
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,310
Hello, sis.

191
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,190
You didn't come home last night again?

192
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,880
Did you sleep at Tang Qi's place?

193
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,390
Tang Qi got drunk yesterday,

194
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,190
so I came to take care of him.

195
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,290
Did Mom and Dad ask you to ask me?

196
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Anyway,

197
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,840
they already know everything

198
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,790
whether you want or not.

199
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,200
Dad said he's making a big dinner,

200
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,520
so bring Tang Qi along after work.

201
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,670
Tonight?

202
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
I'll check with Tang Qi

203
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
and discuss it with him.

204
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,350
Su Chengcheng,

205
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm not asking you.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm telling you.

207
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,080
Done.

208
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,520
I've called them back.

209
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
Can I have breakfast now?

210
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,480
- Sure.
- Eat.

211
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,350
- Come on, eat.
- Hurry up.

212
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,190
Here.

213
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,240
I made the xiaolongbao
for you this morning.

214
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,550
Yes. The soy milk is still hot.

215
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,200
There's also corn, good for dieting.

216
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,960
Chengcheng is trying to trick us.

217
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,870
I called Yuan this morning.

218
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,790
She's also in a relationship.

219
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,720
But she's dating seriously at home.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,270
So,

221
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,830
Yuan makes us less worried.

222
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,800
Right.

223
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,630
- Good morning, Mr. Gu.
- Good morning.

224
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,760
This is my office, right?

225
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,520
Are you learning how to cook?

226
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,390
May I ask what brings you here?

227
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,590
I have a question.

228
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
Go ahead.

229
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,260
I'm going to Chengcheng's house
for dinner tonight.

230
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm a bit nervous.

231
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,000
What if her parents don't like me?

232
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,110
You're dating Su Chengcheng,

233
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,680
not her parents.

234
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,850
Su Chengcheng likes you,
and that's all that matters.

235
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,870
That's true,

236
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
but

237
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,350
Chengcheng is very close to her parents.

238
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
She really values family.

239
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't want her
to feel torn between us.

240
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,070
It's best to win
over her parents' favor.

241
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,350
As expected.

242
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
It can only be like this.

243
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,720
What does that mean?

244
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,280
I've read these two books.

245
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,550
You can read them now.

246
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,620
Recipes from the Garden of Contentment.

247
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,720
My Sichuan Cuisine.

248
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,390
Su Chengcheng's parents
are skilled in cooking,

249
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,680
especially her dad.

250
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,520
He loves food and is good at it.

251
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,680
The places he loves to visit

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,350
are either the gym or the market.

253
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,110
He values seasonal ingredients
and enjoys fresh produce.

254
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,720
Good for you.

255
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
I'll borrow all these.

256
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,000
- These two...
- I'll be tested tonight,

257
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,000
and I'll share the tips
with you tomorrow.

258
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,780
(The Gourmand's Notes)

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,350
Are you nervous?

260
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,590
Not really.

261
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,000
Just sit back and relax.

262
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
Let me see.

263
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,390
Tang.

264
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,680
- Uncle.
- Have some fruit.

265
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,040
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Come on.

266
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,000
Even if it looks a bit rough...

267
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,310
I love the domestic Huaniu apples.

268
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,350
The imported Red Delicious
at the supermarket

269
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,720
looks shiny and pretty,

270
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,550
but they don't taste as fruity
as Huaniu apples.

271
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,590
An expert.

272
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,590
The supermarket

273
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,960
only has Red Delicious.

274
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,030
The Huaniu apples are rare.

275
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,240
You can hardly find them.

276
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,580
- Chengcheng, try some too.
- Aunt.

277
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,960
Don't stand on ceremony. Sit down.

278
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,040
Try some freshly brewed tea.

279
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,440
Thank you, Aunt.

280
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,280
It's hot. Be careful.

281
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,440
This is white tea, right?

282
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,150
My mom loves white tea too.

283
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,920
But this tastes a little different

284
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,790
from my mom's tea.

285
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,070
This tea is grown by Chengcheng's uncle.

286
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,440
If you like it,

287
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,070
you can take two bags when you leave

288
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,440
so your mom can try it too.

289
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Then I'll take some.

290
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
Thank you, Aunt.

291
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,870
Have some fruit. You chat.

292
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,580
There are two more dishes
in the kitchen.

293
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,070
We'll have dinner once they're ready.

294
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,920
- OK.
- OK.

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,550
Chengcheng, come and help.

296
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Bye.

297
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
Chengcheng,

298
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,510
go to the supermarket
in the neighborhood

299
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,440
and buy vinegar for me.

300
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,040
Isn't there vinegar here?

301
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,680
I want white vinegar,

302
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,310
the kind used for cold dishes.

303
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,790
It's all vinegar. The taste is similar.

304
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,760
Of course, they're not the same.

305
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,960
You've taken everything after your dad,

306
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,550
but not his tongue.

307
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,830
Go on. Go.

308
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,510
Make sure to buy Baoning Vinegar.

309
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,350
Got it.

310
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,520
This was taken when Chengcheng was six.

311
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,200
This was taken when she was ten.

312
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,790
I got a silver medal back then.

313
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,310
This was taken when she was 15.

314
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,350
How's this pose?

315
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,630
Not bad, right?

316
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,070
You look so strong and powerful.

317
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,830
Well said.

318
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,550
Enough about photos.

319
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
Eat something.

320
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,350
Let me crack some walnuts for you.

321
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,070
A bit too hard.

322
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,400
I brought them especially for you.

323
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,510
You must be tired.
Have some to nourish your brain.

324
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,870
Tang,

325
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,070
this is Chengcheng's first relationship.

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
She's a straightforward girl.

327
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,000
If you're dating,

328
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,550
date seriously.

329
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,720
Even if

330
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
things don't work out one day,

331
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,870
just be honest about it.

332
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,960
If there's anything sneaky,

333
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,440
making things complicated,

334
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,200
I'll be angry.

335
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,280
Uncle,

336
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,920
I'll remember your words.

337
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
This is also my first relationship.

338
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,830
If I do anything wrong,

339
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,870
please feel free to criticize me,

340
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,240
and I'll change.

341
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,720
It's your first time too?

342
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll crack two more walnuts for you.

343
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,760
Here you go.

344
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,520
This is much better.

345
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,000
- Eat.
- Thank you, Uncle.

346
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,920
Don't tell Chengcheng

347
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,110
what happened just now.

348
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,840
OK.

349
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,760
Tastes good.

350
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,310
You're back?

351
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,350
The dishes are almost ready.

352
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,350
Your vinegar is the last ingredient.

353
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,880
The shop assistant said

354
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
the vinegar was sold out.

355
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,720
Where is she?

356
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,830
- I'm here.
- Her shoes...

357
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,440
Chengcheng,

358
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,480
I'm waiting for your vinegar.

359
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,320
Look at you...

360
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,630
Su,

361
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
has Chengcheng come back?

362
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,960
I haven't seen her.

363
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,630
That's impossible.

364
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,680
I heard the door.

365
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,070
Her shoes are at the door.

366
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,760
You must've heard wrong.

367
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,110
She probably went out in other shoes.

368
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
How could I have heard wrong?

369
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,590
How could I mistake the sound of a door?

370
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Mom.

371
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,720
Mom.

372
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,720
Mom, can't you see me?

373
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,590
Mom.

374
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,520
This was probably
when she was six or seven.

375
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,280
Dad, can you hear me?

376
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,310
Dad.

377
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,590
She's been practicing Yongchun.

378
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,430
Tang Qi.

379
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,430
Tang Qi.

380
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,480
- Come on.
- This is when she was eight.

381
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
Can't you see me or hear me?

382
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,090
She started to care
about her appearance.

383
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,920
The filter...

384
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,430
Oh, no.

385
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,310
The control panel isn't responding.

386
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,630
She still had baby fat at that time.

387
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,760
She was quite chubby as a kid.

388
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,760
Hello, Chengcheng.

389
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,830
Hello, Tang Qi.

390
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
This filter is going crazy.

391
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,510
I'm invisible now.

392
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,350
Hello?

393
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,990
Hello?

394
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,110
Can't you hear me?

395
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,920
Hello?

396
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
Can you hear me, Chengcheng?

397
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
Hello?

398
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,240
The signal is bad?

399
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,920
Hello?

400
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
My voice is blocked by the filter.

401
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,040
They can't hear me.

402
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,350
What happened to Chengcheng?

403
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,720
Chengcheng.

404
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,830
Tang, what's going on?

405
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll call her.

406
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,240
Is something wrong?

407
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,690
Chengcheng is strong,

408
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,250
and the supermarket is just downstairs.

409
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,250
What could have happened?

410
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,830
Chengcheng messaged me on WeChat.

411
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,480
Come out.

412
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,220
(Chengcheng)
Don't make my parents worry.

413
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,630
She asked me to pick her up.

414
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,150
Go then.

415
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,280
- OK.
- Go, go.

416
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,110
Tang,

417
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,960
the vinegar doesn't matter.

418
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,070
Dinner's about to start.

419
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,760
Just pick her up and come back.

420
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
OK.

421
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
Chengcheng?

422
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
Chengcheng?

423
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,480
Chengcheng?

424
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,910
Where are you?

425
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
Cheng...

426
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Chengcheng?

427
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,080
Chengcheng?

428
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,950
Chengcheng?

429
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,430
Chengcheng?

430
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,670
Chengcheng.

431
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,670
Chengcheng.

432
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Don't be scared.

433
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,790
Whatever is wrong with the filter,

434
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,350
we'll fix it.

435
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,310
It's not the first time
the filter malfunctioned.

436
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,510
I'm not scared.

437
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,480
The filter's hidden your body visually,

438
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,310
and it's blocked all the sounds

439
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,480
coming from you audibly.

440
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,310
Others can't see you or hear you,

441
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,110
but actually, I can touch you.

442
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,070
If the phone isn't near your body,

443
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,040
it still makes sounds.

444
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,280
So, it's all just an illusion.

445
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,440
It'll be fine.

446
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,020
Everything will return to normal.

447
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,320
- I can use the phone.
- You can use the phone.

448
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,830
If you have something to say,

449
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,240
just send me a message.

450
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,200
I was wondering
how to explain it to you,

451
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,070
but you're so smart

452
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
and guessed everything right.

453
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,280
The filter has been abnormal
since this morning.

454
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,310
Is your body feeling okay?

455
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,870
No, everything's fine.

456
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,160
I've just become invisible
like the demons

457
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,350
in TV shows.

458
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,720
Being invisible

459
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,310
means the body objectively disappears,

460
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
and you can't see it or touch it.

461
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,720
This is more like a visual block.

462
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,410
It's still within the realm
of technology.

463
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,990
Tang,

464
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,390
are you okay?

465
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,870
Don't make my dad worry.

466
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,520
Uncle, why did you come downstairs?

467
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,480
I wasn't worried,
so I came down to check.

468
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,870
Who were you talking to just now?

469
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,440
I was talking to Chengcheng
on the phone.

470
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,790
That naughty girl.

471
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,400
She went to buy some vinegar,

472
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,870
but she hasn't come back yet.

473
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,590
Uncle, don't worry.

474
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,000
Chengcheng

475
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,550
got an urgent call from the company

476
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,870
and had to rush

477
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,000
to meet a client.

478
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,070
So urgent?

479
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,440
(Family Group Chat)
Dad, Mom,

480
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,070
there's an emergency at work.

481
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,550
I need to go back to handle it.

482
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,960
I didn't have time to tell you.

483
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,830
Sorry.

484
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,110
I might be away for a few days.

485
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,030
Mom, can you pack some clothes for me

486
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,070
and give them to Tang Qi?

487
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,870
I'll come back once the work is done.

488
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
She is going on a business trip.

489
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,240
Work is important.

490
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
Stay safe.

491
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,780
(Dad)

492
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,480
(Mom)
Remember to eat on time.

493
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,390
Don't ruin your stomach.

494
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,550
Don't worry.

495
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm going with my colleagues.

496
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,630
They'll look after me on the way.

497
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,060
(Su Chengcheng)

498
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
Tang,

499
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,630
you're visiting for the first time,

500
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,840
but Chengcheng rushed to work.

501
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,230
We didn't even get to enjoy

502
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,800
this nice meal.

503
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,550
Chengcheng is serious about her work.

504
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,070
She just has too much work.

505
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,630
Uncle, maybe I should go home now.

506
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,440
No, no, you can't leave like this.

507
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,030
The food's ready.

508
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,710
You can't leave on an empty stomach.

509
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,270
Besides, you need to have dinner anyway.

510
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,280
Have it here.

511
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,230
Come on.

512
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,800
My dad's cooking is top-notch.

513
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,070
You must try it.

514
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,760
Tang,

515
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,590
it's just the three of us for dinner.

516
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,810
Make yourself at home.

517
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,240
Sit first.

518
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,710
OK, I'll sit. You sit too.

519
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,030
Chengcheng isn't here anyway.

520
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,360
Why not move this chair away?

521
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,640
Uncle,

522
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
I...

523
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,440
I want to have a sense of ceremony

524
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,320
and pretend that Chengcheng
is eating with me.

525
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,480
Alright, whatever you like.

526
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,550
Thank you for this.

527
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,550
It's okay.

528
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,590
Tang, our cooking isn't great.

529
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,400
Just try it out of goodwill.

530
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,940
Here.

531
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,360
This is blood duck,

532
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,590
Chengcheng's favorite dish.

533
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,440
Try it.

534
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,070
- Thanks, Aunt.
- Eat more.

535
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,220
- I'll have the soup first.
- OK.

536
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,590
Alright, thanks.

537
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,850
According to Chengcheng,

538
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,040
you watch this drama

539
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
every night, right?

540
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,350
It's turned on.

541
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,910
Yes.

542
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,800
Though we can watch it online,

543
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,880
we still prefer

544
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,320
watching it on TV every night.

545
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,000
It seems a bit less free,

546
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,800
but as you young people
would say,

547
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,480
it's a sense of ceremony to sit

548
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,960
in front of the TV every night.

549
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,760
You finished it?

550
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,750
You've got a good appetite.

551
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,110
You and Chengcheng can eat together.

552
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,750
Have another one.

553
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,800
Sweet skin chicken.

554
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,960
It's your uncle's specialty,

555
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,400
also Chengcheng's favorite.

556
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,840
Thanks, Uncle.

557
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,360
You eat too.

558
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,960
It seems like the climax is coming.

559
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,590
What's this?

560
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,320
Don't be scared. I'm here.

561
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,430
This...

562
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,070
What's this?

563
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,670
Uncle, Aunt, don't be scared.

564
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,750
This is a magic trick.

565
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,280
A magic trick?

566
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,710
It's a magic trick?

567
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,960
A magic trick.

568
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,920
Look at how scared you are.

569
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,270
It's fine. It's magic.

570
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,760
Yeah.

571
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,400
This is a magic trick

572
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,550
I've been practicing recently.

573
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,240
Now,

574
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm going to make this chicken leg

575
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,440
defy gravity

576
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,360
and float in the air.

577
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,000
Come on, come on.

578
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,550
Up.

579
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,950
Up.

580
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,280
Stay.

581
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Fall.

582
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,440
Wow, that's amazing!

583
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,630
I didn't see that coming.

584
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,390
How did you do it?

585
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,910
Thank you.

586
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,510
Come on, stop teasing us.

587
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,630
Reveal the secret.

588
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,000
Just reveal the secret.

589
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,400
I learned it from a magician

590
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,630
to give Chengcheng a surprise.

591
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,800
Let's keep some mystery for now.

592
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,070
After I show Chengcheng,

593
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,040
I'll explain it to you.

594
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,150
- How thoughtful.
- OK.

595
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,480
- Let's eat.
- Eat, eat.

596
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,230
Let me serve you some soup.

597
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,070
Thanks, Aunt.

598
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,270
Seems the invisibility function
has its limits.

599
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,080
- The cup can't be invisible.
- The cup can't be invisible.

600
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,630
Try my phone.

601
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,550
My phone can't be invisible,

602
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,070
but your phone can.

603
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,880
Try it with the other hand.

604
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,000
If it's about the size of the object...

605
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,110
Our phones are about the same size.

606
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,480
Why can mine go invisible

607
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,630
but yours can't?

608
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,110
The filter probably works
like a digital space.

609
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,070
It turns your body,

610
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,270
clothes, accessories,

611
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
and phone into data

612
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,630
and turns it into a virtual mirror image

613
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,040
to create a visual illusion

614
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,830
that makes us think
we can't see anything.

615
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,160
I don't get it.

616
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,110
You can think of it simply

617
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,400
as that the filter has the initial data
of your phone,

618
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,190
but it doesn't have mine,

619
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,400
so the filter can use the data

620
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,320
to hide your phone.

621
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,360
Got it.

622
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,360
Chengcheng, take a look.

623
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,620
Is the old lady who gave you
the bracelet like this?

624
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,800
Very similar.

625
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,230
Only the one who tied the bell
can untie it.

626
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,480
I'll go find her at the place
where you got the filter.

627
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,040
It's so late. You should go tomorrow.

628
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,850
The filter has had glitches before.

629
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,590
Maybe it's temporary

630
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,750
like before.

631
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,240
It may get better after one night.

632
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,630
This is different from before.

633
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,440
The control panel has disappeared.

634
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,590
It's so late now.

635
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,040
Even if you go,

636
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,040
the old lady might have left.

637
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,670
It's indeed late now.

638
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,280
Maybe

639
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,040
she still hasn't sold everything

640
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,630
and hasn't packed up yet.

641
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,360
You always comfort me,
saying it'll be fine,

642
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,920
but actually,

643
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,550
you're more worried than I am, right?

644
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,720
Are you afraid of being alone at home?

645
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,190
Is that why you don't want me to go?

646
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,150
I promise you.

647
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,840
I'll never use the filter again,

648
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,000
so you don't have to worry.

649
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,120
Alright.

650
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,550
I'll go find the old lady

651
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,400
who sells flowers tomorrow morning.

652
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,520
Luckily, you're here.

653
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,110
Don't be afraid.

654
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,880
No matter what happens,

655
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,880
I'll face it with you.

656
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,840
I love you.
