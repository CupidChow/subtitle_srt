[Episode 23]

3
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,700
Since Xiao Sheng is Qian Qian's boyfriend,

4
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
I'll definitely help you out.

5
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,510
Thank you, Uncle Hu.

6
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,750
Uncle Hu,

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,330
why are you working for my family?

8
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm here to experience life.

9
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,890
Here? This tiny place? Experiencing life?

10
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,590
To be honest, I want to write a book.

11
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,050
It's to rediscover traditional foods which are falling out of interest.

12
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,150
It's a collection of street food, BBQ, etc.

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,670
Write a book?

14
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,830
These vegetables are not fresh anymore, discard them.

15
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Cut it smaller. You need to stabilize your wrist.

16
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,230
You have all been working hard. Thank you.

17
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,750
- Who did this?
- Me.
- There's too much oil.

18
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,050
- Do it again.
- Okay I will.

19
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,500
We have a lot of customers today, hurry up!

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,670
Customers are satisfied with Chef Hu's dishes.

21
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,270
Our reservation rate is also very high.

22
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,660
However, we still need to search for a head chef.

23
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,510
Uncle Hu is just here to help us.

24
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,130
- We cannot overwork him.
- Okay.

25
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,560
By the way, the economist, Mr. Smith, will be checking in this afternoon,

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,400
send someone to pick him up.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,030
Mr. Smith is our hotel's top VIP.

28
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,710
Make sure we fulfill his requests and attention to detail.

29
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,570
Also, he is allergic to nuts.

30
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,760
Inform the Food and Beverage Department.

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,490
Got it.

32
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,950
Miss Qi, my son is sick. I can't come tomorrow to take care of your son.

33
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,820
When can you come?

34
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,860
I don't know.

35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,080
Okay, got it!

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,910
Mom.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,520
Ruirui, what's wrong?

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,110
Mom, am I a burden to you?

39
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,460
Ruirui, why would you say that?

40
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,010
Because you are busy and you need to take care of me.

41
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,920
But it's because I'm your mother also, of course, I've to take care of you.

42
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,390
Let's go to the supermarket and get your favorite chocolates?

43
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,800
Good!

44
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,850
Hi, Director Xue.

45
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,040
I don't know how they found a new head chef so quickly.

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Forget that. I heard that the economist, Mr. Smith,

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,020
is staying at Evergreen.

48
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,970
What do you want me to do?

49
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,900
I will have to trouble you with Mr. Smith's meal arrangements.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,170
Of course. I will prepare them myself,

51
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,530
nothing will go wrong.

52
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,850
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

53
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,020
[Caution: Do you consume this product if you are allergic to nuts. ]

54
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,720
Mom, why are you holding a packet of nuts?

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,810
I cannot eat them because I'm allergic to nuts.

56
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,130
Nothing, I'm just checking.

57
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,370
Have you gotten the chocolate?

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,540
Yes, I got it.

59
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,280
Okay, let's go checkout.

60
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,750
Mom, can I eat chocolate after dinner?

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,470
Go ahead.

62
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,030
Mom, does this chocolate have...

63
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,650
Hello?

64
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,730
Now you're raising the price?

65
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,000
You have to understand, if they found out, I'll be sued.

66
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,050
How much do you want?

67
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,330
Add another 20,000 RMB, I will get this job done.

68
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay. Be careful and don't make any mistakes.

69
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
I'll ground the nuts into powder,

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,370
and sprinkle them into the soup. No one will find out.

71
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,940
Okay.

72
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,190
Waiter!

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,730
Yes, Miss Qi.

74
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,820
Have you seen my son?

75
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,020
Don't worry, your son seemed to have had a food allergy reaction.

76
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,670
GM Sheng took him to the hospital.

77
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,920
Ruirui, how are you doing?

78
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,190
Are you in pain?

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,080
He might be allergic to nuts.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,950
He ate this chocolate.

81
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,660
It is made with nuts.

[Schogetten Chocolate]

83
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,740
Mom, am I troubling you again?

84
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,410
It's my mistake. I didn't take good care of you.

85
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,550
The doctor said everything is fine.

86
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,700
I'm heading back to the hotel now, I will come and visit later.

87
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,960
Wait!

88
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,810
GM Sheng.

89
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,060
Hurry up and asked the waiter to remove the soup for Mr. Smith.

90
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,640
Excuse me!

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,100
Hello?

92
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,160
The soup is a little bit cold.

93
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,470
Can I change it for you?

94
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,060
Yes, nice.

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,210
Enjoy.

96
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,160
No worry, thank you!

97
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,450
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,650
Why are you doing this?

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,290
If you want to take over Evergreen,

100
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,120
you don't need to do something dirty like this.

101
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
Zhening,

102
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,720
do you think I am a good mom?

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,640
This nut allergy incident has happened a few times before.

104
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,180
Because of work,

105
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,250
I always bring him to my office.

106
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,690
However, I can't take good care of him.

107
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,130
Director Xue knows my abilities,

108
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,290
he suggested that I take over Evergreen.

109
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,680
If I don't do it,

110
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,520
he will interfere with...

111
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,100
the custody battle between Zirui's father and me.

112
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,230
He won't let me win.

113
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,060
You've known me since I was young.

114
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,520
When I am determined to do something,

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,660
I'll do it to perfection.

116
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,380
Look at me now.

117
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,130
I seem to be a successful businesswoman...

118
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,700
on the outside.

119
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,740
But deep down,

120
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,260
I fail to be a mother.

121
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,980
I feel like...

122
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,400
I've made the wrong decision.

123
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,450
I've made too many mistakes.

124
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,020
I never found myself being a failure up until now.

125
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,090
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm telling you all this is not to ask you for forgiveness.

127
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,750
I jeopardized Evergreen,

128
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,270
and also damaged the relationship between us.

129
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,610
What are you planning to do next?

130
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,990
Leaving the country, I think.

131
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,630
I still need to face it all.

132
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,980
I need to learn from my mistakes,

133
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,130
and become a good mother.

134
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,150
Wow.

135
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,160
This situation has allowed me to understand

136
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,390
work and kids really need to be well-balanced.

137
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,850
Yes, I also now understand.

138
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,310
What does this have to do with you? What do you understand?

139
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,470
In the future, when we have kids,

140
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,900
I will quit my job and raise the kids.

141
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,980
This way you can work without worry.

142
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,640
Aren't you thinking too far into the future?

143
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,900
Our future is already in my plans,

144
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,470
it is not unexpected.

145
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,240
Then as a participant,

146
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,410
can I listen to what your plans are?

147
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,530
First...

148
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,580
I will propose to you. Then, I will arrange

149
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,430
a wedding that doesn't have to be grand.

150
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,670
But it has to be very romantic.

151
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,140
I will take you to Italy for our honeymoon.

152
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,700
We will raise a cat and a dog.

153
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,590
We will cook together, do chores together, go shopping together.

154
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,560
Take a nap in the sun together.

155
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,460
When we have our own child,

156
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,710
we will slowly watch them grow up.

157
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,810
They will have their own lives.

158
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,640
When we are old,

159
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,730
we will move to a cabin in the woods.

160
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,450
Beside the cabin, there will be a river.

161
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,450
During the day, we can take a boat and go fishing.

162
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,140
During the night, the two of us can sit by the river

163
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,620
and reminisce about the past.

164
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,970
Hearing all of your plans,

165
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,450
I have one small plan of my own now.

166
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,190
What plan?

167
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Nothing much,

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,680
I just want to hug you.

169
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
And do this.

170
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,140
This is the office I prepared for GM Qin.

171
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,830
How is it? GM Qin, are you satisfied?

172
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,890
Thank you, President Wu.

173
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,450
Before you officially start tomorrow, is there anything else you need?

174
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:20,250
I would like to meet with all the department heads so I can get to know them.

175
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,760
Don't worry.

176
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,830
During tomorrow's meeting, I will officially introduce you.

177
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,270
Okay.

178
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,780
In terms of customer service, our Lang Yue Hotel

179
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,260
has always been inferior to Evergreen.

180
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,610
I hope that with your arrival you will help change that.

181
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Once I start, I will create a proposal for that direction.

182
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,480
That's good.

183
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,910
Right now, Lihe Capital has some issues with its capital chain.

184
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,590
As long as Evergreen stays stable,

185
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,500
Director Xue cannot obtain any more shares from other shareholders.

186
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,540
Evergreen can now take a sigh of relief.

187
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,870
I know that saying all this cannot make up for the losses I have created for Evergreen.

188
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,810
But I can only do so much.

189
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,630
It's all in the past. Don't worry.

190
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,660
You can get back to work.

191
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,780
Okay. Stay safe.

GM Sheng, Qin Hebo is back. He is now the general manager at Lang Yue Hotel.

195
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,700
I understand.

196
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,070
Will we have contact with him in the future?

197
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,240
We work in the same field, it would be hard to avoid him.

198
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,930
We'll meet when we meet. Don't be anxious.

199
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,130
Oh, right! Miss Xia is here. She is in the office waiting for you.

200

Why didn't you say so earlier?

201
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,050
The first round of presale products have already been delivered

202
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,020
and the customer reviews have all been really good.

203
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,950
I have already arranged for them to get started on the second round of products.

204
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,910
To summarize, GM Sheng, the progress of this collaboration has been very successful.

205
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,680
These past few days you have worked hard.

206
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,060
Then, GM Sheng, are you satisfied with the collaboration?

207
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,020
More or less yes.

208
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,460
Then, what aren't you satisfied with?

209
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,100
There is one thing.

210
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,030
Miss Xia is too busy. She never has time to eat with me.

211
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,970
Then, do you want to come to my house today? I will personally cook for you.

But starting such a big company must have cost a lot of money.

Don't you think you are putting too much pressure on me?

230

Don't feel pressured.

Starting this business is not just for you.

This is your work contract.

Besides your salary, there will be a commission based on your sales.

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,790
I'll probably stay at the hotel.

330

If you are worried, you can change the access code at any time.

331
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,810
Let me find my own accommodation. The company shouldn't pay for this.

332
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,580
The rent for the nearby apartments is really expensive, you can't afford it.

333
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,890
If you live too far away,

334
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,260
it will affect your work.

If you stay here, you can do some cleaning for me.

Also, your good friend, the cat.

341
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,720
Someone needs to take care of it.

342
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,690
If that's the case,

343
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,670
I'll reluctantly accept your offer and spend time with the cat.

344
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,670
Then, I'll change the password.

I haven't thought about romance anymore.

I knew you just pretended to be tough.

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,280
Brother, Manhui used to visit us a lot. Do you still remember?

490
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,790
Not really.

491
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,990
It's fine. I look very different now.

492
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,530
By the way, I bought this neck tie for Brother Zhening.

493
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:38,070
I saw it when I was shopping this afternoon, and I thought it suits Brother Zhening very well.

494
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,030
I hope you like it, Brother Zhening.

495
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,870
Thanks, but I can't take it.

496
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,450
My girlfriend chooses the neck ties for me.

497
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,340
What? When did you get a girlfriend?

498
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,960
I know that you care about what happened between He Zhijuan and Xia Qian in the past.

499
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,290
So I didn't tell you about it.

500
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,570
He Zhijuan chose you. That means he loves you deeply.

501
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:11,220
Don't harm your relationship because of your doubts.

502
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,940
I know that these words sound harsh.

503
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,040
But I have to say them. You're my sister.

504
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,360
I love you very much. But I won't give up

505
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,190
my love for Xia Qian just because you're against it.

506
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,930
If you insist,

507
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,950
I will try to keep you two away from each other,

508
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,970
so that it won't be too awkward.

509
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,730
Let me think about it.

510
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,670
- You're still up! It's so late.
- Hubby, you're back.

511
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,400
I just made some jujube and tremella soup for you. I hope you like it.

512
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,110
Okay.

513
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,660
Taste it. Is it sweet?

514
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,160
It's delicious! But don't stay up so late again.

515
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,440
- You should go to bed early.
- Okay.

516
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,820
Hubby, my brother is dating someone.

517
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,010
Really?

518
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,610
- Guess who she is?
- Who is it?

519
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,360
It's Xia Qian.

520
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,610
Hubby, do you mind?

521
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,920
- Do you want to hear the truth?
- Of course.

522
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,030
I do mind.

523
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,140
It's going to be somewhat awkward.

524
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,970
But I'm more concerned about the fact that you may get worried.

525
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,220
Mengmeng, I've been so happy over the past month.

526
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,680
I like the way you are now.

527
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,380
What happened in the past is the past. Let's focus on our life from now on.

528
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:24,290
You're my wife, and you're the only one that I care about the most.

529
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,290
Don't ever overthink again.

530
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,680
Hubby, I love you.

531
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,870
Me too.

532
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,890
I'm busy with work at the hotel today.

533
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,890
Can you postpone the livestream a little bit?

534
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,280
It's fine, you can focus on your work.

535
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,630
I'm okay.

536
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,360
Okay.

537
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,700
Hello, Brother.

538
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,510
I've thought it through. I was too sensitive at the beginning.

539
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,440
Okay.

540
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,370
I'm glad that you thought it through.

541
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:18,800
Can you bring Miss Xia to our place for a meal next week?

542
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:23,640
Okay. I'll ask her opinion of it.

543
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,780
We should go.

544
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,450
Are you sure?

545
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,330
You don't have to.

546
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,080
Ning Meng is your sister.

547
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,250
I can't always be hiding from her. And I think we should

548
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,450
meet and clarify things up.

549
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,130
What's up?

550
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,370
Hubby, what do you want to have for dinner?

551
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,960
I'm good with anything. But you're preparing too much food for us.

552
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,000
I asked my brother and Xia Qian to come over for a meal tomorrow.

553
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,810
I want to be prepared for that.

554
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,730
Hubby,

555
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,450
do you still remember what Xia Qian likes to eat?

556
