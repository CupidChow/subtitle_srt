[Episode 18]

3
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,760
Excuse me. Sorry to disturb you.

4
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,160
Can I help you?

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,670
I'm the boyfriend of the girl that lives upstairs.

6
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,450
I want to talk to you about the leak.

7
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,870
Come in and take a look then.

8
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,320
Yes.

9
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,460
Look at my walls. I just had it painted a few days ago.

10
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,600
Now, look at all the water! Look!

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,950
There really is a leak.

12
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,070
And there's also a leak from the heating vent, it's all water inside.

13
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,380
There's water in the vent?

14
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,150
Look for yourself. It's dripping down.

15
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,520
How about we find a maintenance man to come and look?

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,090
The water will be gone by the time you find someone.

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,120
How about this? I won't bother you about the heating vent.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,670
There's so much water here at the corner. What are you going to do?

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,060
How about this?

20
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,960
I'll give you ¥500.

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,820
¥500?

22
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,490
¥1,000?

23
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,450
How about ¥1,500?

24
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,890
How come you're giving me another ¥500?

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,750
Take that extra ¥500 as hush money.

26
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,280
Just don't let my girlfriend know I came.

27
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,180
Sorry for the trouble.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Everyone look, the fruit is so fresh.

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,070
I can hardly wait to eat it. Let me taste it.

30
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,170
Let's see what it tastes like.
[Unbeatable Price]

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,110
I swear that this is the best-tasting snack I've ever eaten.

32
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,060
When girls eat it, it's good for your skin,

33
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,360
you can also lose weight by eating it. Guys who are watching the stream,

34
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,530
don't forget to get some for your girlfriends, okay?

35
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,830
I can't stop!

36
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,590
[Xia Qian's admirer No. 1: Qianqian, I like you.]

37
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,220
Thank you, everyone! I like each and every one of you.

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,690
During today's broadcast, there was an account named "My Summer No. 1"
 (T/N: Xia Qian's last name means summer)

39
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,150
Looks like Sister Qian has fans!

40
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,040
I think that's great!

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,490
Later, there may even be My Summer No. 2, No. 3, or No. 4.

42
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,950
Except, I already have a boyfriend.

43
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,690
I don't think we should lie to our customers to boost sales,

44
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,390
and pretend that I am single and available.

45
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,390
Right?

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,360
You object? Objection overruled.

47
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,070
These are all because of your great idea!

48
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,090
So now, there are accounts like My Summer No. 1, No. 2, No. 8.

49
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,950
Weren't you pretty happy about it before?

50
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,930
What are you mumbling about?

51
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,850
I'm saying...

52
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,510
I don't want my paycheck two months from now either.

53
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,130
Even if I take your whole year's pay, so what?

54
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,800
Hurry up and figure something out. Solve this for me.

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,460
Got it.

56
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,280
It's fine now. Property management has said they will take responsibility.

57
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,900
Really?

58
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,480
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's fine.

59
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,500
Property management will take responsibility?

60
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,450
Hubby, where did you go this afternoon?

61
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,020
I called you so many times but you didn't answer.

62
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,440
What time are you coming back?

63
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,870
[I will be back soon]

64
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,360
Has it ever occurred to you that Ning Meng ended up like this

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,590
because you've been too protective of her feelings?

66
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,480
I'll be back soon. I've had a lot of work today.

67
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,290
Hubby, are you working overtime?

68
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,620
I'll wait for you at home.

69
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,970
I can't sleep if you're not home.

70
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,150
I'll be back right away.

71
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,230
Something on your mind?

72
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,980
Nothing, just a little tired.

73
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,110
Then you should go rest. You shouldn't have come over this early in the morning.

74
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,060
I missed you and wanted to see you.

75
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,200
Oh right! I watched your livestream.

76
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,590
What do you think? It's improving?

77
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,800
It's improved quite a lot.

78
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,310
But I feel like it can be even better.

79
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,720
I saw during the livestream, someone named

80
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
My Summer No. 1.

81
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,320
You saw that?

82
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,060
Jealous?

83
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,050
Why would I be jealous? Isn't it just a regular viewer?

84
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,060
You're a streamer now so you'll have plenty of fans in the future.

85
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,500
This is inevitable.

86
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,210
You're not jealous?

87
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,220
No.

88
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,440
I thought you'd be jealous, I was thinking about how to explain it to you.

89
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,720
I didn't realize you'd actually understand.

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,520
He's just a regular viewer, but I feel like using that type of ID

91
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,970
- is a bit rude.
- What's rude about it?

92
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm trying to get used to it. He's just a regular viewer.

93
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,310
It's all for fun online.

94
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,380
Then I think,

95
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,320
as a regular viewer like him, you should block him.

96
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,450
Block him? Do I need to?

97
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,490
You're definitely jealous.

98
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,760
- No.
- Yes.

99
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,020
- I'm really not!
- You are jealous!

100
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,150
Fine, I'm jealous. Then, can you block him?

101
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,730
No, he's just a normal viewer.

102
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,330
I'm just saying there might be a possibility.

103
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,960
But... I'm really not jealous.

104
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,530
You're too much. What does it have to do with it?

105
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,950
Hubby, what medicine are you taking?

106
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,610
Nothing, my stomach hurts a bit.

107
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,510
Hubby, let's go to the hospital and have you checked.

108
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,850
I'm fine. I'm a doctor, I know my condition.

109
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,070
Hubby, really, just go see the doctor.

110
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,530
Ning Meng, stop forcing me.

111
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,930
I said I'm fine.

112
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,390
Hubby, sorry. I'm just worried about you.

113
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,620
I'm just saying, if you go—

114
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,320
Don't be like this.

115
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,400
Okay, Hubby, I'm sorry.

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,020
I won't overthink in the future, I won't think wildly.

117
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,220
- Hubby, can you forgive me?
- Mengmeng,

118
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,880
can we live normally? I'm really tired.

119
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,630
After we got married, I've forgotten what it was like before.

120
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,420
Every day we fight and apologize, then fight again after apologizing.

121
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,810
Is this the life you want?

122
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,220
I'm going to read a book.

123
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,830
Hello! We're streaming now. Welcome to my livestream.

124
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,590
Today before we start, I'd like to explain something to everyone.

125
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,800
It's regarding my personal life. I have a boyfriend.

126
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,630
He's very outstanding and I love him very much.

127
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,390
I have my heart set on him for this life.

128
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,050
He's my one and only.

129
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,320
So...

130
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
[Too mushy]

131
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,870
No worries. So,

132
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm not single. Okay, okay.

133
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,840
I won't talk any more nonsense, we'll start today's livestream.

134
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Today, what I'd like to show everyone is tea leaves.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,690
The price is very good,

136
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,000
so buy, buy, buy!
[Buy]

137
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,530
Three more people unfollowed us.

138
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,870
We lost another 3 fans.

139
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,790
Today we lost 3, tomorrow we'll add 30.

140
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,980
I agree.

141
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,500
Being a streamer, we have to be honest.

142
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,150
We are what we are. No faking.

143
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,170
True, lies will always eventually be exposed.

144
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,710
Then... it'll bring more harm.

145
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,110
Sister Shuangshuang is right.

146
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,330
Okay, no need to say anymore.

147
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,500
We need to continue working hard.

148
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,020
Most of Director Gao's assets are in his wife's hands.

149
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,640
If he divorces, he'll lose big.

150
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,340
If he wants to keep his assets, he will definitely not want his cheating video exposed.

151
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,380
He would be willing to sell his shares.

152
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,350
Should I send this to Director Xue?

153
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,360
No need.

154
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,110
I'll take care of it.

155
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,620
Okay.

156
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,850
Hebo, I plan to have the entrusted Evergreen stocks

157
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,490
directly transferred to Lihe Capital.

158
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,090
Then rightfully become a member of the Evergreen board of directors.

159
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,400
Since we have already been exposed, we don't have to hide.

160
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
On my side—

161
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,410
Excuse me. Hebo, let me take this call.

162
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,040
Yes, what is it?

163
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay, I got it. Rest assured.

164
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
We're friends. If I can help, of course I will.

165
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,130
Hebo, how's it going with Director Gao?

166
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,840
I don't have any news yet. If I find out anything, I'll let you know.

167
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,620
Be sure to hurry.

168
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,210
The 30th-anniversary celebration was a success.

169
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,840
GM Sheng's abilities are also obvious to everyone.

170
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,000
I think he is more suitable for the general manager position.

171
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,630
Frequent position changing will make Evergreen's management look unstable.

172
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,290
It'll have a bad effect on Evergreen.

173
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,190
GM Qin is doing a good job. There's no need to switch.

174
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,160
GM Qin, what do you think?

175
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,060
I don't have an opinion. I'll listen to the board of directors.

176
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,170
Okay, then we'll have a meeting next week

177
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,970
to officially discuss this topic.

178
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,560
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

179
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,750
This... The meeting isn't over yet, and he just...

180
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,200
They're being so ungrateful!

181
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,530
These past few months, you've done so much for Evergreen Hotel.

182
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,360
Now that Sheng Zhening is back, they want to take away your position.

183
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,800
Since the video has already been sent to Lihe Capital,

184
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,650
how come Director Xue hasn't done anything?

185
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,890
Should I go ask?

186
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,910
There's no need.

187
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,340
GM Qin, do you have something on your mind?

188
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,770
I feel like you've been a bit absent-minded recently.

189
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,990
It's nothing. I'm just tired.

190
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,290
You can go.

191
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,950
Okay.

192
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,160
[Ning Meng]

193
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,760
Mengmeng, when did you arrive?

194
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,100
I just arrived.

195
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,260
How come you didn't come up?

196
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,840
- I want to go to a place.
- Okay

197
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,000
According to Xiaoai's data analysis, it is clear that

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,720
videos about clothing have significantly way more viewers.

199
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,300
We haven't done anything in this area before, but I think we can try.

200
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,680
This happens to be our weakness.

201
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,920
What are you doing? You, go to the head office and apply for some clothing brands.

202
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,860
Do you want anything in particular?

203
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,350
I don't want too much.

204
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,650
But I want the best in terms of materials and workmanship.

205
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,470
I don't want something that looks good on livestream, but is different when you touch it.

206
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,150
Okay, I'll take care of it.

207
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,220
How did you think about bringing me here?

208
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,360
We came here last Valentine's Day, do you remember?

209
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,120
I remember.

210
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,250
Zhijuan, I went to see Doctor Zhang.

211
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,780
Teacher?

212
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,020
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

213
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,880
I returned to the familiar mental health clinic.

214
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,740
I remembered how we first met.

215
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,400
Now, I'm really happy and thankful,

216
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,050
and treasure what we are having right now.

217
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,480
Zhijuan, I know I did a lot of things that made you angry.

218
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,380
From now on, I won't meddle in your work, I won't be suspicious of you.

219
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,430
I won't worry that someone will steal you away.

220
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,370
I know I can't change immediately, but Zhijuan, can you give me some time?

221
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,530
- I will definitely—
- Mengmeng.

222
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,660
Mengmeng, I really have never blamed you.

223
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,690
You don't have to worry about my feelings for you.

224
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,370
And you don't have to worry about anything bad happening to us in the future, okay?

225
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,920
- Zhijuan, can we sit here for a bit?
- Sure.

226
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,010
How come they are all traditional clothes?

227
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,310
This is the Hanfu brand that the head office recommended. They said

228
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,110
it fits the head office's theme of traditional culture for this month.

229
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,360
Something about traditional clothes, jewelry, and make-up.

230
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,320
All with a traditional flare.

231
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,980
Who will buy these kinds of dresses on a livestream?

232
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,250
Clearly, the head office thinks that our sales aren't great,

233
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,680
so they are forcing these upon us.

234
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,530
They are clearly making it difficult for us.

235
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,010
It's fine.

236
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,250
Actually, I took a look. The quality and workmanship of these clothes are pretty good.

237
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,130
The quality is pretty good.

238
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,730
I suddenly have an idea.

239
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,000
Shuangshuang, don't you usually like to watch traditional dramas?

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
Do you want to wear these?

241
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,770
Watching is okay, but wearing... I can't.

242
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,880
You know I get nervous when I am in front of the camera.

243
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,560
Then...

244
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,530
I can't handle this kind of clothes.

245
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,150
You do it.

246
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,930
Me?

247
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,620
Sit, sit.

248
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,990
Here, for you.

249
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,870
What's this?

250
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,990
Do you remember this?

251
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,790
How come you still have this?

252
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,860
Back then when I was sick, I couldn't sleep every day,

253
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,760
so you let me listen to this nature recording.

254
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,830
You told me, the world is big,

255
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,590
so I shouldn't be restricted in that small world of pain.

256
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,190
Back then, you even told me you just downloaded this randomly from the internet.

257
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,200
But actually, I know you must have recorded it yourself.

258
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,030
I can even hear your breathing.

259
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,320
How come I didn't hear it?

260
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,970
Of course, you didn't.

261
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,110
Everything you've done in any second, minute, or hour,

262
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,330
I'll be the first one to know, to experience.

263
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,910
Everything you've done, I'll remember them all.

264
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,920
I know.

265
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,840
Zhijuan, let's go on a vacation.

266
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,220
Didn't you say you wanted to show me the world?

267
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,760
Okay, as you wish.

268
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,290
Hello?

269
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,920
- Hello?
- Hello, this is property management.

270
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,240
I think the breaker flipped. Can you send someone to take a look?

271
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
Okay, I'll send someone tomorrow.

272
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,410
Wait! How come it's tomorrow again?

273
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,330
Last time, didn't you guys take care of the leak pretty quickly?

274
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,200
How come this time you're so unwilling?

275
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,250
The leak, didn't you settle personally with the tenant downstairs?

276
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,330
I settled it myself?

277
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,930
It was your boyfriend who didn't want me to tell you.

278
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,180
What boyfriend?

279
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,190
The man who paid to have it fixed.

280
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,830
He is pretty handsome, wore a suit. It seemed like he was quite rich.

281
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,010
Did you guys fight?

282
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,200
No... thank you.

283
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,960
No problem.

284
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,070
Do you watch every time I livestream?

285
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,230
Not every time.

286
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,240
When I'm busy, I ask Anan to record it so I can watch it when I've finished working.

287
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,770
You're not allowed to watch tomorrow's livestream.

288
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,410
Why?

289
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,380
No reason.

290
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,100
You're just not allowed to watch tomorrow or record it.

291
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,430
Okay.

292
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,530
This is the money you paid to fix the leak.

293
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,350
¥2,000, I'm paying you back.

294
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,930
I don't want to owe you anything.

295
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,660
Shuangshuang.

296
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,250
Do you need anything else?

297
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,280
If I promise not to do something bad again,

298
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,910
do we still have a chance?

299
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,280
I don't know.

300
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,830
Why do you keep ironing that spot? You'll burn it.

301
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,500
What is it? Something on your mind?

302
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,120
Do you think if a person keeps doing bad things, can he change?

303
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,450
Why do you suddenly ask this?

304
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,580
I'm just watching a drama.

305
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,320
In the drama, there's a character that did many bad things before.

306
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,300
But he wants to be good.

307
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,760
Do you think it's possible?

308
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't know. Depends on how the script is written.

309
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,040
Here, let me help.

310
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,070
Go take a rest.

311
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,910
Be careful.

312
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,590
So awkward.

313
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,370
Why did I act on impulse and agree to do this?

314
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,600
So weird.

315
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,930
Where are you?

316
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,000
Are you home?

317
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,380
[Zhening]

318
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,830
I'm here,

319
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,740
changing clothes.

320
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay.

321
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,150
How come you're here?

322
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,580
There's nothing much for me to do at the hotel,

323
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,680
so I came to accompany you to work.

324
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,440
Didn't we already agree last night

325
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,990
that you're not allowed to watch the livestream today?

326
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,250
Why are you not keeping your promise?

327
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,670
I just said I wouldn't watch your livestream,

328
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,780
but I didn't say I wouldn't watch you while you're streaming.

329
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,120
You are arguing unreasonably.

330
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,840
Are you finished changing?

331
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,720
You're going to be late.

332
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
Not yet.

333
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,990
Almost.

334
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,920
Hold on.

335
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,140
What's wrong?

336
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,410
Nothing!

337
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,030
Okay.

338
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,240
[Anan]

339
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,330
Hello?

340
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,250
Okay, I got it. I'll be right there.

341
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,530
What is it?

342
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,920
There's something urgent at the hotel. I have to go back.

343
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,940
Hurry and go.

344
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm fine.

345
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,850
I'll go down as soon as I'm changed.

346
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,760
Okay, as long as you're good. I'm leaving.

347
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,300
Okay.

348
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,830
Bye!

349
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,580
We can put this in the front.

350
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,930
Brother, look at me, don't make it tilted.

351
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,100
- This way... Not that way! The other way.
- Really!

352
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,360
Then, light.

353
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,750
Okay.

354
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,030
My face is still quite dark, can you point the light towards my face?

355
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,470
Sister Qian, you look so pretty in this.

356
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,610
What's pretty about it? It's uncomfortable and feels super weird.

357
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,900
Right, Sister Qian,

358
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,180
you can handle this style, it does look pretty.

359
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,180
[Anan]

360
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,490
Can you clean that up?

361
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,870
Hello, Anan?

362
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,200
Miss Qian, is GM Sheng with you?

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,280
He's not with me. He left when you called him.

364
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,560
He's not back.

365
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,000
And his cell phone is off, so I can't contact him.

366
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Really?

367
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,620
He left in a hurry and said there was something urgent at the hotel.

368
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,140
It's because Director Gao from our hotel sold his stocks to Lihe Capital.

369
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,270
Lihe is now one of Evergreen's shareholders.

370
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,280
Since Director Xue hasn't done anything, so I took the initiative to go find him.

371
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,450
Then he told me you didn't send Director Gao's video to him, so I—

372
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,770
Who told you to do that without my permission?

373
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,300
I only wanted to help you.

374
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,970
I thought you didn't want to ruin your relationship with GM Sheng, and you were reluctant to send the video to Director Xue so I—

375
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,380
Get out. Get out!

376
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,890
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,010
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed—

378
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,450
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

379
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,220
Powered off.

380
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,250
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

381
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,170
GM Sheng, you're finally here.

382
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,530
What's the situation?

383
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,140
Director Gao has been a long-time shareholder of Evergreen and he suddenly sold his shares to Lihe Capital.

384
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,870
Now our shareholders are feeling unsettled.

385
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,090
Many shareholders have already asked me if there's something wrong with Evergreen Hotel.

386
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,250
I've asked Director Gao to record a video statement.

387
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,660
Hurry and arrange an emergency meeting with the shareholders.

388
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,140
Also, Lihe Capital not only took Director Gao's 5% shares,

389
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,580
Director Xue also secretly bought the shares from Director Lin and Director Yu.

390
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
They didn't buy these shares under Lihe Capital's name.

391
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,580
So until now, Lihe Capital probably has at least 10% shares of Evergreen Hotel.

392
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,200
I understand. Arrange the meeting.

393
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay.

394
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,580
Excuse me. Thank you.

395
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,640
Guests, this way.

396
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,710
Weird.

397
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,840
Anan just told me that he couldn't find you,

398
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,410
I was too worried and ran over here.

399
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,030
I thought you were with Miss Xia, so I...

400
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,730
I went to Director Gao's house for a meeting. My phone is dead. I'm fine.

401
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,790
I'm glad nothing happened.

402
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,180
I have a meeting. Will be back soon. Can you wait for me?

403
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,450
Is there an issue with Evergreen's operations?

404
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,620
Director Gao has been a long-time shareholder. Now all of a sudden he sold his shares.

405
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,510
Why?

406
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,080
I believe most of you know that Director Gao sold his shares.

407
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,650
There are many speculations. I have a video statement from Director Gao.

408
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,020
I have personal reasons for selling my shares. It has nothing to do with Evergreen Hotel.

409
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,630
With great regret, I will not be able to work with you guys.

410
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,080
All the best with your work.

411
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,310
Lately, there's been a rumor

412
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,270
that there is a problem with Evergreen's operations.

413
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,850
During the past decade, you all have seen Evergreen's strong progress.

414
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,390
The operations have always been methodical. It is obvious that

415
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,880
some people want to take advantage of this and distract us.

416
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,080
They want to muddy the waters.

417
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,140
I hope that everyone sitting here won't be misled.

418
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,370
We're coming. We're coming. Xu Xian is here.
(T/N: Xu Xian as in "Legend of White Snake")

419
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,220
Hello, everyone! Isn't he handsome?

420
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,420
Don't run away!

421
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,340
Look! Everyone is saying you are so handsome. Look.

422
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,190
Handsome!

423
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,690
Okay!

424
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,330
Let's look at this outfit. Dignified, elegant, and gentle.

425
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,490
Such a fairy. Are you really the same streamer I know?

426
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,910
- I am.
- ♪ Bai Suzhen under♪

427
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,360
♪ Qingcheng Mountain ♪

428
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,180
♪ Cultivating this body for a thousand years ♪

429
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,140
That was amazing. Today we are still here to promote goods.

430
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,240
All the traditional (Hanfu) outfits on us today

431
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,720
will soon have a really big discount. The first thirty orders will be given

432
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,330
these ¥198 embroidered shoes that are currently on our feet, for free. Super good-looking.

433
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,950
They are very pretty, you should fight to buy them!

434
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:48,250
- Comments?
- Yeah, a lot.
- 120 kg? No problem, you can definitely wear them. No worries, ladies.

435
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,260
- This will make you look thinner.
- Let me see...

436
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,150
Someone asked if she would wear this outside?

437
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,670
- As long as you like, everything can be worn outside.
- Of course!

438
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,360
- We can go out like this.
- Right, and even take pictures.

439
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,650
Someone is envious of you. He said he is jealous.

440
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,180
Someone wants to buy you.

441
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,660
Xu Xian is not for sale, but this outfit is for sale.

442
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,300
I feel like we can sell them together.

443
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,030
Wow, wearing this I feel like I am time-traveling.

444
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,530
Like a real young master. Aren't I handsome?

445
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,200
- Definitely handsome.
- Do I look like a fairy?

446
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,830
Organizing the data in these dynamic bar charts

447
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,450
is indeed more intuitive, right?

448
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,390
It is better.

449
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,370
You're back? Come take a look.

450
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:41,220
Anan and I organized Evergreen's sales from the last few years, by month and year,

451
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,760
and made it into a graph, so the shareholders can easily see that Evergreen is growing.

452
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,580
It should hopefully give the shareholders peace of mind. But I don't know if it will be effective.

453
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,500
The graph is even more convincing than words.

454
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,550
Are you comfortable wearing that?

455
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,920
There's nothing uncomfortable with this. I was busy so I forgot to change.

456
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,520
Come outside with me.

457
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,780
What is it?

458
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,870
The clothes are there for you to change into.

459
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,990
When did he buy this dress?

460
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,030
Just a minute.

461
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,970
Don't knock, I'll be right there!

462
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,470
Zhening,

463
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,640
come in and help me.

464
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,020
You've been in here for a while but still not changed.

465
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,320
My clothes are too difficult. Can you help me untie it?

466
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,040
You didn't want me to see your livestream because of this?

467
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,530
Yes, it's so weird.

468
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,390
What's weird about it? It's pretty cute.

469
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,840
Okay, okay.

470
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,260
That Director Gao... what's wrong with him?

471
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,170
Why did he sell his shares to Lihe Capital? Isn't he a long-time shareholder of Evergreen?

472
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,220
Someone put a camera in Director Gao's room.

473
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,430
They recorded something that... was not good.

474
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,080
Lihe Capital used the video to blackmail him.

475
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,210
Evergreen Hotel's security is so tight. No outsider can get in.

476
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,070
Is it possible that an employee from inside did this?

477
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm thinking... it might be Qin Hebo.

478
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,090
Last year, he changed all of Evergreen's office locks.

479
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,730
Coincidentally, the lock manufacturer

480
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,110
is related to Lihe Capital.

481
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,780
Now, in his eyes, Evergreen Hotel is like a house without a lock.

482
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,190
Then... do you have a plan?

483
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,790
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

484
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,270
Okay, go out so I can change.

485
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,170
Our last livestream was a huge success. All the outfits were sold.

486
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,820
And the lipstick and eyeshadow that you used were all sold out!

487
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,110
Our fans have increased by 1,000!

488
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,910
And the fans strongly requested us to do another livestream.

489
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,190
Stop complimenting me. If you keep going, I might take off on my own.
(T/N: get too proud of oneself)

490
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,760
Off on your own?

491
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,970
Since the fans are so excited, let's do another one.

492
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,820
Also, this is my plan. In the future, all the livestreams will be given to...

493
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,570
our Mu Xiaoyan to be in charge.

494
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,420
- Do you think I can?
- You doubt yourself?

495
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,230
I plan to stay behind the camera,

496
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,570
because I was really forcing myself to do the livestream before.

497
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,770
From the data, we can clearly see that Xiaoyan is much more suitable than me.

498
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,240
You are more relaxed, also you are very charming.

499
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
- I agree
- I second.

500
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
I'll try then.

501
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,320
The honorable crown.

502
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,610
GM Sheng, Lihe Capital's Director Xue would like to invite you and several major shareholders to have dinner together.

503
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,770
It's right here at the hotel. The shareholders want to know if they should be going.

504
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,580
The Hongmen Banquet is already at our door.
(T/N: a historical event where a festive banquet turned deadly)

505
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,920
We can't not go.

506
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:22,100
Lihe Capital is already a shareholder of Evergreen Hotel. For the future of Evergreen,

507
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,810
we will have to work together from now on.

508
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,220
Here.

509
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,480
Cheers to Evergreen Hotel's future!

510
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,950
Our food at Evergreen Hotel really is good.

511
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,290
GM Sheng, what do you think?

512
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,600
Director Xue, as long as you like it.

513
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,560
GM Sheng, Director Gao has organized all of the hotel's VIP information.

514
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,270
The new housekeeping manager will start tomorrow. Put the information in his office,

515
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,160
so he can take it over.

516
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,560
Understood.

517
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,960
GM Qin, what a coincidence.

518
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,810
How come you didn't come to the dinner with the shareholders?

519
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,760
I have been waiting for Director Xue for a while now.

520
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,580
That's perfect. I wanted to ask you something too. Let's go talk in the car.

521
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,460
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

522
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,800
