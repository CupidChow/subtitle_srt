00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,700
[Episode 26]

3
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Does it hurt?

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,200
I know you are juggling the hotel,

5
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,600
your sister, and me. You must be exhausted.

6
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I didn't want you to pick me up, fearing that something might happen when you are tired while driving.

7
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
It was not tired while driving.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
It was the car on the opposite side that drove on the wrong side.

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
That's even more terrifying.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't worry. I'm okay.

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't do that again.

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Although Shuangshuang hasn't accepted me,

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,500
I will stay by her side until she says yes.

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,200
What am I thinking?

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,700
Fu Shuangshuang, you are useless!

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,510
Although confessing during the livestream was so cliche,

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
it actually works, doesn't it?

18
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Can I help?

19
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
No need.

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
No?

21
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll trim the vegetables then?

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,800
That's water spinach, you need to keep the leaves.

23
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,300
Then... asparagus?

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
You can peel the potato.

25
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay.

26
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Peel higher, don't cut your hand.

27
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm fine.

28
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
You cut yourself.

29
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
It's not my blood.

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come.

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Does it hurt?

32
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,310
No.

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,200
Were you worried about me?

34
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,000
We are colleagues, it's normal to worry a bit.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,600
But the way you reacted,

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,000
it was not like you were worried for a colleague.

37
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,200
It's not true, nonsense.

38
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,400
Do you know why people always mistake us for a couple?

39
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Why?

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
I learned a new phrase online today.

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
- What was it?
- CP feel.
(T/N: CP stands for couple)

42
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
What is that?

43
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
It's the amazing chemistry between two individuals.

44
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
A bit like a chemical reaction, which you can't clearly explain.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,300
But it exists in little details in life.

46
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,100
Could be a caring look,

47
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
a special nickname,

48
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,900
or a little gesture.

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Anyways, I think we have a CP feel between us.

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Why do I feel that you are lying to me again?

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,200
You know best whether I'm lying to you or not.

52
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,570
Look.

53
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,400
Got your hand like this, you probably can't cook.

54
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Shall we go out for dinner?

55
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,800
You guys aren't married yet, there's already so much drama.

56
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,300
Who knows what that sister of his would do if you two really get married?

57
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,800
No. The way I see it,

58
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
she is being unreasonable because of her pregnancy.

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,900
Maybe things will be okay after the child is born, right?

60
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
That is possible.

61
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Not very likely.

62
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,500
- Actually...
- How about...

63
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,000
- Right?
- It's fine.

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll take care of it.

65
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,590
I just wanted to test how loyal you were to my brother.

66
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,000
Who knows, maybe it's our money that you are after.

67
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,700
I will never let you be a part of my family, no matter what.

68
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,200
And I won't stop until you leave my brother.

69
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
This can't go on.

70
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,400
Brother, aren't they beautiful?

71
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
What brings you here?

72
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
I would like to speak to you alone.

73
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
Okay, you two can talk.

74
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
What is it?

75
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,900
Zhening,

76
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,000
I've been thinking all night.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,900
And I think...

78
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
we should separate.

79
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
What?

80
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,500
I said we should separate. I know it has been difficult for you these days.

81
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
I don't want that.

82
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
You know me.

83
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,400
I just want a simple relationship.

84
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,200
I never expected to get involved in such a complicated family relationship.

85
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,510
It's already a handful now.

86
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,500
What will our future look like?

87
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
It will just keep draining us both.

88
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Sooner or later, we will part our ways.

89
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
Let's do it now rather than later.

90
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Don't you think you are being selfish?

91
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,780
I've always been selfish in a relationship.

92
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,390
I didn't expect you to be like this.

93
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,830
Sorry.

94
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
This is it.

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,600
Do you know what it means once you leave this room?

96
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I know it too well.

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
You broke up?

98
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Yes, we broke up.

99
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,200
Mom, really, I'm fine.

100
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
It's my decision after careful thinking. Stop worrying.

101
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm off, Uncle Hu.

102
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
No room for reconciliation?

103
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
- Why?
- Why?

104
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
No reason.

105
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
I don't want a relationship like that.

106
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,200
But isn't GM Sheng pretty good?

107
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000
He is. But it won't work. What can I do?

108
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Why wouldn't it work?

109
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Do I have to explain that to you?

110
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I asked you two over today, just to inform you.

111
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
That's all. Let's call it a day.

112
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,540
(Why?)

113
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,400
My brother broke up with Xia Qian.

114
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,000
Really?

115
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
I heard it myself.

116
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
They said it in my brother's office.

117
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,570
Although I do think that Brother Zhening did not take her seriously

118
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,400
and they dated just for fun, but this happened too quickly.

119
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,450
I think it was quite sudden, too.

120
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,170
But judging from the way my brother said it,

121
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,190
I think he was quite disappointed with Xia Qian.

122
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,210
But now Brother Zhening knows that he and Xia Qian are not a good fit. Isn't that nice?

123
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,420
Mengmeng, when can you get me an opportunity to spend some time with Brother Zhening?

124
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,870
My brother just broke up with Xia Qian.

125
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,790
He must be upset right now.

126
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,110
If you approach him now, wouldn't that put him off?

127
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,720
Mengmeng, you're thinking too much.

128
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,150
This is exactly when he needs company.

129
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,410
And Xia Qian is so cunning.

130
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,820
Who knows if she's playing hard to get. Right?

131
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,620
Is that so?

132
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,290
Then I'll invite my brother to have dinner with you in the next few days.

133
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,380
- You should schedule it soon.
- Okay.

134
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,610
I think it was because he had Xia Qian by his side,

135
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,810
that Brother Zhening didn't get to know me well.

136
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,030
Otherwise, he would definitely fall in love with me.

137
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,510
Good luck then, Manhui.

138
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,950
Dr. He, I heard your wife is pregnant. Congratulations.

139
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,880
Oh, speaking of that. I wanted to ask you.

140
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,580
What should a husband do when his wife is pregnant?

141
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,300
There's so much information online.

142
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,820
I think I should just ask you guys who have experience with it.

143
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,990
There's so much to do.

144
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,470
That's fine. You keep talking, I'll bear them in mind.

145
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,860
You see, first of all, you have to...

146
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,030
Xiaoai, let's go to the headquarters later.

147
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,360
We have to confirm the high-end cosmetics order today.

148
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,110
No problem.

149
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,810
Xiaoyan, look at this.

150
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,560
This is our plan for tonight's livestream. I sent a copy to your email too.

151
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,180
- Let me know if you have any questions.
- Okay.

152
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,500
Hello, Xia Qian. Are you coming home for lunch today?

153
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,820
Uncle Hu made stewed pig's feet for you.

154
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,450
He said it's good for the recovery of your wound.

155
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,960
Great, come back early.

156
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,000
She'll be here very soon.

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,620
Don't mention the breakup to her.

158
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,680
I know.

159
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,560
Tell me, Xiao Sheng is such a good guy.

160
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,800
Why would they break up like that?

161
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,190
Let the young people resolve their problems by themselves.

162
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,780
What are you worrying about?

163
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,150
Season the food lightly. Xia Qian must have lost her appetite.

164
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,020
Got it.

165
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,730
Why did they break up?

166
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,530
Mom, I'm hungry.

167
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,120
- Mom, can I get some staple food?
- Sure, yes.

168
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,630
- Yes.
- Of course.

169
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,320
- Go get it for her.
- Oh, no problem. I'll get it.

170
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,110
Forget about it!

171
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,990
I'm full.

172
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,830
You're full?

173
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,090
She doesn't want to make us worry. She's pretending to be fine.

174
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,320
Poor kid.

175
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,760
The best way to recover from the pain of love is to start a new relationship.

176
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,620
That makes sense.

177
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,190
I should find a new partner for Xia Qian soon.

178
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,900
Take this.

179
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,420
You should wear non-slip slippers at home.

180
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,220
I've also put a non-slip mat for you in the bathroom. We can move back home today.

181
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,730
Okay.

182
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,960
Here's the pregnancy meal plan I've prepared for you. Take a look.

183
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,790
I know that there's some food that you don't like,

184
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,660
but you can't be picky while you're pregnant.

185
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,990
Okay.

186
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,660
Oh, you should also rest early these days.

187
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,730
Don't stay up to watch TV dramas. Okay?

188
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,750
Do I snore when I sleep at night?

189
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,160
No. You're very quiet when you sleep.

190
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,860
That's good.

191
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,490
[Chief]

192
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,220
I'll answer a phone call.

193
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,360
[Chief]

194
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,930
Xiao He. We have another opportunity for further education.

195
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,890
It requires studying abroad for a month. I've signed you up for it.

196
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,930
This will be very helpful for your professional title assessment.

197
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,630
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm afraid I can't go.

198
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,800
My wife is pregnant. I have to take care of her at home.

199
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,460
Thank you.

200
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,460
Okay. Thanks, Chief.

201
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,030
Hubby, you should go this time.

202
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,190
I just got pregnant. It'll be okay. Don't worry about me.

203
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,450
I ruined your opportunity for further education last time.

204
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,740
And I've always felt so sorry.

205
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,160
Silly girl. Being pregnant is not just a matter of yours alone.

206
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,820
I know. The further education will only take a month.

207
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,990
Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself,

208
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,030
and my brother is here, too.

209
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,290
Hubby, I'm about to be a mother.

210
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,630
I'm no longer that little girl that needs you to worry about and care for all the time.

211
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,320
Okay. We'll decorate the baby's room together when I get back.

212
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,720
This whole fake breakup thing, is it the right thing to do?

213
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't know if it's the right thing.

214
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,120
Zhening.

215
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,960
The main reason why I did this, is because of you.

216
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,810
At least Ning Meng can be more emotionally stable while she's pregnant.

217
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,890
And it will be much easier on you.

218
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,860
I really don't want you to be torn apart between Ning Meng and me.

219
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,030
You know it.

220
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,740
When it comes to families, there's often no right or wrong.

221
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,030
If anything happens to Ning Meng, you will blame yourself, too.

222
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,830
Am I right?

223
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,660
It will become a secret love from now on.

224
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,570
I'm wondering when will be the next time we hug each other.

225
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,530
Zhijuan is attending further education abroad.

226
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,930
Thanks to Manhui's company, I'm not too bored.

227
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,830
Manhui is really virtuous and thoughtful.

228
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,300
Whoever gets married to Manhui must be the luckiest one!

229
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,960
You're overstating it.

230
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,870
Oh, I almost forgot that I have to attend a yoga lesson.

231
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,470
- You can chat. I have to go.
- I'll drive you there.

232
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,670
No, no. Brother. I've called a cab.

233
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,060
Manhui didn't drive today.

234
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,760
Brother, remember to drive her home after you guys are done.

235
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,730
Bye, Brother.

236
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,800
Brother Zhening, if you're too busy, I can just go home by myself.

237
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,500
It's okay.

238
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,100
Thank you so much for being there with Mengmeng these days.

239
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,230
One car, one apartment. Graduate student. 32 years old.

240
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,470
Look at this one. What do you think?

241
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,050
He's not as handsome as Xiao Sheng.

242
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,900
- Well, he is a bit...
- A bit ugly.

243
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,530
Next one. Look at this one.

244
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,670
Two cars, two apartments.

245
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,570
Even if he's got two cars and two apartments, he's not as rich as Xiao Sheng.

246
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,810
Why are you always comparing them with Xiao Sheng?

247
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,420
If Xia Qian could find someone like Xiao Sheng, it would only happen once in this lifetime! Why do you always compare them with him?

248
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,250
But the problem is that Xiao Sheng is our only comparison.

249
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,580
That makes sense. Check this one out.

250
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,510
How about this one? Graduate student.

251
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,490
Not as educated as Xiao Sheng.

252
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,430
Right. This is...

253
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,780
Stop it.

254
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,120
Well, you're back!

255
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,580
- I'm back.
- Well, it's him.

256
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,810
Uncle Hu said that the best way to get over someone is to start a new relationship.

257
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,070
That... Did you say that, Old Hu?

258
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,400
All right, all right. Let me tell you. Don't worry about my breakup.

259
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,930
I'm really not in the mood for a new relationship.

260
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,080
Well, you're at the age of marriage.

261
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,900
- No matter how old you are, you should get a partner.
- Exactly!

262
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,220
You haven't eaten, right? I'll make some food for you.

263
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,810
Right, we'll make some food.

264
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,740
I heard from Ning Meng that you like Blue Mountain Coffee, Brother Zhening.

265
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,670
I asked someone to bring back some from abroad. If you're not busy, I can make some coffee for you.

266
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,100
No, I'm good.

267
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,370
I've still got work to do. I won't drive you home.

268
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,170
My assistant Anan will drive you home.

269
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,600
Miss Chen, let's go.

270
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:20,590
What? Ning Meng has already matchmade for you?

271
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,720
Yeah.

272
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,660
My mom's asking me to browse all kinds of dating websites again.

273
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,860
I want to see you.

274
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,530
Not seeing you on my screen.

275
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,250
What can we do?

276
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,700
Close your eyes.

277
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
- Why?
- Just close your eyes.

278
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,200
Okay.

279
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,270
Now start imagining yourself walking on a lawn.

280
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,920
The wind is very gentle.

281
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,830
And out of nowhere, the smell of flowers wafts in the air. Wow!

282
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,210
What a pleasant smell!

283
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,540
At this moment, a girl

284
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,470
hugs you from behind.

285
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,840
Don't turn your head! Don't do it yet. You know it's me.

286
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,410
The girl holds you tightly from behind

287
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,090
and the two of you can feel each other's heartbeat.

288
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,710
Now, you're laughing and playing on the grass.

289
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,700
The sky is blue, and the cloud is wispy.

290
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,710
At this moment, the girl holds your hands.

291
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,290
As if you and she are the only people in this world.

292
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:27,140
And now, out of nowhere, music comes to your ear.

293
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,000
Why is it suddenly playing Chopin Nocturne?

294
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,380
You don't like it? I chose it. I just picked a random piece of classical music.

295
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,050
- What happens afterward?
- Afterward?

296
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,330
It's such a long story already! Isn't that enough?

297
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,530
The story ends here today.

298
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,880
What?

299
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,600
Then tell me what you want.

300
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,680
It's different from what I thought.

301
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,090
Tell me about it. What were you thinking?

302
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,130
Whatever you are thinking

303
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,350
is what I'm thinking.

304
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,110
I'm thinking...

305
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
I'm not thinking about anything.

306
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,440
You're thinking too much.

307
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,310
Fine. Then maybe I'm thinking too much.

308
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,670
It's almost midnight. You should go to bed.

309
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,270
- Okay. You should rest early too. 
- Bye.

310
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,000
Good night. Sleep early.

311
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,960
Come in.

312
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,190
Here's the quarterly financial statement. Please review it.

313
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,900
Help me check if there's any Chopin-themed piano concert here recently.

314
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,800
Are you going with Miss Xia?

315
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,220
Then I'll be happy to check it for you.

316
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:41,290
GM Sheng, I have a question, but I'm not sure if I should ask it.

317
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,190
What's the question?

318
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,590
Well, you and Miss Xia love each other so much,

319
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,830
why would you turn it into a secret love?

320
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,210
Are you looking for new excitement?

321
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,500
Shuangshuang! Leave! Don't come over. Leave now!

322
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,370
Go! Shuangshuang!

323
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,870
Shut up.

324
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,620
Go, Shuangshuang! It's dangerous!

325
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,300
Don't come close! I'll kill him if you do!

326
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,330
Shuangshuang! Leave quickly! Shuangshuang!

327
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,280
Shuangshuang.

328
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,560
Didn't I tell you not to worry about me and leave by yourself?

329
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,200
How could I just leave you?

330
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,820
Since you care about me so much, and you saved me,

331
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,670
from today on, I'm yours.

332
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,660
- What do you want?
- Don't waste time.

333
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,010
Don't move.

334
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,070
You look quite handsome.

335
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,850
What am I thinking in the middle of the night!

336
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,860
Oh my god!

337
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,400
Fu Shuangshuang, are you crazy? Wake up!

338

[Worth or Not]

339
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,830
Sister Qian, you've got a package.

[Come Across Chopin Piano Concert]
[Jinhai Baoyue Theater]

341
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,300
I assume you've got the ticket.

342
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,530
I'll meet you at 8:00 p.m., see you.

343
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,860
Brother, this is the first time that Manhui is visiting our hotel. You should show her around.

344
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,180
I've got a lot of work today. I don't have time.

345
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,500
Brother, her dad is the Deputy GM of Mingcheng Group.

346
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,860
Maybe in the future, Mingcheng Group can be our client as well.

347
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,870
GM Sheng, your meeting with the Marketing Department will start in five minutes.

348
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,380
Okay. I'll be right there.

349
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,450
You can show Ning Meng and Miss Chen Manhui around in our hotel.

350
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,230
Okay.

351
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,080
[Come Across Chopin Piano Concert]

352
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,360
Miss Ning Meng, shall we go?

353
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,200
I'm sorry, guys. I have to leave early to deal with something urgent.

354
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,850
We'll review tonight's livestream tomorrow morning.

355
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,450
Okay?

356
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,220
Sister Qian either works overtime or leaves early.

357
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,430
Looks like she's still tortured by the pain of the breakup.

358
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,040
Oh. If you ask what love is,

359
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,900
I have no idea.

360
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,130
Hi. I've arrived at the concert hall.

361
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,950
I'll be there right away. Wait for me.

362
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,780
No rush. The concert hasn't started yet.

363
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,060
Brother!

364
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,490
Brother Zhening.

365
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,880
I see why you didn't want to show us around at Evergreen.

366
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,850
It's because you want to listen to the concert alone!

367
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,840
Well, the two of you...

368
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,240
I saw your ticket. So we bought the tickets, too.

369
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,160
You can't run away from us now, right?

370
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,940
The concert is about to start.

371
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,610
What are you looking at? Let's go.

372
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,620
How come you are out here?

373
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,830
Come with me. The concert is about to start.

374
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,630
Where to?

375
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,050
Here?

376
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,480
Although the audio-visual quality is not ideal here,

377
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,800
at least no one will disturb us.

378
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,400
Here it goes.

379
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,070
You've never seen me dance. Want to see it now?

380
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,330
You must be tired now. Maybe next time.

381
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,690
You are turning me down.

382
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,680
Well, if you insist.

383
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,050
Shall I twirl for you?

384
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,620
After you, Miss Xia.

385
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,100
Let's go.

386
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,040
Next week, there's also a concert of Mozart's symphony.

387
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,090
Still going?

388
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,830
But Ning Meng hasn't totally bought our story.

389
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,880
It won't be easy for us to meet.

390
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,000
Besides,

391
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,340
going to a concert, all we do is...

392
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,250
It's a bit disrespectful to the performers.

393
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,640
Off you go. Drive safely.

394
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,630
Okay. I'm off.

395
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,240
Xia Qian!

396
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,950
Mom!

397
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,560
What are you doing?

398
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,850
Who drove you back?

399
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,410
A client, a female client.

400
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,800
It was a guy, I saw it.

401
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,140
- Mom, can you stop being so nosy?
- I...

402
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,080
I'm very hungry after a whole day of work.

403
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,610
Get me something to eat.

404
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,900
Next time, invite him in. This kid...

405
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,680
To support our listing process,

406
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,910
establishing an E-commerce Department is only imperative.

407
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,380
Let's vote then. Those who are in favor, please raise your hand.

408
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,110
Then I have a question. What are we going to do with the staff of the new department?

409
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,740
For now, we could transfer staff from various departments, then provide them with unified E-commerce training.

410
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,620
Manager Wang from the Marketing Department will be in charge. HR Department, please assist.

411
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,840
The staff shouldn't be all from Evergreen. We should take in some fresh blood.

412
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,200
I think Miss Xia Qian, who worked with our Sales Department, would be a good choice.

413
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,380
She has an internet-based mindset.

414
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,170
Why are you sighing so early in the morning?

415
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,220
I thought it would at least take half a year for our Xia Qian to recover from the breakup.

416
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,560
It turns out that

417
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,790
she has already found a new boyfriend so quickly.

418
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,210
She has a new boyfriend?

419
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,240
Yes! I saw him drive her home last night, I saw it with my own eyes.

420
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,110
No way. You must be mistaken.

421
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,820
How could I? My intuition has always been spot-on.

422
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,970
I'm not over Xiao Sheng yet. She has already moved on.

423
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,230
How can she be so fickle?

424
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,910
Meet me at the cafe at noon. It's business.

425
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,500
Mom.

426
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,350
Something came up at work, I'm leaving.

427
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,210
Okay.

428
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,610
I couldn't finish. You take the rest.

429
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,750
Look at her, look at her!

430
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:17,700
As if nothing had happened. Who did she get that heartlessness from?

431
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,370
You want me to join the E-commerce Department at Evergreen?

432
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,440
Is it for personal reasons or...

433
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,260
Asking you to work at Evergreen was proposed by other shareholders.

434
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,530
Of course, I'd be lying if I said I was completely neutral.

435
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,280
I'm just going with the flow.

436
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,460
In that case, I shall respectfully accept.

437
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,620
Then you coming to work, is it for personal reasons or...

438
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,670
Apparently, it's personal.

439
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,210
You are going to work at Evergreen?

440
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,990
Yes.

441
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,800
I will hand over the streaming-related work to you both within this week.

442
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,020
Me going to work at Evergreen doesn't mean that I don't care about our livestream.

443
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,280
It's like this.

444
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,800
Evergreen is one of the shareholders of our livestream business, and I'm working for their E-commerce Department.

445
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,570
That is to say, our livestream business is an extension of their E-commerce Department. Also, we are an independent entity.

446
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,410
Are we clear?

447
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,830
That'll be all.

448
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,280
What is happening?

449
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,660
The way I see it, Sheng Zhening is not completely over Sister Qian yet. He wants her by his side, so he can win her back.

450
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,880
Really?

451
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,940
It's the typical plot in romance novels.

452
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,900
A moment, please, everyone.

453
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,230
Allow me to introduce Miss Xia Qian. Starting from today,

454
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,080
Miss Xia will be the temporary team leader of Project A in our department.

455
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,890
Hello, everyone. I'm Xia Qian.

456
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,030
Let's give her a warm welcome.

457
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,620
I look forward to working with you all.

458
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,410
This way, please.

459
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,850
Team Leader Xia, your workstation is over here.

460
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,440
This is mine?

461
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,490
- All these plants and flowers...
- To welcome our new colleague.

462
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,210
Thank you, Manager Wang.

463
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,580
Who is she? How come Wang is treating her with so much respect?

464
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,400
- With a humidifier, it wouldn't be so dry.
- I know.

465
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,780
- She is GM Sheng's girlfriend.
- But if you put it in the middle, everyone can share it.

466
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,470
- Really?
- It has always been here.

467
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,490
I see.

468
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,450
- Very well, then.
- If there's nothing else, I'll be off now.

469
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,050
Please go ahead.

470
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,970
Thank you, Manager Wang.

471
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,800

00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,900
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

483
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,020
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

484
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,430
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

485
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:44,160
♫ I am here anyway ♫

486
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,100
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

487
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,180
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

488
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,580
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

489
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,700
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

490
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:07,780
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

491
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,840
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

492
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,130
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

493
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,620
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

494
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:35,670
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

495
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,030
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

496
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,310
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

497
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,780
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

498
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,610
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

499
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,660
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

500
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,160
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

501
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,190
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

502
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,350
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

503
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,630
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

504
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,360
♫ I am here anyway ♫

505
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,270
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

506
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,500
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

507
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,850
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

508
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,980
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

509
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:41,960
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
