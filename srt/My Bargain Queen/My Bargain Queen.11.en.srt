[Episode 11]

3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,270
[Worth or Not]

4
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,120
[Are you at home? Busy recently? I came over to feed the cat. Don't worry.]

5
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,460
Something seems off with Sister Qian today.

6
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,610
No, not really.

7
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,290
Why are you hiding your phone?

8
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm not.

9
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,110
Are you in a relationship?

10
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,060
What are you talking about? I'm working.

11
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,200
Really?

12
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,040
Get back to work. Are you slacking when Sister Qian is out?

13
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,070
I'm telling her right now.

14
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,470
Fine, fine.

15
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,570
I'll record you.

16
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,410
Didn't you sleep at Miss Xia's place last night?

17
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,060
What happened to your forehead?

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
The budget is way over.

19
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,860
I'll tell the Purchasing Department to make another budget report.

20
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,650
Brother, where are you staying now? I'd like to come and see you.

21
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,230
Last time, I didn't see you at Evergreen Hotel.

22
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Also, I didn't help with the renovations of Building No. 2.

23
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,930
Mengmeng, don't worry. I'm staying with a friend. Everything is fine.

24
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,130
Take care of yourself. I have a meeting. I'll talk to you later.

25
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,970
Sure, take care of yourself.

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,660
Mengmeng.

27
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,160
- Zhijuan!
- Why did you prepare so much fruit?

28
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,550
I prepared everything you like. Have a taste.

29
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,940
I've already eaten at the hospital.

30
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,400
But I took a long time to prepare it. Come, sit down.

31
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,870
First, some kiwi.

32
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,530
Very sweet.

33
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,980
Zhijuan, I always want to help out,

34
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,150
but nobody seems to need me.

35
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,500
Come.

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,140
Overthinking is not good for you.

37
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,530
Why don't we try to find something you like. Or a job?

38
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,740
Then you'll be too busy to overthink.

39
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,260
Sheng Zhening, hurry up and take your shower. I'll take one after you.

40
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,960
Okay.

41
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,290
I bargained the floor price down by two yuan.

42
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,520
How about the timber?

43
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,110
I can bring it down by 50 cents, tops.

44
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,720
Fine, as long as it's a discount. Every penny counts.

45
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,360
Tomorrow you and Mu Xiaoyan go and find out about the wall paints.

46
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,700
- See how much of a discount they can offer.
- Okay

47
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,060
Okay, bye.

48
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,980
Although we've done bargain cases for decoration materials before,

49
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,040
most of them are worth 2-3 million, tops.

50
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,620
I've never done one that is worth tens of millions. I'm not confident at all.

51
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,580
In essence, they are the same. The only difference is the scale.

52
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,460
The bigger in quantity, the bigger the space for bargaining.

53
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,080
Compared to your smaller deals, this one will be easier to handle.

54
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,410
- Theoretically—
- Stop being modest.

55
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,990
You did a pretty good job for the group automobile purchase.

56
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,690
Indeed, Miss Xia, you really should take it.

57
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,970
Did you take it or not?

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,340
- Well? Such a big project!
- Right! Right!

59
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,300
What can I do?

60
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
You didn't take it?

61
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,950
Look at you both!

62
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,060
Such a big project, with so much money, how can I drop it?

63
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,850
- Yes!
- We'll be rich!

64
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,330
Now, listen. Put everything else on hold for now.

65
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,930
We need to focus on the renovation of Evergreen Hotel Building No. 2. This is our priority.

66
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,080
- Yes, sir!
- Understood

67
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,220
Why is it that we cross paths with Evergreen so much lately?

68
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,780
Last time, there was so much crisis. But eventually, we earned big.

69
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,300
Good things come to those who wait.

70
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,780
We'll get rich!

71
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,680
It's your treat.

72
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,790
I'm leaving.

73
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,150
Are you sure they've signed with Worth or Not?

74
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,120
Affirmative. They have signed the contract.

75
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,040
Fu Shuangshuang works there. Maybe we can use her.

76
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,730
I have my own plan. You can leave.

77
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,260
Very well.

78
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,260
Have you been really busy lately? You don't even go home.

79
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,620
I've fed the cat. Don't worry.

80
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,920
[Just got back from a business trip.]

81
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,840
[Thanks for taking care of the cat.]

82
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,940
Just got back from a business trip. Thanks for taking care of the cat.

83
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,970
You can't treat a cat like this. If you really care...

84
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,460
You're welcome.

85
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,710
Such a cold response, are you mad that I replied late?

86
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,800
[From: Qin Hebo]

87
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,790
Such a cold response, are you mad that I replied late?

88
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,310
No.

89
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,010
That means "yes." Let me make it up to you.

90
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,120
I am not angry. You don't need to make it up to me. I am going to bed now.

91
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,450
What is that?

92
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,480
What were you looking at so happily?

93
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,810
What?

94
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,550
I asked you a question.

95
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,640
I was counting money.

96
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,860
No wonder you were so happy.

97
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,990
How much is your budget for the wood flooring? I made a price list, have a look.

98
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,690
It works.

99
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,620
Did you even have a good look at it?

100
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,410
Why are you here?

101
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,060
I was passing by so I thought I would bring you something.

102
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,730
Come over, I brought you some snacks.

103
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,680
I know you are angry because I did not respond quickly.

104
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,760
So I am here to formally apologize.

105
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
I am really not angry.

106
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,580
I just feel like you did not take responsibility for your cat.

107
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,950
I have been pretty busy on a business trip the past few days,

108
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,960
but I told the housekeeper to take care of it.

109
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,630
I didn't realize she would be so careless.

110
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,750
I promise a situation like this will never happen again.

111
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,840
If you are busy just let me know, I can take care of it for a few days.

112
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,400
Really?

113
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,820
That's great. I really swear it will not happen again.

114
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,630
Next time, I will definitely let you know beforehand.

115
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,700
Then I will reluctantly forgive you on your cat's behalf.

116
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,500
Then on my cat's behalf, please have some treats.

117
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,930
You're so generous.

118
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,690
Have a look.

119
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,310
Three layers.

120
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,290
Then I won't hold back.

121
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,720
It's really good.

122
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,460
Eat more.

123
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,660
It's getting late, time to sleep.

124
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,170
I can't sleep. I still haven't finished organizing the price for Everygreen's bedding.

125
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,200
What are you doing?

126
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,940
As your employer, I order you to go to bed immediately.

127
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,900
I refuse.

128
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,650
I will fire you.

129
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Then as your landlord, I can kick you out of the house. Leave!

130
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,690
Take a shower then go to bed.

131
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,000
You can't just take it!

132
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,090
You can't control me.

133
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,850
It's getting late, shouldn't you be sleeping?

134
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,440
Ever since you finished eating, you have been stuck to your computer typing. What are you doing?

135
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,710
It's for your Evergreen.

136
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,300
Evergreen?

137
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Your Evergreen Hotel's Building No.2 renovation materials are being bargained and managed by my company.

138
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,500
I am working hard so that your hotel can save money.

139
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,850
Am I doing a good job?

140
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah, it's pretty good.

141
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,230
Material, price, and price ratios are all very clear.

142
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,020
I am very impressed.

143
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,630
You-You should also head back so you can rest early.

144
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,460
The cat is also at home all alone right now.

145
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,970
That's true.

146
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,760
How about this? When you're done working, we should go out to eat.

147
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

148
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,350
I'm leaving.

149
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,890
Bye-bye.

150
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,890
Rest early.

151
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,070
Open the door.

152
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,680
- Who is it?
- Your mom, me!

153
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,030
- Mom
- What took so long?

154
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,230
Open the door! Open the door!

155
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,540
What are you doing?

156
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,130
Sheng Zhening!

157
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,540
What?

158
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,760
Get up! My mom is at the door!

159
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,940
Open the door!

160
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,740
This child...

161
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,280
Open the door!

162
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,430
What are you doing?

163
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,950
Mom, why are you here?

164
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,200
I brought you breakfast.

165
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,750
Just giving it to me is fine, I'm going downstairs to work.

166
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,250
Why didn't you let me in earlier?

167
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,480
I was cleaning up.

168
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,100
You don't have something you are hiding, right?

169
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,410
Why would I have a secret?

170
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,970
I was cleaning up. The house is a mess and I was afraid you would scold me.

171
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,740
Is that so?

172
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,590
What secret would I have? What don't you know?

173
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,860
Hurry up.

174
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,710
I have stuff to do, I need to go downstairs.

175
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,260
It will be really fast. Did you even brush your teeth before drinking that?

176
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,030
I brushed already, I brushed as soon as I woke up.

177
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,750
Hey!

178
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,990
Explain, what is going on here?

179
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,050
Speak.

180
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,200
Fu Shuangshuang.

181
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,150
Two days ago she came over and stayed the night. I haven't had time to clean up.

182
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,810
Fu Shuangshuang was living here?

183
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,160
That child...doesn't even clean up when

184
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,980
living in another person's house.

185
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,720
It's a simple task.

186
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,780
That's right.

187
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,370
That's enough.

188
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,470
I am leaving. Quickly eat before it gets cold.

189
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,870
You were the one who came to find me.

190
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,320
- Otherwise, I would have cleaned up.
- Okay. Hurry up! Brush your teeth and clean your face.

191
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,150
That's enough, you don't need to see me off. I'm leaving.

192
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,260
I am not sending you off. Hurry up and leave, I am in a rush.

193
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
This child...

194
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,920
- Okay?
- Okay, I know!

195
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,990
The blankets were still warm.

196
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,980
Come on out, my mom left.

197
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,460
Xiao Sheng, wouldn't you say that your relationship is developing too fast?

198
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,950
Mom, we are just roommates.

199
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,510
- We haven't slept together yet.
- Shut up!

200
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,750
Come on, have a seat.

201
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,810
Let go!

202
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,040
You two weren't even on good terms a few days ago,

203
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,910
why are you guys suddenly roommates?

204
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,190
After my unwavering efforts,

205
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,660
Qianqian was moved by my sincerity. Isn't that right?

206
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,330
- Yes.
- So that's how it was.

207
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,060
Look at you two. It's not that I don't approve of you two.

208
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,470
But is it necessary to hide it from me?

209
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,960
Mom, we didn't want to hide it from you.

210
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,550
It's just that it hasn't been that long so we haven't had time to tell you.

211
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,860
Next time, if there are new developments you have to let me know right away. Okay?

212
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,210
Things like engagement, marriage, pregnancies are all big events in one's life.

213
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,860
Do you understand?

214
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,680
Understood.

215
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,420
You keep going on and on,

216
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,120
he has to go to work.

217
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,850
Oh, then I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

218
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,300
Sit down. I will send him off.

219
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,500
Okay, okay.

220
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,690
Let's go.

221
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,740
- Okay. I'm leaving, Auntie.
- Come back often.

222
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,490
Let's go.

223
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,140
Bye, Mom.

224
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,740
W-What do we do in the future?

225
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,130
What else can we do?

226
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,020
We already told my mom, so we have to keep pretending.

227
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,270
- But—
- To thank you for cooperating, you don't have to pay rent.

228
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,540
But pretend till when?

229
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,130
How should I know?

230
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,100
Maybe one day I will find true love and dump you.

231
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,060
Why can't it be that I dump you?

232
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,520
Why would you dump me?

233
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,140
The character you portrayed is someone who pursued after me.

234
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,550
You pestered me to be with you. You are the infatuated one.

235
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,370
So, only I can be the jerk.

236
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,800
Then maybe my infatuation and single-mindedness is all an act.

237
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,690
I am originally a jerk and after deceiving you, I dump you.

238
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,320
Why would you deceive me? You can't manipulate my feelings.

239
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,820
Then that's settled. Only I can dump you, I will be the jerk.

240
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,920
If I dump you, you will still have some face.

241
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,650
Get in the car.

242
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm off.

243
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Hurry up.

244
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
Why are we here? Do you want cake?

245
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,200
One moment.

246
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Is it pretty?

247
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Do I look like a pastry chef?

248
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Indeed you do.

249
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Very much.

250
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,900
Hubby, didn't you say that I should find a job

251
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,400
to keep myself occupied.

252
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
So I rented this place.

253
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,500
It's just opposite your hospital.

254
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
We can go to work and leave together every day.

255
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't you think I'm thorough, hubby?

256
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
But, Mengmneg...

257
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Running a bakery is a lot of work.

258
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,200
You just decided like that. Will it last long?

259
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Don't worry, Hubby.

260
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
I've always liked making desserts.

261
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,400
For sure, I'll be fantastic at it.

262
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
Very well, then.

263
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
As we have discussed before,

264
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,300
you were all happy with the price we offered.

265
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Today, I've invited you here to discuss the discounts again.

266
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,200
Here is what I think—

267
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,500
You know our prices over the past years.

268
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,600
This is the lowest we can offer.

269
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
True. It won't even cover the cost if it gets lower.

270
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
I understand that.

271
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,100
First, let me finish.

272
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,700
This discussion today is also for your own interest.

273
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,900
If you agree with my offer,

274
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
upon the completion of Evergreen Building No.2,

275
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
you can put your own advertisement

276
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,900
in its washrooms, elevators, corridors, etc.

277
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
You all know Evergreen Hotel.

278
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,800
They have a huge clientele, which means huge potential benefits with advertisements.

279
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,600
The way I see it, this is a win-win deal.

280
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
You can all take it into consideration.

281
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,000
- It could work.
- Yeah.

282
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Finally done!

283
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,700
My work is done. Want to have dinner?

284
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,000
Sure, same place.

285
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
Okay!

286
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,800
Are you tired?

287
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
I'm fine.

288
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Hey, what shall we eat?

289
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,250
Hubby!

290
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,600
I’m here to pick you up.

291
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Okay! I'll leave you two to it. I'll disappear!

292
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,990
It's so late. Why are you here?

293
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,600
Have you forgotten? My bakery closes at the same time.

294
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,000
From now on, we can come and go together.

295
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,700
How romantic, don't you think?

296
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,200
Fine.

297
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Cheers!

298
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
You are in a good mood today.

299
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,600
I am! Work is finally finished.

300
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
So beautiful is my mood.

301
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
Let's drink and celebrate, then.

302
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,100
Sure.

303
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
Wow. This one is finished already.

304
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Excuse me! One more bottle, please.

305
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,020
Cheers!

306
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,700
- Make sure you eat.
- Okay.

307
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Why are you watching me eat? Eat yourself.

308
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,500
This is not bad.

309
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,100
Stop drinking.

310
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
Okay, okay.

311
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Here, all yours.

312
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Two more to come. Enjoy!

313
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,100
- Hurry up!
- Fine. You go ahead.

314
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Darling, I want the eyes.

315
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
He's the guest. Let him have it.

316
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,400
- Mom!
- Thanks, Auntie.

317
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Here.

318
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
Take more.

319
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
I will!

320
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not full yet.

321
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Rice, please.

322
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

323
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Here, Darling.

324
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Thank you!

325
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You are welcome, Darling.

326
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Here, Darling, open up.

327
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Me, too.

328
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
I say, someone else is here.

329
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,990
Auntie, please help yourself.

330
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm so stuffed.

331
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,880
And he forgot his wallet.

332
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,800
Mom.

333
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
What are you doing?

334
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
Give it back!

335
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,000
- Give me the photo.
- I gave it to Xiao Sheng.

336
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
- You gave it to him?
- Yes.

337
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
What's going on? Are you selling your own daughter?

338
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Correct! Congratulations!

339
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Let go of me.

340
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
What kind of mother are you?

341
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,300
Fine, I won't give it to him.

342
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
So cruel.

343
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,700
Also, my mom likes you a lot.

344
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,500
She almost wants me to marry you right now.

345
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,100
Can't you be a little annoying?

346
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,800
Keep some distance from her.

347
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Make her hate you.

348
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,000
In this way, when I dump you, she won't hate me.

349
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,400
The image I built is a dedicated nice guy.

350
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
What are you doing?

351
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
Nothing.

352
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,400
I didn't purposely hide in your closet.

353
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Then, what?

354
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,000
That photo in your wallet, I want it back.

355
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
I hid it.

356
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,000
I know. Where did you hide it?

357
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm telling you, you'll never find it.

358
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,600
That's my photo.

359
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,800
Auntie gave it to me. So, it's mine now.

360
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,000
Tell me. What do you want my photo for?

361
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,700
- None of your business.
- Do you want to make fun of me?

362
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,800
You are sticking around... what? You want to watch me sleep?

363
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Go ahead.

364
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Get out!

365
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Just you wait. One day I'll find it.

366
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,930
Xiaoyan, what's on your mind?

367
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:11,570
I saw Sister Qian seeing a stranger off a few days ago. Maybe they have a thing?

368
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,260
A client, maybe? Don't overthink.

369
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,100
Fine. I've got my eyes on them anyway. Don't you lie to me!

370
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,640
I want to ask you something.

371
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,740
If a man makes porridge for you

372
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,290
when you have a hangover, gives you his house password,

373
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,140
and often treats you to dinners and drinks,

374
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,990
do you think he likes you?

375
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,390
Someone is pursuing you?

376
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,770
Not me! It happened to my friend. She was asking me.

377
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,030
Your friend sounds like a romantic idiot.

378
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,350
Only under two circumstances will a man go this far.

379
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,670
What circumstances?

380
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,900
One, he likes her.

381
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,400
And the second?

382
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,870
Two, they are siblings long separated.

383
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,250
What do you think my friend should do?

384
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,540
If I were her, I would be more expressive. Give more positive reactions.

385
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,740
How?

386
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,610
GM Sheng, something's up.

387
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,070
What's wrong?

388
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,400
Heavy rain in the south. Our delivery trucks got caught up in mudslide and rolled over.

389
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,170
Luckily, no one got hurt. But we lost the timber and the tiles.

390
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,030
Was it fully insured?

391
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,230
I've contacted them. They are dodging with excuses.

392
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,220
Even if we get compensation, it would only be 10%. Should we go to court?

393
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,130
If we go to court, everything will be too late.

394
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,420
Make purchases again. We can't delay the deadline.

395
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,020
Understood.

396
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,450
How much was the loss?

397
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,780
Four trucks' worth.

398
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,980
They already have a tight budget. It won't last long.

399
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,920
Are you busy, Vice GM Qin?

400
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,380
Director Song, please sit.

401
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,430
You can't spare 3 million?

402
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,050
You are a member of the board.

403
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,950
For sure, you can benefit from the completion of Building No.2.

404
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,690
Okay, understood.

405
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,980
Hey, I've heard about the timber tiles.

406
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,460
Are we getting tight on budget?

407
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:00,350
Okay, I'll try to bring the price down further.

408
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,630
It can't be done.

409
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,650
Lower prices might compromise the quality of the product. I don't want that.

410
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,460
Then, what can we do?

411
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,410
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

412
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,510
But this can't happen again.

413
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,870
Not just me, other shareholders are not happy

414
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,250
with GM Sheng's decision to renovate, either.

415
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,880
He's too young, easily carried away by impulse.

416
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,180
We've been discussing,

417
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,570
and agreed that you are a better fit for the general manager post.

418
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,340
If you are willing,

419
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,170
we can join forces with other shareholders and make it happen.

420
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,580
No need to be concerned.

421
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,000
We only need to persuade the shareholders who are close to Sheng Zhening.

422
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,650
It won't be too hard. But the thing is, are you willing?

423
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,260
Please give me some time to consider.

424
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,790
Think it through, then. Give me an answer soon, so that we can proceed.

425
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,950
Understood.

426
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,400
This way, please.

427
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,910
What do you think, Vice GM Qin?

428
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,100
It would be nice to become the general manager.

429
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,900
But a handful of shareholders' support won't be enough. Sheng Zhening is the key.

430
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,030
[Caller: Fu Shuangshuang]

431
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,460
- Hello?
- Hello.

432
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,720
Thanks for taking me home and preparing breakfast.

433
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,660
No problem.

434
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,710
Are you free tonight? Let me treat you to a movie.

435
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,540
Movie?

436
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,060
I should reciprocate.

437
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,500
Very well, then. I'll pick you up after work.

438
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,480
I'll leave you to your work, then.

439
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,160
Bye-bye.

440
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,790
Boss, could it be that she has fallen for you?

441
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,550
I don't think it's necessary for you two to stay in touch.

442
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:22,330
No... this is the funny part, it's not scary yet.

443
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,460
It's just horror movies are usually funny first,

444
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,190
later you will cry. I'm taking precautions.

445
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:39,590
If you are so scared, why do you have to watch it?

446
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,130
It's probably been too long since I've watched a horror film.

447
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,600
Not scared now, are you?

448
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,840
Hey! I'll buy you something to drink.

449
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,970
Okay.

450
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,630
What would you like?

451
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,100
Would you like...?

452
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,410
Anything will do.

453
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,360
Two cokes, please.

454
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,150
We have a promotion for couples. If you two can take a photo

455
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,390
and pin it on our wall, we will offer free drinks and popcorn. How about...

456
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,770
Sorry, you got it wrong. We are not a couple.

457
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,090

488
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,480
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

489
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,160
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

490
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,550
♫ I am here anyway ♫

491
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,420
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

492
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,600
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

493
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,310
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

494
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,130
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

495
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:01,460
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
