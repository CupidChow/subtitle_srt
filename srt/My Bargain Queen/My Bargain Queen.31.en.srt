- Did you find it?

It's not here. It's such a big ring, and it just disappeared like that.

- Go buy one . Hurry and buy one.

Then the ring must be hidden inside the cake.

This is an old trick. Go on and see.

Why hasn't he proposed to me?

It is weird. He purposely took you to the amusement park,

but didn't even do anything.

67

He filled me with so much hope,

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,260
a woman accepting a man's proposal

128
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,340
should not be an impulsive decision.

129
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,950
A man's proposal should not

130
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,230
be accepted because it automatically moves the woman.

131
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,270
If you want the woman to give you her heart,

132
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,670
for her to become your wife,

133
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,860
starting from when they first meet,

134
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,640
you start to work on it.

So, in this world, there is no

136
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,070

137
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,270
is two people's

138
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,680
every moment, every second.

139
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,150
It is understanding. It is tolerating.

It is the beautiful scenery of the journey.

00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,800
You're awake? Get ready for breakfast.

169
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,900
I had Director Sun go instead.

170
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,110
I have more important things to do today.

171
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,230
What important things?

172
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,400
After eating breakfast, we should go to Liping Barbecue.

173
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,870
I've already proposed, we should let your mom know about it.

174
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,870
How about we go back to the hotel?

175
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,620
What's wrong?

176
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,950
My suit today doesn't feel formal enough.

177
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,470
What side of you hasn't my mom seen?

178
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,240
She will like whatever you wear.

179
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,410
Don't be so scrupulous.

180
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,460
Xiaoyan, with Sister Qian's engagement,

181
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,900
what present do you plan to give her?

182
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,950
I don't know. What are you gifting her?

183
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,470
- I already bought it
- What are you giving her?

184
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,080
I can't tell you.

185
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,340
I suck at giving gifts.

186
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,400
What do I do?

187
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,830
I think they don't need anything,

188
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,710
so gifts represent your regard.

189
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,040
I think you should gift those things that they will use sooner or later.

190
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,400
You need to think about it in the long run.

191
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,300
Something they can use sooner or later?

192
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,630
What are you thinking about?

193
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,420
I think I should buy something. I can't just show up

194
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,320
empty handed.

195
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,180
There's no need. Telling my mom will make her happier than anything else could.

196
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,130
Wait. Wait.

197
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,940
Let me think about how to tell Auntie.

198
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,900
Let's go. You don't need to think, you will know soon.

199
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,940
Hurry up.

200
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,160
Let's go. Why are you so heavy?

201
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,180
Go in.

202
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,970
This time Chef Hu made a good purchase. It smells good.

203
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,880
Tell her.

204
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,840
- What's wrong? Why are you so serious?
- He has something to say.

205
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,760
Say it.

206
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,440
Auntie, I proposed to her.

207
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,320
- Really?
- Mom.

208
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,470
I know Qianqian is your most important person

209
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,010
so I will definitely love her,

210
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,540
respect her, protect her. I hope you—

211
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,430
I agree. I agree.

212
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,930
Then, when will you have the wedding?

213
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,330
See? My mom didn't even have to think about it.

214
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:13,090
Think about it? It is so hard to find a son-in-law as good as Xiao Sheng. Why would I think about it?

215
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,430
B-But Auntie, don't you

216
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,880
want to hear about our plans for the future

217
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,210
- and life—
- I don't want to hear about it.

218
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,050
No, that's not what I mean.

219
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,250
You, young people, have your own plans.

220
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,640
You have your own pace for life. I don't want to interfere too much.

221
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,980
Besides, I won't even understand if you tried to explain your jobs to me.

222
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,150
But, about getting married,

223
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,460
there are a few things I want to tell you.

224
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,390
Don't mind me being wordy.

225
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,500
Marriage life is not as romantic as you think,

226
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,430
it is not like how it is on TV.

227
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,470
Just shopping, cooking,

228
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,230
watching TV will not allow you to maintain the relationship.

229
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,160
Marriage requires managing and protecting from the both of you.

230
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,530
Of course, it is not a simple thing.

231
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,090
Once you guys have lived together for a long time,

232
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,190
there will be some clashes, some conflicts.

233
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,120
During these times do not be dissatisfied.

234
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,330
Be tolerant and understanding. Learn to stand in the other's shoes and see things from their point of view.

235
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,290
Think about each other's benefits and forgive them.

236
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,980
The most important thing is that

237
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,820
you need to trust one another.

238
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,430
That way your marriage can last a long time.

239
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,670
Aunt, I understand.

240
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,870
Since you're so easygoing today,

241
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,480
let's not mention children...

242
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,660
You guys should have children soon.

243
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,970
It's a very important thing! How old are you?

244
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:58,000
Pre-pregnancy and prenatal care is very complicated. There are a long of things to prepare.

245
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,820
Old Hu! Old Hu!

246
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,470
No, stop yelling.

247
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,910
I'm asking him to prepare some chicken soup.

248
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,730
We have to make chicken soup, and you have to eat it every day.

249
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,610
I won't count on him. I'll buy a chicken and make chicken soup for you now.

250
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,170
Bye!

251
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,580
That's how she is.

252
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,920
Excuse me.

253
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Why are you here?

254
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,260
What a coincidence.

255
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,440
- You're buying babies clothes, too?
- Yeah.

256
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,570
Is there anyone in your family expecting a baby?

257
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,580
No.

258
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,480
Then why...?

259
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,460
You can't be buying this for...

260
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,970
Yeah. An engagement gift for Miss Xia and GM Sheng.

261
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,540
You can't do that.

262
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,110
Why not?

263
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,190
Because I'm buying this as a gift. We can't buy the same thing.

264
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,380
Then you should get something else! I was here first.

265
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,430
I decided yesterday!

266
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,950
I decided yesterday evening.

267
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,160
Hi, please wrap this for me.

268
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,230
Are you paying together?

269
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,640
- Separately.
- Separately.

270
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,290
Okay.

271
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,870
The clothes you bought won't be useful. GM Sheng likes girls.

272
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,080
Who knows if they'll have a girl or a boy?

273
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

274
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,750
I can tell from your tone over the phone. It must be good news.

275
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,050
Tell me how he proposed to you. Tell me now!

276
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,600
Please! Tell me about it! Now!

277
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,350
- You already know.
- Was it really romantic?

278
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,780
Well, the scene of the proposal wasn't that romantic.

279
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,410
What? Tell me about it. What was it like?

280
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,270
I got very desperate. So I proposed to him.

281
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,170
- You proposed to him?
- Yeah.

282
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,360
No way!

283
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,620
While I was drunk,

284
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,360
I urged him to use the squid ring from my mom's barbecue house

285
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,550
and put it on my finger.

286
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,390
- Squid ring! That's awesome!
- And then,

287
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,220
all of the guests in the barbecue house witnessed our proposal.

288
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,430
- Isn't it romantic?
- It is.

289
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,990
- Isn't it awesome?
- Yeah!

290
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,630
Too bad I wasn't there.

291
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,810
You were the only one missing.

292
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,690
I'm so happy for you.

293
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,220
What about you? Are you dating someone?

294
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,620
Why are you sighing?

295
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,690
I'm not sighing. I mean,

296
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,080
Qin Hebo and I are dating, too.

297
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,200
- That's what I guessed.
- How did you guess?

298
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,410
How could I not guess right?

299
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,480
You've been spending day and night together, and he's always on your mind.

300
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,510
It would happen sooner or later. I think this is great.

301
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,610
Do you think that I'm...

302
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,620
Shuangshuang, you have my blessings. I'm happy for you.

303
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,560
I mean it. And it's up to you to decide who you like or love.

304
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
It has nothing to do with anyone else. I hope you can be happy.

305
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,730
Thank you, Qianqian.

306
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,160
That's great.

307
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,550
- It looks stunning!
- You need a squid ring, too.

308
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,660
Tell my mom when you need it.

309
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,120
- Come to our barbecue house!
- Okay!

310
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,090
- Mengmeng.
- Brother, you're here.

311
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,490
Take a seat. I'll be right there.

312
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,150
Okay.

313
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,590
Brother, try this.

314
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,340
Is it delicious?

315
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,160
It tastes great.

316
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,720
Brother, I've been thinking a lot recently.

317
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,720
I was too immature before. I'm sorry.

318
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,490
Mengmeng.

319
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,890
This Sunday, Xia Qian and I will have a simple engagement party.

320
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,340
I don't think I should go.

321
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,980
I don't want to make it awkward for everyone.

322
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,990
Okay.

323
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,110
Qianqian, I'm sorry that I can't attend your engagement party

324
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,060
because of work.

325
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,550
I'm truly happy to see you starting a new life with the one you love.

326
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,920
May happiness and peace be with you, and I hope all your wishes can come true.

327
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,430
Your friend forever, Shuangshuang.

328
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,630
I'm back.

329
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,100
Wash your hands. I'll get the soup.

330
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,490
The soup is here.

331
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,060
Okay, time for dinner.

332
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,290
I saw the gift you prepared.

333
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,090
That's the engagement gift for Qianqian and Sheng Zhening.

334
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,770
Their engagement party will be held at Evergreen Hotel on Sunday evening.

335
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,160
I'll drive you there.

336
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,660
I have to live stream that evening. I don't think I'm going.

337
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,660
You can reschedule it for the afternoon. It's fine.

338
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,300
It's okay. Qianqian won't mind.

339
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,500
As long as my wishes are there.

340
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,120
I know it's all because of me, right?

341
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm sorry.

342
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,400
I know that Xia Qian is a very important friend to you.

343
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,300
Now I've put you in a difficult spot.

344
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,060
No, it's okay.

345
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,340
Give me some more time.

346
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,590
I'll solve all the problems between Zhening and me. Okay?

347
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,460
Thank you for saying this to me.

348
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,820
I'll always be there for you.

349
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,900
Let's have dinner.

350
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,890
- What are you doing?
- What's in the boxes?

351
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,290
Don't touch it yet. Didn't I ask you two to come together?

352
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,990
Why are you here alone? Where is he?

353
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,070
He's in a meeting. He'll be here soon.

354
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,030
Tell me. What's happening?

355
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,690
What is it? Two mysterious boxes.

356
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,060
These are the gifts I've prepared for you and Xiao Sheng.

357
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,800
They are very valuable.

358
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,290
Guess how much they are.

359
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,130
They look festive.

360
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,230
Let me give you a hint.

361
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,860
2,000?

362
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,130
You think your mom's that stingy? Make a better guess.

363
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,430
You spent 20,000?

364
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,560
Guess again.

365
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,600
200,000?

366
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,300
Are you crazy? 200,000?

367
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,460
Mom, why did you spend 200,000 yuan on these?

368
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,300
Did you get ripped off, Mom?

369
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,430
Of course, I didn't get ripped off. They're worth that much.

370
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,700
Why did you spend so much money?

371
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,630
And where did you get so much money?

372
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,800
I... I've saved some money.

373
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,470
And I borrowed the rest from Uncle Hu.

374
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,000
But he said that there's no rush to pay him back.

375
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,700
You really don't have to do this.

376
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,000
As long as we have your wishes. Zhening would understand.

377
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,540
You don't have to buy such expensive gifts.

378
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,030
I know that he doesn't care about this sort of stuff.

379
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,020
But I can see

380
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,240
how well he's been treating you.

381
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,470
Our family isn't rich.

382
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:19,900
But as your parent, shouldn't I prepare a decent gift for him?

383
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,090
Thank you, Mom.

384
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,790
Xia Qian, you know, Mom was hoping every day

385
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,050
that you could get married soon.

386
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,660
But now you're getting married for real,

387
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,530
I feel reluctant to let you go.

388
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,790
- Why are you laughing?
- I mean,

389
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,650
I haven't seen you like this for many years, Mom.

390
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,820
There, there.

391
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,770
Stop crying. How about this?

392
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,320
Mom, I can't just watch you cry. I'll take off the ring. I won't get married.

393
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,520
Stop messing around. How's that possible?

394
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,960
Aunt.

395
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,860
- Xiao Sheng!
- Were you looking for me?

396
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,120
You're here. Take a seat.

397
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:26,730
You are about to be engaged to Xia Qian. I have prepared a present to give you both.

398
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:32,450
See if you like it. This is a pair of Dragon Phoenix necklaces.
(TN: from an idiom that means the dragon and phoenix are symbols of good fortune)

399
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:37,710
I hope in the future the two of you will live peacefully, beautifully, and in prosperity.

400
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,070
See if you like it.

401
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,180
How is it?

402
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,540
I like it. This is very unique.

403
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,210
- You should open it too.
- I won't

404
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,920
- Quickly!
- I'll see, I'll see.

405
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,550
Yours is a Phoenix.

406
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,380
On your engagement day, both of you wear these.

407
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,500
No, No, No, not wearing these. These do not fit our engagement outfits.

408
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,690
What's wrong with wearing these? If not, you can still wear them inside!

409
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,780
It's okay. I'll wear it, it looks nice. It's good.

410
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,010
Look at him, wear it!

411
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,170
I'll wear it.

412
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,190
Okay, on your engagement day, wear it around your neck.

413
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,390
I'll wear it inside.

414
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,550
- Dragon Phoenix brings good luck.
- I know.

415
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,070
Not practical.

416
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,880
Are you sick?

417
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,930
Come, let me take it off. Don't wear it, it's old-fashioned.

418
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,030
Aunt's token of regard, I need to wear it.

419
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,250
Okay, stuff it inside.

420
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,810
On top of my shirt. Do you have time tomorrow?

421
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,550
Tomorrow? Yes, I have time.

422
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,330
Okay. I'll take you somewhere.

423
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,750
Let's go.

424
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,520
Here.

425
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,100
[Father: Sheng Shaoxuan
Mother: Ning Shuying]

426
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,150
Dad. Mom. I've come here to see you.

427
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,950
Telling you both, I'm engaged. This is my fiancé, her name is Xia Qian.

428
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:57,890
Hi, Uncle and Auntie. Please rest assured, I'll take good care of Zhening.

429
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,500
There are some things that I've been hiding in my heart.

430
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,220
Before joining Evergreen Hotel,

431
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,600
I've always had a dream, I wanted to be a violinist.

432
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,790
Violinist?

433
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,950
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

434
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,340
[Ning Meng: Dad, I'm stuck in traffic and will be there later. You and Brother can eat first.]

435
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:27,920
Dad! Dad! Brother wanted to give you a surprise and perform especially for you. Dad!

436
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,780
You come down!

437
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,800
Why didn't you attend this afternoon's board meeting?

438
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,540
I didn't agree that I would go at all.

439
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,110
You knew the purpose of me organizing the meeting.

440
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,650
To introduce the shareholders to you. But look at you!

441
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,130
You didn't say anything, didn't even come. Do you know that

442
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:16,520
it would result in the partners losing trust in you. This is a big corporate taboo, do you know?

443
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,370
What do you want to say? You can tell me.

444
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,510
I absolutely don't care about corporate rules

445
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,260
and what management tips are. I asked you to meet me here today,

446
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,170
was to tell you I had my own ideas, my own dreams.

447
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,700
I absolutely do not want to enter Evergreen's board. These years,

448
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,100
it's always been your arrangements, your ideas. Did you even ask for my opinions?

449
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,380
Since I was young, I've listened to you. Now I want to play the violin.

450
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,670
This one time, I need you to acknowledge me. Is it so hard?

451
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,050
Brother don't say too much.

452
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,830
Dad, you just let brother do what he likes.

453
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,700
Are you done talking?

454
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,000
There will be a business forum the day after tomorrow. You have to attend.

455
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,650
I'll ask Xiao Qin to send you the time and location.

456
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,570
I have a competition. I can't attend.

457
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,990
Young man.

458
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:35,170
I trained you for so many years, not for you to play the violin here.

459
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,210
If you keep doing this, I'll cut ties with you.

460
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,270
My father had an accident on his way home.

461
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,810
If I had known that it was the last time to see him,

462
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,910
I wouldn't have argued with him. Instead, I would have had a good chat with him.

463
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,230
Later, I took over Evergreen. Every day,

464
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:17,870
I had to put on a face of fake confidence in front of all the shareholders.

465
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,750
Only when when it was late at night,

466
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,650
I knew how much I doubted myself.

467
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,030
Only then did I realize that judging from my father's perspective,

468
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:35,860
having me join Evergreen was the best acknowledgment I could get.

469
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,230
After I took over Evergreen, I realized

470
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:45,410
how hard it was to manage such a big company without anyone you can trust by your side.

471
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,400
This understanding came too late.

472
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,680
My father can't ever hear it again.

473
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,050
I'm sure your father will understand.

474
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,900
And I'm sure he doesn't want you to feel sad about it now.

475
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,260
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

476
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,670
Sunflowers?

477
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,810
When I was working as the assistant to Old GM Sheng,

478
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,470
I'd put sunflowers in his office every day, as he requested.

479
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,530
Back then, he always said that there are too many things to worry about during one's life,

480
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,540
and that we have to find something to remind ourselves

481
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,510
that we should try to be happy every day.

482
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,260
After all these years, you still remember my father's likes and preferences.

483
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,850
As I should.

484
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,640
By the way,

485
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,850
I heard that you're getting engaged.

486
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,030

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,970
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

488
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,280
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

489
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,700
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

490
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,830
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

491
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,130
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

492
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,370
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

493
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,850
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

494
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,620
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

495
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,560
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

496
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,310
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

497
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,230
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

498
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,420
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

499
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,130
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

500
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,510
♫ I am here anyway ♫

501
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,320
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

502
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,490
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

503
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,120
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

504
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,130
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

505
00:44:54,130 --> 00:45:01,230
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

506
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,230
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

507
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,450
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

508
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,970
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

509
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:29,090
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

510
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,350
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

511
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,680
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

512
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,110
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

513
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,960
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

514
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,990
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple

515
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,580
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

516
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,510
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫
