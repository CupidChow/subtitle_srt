[Episode 2]

3
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,030
- Excuse me, I have to answer a call.
- Sure.

4
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,470
Hello, Hubby.

5
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,850
You're here?

6
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,910
I'm upstairs.

7
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,330
Okay. I'll be there right away.

8
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,120
Hubby, I'm here!

9
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,690
Starting today,

10
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,680
wherever you go,

11
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
I will go there, too!

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,830
Listen carefully,

13
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,170
I'm not the type to pester,

14
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,540
and I will not persuade you to stay. But if you take one more step today,

15
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,570
one step, I will dump you.

16
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,550
Even if you come back to me begging, I will not take you back.

17
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,440
He Zhijuan!

18
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,780
[Xia Qian, I'm sorry! I cannot get engaged to you.

19
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,690
Miss Xia, my fiancé is here to pick me up.

20
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,040
Let me introduce you guys, He Zhijuan.

21
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,680
Sorry for arriving late.

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,100
Hello, I am He Zhijuan.

23
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,840
What's wrong, Miss Xia?

24
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
I don't know. It's just...

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,400
just that my eyes are allergic.

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,640
Sorry, Miss Ning Meng, I have to go.

27
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,790
Qianqian.

28
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,790
Qianqian.

29
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,890
- I'm so sorry
- I'm sorry.

30
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,730
- Qianqian.
- You arrived?

31
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,300
Qianqian.

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,030
Sit down.

33
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,760
Are you okay?

34
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,260
That's enough.

35
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,170
Are you okay?

36
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,080
I feel much better.

37
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,470
- Slow down, slow down.
- Shuangshuang,

38
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,880
I still don't understand.

39
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Help me come up with a reason.

40
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,690
What do you think is wrong with He Zhijuan?

41
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,740
- Exactly.
- Do you think he was diagnosed with a terminal illness?

42
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,410
He must have his own reasons.

43
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,880
Something bad happened?

44
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,700
Something bad really did happen.

45
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,420
No, no, no.

46
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,210
I think it must be like how we discussed.

47
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,770
At the time,

48
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,840
I didn't give him the opportunity and time to explain.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,280
He must have left in anger.

50
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,760
If he wanted to explain, he would have already explained. Right?

51
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,860
No? Never mind.

52
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,360
Forget him. A man like him doesn't deserve your love.

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
He's worth it.

54
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,800
Let me tell you the truth, He Zhijuan is not that type of person.

55
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,230
I swear, He Zhijuan is not that type of person.

56
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,840
I know him really well.

57
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,210
Did you know at the time he looked back at me?

58
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,750
He looked at me. He wanted to say something.

59
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,420
But I didn't give him time, so he left.

60
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,500
He will come back.

61
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,910
But Shuangshuang,

62
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,130
at the time...

63
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,750
at the time...

64
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,720
why did I say those words?

65
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,560
I told him, if

66
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,740
he comes back,

67
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,820
I will dump him.

68
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,700
- Don't take him back. We don't want him.
- I want him.

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,910
Yes, don't take him back.

70
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,360
- I want him, I want him, I want him.
- Don't think about him.

71
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,940
What are you doing?

72
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,770
You aren't thinking I am going to get drunk because of He Zhijuan, right?

73
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,340
I... just really never expected that

74
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,490
we would meet again like that.

75
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,930
What will you do next?

76
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,930
That's such a coincidence.

77
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,960
Do you think Ning Meng planned it on purpose?

78
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,730
I don't think so.

79
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,510
It felt like Ning Meng didn't know.

80
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,690
How did He Zhijuan react when he saw you? You can't say that he didn't know.

81
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,480
Lihe Capital has obtained 3% of Director Lin's shares.

82
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,860
Thank you for your work, Director Qin.

83
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,020
Oh, wait. I should call you Vice GM Qin now.

84
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,830
Six years ago, I brought you to Evergreen.

85
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,490
I knew already at the time, with your ability,

86
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,190
you would be able to earn that position.

87
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,830
It would not have been possible without the help of Director Xue.

88
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,850
Whether or not Lihe Capital will be able to acquire Evergreen,

89
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,820
all depends on Vice GM Qin.

90
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,640
Please excuse me. I need to take this call.

91
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,840
Hello, Mengmeng.

92
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,460
What's wrong? Is your brother mad at you again?

93
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,940
Come to my office, I will be there shortly.

94
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,210
See you in a bit.

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm sorry, Director Xue, Sheng Zhening's sister is looking for me. I will head back first.

96
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,880
I did not realize that you get along quite well with both the brother and sister of the Sheng family.

97
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,990
Hebo,

98
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,580
it wasn't easy for you to get to this position, don't let your emotions lead you astray.

99
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,400
Don't worry, I know what to do.

100
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,140
[Alipay]

101
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,610
What does this mean? Why did you transfer money to me?

102
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,020
We'll pool our money together to refund Ning Meng. Let's not take this case.

103
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,680
Shuangshuang, let me tell you. That's really not necessary. I have money.

104
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
Don't tell me you have money.

105
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,760
I already heard you sold your car.

106
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,380
Yes, money needs to be made. But you shouldn't make it so hard on yourself.

107
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,600
Besides, no matter what happens, I can support you financially.

108
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,020
Why are you smiling? I'm being serious.

109
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,360
Thank you.

110
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,900
There is no need to say that between us. Please don't burden yourself.

111
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,990
I am not burdened, I just really want to take this case.

112
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,820
And it's not because of money.

113
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,690
It's because, after He Zhijuan ran away from the engagement, I wanted to change.

114
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,130
Under those tough circumstances, I forced myself to start my own company.

115
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,720
We've worked really hard these past few years. We took all cases,

116
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,580
to make "Worth or Not" to where it is today.

117
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,290
This is our dream. Why should we let go of the case because of He Zhijuan?

118
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,840
Besides, he isn't important to me anymore.

119
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,990
Not important? Is that really how you feel?

120
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,890
I am the person who understands the most about how much you suffered when He Zhijuan left you.

121
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,170
You became a different person. Just to not think about him, you threw yourself into work. You worked like crazy.

122
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,970
I don't want you to be like that again. Now that He Zhijuan is back,

123
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,690
I am afraid you will become that person again.

124
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,020
Shuangshuang, because He Zhijuan is back,

125
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,280
I've seen him and now I understand.

126
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,600
It's been two years. He has his own life, I have my own.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,220
We are not important to each other anymore.

128
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,670
It's true,

129
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,760
helping my ex-boyfriend schedule his wedding is ridiculous.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,170
But what can I do? This ridiculous situation happened and I need to fix it.

131
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,460
If I break the contract and not take this case,

132
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,900
it would mean that I have not forgotten him.

133
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,830
So, we must take it. We must finish it beautifully.

134
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,930
Come on, let's drink.

135
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,690
Let's work hard.

136
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,140
What brings you here today?

137
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,390
I miss Brother Hebo, of course.

138
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,000
Miss me?

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,090
I thought you are busy dating and don't have time to miss me.

140
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,990
Just tell me. What is it?

141
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,530
Looks like I can't hide anything from you, Brother Hebo.

142
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,880
Brother Hebo, I'm getting married. At the Evergreen Hotel.

143
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,750
I thought your brother didn't want you to get married so early.

144
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,120
You've talked him into it already?

145
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,310
Of course not! You know my brother.

146
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,140
I've hired a bargainer in secret to secure a spot for me.

147
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,010
I'm signing the contract tomorrow.

148
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,740
- So you're the one who hired the bargainer?
- Yes.

149
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,860
Your brother will be pissed off if he knows about it!

150
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,390
I know! So I'm counting on you, Brother Hebo, to say something nice for me.

151
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,780
Please, Brother Hebo.

152
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,670
Okay, okay. I got it.

153
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,050
You're the best, Brother Hebo!

154
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,350
Come, have a seat.

155
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,550
You should talk to your brother more often.

156
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,020
He's not unreasonable. He cares too much about you, and he is afraid that you will be hurt.

157
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,920
I know. I'll find a time to have a good chat with him.

158
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,430
- Oh, I almost forgot.
- What?

159
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,970
Congratulations on your promotion, Brother Hebo!

160
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,160
You’ve been blowing your money again?

161
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
Not at all! I know Brother Hebo doesn't like it when I spend frivolously.

162
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
I've made them by myself. Do they look nice?

163
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,500
- Really? Did you really make them by yourself?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,680
Do you like them, Brother Hebo?

165
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,700
Yes.

166
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm glad you like them!

167
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,450
I'll be heading home. Zhijuan is waiting for me at home.

168
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,350
See you. Brother Hebo, bye!

169
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,300
- Take care.
- Will do.

170
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,790
Assistant An, I've arrived at Evergreen.

171
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,390
The representative of Xinyuan Technology has not arrived yet. Maybe you can wait for him in the meeting room.

172
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,330
Is that the case?

173
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay, I got it.

174
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,570
Xia Qian.

175
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,640
What's up?

176
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Can we talk?

177
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,580
He Zhijuan.

178
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,240
I've got other stuff to deal with.

179
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,380
Just say what you want.

180
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,180
I hope that you can terminate Mengmeng's contract with you.

181
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,690
About this...

182
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,760
you should talk to your fiancée, not me.

183
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,110
She doesn't know about it. And I don't want her to know.

184
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,960
I wasn't planning on telling her about it.

185
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,340
So you ran away from our engagement ceremony

186
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,030
because of Ning Meng?

187
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,610
It had nothing to do with her. I just realized on the engagement day that I didn't love you anymore.

188
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,290
I couldn't force myself to be with you.

189
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,960
You realized that you didn't love me on the engagement day?

190
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
You realized it pretty early.

191
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,660
Xia Qian, can you not be sarcastic?

192
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,880
There's no such rule that I can only love one person in my life.

193
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,880
I've known you for such a long time,

194
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,070
and this is the first time I've realized that you've taken things so easy.

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,690
I know you need money these days. There's ¥100,000 on this card.

196
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,890
I want you to give up your job.

197
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,240
Mengmeng doesn't know anything about us yet.

198
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
We haven't met in two years, but I don't think that's a long time.

199
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,380
You forgot who I am?

200
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,330
It's true that I'm poor and I need money.

201
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,440
But I'm not that pathetic to take money from you!

202
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,460
I repeat. Rest assured,

203
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,190
I won't tell Ning Meng what happened between us.

204
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,130
If it were possible, I wish I never had anything to do with you.

205
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,220
Just take your hush money back. I don't need it.

206
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,460
Anything else?

207
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,980
If you can terminate this contract,

208
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,200
I'll satisfy whatever requests you make.

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,650
Think of it as my compensation for hurting you emotionally.

210
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,010
Compensation for hurting me? How?

211
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,180
Who do you think you are?

212
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,330
And I’m over what happened between us a long time ago.

213
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,250
Anything else?

214
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,180
Xia Qian.

215
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,580
[Xia Qian]

216
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,860
Brother, this is my boyfriend Zhijuan.

217
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,510
Nice to meet you, I'm He Zhijuan.

218
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,550
Thank you.

219
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,520
Did you hear what we were talking about?

220
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm feeling sad now,

221
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,270
not because I'm still in love with him.

222
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,750
It's because it's hard for me to accept the truth of why he left me.

223
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,140
Do you know how overboard he went?

224
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,490
Two years ago, he ran away

225
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,620
from our engagement ceremony.

226
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,480
Why would he run away?

227
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,240
I've been thinking about it for two years.

228
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,880
I was even wondering if he had some kind of terminal disease

229
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,210
and couldn't be cured, and he left me because he was afraid I'd be sad.

230
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,800
But in the end, this is what the truth is.

231
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,840
He just didn't like me anymore.

232
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,190
But it's okay.

233
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,030
I don't care about it anymore now.

234
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm so sorry.

235
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,580
I've said so much nonsense to you.

236
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,480
Sorry for wasting your time.

237
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,530
I've been using this handkerchief. I'll wash it and give it back to you tomorrow.

238
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Excuse me.

239
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,110
Miss Xia, the agent is waiting in the meeting room. Where are you?

240
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,660
Oh. Just a moment, I'll be right there.

241
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Okay. See you soon.

242
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,360
I've got something urgent to deal with. I'll be on my way.

243
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
Thank you. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

244
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,950
- Hello?
 - Hello, Brother.

245
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,780
Are you free tonight?

246
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,580
I want to invite you over for dinner and... have a chat with you.

247
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,890
I need to talk to you, too.

248
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,180
That's great. I'll see you tonight!

249
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,460
Brother! You've brought so much delicious food for me!

250
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,090
I'll make dinner first, and then we can eat and talk together.

251
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,630
That's delicious! These are all my favorites!

252
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,810
Have a seat.

253
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,280
I need to talk to you about something.

254
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,970
Zhijuan! Come on in!

255
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,070
My brother made a lot of delicious food for us!

256
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,010
Brother.

257
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,860
Brother Zhening.

258
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,780
There's one more dish. You guys can sit first.

259
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,150
My brother is slow to warm up. It'll get better.

260
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,640
- Okay.
- Have a seat.

261
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,140
Brother, I've mentioned to you before

262
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,710
that Zhijuan is super good.

263
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,270
He's the best and the youngest psychiatrist in his clinic.

264
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,960
And he's very gentle and considerate.

265
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,950
Everyone is envious of me.

266
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,370
They said I've found the perfect man for myself the first attempt at love.

267
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,900
Mengmeng, you're overstating it.

268
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,320
I should have let you meet with my brother earlier.

269
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,450
He'd know how great you are.

270
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,900
I'm full, enjoy the meal you two.

271
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,030
The fish my brother made is really delicious. Have some more.

272
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,400
Eat more.

273
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,340
- You don't have to see me out.
- I do!

274
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,300
Zhijuan, my brother is not like that usually.

275
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,880
Please don't be mad.

276
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,420
It's okay. If I had a sister as lovely as you,

277
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,490
I'd be unhappy if she brings her boyfriend home.

278
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,400
I'll go downstairs with you.

279
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,140
It's okay.

280
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,280
- I'll be leaving now.
- Take care!

281
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,770
Brother, why are you putting on a long face?

282
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,930
What's wrong with Zhijuan?

283
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,790
Are you the one who hired Xia Qian

284
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,070
to get the wedding reservation?

285
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,740
You know that I don't want you to get married so early.

286
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,940
So you're thinking to act first and ask later?

287
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,890
I just want to get married to him right away!

288
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,590
How long have you guys been dating? Do you really know him?

289
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,250
How would I not?

290
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,450
When I saw him, at first sight,

291
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,070
I decided that he's the one I'd like to marry in my life.

292
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,640
It's an instinct. You don't get it.

293
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,110
I think you're infatuated.

294
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,060
I just love him. I just want to marry him.

295
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,900
Even if I'm infatuated, I'd still be willing to do that.

296
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,720
GM Sheng, you might be overreacting.

297
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,340
I think Mr. He loves Miss Ning Meng a lot.

298
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,050
How long does love last?

299
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,780
To see if a man

300
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,540
can hold onto his marriage,

301
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,660
we have to see if he's responsible.

302
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,290
If He Zhijuan can run away

303
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,120
from his engagement ceremony because of love,

304
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,140
then couldn't he leave Mengmeng for someone else?

305
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,570
How can I rest assured if Mengmeng is married to

306
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,570
a man like him with no sense of responsibility?

307
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,900
Makes sense.

308
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,030
Then, what do we do about Miss Xia?

309
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,770
She's bargained down all the orders we need.

310
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,390
And I've made an appointment with her to sign the reservation contract for Banquet Hall 8 tomorrow.

311
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,640
We can't sign the contract?

312
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,970
Tell me why.

313
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,880
I have my own reasons and I don't have to explain them to you.

314
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,430
By the way, here's all your reward

315
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,650
for bargaining for Evergreen.

316
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,310
I don't want money. I want the reservation for the wedding in May.

317
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,370
Then there's nothing for us to discuss.

318
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,050
You've gone back on your words, do you know?

319
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,260
I've got other work to do. If you don't have anything else, I may ask you to leave.

320
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll ask Anan to transfer the money to your bank account!

321
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,420
GM Sheng.

322
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,650
I saw Miss Xia waiting for someone in the garden.

323
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,360
I've been using it.

324
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,920
I'll wash it and give it back to you tomorrow.

325
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,660
It's such a hot day. I hope she doesn't get heatstroke.

326
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,680
- Is it hot today?
- Yeah.

327
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,710
38 degrees celsius.

328
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,210
I found a tiny hole in the handkerchief

329
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,870
and decided to embroider a blue Morning Glory flower for you.

330
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,380
I hope you don't mind.

331
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,930
It's growing well. See, I was right.

332
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,640
It's because I have an uncle who's also a gardener.

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,980
I learned a bit from him before.

334
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,460
I don't know how to take care of other flowers, but I really like blue Morning Glories.

335
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,850
That's why I know more about it.

336
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,650
Your hand!

337
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,710
Wipe it.

338
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,590
The juice of blue Morning Glory is poisonous. You have a wound on your hand.

339
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,540
Wipe it here or you might suffer from a skin allergy.

340
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,930
Why are you not talking at all?

341
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,240
Take this pack of tissues with you. You can use it later.

342
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,890
I won't be bothering you. Take care.

343
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
Hello, Anan.

344
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,020
Come to my office.

345
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,230
Sheng Zhening has no spirit of contract at all!

346
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,870
It's not only the spirit of the contract,

347
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,320
he commits treachery and goes back on his word!

348
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,890
Sister Qian did so much research just for this order,

349
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,500
and he just said no like that!

350
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,980
What do we do?

351
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,110
[Anan]

352
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,600
- What now?
- Hello, Miss Xia.

353
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,900
GM Sheng thought about your situation.

354
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,990
We have a plan for you.

355
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,110
If you give up on the wedding reservation,

356
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,940
as an exchange,

357
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,740
we'll give you another big bargaining order.

358
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,090
Our company is planning on bulk-buying cars.

359
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,860
- Maybe you can...
- I can't. Not interested.

360
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,920
Miss Xia.

361
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,650
Hello?

362
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,790
Hello?

363
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,270
She hung up.

364
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,820
What a weird man!

365
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,320
Wait... What did he say?

366
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,590
I can't believe he said

367
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,310
that as an exchange, they would give me a car bulk-buying order.

368
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,800
- Buying cars?
- Yeah.

369
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,550
We've never had a car bargaining order before.

370
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,490
If we make it this time,

371
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,970
we'll have... we'll have nothing to worry about in the future!

372
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,540
Do you only care about money?

373
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,110
Don't be such a loser! We can't take "food handed out in contempt."
(T/N: Chinese idiom for 'not to be pitied')

374
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,810
Don't you understand?

375
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,380
We can't take it.

376
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,930
Then, what do we do?

377
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,010
Do we still want the wedding reservation?

378
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,170
Yes. We have to get it.

379
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,860
Sheng Zhening promised to make the reservation for me.

380
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,710
Since he went back on his word and won't give it to me, I'll have to get it by myself.

381
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,880
- How?
- Don't know.

382
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,300
You basically said nothing.

383
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,990
If...

384
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,830
If we can get the hotel reservation list for May,

385
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,270
does that mean we can potentially find someone who will change their wedding date?

386
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,250
But the key is that we need to get the list first.

387
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,940
We're not spies.

388
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,080
I've got a plan.

389
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,540
This is your first day at work. Your probation is three months.

390
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,220
If you want to stay at Evergreen,

391
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,190
you have to stay alert.

392
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,580
- Is that clear?
- Yes!

393
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,750
Good. Get to your work.

394
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,580
[Sheng Zhening]

395
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,650
[Xia Qian]

396
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,430
Miss Xia, now that you've signed the contract,

397
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,730
I assume you've agreed to give up on the wedding reservation?

398
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,520
It's over and we're partners now.

399
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,590
Yeah, sure. All the best to our collaboration.

400
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Is there...

401
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,540
Do you have any concerns?

402
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,970
No.

403
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,520
We've signed the contract.

404
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,120
I'll do my best to do whatever I've promised you, GM Sheng.

405
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,470
Anything else? I'll be on my way if there's nothing else.

406
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,830
Just a moment. I have a little bit of doubt.

407
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,560
Before, I felt that

408
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,050
you were not so willing to take on the car bargaining order, but why all of a sudden...?

409
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,500
For money's sake. Who doesn't like money?

410
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,930
And people should be flexible.

411
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,520
Evergreen will give you a satisfactory reward for sure.

412
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,600
Thank you, GM Sheng.

413
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,480
This copy is yours.

414
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,280
I have a very busy schedule these days,

415
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,100
and I'm not sure when I'll be available. For the car bargaining,

416
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,900
we might need you to show up anytime—

417
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,840
No problem. 24/7, anytime you need.

418
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,390
Good.

419
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,170
Bye.

420
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,630
It's signed, the car bargaining contract with Sheng Zhening.

421
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,230
So the next step for me is to see

422
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,430
if there's a chance to get the reservation list for May from him.

423
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,940
What about you two? Report to me.

424
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,090
I've been washing dishes for a whole day and have no time to search for information at all. I can't even

425
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,360
stand up straight. I regret doing this.

426
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,930
Maybe we should terminate the plan.

427
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,840
No way! I thought you were proud of yourself when you first came up with the plan.

428
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,590
How can you go back on your word?

429
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,290
Who would expect that being a spy is so tiring?

430
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,830
I've got something.

431
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,790
I heard from my colleague who is in charge of the banquet halls

432
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,390
that the Evergreen wedding reservation materials

433
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,100
will be eventually submitted to two people.

434
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,250
One is the General Manager, Sheng Zhening.

435
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,470
The other is the Vice General Manager, I think it's Qin something Bo.

436
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,710
That's an important piece of info.

437
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,470
I'll be dealing with Sheng Zhening from today on.

438
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,610
You two can deal with the Qin something Bo.

439
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,940
[Sheng Zhening]

440
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,250
Hello?

441
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,590
Miss Xia, come over to Evergreen now.

442
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,950
We need to go on a business trip.

443
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,930
What business trip? It's midnight. Are you out of your mind?

444
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,650
[Sheng Zhening]

445
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,180
GM Sheng.

446
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,810
I'm so sorry.

447
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,650
No, no, no, no, no.

448
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,210
I'm leaving now. Thirty minutes.

449
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,840
No, twenty minutes. I'll be right there.

450
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,270
I'm right here! Oops!

451
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,380
I'm fine! You don't have to help me with it.

452
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,940
I'll be right there!

453
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

454
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,260
Thank you, GM Sheng.

455
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,530
GM Sheng.

456
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,440
I didn't know that you work so hard.

457
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,560
Going on a business trip so late at night

458
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,100
and driving by yourself. Where's Assistant An?

459
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,670
I've arranged for him to deal with some other business.

460
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, if you're tired, I can drive.

461
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,200
It's okay, I can drive by myself.

462
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,270
GM Sheng, where are we going?

463
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,580
Evergreen has a new business hotel.

464
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
The purpose of the trip is to

465
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,300
make arrangements for the soft opening of the hotel,

466
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,310
and finish the car bulk-buying order at the same time.

467
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,680
It'll take some time. You can get some rest if you're tired.

468
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,850
I'm okay. I'm not tired.

469
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,050
Are we here?

470
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,840
Have you arranged the rooms for us?

471
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Yes.

472
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,450
Take her to her room for some rest then.

473
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,750
Miss Xia, shall I take you to your room?

474
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,590
Okay.

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,720
Your luggage.

Thank you, Assistant An.

You're welcome.

478
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,910
By the way, can you tell me which room GM Sheng is staying?

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,540
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

481
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,990
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

482
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:12,090
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

483
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,300
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

484
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,650
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

485
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,240
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

486
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,980
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

487
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,960
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

488
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,540
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

489
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,560
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

490
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,600
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

491
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,150
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

492
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,760
♫ I am here anyway ♫

493
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,650
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

494
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,670
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

495
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,150
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

496
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,300
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

497
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:18,390
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

498
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,490
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

499
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,880
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

500
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,150
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

501
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,340
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

502
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,650
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

503
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,980
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

504
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,410
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

505
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,310
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

506
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:07,270
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

507
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,880
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

508
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,790
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

509
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,920
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

510
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,450
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

511
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,990
♫ I am here anyway ♫

512
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,910
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

513
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,020
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

514
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,570
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

515
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,570
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

516
