Who said boy problems are the only reason to drink? So vulgar!

How come you have the passcode?

You are too bold.

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,890
and we are there at the next slop, right?

165
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,300
That's right.

166
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,130
Thank you, sir! Thank you for taking care of us.

167
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,660
I'm leaving.

168
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,380
The mountain road is slippery. Please be careful.

169
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,660
Okay. Thank you.

170
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,460
- What are you doing?
- Move out of the way.

171
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,630
- What are you doing?
- Get out of the way!

172
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,960
Stay away from me.

173
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,270
Why did you pull me?

174
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,130
Why did you drag me down?

175
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,790
Don't you have any shame, Ms. Xia?

176
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,560
What about me?

177
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,790
How are we going to get out of here?

178
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,960
This sort of situation

179
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,290
requires us to work together.

180
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,850
You.

181
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,030
You carry me, and I will go up first.

182

And then I will pull you out.

183
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,230
How did you come up with this idea?

184
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,690
Why should I carry you?

185
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,090
What else then?

186
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,220
Of course, I'm going up first.

187
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,850
How about this? Rock, paper, scissors.

188

The loser carries the winner.

189

- Okay. Quick.

Let's go.

193
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,190
Where should I carry you?

194
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,000
Over there.

Hurry and climb up.

Okay. You do it.

Get up.

Come up.

Are you done?

Do you have any sincerity?

This is all my sincerity, I am about to fall.

217
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,380
Look at the situation now.

218

I tried my best. I'm sorry.

[Evergreen Hotel Pre-Scheduled Marriage Banquet Transfer Agreement]

Ms. Xia, I am a businessman.

230
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,710
I have a lot of acquaintances coming, I cannot do destination weddings.

231
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,140
Plus, we have already contacted our friends and relatives.

232
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,300
How can I just change my mind and cancel it?

233
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,810
Mr. Han, I did not say we will cancel it.

234
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,520
I am just asking if the date could be moved back a bit.

235
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,370
Didn't you want to have the wedding at the Evergreen hotel?

236
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,890
The Evergreen Hotel hasn't changed its location for decades.

237
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,410
But a luxury cruise is different, it doesn't wait for people.

Have a look at this.

239
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,170
Look at this. A destination wedding is your wife, Miss Yan's dream.

240
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,830
Saying your vows under the stars in the Aegean Sea

241

is not less than saying them in front of your relatives.

There are no buts.

Don't be discouraged.

Let me tell you. This is a breach of contract. I can sue you.

286
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,620
Even if the Evergreen is closed,

287
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,580
I will not let Ning Meng hold the wedding.

288
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,940
Why not?

289
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,370
Why are you going against Ning Meng? She is your biological sister.

290
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,790
Because He Zhijuan is not a good person.

291
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,660
I cannot just sit by and watch my own sister

How is my sister?

296
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,080
Don't worry, your sister is fine. Ning Meng just experienced a shock, she is now sleeping.

297
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,900
Her boyfriend's injuries are worse.

298
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,790
His arm has a bunch of abrasions. But it is not something to worry about.

Why haven't you left?

304
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,530
I was waiting for you. I have something I want to show you.

305
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,760
It was He Zhijuan who saved Ning Meng.

306
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,620
Although he isn't a good person,

307
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,890
but he loves Ning Meng.

308
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,170
Does your arm hurt?

309
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,470
It's fine. It should be better in about two days.

310
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,760
Since it is okay,

311
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,730
then you should find time to prepare for your wedding on the 8th of May.

312
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,980
Brother Zhening, you approve?

313
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,590
Originally I was very against Mengmeng getting married so early.

314
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,510
But after today's experience, I can see that your feelings towards her are sincere.

315
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,180
Mengmeng can sometimes be very stubborn.

316
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,010
Once she is angry, it is hard to coax her.

317
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,570
But she is very sincere and responsible with her feelings.

318
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,100
Once she likes you, she will wholeheartedly love you.

319
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,520
I can see that she truly loves you

320
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,670
and you also love her. So, I genuinely wish you guys happiness.

321
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,160
Thank you, Brother Zhening.

322
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,840
But before I hand Mengmeng to you,

323
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,940
you need to promise me two things.

324
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,010
Say it.

325
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,930
You should be very familiar with Mengmeng's health condition.

326
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,460
No matter what happens in the future,

327
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,290
you have to take care of her feelings. Don't let her get hurt.

328
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,620
Okay.

329
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,630
And the other is Xia Qian.

330
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,720
I know what happened between you and Xia Qian before.

331
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,040
You must not let Mengmeng know of this.

332
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,600
So please stay away from Xia Qian.

333
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,920
I think this is good for you, for Mengmeng

334
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,910
and for Xia Qian.

335
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,080
I understand, Brother Zhening.

336
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,130
I'll definitely be true to my word.

337
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,670
Okay. Rest well

338
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,340
and get better soon.

339
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,920
Brother Zhening.

340
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,120
Thank you.

341
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,430
I'll definitely take care of Mengmeng.

342
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,650
How are you feeling? Do you still have a headache?

343
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,070
Brother, how's Zhijun now?

344
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,550
He's doing just fine.

345
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,610
He's just got some minor scratches.

346
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,880
- I‘ll go visit him.
- No.

347
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,950
You shouldn't be moving around before you recover.

348
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,990
But...

349
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,700
How can you get married if you don't recover from your injury?

350
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,860
Brother, you've consented to me getting married?

351
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,010
As long as you don't regret it,

352
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,390
I don't have anything else to ask for. I just want you to be happy.

353
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,850
Brother.

354
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,480
Lie down.

355
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,220
Hello?

356
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,400
I just visited Mengmeng in the hospital. She was very happy.

357
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,390
She said you've agreed to her wedding.

358
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,130
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

359
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,420
You sound a bit upset.

360
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,350
I do feel a little upset.

361
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,250
How about this?

362
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,970
We can meet up in our old place and have a drink.

363
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,240
Cool. I'll be there.

364
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,680
Your drinks are here! Your usual drinks

365
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,990
I'll go take care of the other guests. This way, please.

366
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,750
What's wrong?

367
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,200
Have you regretted saying yes to her wedding?

368
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,100
It's good news that she's getting married. Why are you so depressed?

369
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,260
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

370
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,200
Are you feeling frustrated? Excited but reluctant to let her go,

371
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,980
happy but sad,

372
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
coming to you at the same time?

373
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,530
You don't feel like your sister's going to get married.

374
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,720
It looks like your daughter's getting married.

375
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,980
You care too much about Mengmeng.

376
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,030
You should know that

377
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,050
she's not the little girl running after you anymore.

378
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,250
You shouldn't treat her like a child anymore.

379
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,080
She's not as fragile as you think.

380
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,140
I know that.

381
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,390
In a blink of an eye, Mengmeng is already 22 years old.

382
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,290
She has now grown up,

383
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,740
and she can now choose the type of life she wants to live.

384
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,260
And she can also be responsible for her choices. You have to trust her.

385
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,360
Plus, with a brother like you, who can hurt her?

386
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,850
That's true as well.

387
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,320
I think that when it comes to romantic relationships,

388
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,650
you should really learn from your sister.

389
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,520
Look at you. You're not young anymore,

390
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,030
shouldn't you think about it for yourself as well?

391
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,040
I thought we were talking about Mengmeng. Why are we talking about me now?

392
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,930
What's more, Brother Hebo, you're still single as well.

393
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,270
Why do I have to rush?

394
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,730
At the worst, we'll just be two single men.

395
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,160
No, no. Don't say that.

396
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,470
Don't drag me into this.

397
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,590
I don't want to be single for the rest of my life.

398
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,660
This is the wedding transfer agreement for Mr. Han and his wife.

399
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,530
Please take a look.

400
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,030
[Sheng Zhening]

401
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,960
- So we're all settled on the May 8th wedding reservation.
- Yeah.

402
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,140
- I'll be on my way.
- Miss Xia,

403
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,760
would you like to continue working on the car purchasing project?

404
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,630
- You want me to keep working on that project?
- As a matter of fact,

405
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,660
you've done most of the work with the car purchasing project.

406
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,940
The Procurement Department kept failing to get the price you wanted.

407
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,670
Manager Sun told me that you've performed very well, and she wanted you to keep working on it.

408
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,730
The compensation will be the same as what we've agreed. What do you think?

409
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,130
All right. I'll take it.

410
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,990
I'll be going now then.

411
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,270
I can't believe our Procurement Department can't even handle a car purchasing order.

412
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,790
And Manager Sun said that she wants Miss Xia to continue?

413
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,500
I see.

414
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,200
You just want to give her the opportunity.

415
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,020
Don't you have anything else to do?

416
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,380
- Manager Sun!
- Miss Xia! Hi.

417
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,900
I'd like to say thank you.

418
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,030
I've accepted the car purchasing project.

419
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,490
Thank you for recommending me to GM Sheng.

420
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,620
Well... GM Sheng asked you to take on the car purchasing project?

421
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,320
That's right.

422
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,400
You're not aware of it, Manager Sun?

423
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,730
Maybe GM Sheng has been too busy to talk to me about it.

424
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,550
I've been learning how to bargain

425
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,410
since the last time I saw you bargain. I've even read two books.

426
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,810
I wasn't expecting that he would still entrust you to it.

427
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,900
But I think that's great,

428
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,250
you're the professional bargainer.

429
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,820
I think he can trust you on this.

430
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,430
I've got to go, Miss Xia.

431
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,060
Okay. See you.

432
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,660
Zhijun, are you sure we shouldn't postpone the wedding?

433
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,050
The wound on your hand has not healed completely yet.

434
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,710
You've always hoped to have a wedding at the Evergreen in May.

435
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,620
I promised you that I would make that come true.

436
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,380
Zhijun, except for my brother, there's no one who loves me

437
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,500
more than you do in this world.

438
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,650
I'm so lucky to have met you.

439
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,480
I want the perfect wedding!

440
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,250
I'll let the whole world know that I'm married to you!

441
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,280
Of course. As you wish.

442
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,670
It's time to go. We're taking the wedding photos this afternoon, remember?

443
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,550
Don't touch it!

444
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,300
From today on, I'll learn how to take care of you.

445
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,990
Let's go.

446
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,480
It's so heavy.

447
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,960
Manager Sun didn't recommend me at all.

448
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,370
Then, why would Sheng Zhening say that?

449
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,480
I think he's finding an excuse.

450
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Think about it. Sheng Zhening is the GM of Evergreen.

451
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,080
He wants to give you the project, but couldn't say it directly because he wants to look good.

452
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,090
That's why he used Manager Sun as an excuse.

453
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,500
Then, why did he insist on giving the car purchasing project to me?

454
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,390
It must be that he's done something wrong,

455
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,600
and he wants to make it up to you because he feels guilty.

00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,600
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

485
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,670
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

486
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,710
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

487
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,350
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

488
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:01,760
♫ I am here anyway ♫

489
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,680
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

490
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,820
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

491
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,500
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

492
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,350
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

493
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:25,770
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
