Come in.

4
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,450
GM Qin, I've prepared the gifts you asked for.

5
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,870
There is also a card, here you go.

6
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,150
- You can go.
- Okay.

7
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,790
Zhening.

8
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,980
Congratulations on getting engaged.

9
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,740
Hebo.

10
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,860
There is no problem.

11
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,270
I have confirmed the products and the plan.

12
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,150
We'll live stream tonight based on this plan.

13
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,930
Okay.

14
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,030
Sister Qian, you are busy with the livestream and the company.

15
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,670
Do you have time to prepare for the wedding?

16
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,030
Isn't it still early?

17
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,540
I don't need to start preparing now.

18
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,820
What still early? My cousin started preparing for her wedding half a year in advance.

19
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Is it that troublesome to have a wedding?

20
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,320
Let me briefly tell you.

21
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,200
For a wedding, you have to choose the date and the style,

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,380
where you will take the wedding photos, who the photographer will be, who makeup artist will be,

23
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,540
and what kind of dress you will wear.

24
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,900
The wedding rings, the wedding veil, the bouquet, and the shoes.

25
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,410
Who are the groomsmen and bridesmaids?

26
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,210
Then what will they wear?

27
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,580
What guests are you going to invite? And how are they going to sit?

28
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,510
Oh right! And also, if you are going on a honeymoon, where would you want to go?

29
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,130
Enough, enough.

30
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,370
Don't say it anymore. Listening to it is giving me a headache now.

31
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,820
A wedding is truly a mental and physical test.

32
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,510
When my cousin got married,

33
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,230
she was totally worn out the week before.

34
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,320
You better think about it.

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,680
You really don't have anything to say?

36
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,340
Nothing.

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,070
Everything has been fine recently.

38
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,800
Your not saying it, is it because in your heart you have already made a choice?

39
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,990
Actually, I never had a choice.

40
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,810
I just haven't found the right solution.

41
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,110
And now?

42
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,270
Now I've thought it through clearly.

43
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,080
I only need to be more courageous.

44
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,160
Say what I want to say from my heart.

45
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,690
Thank you.

46
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,560
I received two presents, given by GM Qin.

47
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,720
If you don't like them, I'll send them back.

48
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,030
[Zhening, Congratulations on getting engaged. Hebo]

49
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,780
Everything we need for the wedding, I've already prepared them.

50
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,510
You just need to make requests

51
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,950
and enjoy our wedding, that's all.

52
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,690
Here we have the forest theme, fairy tale theme, and vintage theme.

53
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,530
These are only drafts, I haven't finished the design.

54
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,720
There are so many drafts, how am I going to choose?

55
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,230
This is so much more compared to your usual work reports.

56
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,100
You're my client now.

57
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,060
I work for you.

58
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,240
You can make any requests you like. I will try my best to accommodate.

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,900
I'll think if I have any requests, and let you know after.

60
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,230
- Do you have time this afternoon?
- Yes.

61
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,860
I'll take you to choose the wedding dress?

62
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,080
What's this for?

63
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,310
I read on the internet

64
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,930
that many brides hesitate when choosing the wedding dress.

65
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,780
To solve this problem,

66
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,040
when you try on each wedding dress,

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,400
I will take a photo of you,

68
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,090
and rate the dress objectively, for your reference.

69
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,050
Okay.

70
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,950
Miss Xia, the dresses are here. Would you like to try them on?

71
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,360
- All right.
- This way, please.

72
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
Wait for me here.

73
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,870
Let's go.

74
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,770

75
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,330
I'm ready.

76
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,640
It's done!

77
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,320
GM Sheng.

78
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,010
I think this one looks great.

79
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,420
It's elegant and cute at the same time.

80
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,600
It fits Miss Xia's flair really well.

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,810
What do you know about elegance?

82
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,880
So the previous one wasn't elegant and cute?

83
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
That's not what I mean.

84
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,390
I mean, both of them are special and beautiful.

85
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,080
You should be the one making the decision.

86
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,230
If you can't decide, you can buy both.

87
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,020
How about this one?

88
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,620
I think there's a problem with it.

89
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,800
What is it?

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,660
Well, the bow tie, has a tiny problem.

91
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,200
Let me help you adjust it.

92
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,680
Okay.

93
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,230
Let me see.

94
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,960
I remember you said before

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,280
if I, your client, have any problems, you can solve them.

96
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,620
Yeah.

97
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,040

This is us?

This is the invitation cover I drew.

109

You're holding 1and 0 and I'm holding 8 and 9.

110

Do you like it?

111
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,700
Not bad.

112

Also, look.

113
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Where's your ring?

114
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I took it off while I was working.

115
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,900
It's here.

116
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, you are my fiancee.

117
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
If the ring breaks, we can buy a new one.

118
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,000
But once you have it on, you can't take it off. Got it?

119
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,790
I understand. I won't do it again.

120

Oh, right!

121

When I was preparing the wedding candies today, I also bought this.

122

What is it?

123
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't you always get low blood sugar?

124
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,400
With this, it'll be more convenient.

125
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
You even put candies in it?

126
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,800
Give it to me.

127
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,800
Hang it on your purse.

128
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,000
This will be more convenient.

129

I'm so happy now.

130
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,200
Isn't it good to be happy?

131
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,200
If I'm too happy, I won't feel safe. What if I lose you in the future?

132
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,000
You won't lose me. Never.

a super special gift.

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,900
Did you wear the jade pendants?

167
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,400
Yes, they are underneath.

168
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They are so valuable and we're afraid to lose them.

169
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
- Let's sit down.
- Come.

170
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
- Come over.
- Uncle and Auntie, let's sit.

171
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,000
- Old Hu, let's sit here.
- Sure.

172
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
- Mengmeng is here. Anan.
- Hurry and sit.

173
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Miss Ning Meng, let's eat together.

174
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
There's no need.

175
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,800
I have a gift for everyone.

176
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,250
There is an issue that has been hidden in my heart for many years.

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,700
That year when we finished our national college entrance exam, Xia Qian and I went to release a sky lantern.

178
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
The sky lantern caught fire

179
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,700
and indirectly caused Ning Meng and her father's car accident.

180
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
I've never told anyone,

181
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
including Xia Qian.

182
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,600
I always thought that

183
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,400
all the guilt and anxiety would fade away with time.

184
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
But it's always like a knife hanging on top of my head,

185
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,670
and I don't know when it'll come down

186
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
and hurt someone I love.

187
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,600
It was you!

188
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
You and Xia Qian killed my father!

189
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
- Mengmeng, let's talk—
- Don't touch me!

190
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
You're still trying to protect her, right?

191
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I've uncovered your years-long secret

192
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,000
and hurt someone you love, right?

193
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,600
He Zhijuan, say something. Say something!

194
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,200
She's that important to you? Then, what am I?

195
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,000
What's our marriage to you?

196
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,400
You guys just wanted to compensate me, right?

197
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,870
Mengmeng, enough!

198
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Nothing is one-sided.

199
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll investigate this.

200
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,630
These are all the documents pertaining to Old GM Sheng's accident.

201
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,600
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

202
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,200
What else can you say?!

203
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,800
My father's car accident was caused by you two!

204
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Why?

205
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Let me go!

206
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Why did you two keep hiding it from us?

207
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
[He Zhijuan and Xia Qian]

208
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
[We will both make it to our dream school.]

209
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,830
This sky lantern...

210
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
was released by me indeed.

211
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Why didn't you two say so before?

212
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
Why?

213
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,400
You two kept hiding it from us for so many years. Why?

214
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,800
Why? Don't you have any conscience?

215
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,420
Are you guys acting before me?

216
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,200
Auntie.

217
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Does the sky lantern really have something to do with Sister Qian?

218
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,220
I-I remember that after Xia Qian finished the college entrance exam,

219
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,910
she did mention releasing a sky lantern with He Zhijuan.

220
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,040
Xia Qian.

221
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,780
Are you all right?

222
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,290
I'm fine.

223
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,660
Uncle Hu, please take my mom and...

224
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,690
Xiaoyan, you...

225
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,780
you guys can go home first.

226
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,530
Thank you for coming here today.

227
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,410
Please take my mom home.

228
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,770
Then... I'm leaving.

229
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,200
Hurry and go back. Be safe on your way.

230
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,930
Uncle Hu.

231
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,350
Come home and stay with me.

232
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,990
Mom.

233
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,460
I'm sorry.

234
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,350
I want to have some quiet time.

235
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,700
Let's go. Let's give her some time alone.

236
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,620
Okay, we should go. Let her have some time alone.

237
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,790
Let Qianqian have some time alone.

238
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,360
Okay.

239
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,250
Zhening.

240
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,630
You didn't eat anything tonight.

241
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,050
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,300
It's in the past. We...

243
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,320
have to move on.

244
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,390
But I can't...

245
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,350
pretend that nothing happened.

246
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,820
You know it.

247
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,240
I also can't face your continuous kindness to me.

248
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,350
Thank you so much for coming here to comfort me.

249
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,120
But you and Ning Meng are the victims of the accident.

250
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,760
I don't know if this is the right time to beg for your forgiveness.

251
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,120
Nor do I know...

252
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,720
how I can make up for it.

253
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,700
I feel so guilty right now,

254
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,350
and I don't know what I should do.

255
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,840
So, Zhening,

256
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,260
let's not meet again for now.

257
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,300
Give me some time to think it over.

258
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,290
No problem. I understand.

259
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,350
Sorry.

260
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,190
Sorry.

261
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,400
What's the point of apologizing?

262
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,420
Will that bring my father back?

263
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,090
Ning Meng,

264
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,700
I know that you won't hear anything I say now.

265
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,660
- Maybe when you've calmed down a bit—
- No need.

266
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,490
From now on, I won't believe in

267
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,160
anything you say.

268
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,650
He Zhijuan, you should go. I don't want to see you again.

269
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,650
In the past, no matter how much we quarreled,

270
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,020
I always believed that you loved me.

271
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,860
Even just a little bit.

272
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,300
But now, it seems that I'm just a joke.

273
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,940
He Zhijuan, all this time,

274
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,190
you've been with me just to redeem yours and Xia Qian's sin. Right?

275
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,470
Let me tell you! I won't forgive you two in this life!

276
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,990
And I won't divorce you either.

277
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,880
I won't make it easy on you.

278
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,120
We'll both be in pain. Neither of us can run away.

279
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,360
[Mu Xiaoyan]

280
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,230
Hello, Xiaoyan.

281
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,740
Do you have the contact info of He Zhijuan?

282
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,230
When did you know

283
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
that the accident of Old GM Sheng was caused by us?

284
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,930
After we released the sky lantern that day,

285
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,180
and after we said goodbye,

286
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,450
I was walking alone on my way home.

287
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,800
Mengmeng!

288
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,160
- Dad!
- Mengmeng!

289
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,560
Mengmeng!

290
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,790
Later, I learned

291
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,830
that the girl was Ning Meng.

292
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,160
How did you two meet each other later on?

293
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,970
Ning Meng had PTSD because of the accident.

294
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,120
When she was receiving treatment at our clinic, I recognized her,

295
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,730
and my mentor was her doctor-in-charge.

296
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,430
I guess destiny fooled us.

297
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,890
During her treatment,

298
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,960
she became more and more reliant on me.

299
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,360
The moment I realized that her reliance had turned into something different,

300
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,520
it was too late.

301
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,860
So,

302
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,770
you couldn't tell me what happened between you and Ning Meng back then.

303
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,870
You decided to walk away from our engagement party.

304
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,300
He Zhijuan!

305
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,460
Don't leave!

306
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,840
Stop there!

307
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,900
Let me ask you...

308
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,610
What did you mean by the message you sent me?

309
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,210
What do you mean "you can't marry me"?

310
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,170
I couldn't speak up.

311
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,970
Because I didn't even know myself, why I agreed to Mengmeng's request,

312
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,180
and why I decided to walk away during the engagement party.

313
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,960
I was afraid that you would ask me about it,

314
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,860
but I couldn't say anything.

315
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,520
He Zhijuan.

316
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,800
Is it because of Ning Meng's reliance

317
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,610
that you have a strong sense of responsibility?

318
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,820
And over time you couldn't let go of this responsibility,

319
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,480
right?

320
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,800
I didn't know for sure back then.

321
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,390
But after all this time,

322
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,160
I've now thought it through.

323
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,860
It's not all because of Mengmeng.

324
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,080
It's because I couldn't let go of the guilt and anxiety that the accident brought to me.

325
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,430
To be more exact,

326
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,200
it did change my life, my way of thinking,

327
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,860
and the destiny with Mengmeng.

328
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,310
The accident impacted so many people.

329
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,570
I didn't want to involve you as well.

330
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,320
I always thought that if fewer people were involved,

331
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,360
fewer people would be hurt.

What happens now?

334
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,880
You chose to take it all by yourself.

335
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,210
And you didn't tell me what happened.

336

You chose to take it all by yourself,

You're right.

I originally thought that

347
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,570
taking it all by myself was the best choice.

348
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,330
But instead, it hurt everyone.

- I'm fine.

What is it?

404
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,800
The bulk purchasing order that we had with Jiangong Group

405
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,940
was snatched by Langyue.

406
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,770
Tell me exactly what happened.

407
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,230
They were planning to book 59 rooms in our hotel for one week,

408
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:54,040
and out of courtesy and respect, we gave them the lowest offer.

409
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,730
But Langyue suddenly dropped their rate to a surprisingly low price.

410
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,870
So Jiangong Group decided to book with Langyue instead.

411
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,740
Don't let the public know about it for now.

I was about to tell you about it, GM Qin.

418
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,370
Although we snatched the order from Evergreen,

419
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,180
at such a low price,

420
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,400
Langyue will be losing money. Why would we do that?

421

It's the new marketing strategy for long-term development

that the Marketing Department came up with.
