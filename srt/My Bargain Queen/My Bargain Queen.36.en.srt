[Episode 36]

3
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,890
Why are you here?

4
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,410
Director Lu told me to come.

5
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,720
I'm fine. You can go back.

6
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,150
I will clarify the situation with Director Lu.

7
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,110
I won't bother you in the future.

8
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,220
How many more days do you need to stay in the hospital?

9
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,310
Three to four days.

10
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,430
Then, I'll go grab you some clean clothes

11
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,910
and daily necessities.

12
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Thank you.

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,310
GM Sheng, here's your coffee.

14
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,100
It's so hot outside. Will she get heatstroke?

15
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,110
What are you saying?

16
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,750
I'm talking nonsense again. Just pretend you didn't hear anything.

17
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,400
Actually, it's not a big deal.

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
Ruifeng Technology is talking with Worth or Not about collaborating.

19
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Later this afternoon, they will conduct an offline survey together.

20
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,190
Miss Xia will also be going.

21
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,170
Given how hot it is outside,

22
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,830
will Miss Xia get heatstroke?

23
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,710
Also, I heard Mu Xiaoyan say that Ruifeng Technology's CEO, Hao Siyuan,

24
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,960
was Miss Xia's neighbor when they were young.

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,880
They were childhood friends and very close.

26
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,910
Also, he is into Miss Xia.

27
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,520
What a coincidence, he will also be there this afternoon.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,020
GM Sheng, what do you think?

29
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,900
Do you still have me in your heart?

30
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,670
You are joking!

31
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,220
You do! You still have me in your heart!

32
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,880
No way.

33
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,590
Do you think you are not busy enough with work?

34
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,950
That's not what I meant.

35
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,680
In the future, don't talk about

36
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,340
non-work-related topics during work. Got it?

37
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,990
Leave.

38
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,890
Yuanyuan, strike a pose!

39
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,230
Change to another pose.

40
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,960
So cute.

41
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,850
Done!

42
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,290
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

43
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,760
Let's go.

44
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,060
Hi.

45
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,630
- Sorry, I called you out even in this heat.
- So what?

46
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,990
Just treat it like we are here for fun.

47
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,070
Are you Ruifeng Technology's Mr. Hao?

48
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,600
I am a fan of your company's games. Can I take a picture with you?

49
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,070
Sure, sure.

50
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,890
- I'll take the photo for you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,260
- How about having the tree in the background?
- Sure.
- Okay.

52
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,300
Bear, we are taking a photo.

53
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,800
Can you move a little, please?

54
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,410
Thank you!

55
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,450
Ready.

56
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,230
Done, take a look.

57
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,190
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

58
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,150
You have fans, huh?

59
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,130
CEO Hao, we've surveyed 100 people.

60
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,480
- You've worked hard.
- No problem.

61
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,100
I brought mung bean soup.

62
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,330
Come here, come here and drink some.

63
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,700
- Thank you, Miss Xia.
- Thank you, Miss Xia.

64
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,530
- Don't get heatstroke. Drink more.
- Sure.

65
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,460
CEO Hao.

66
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,770
- I also get some?
- Take one.

67
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,660
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,350
- Are you hot? I can fan you.
- You are too considerate.

69
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,280
Tastes good.

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Sheng Zhening.

71
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,600
Wake up.

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,560
Drink some of this mung bean soup I made.

73
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,110
No, no. I don't like sweets.

74
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,990
Let me tell you. This mung bean soup doesn't have sugar.

75
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,180
But this is the best food to break your fever.

76
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,380
When I was little, I used to drink this. I didn't need medicine.

77
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,140
I'm all right. No need to fan me.

78
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,790
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

79
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,450
He keeps staring at us.

80
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,280
Maybe he likes to be around people.

81
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,720
I don't know. Something seems off.

82
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,580
Oh, do you think he's thirsty watching us drink mung bean soup?

83
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,540
He's wearing so much on this hot summer day. He won't get heatstroke, right?

84
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,630
- I need to pick up this call.
- Go.

85
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,020
What's going on? Why do you keep staring at us?

86
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,630
Are you too hot? I'll get you some water.

87
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,050
Don't wear this much in the heat. You can get heatstroke. Go sit down and rest.

88
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,510
Wait a second.

89
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,140
Take it.

90
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,460
I'll help you take this off. You won't be able to drink water with it.

91
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,130
Is that okay?

92
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,600
It's so heavy!

93
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,950
Be careful.

94
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,030
I'll help you open it.

95
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,340
Here.

96
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,580
This is hard work for you guys.

97
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,890
Drink up.

98
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,590
- Here, can you put this in the bag?
- Okay.

99
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,690
- You're back.
- I'm back.

100
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,380
This is about it. Let me send you back.

101
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,970
Sure, what about this stuff?

102
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,010
- They got it.
- Leave it to us.

103
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,410
- You've worked hard.
- You've worked hard.

104
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,760
Let's go.

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,460
I just asked the bear.

106
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,530
What happened? It's so hot.

107
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,550
- I'm a bit tired, too.
- You're also tired? It's okay.

108
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,470
We'll get in the car for some air conditioning.

109
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,110
When are you leaving the country?

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,550
I heard from your brother.

111
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,880
Once you recover, we can talk about it.

112
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,560
You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself.

113
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,540
No matter what, we are still a couple legally.

114
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,780
If you need anything else, just give me a call.

115
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,560
I'm going to head back.

116
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,410
Okay.

117
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,240
- Is this the meal for patients?
- Yes.

119
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,780
Is this the only option? Are there other options?

120
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,550
No, all of the patient meals

121
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,420
are standard like this.

122
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,120
You don't need to send food to this patient.

123
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,080
I'll bring him food every day.

124
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,590
- Okay.
- Thank you.

125
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,560
GM Sheng.

126
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,470
What's wrong?

127
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,730
- I might have heatstroke.
- Heatstroke?

128
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,270
Did you go out today? How did you get heatstroke?

129
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,930
Should I get the Catering Department to bring you some mung bean soup?

130
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,970
I don't want it.

131
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,800
Sister Qian just called me and said they would be back soon. Did Sheng Zhening go there?

132
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,110
GM Sheng didn't go. He got heatstroke.

133
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,690
Heatstroke? He's missing out on such a good opportunity.

134
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,950
What do you know?

135
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,790
Heatstroke might also be a good opportunity.

136
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,150
I'll head back now. I'll get the data analysis to you as soon as possible.

137
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,890
There's no rush. You've worked hard all day. How about we invite Xiaoai and Xiaoyan to have dinner together?

138
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,720
Tonight?

139
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,500
Miss Xia.

140
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,460
Why are you here?

141
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,310
I have something important to tell you.

142
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,240
It's fine. Go ahead. I'll wait.

143
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,940
Sorry, we might take a while.

144
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,710
Let's not eat together tonight. Next time, it'll be on me.

145
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,680
Okay. Next time then.

146
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,990
Take care.

147
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,710
Miss Xia, GM Sheng has heatstroke.

148
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,250
He hasn't been in a very good state.

149
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,120
He locks himself up in his room and doesn't eat. He's unwell.

150
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,940
Heatstroke? Heatstroke makes you extremely unwell.

151
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,570
The last time I had heatstroke, I was light-headed. It took me several days to get better.

152
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,400
Miss Xia, I know I shouldn't be telling you this.

153
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,790
But I know you still care about GM Sheng.

154
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,960
He has heatstroke? Then try

155
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,820
to find some mung bean soup for him.

156
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,360
How can I find it? I don't know how to cook mung bean soup.

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,150
If you don't know, can't you look it up online?

158
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,830
Miss Xia. Miss Xia.

159
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,180
Even if I can look it up online, it won't taste good.

160
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,120
It's so hard.

161
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,640
Here. I bought you the lily bulb and lotus seeds you wanted.

162
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,850
Hurry. Give them to me.

163
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,060
Thank you.

164
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,490
I have mung bean soup. Why do you need to cook it yourself?

165
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,090
Do you not like how I cooked it?

166
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,570
How could that be? My mom makes the best soup.

167
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,960
But I need to cook this one myself.

168
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,750
You need to soak them for a while.

169
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,890
- They're soaking.
- That's too much.

170
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,880
Hi, Anan.

171
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,380
I have something for you. I'm at...

172
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,680
the second-floor corridor. Come down and get it.

173
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,180
Okay, Miss Xia. Give me a second.

174
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,280
Is he feeling better?

175
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,160
GM Sheng? He's still very ill.

176
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,510
But he's still forcing himself to work. It's tough on him.

177
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,280
Then I'll wait for you.

178
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,990
Miss Xia, I'll head down now.

179
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,060
- Don't forget what we just discussed.
- Okay.

180
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,090
Sheng Zhening.

181
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,970
GM Sheng, we'll wait for you outside.

182
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,970
It's nothing. I heard you got heatstroke.

183
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,680
My mom made this mung bean soup. She told me to stop by to give it to you.

184
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,770
No thanks.

185
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,110
Just have some.

186
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,910
Take care of yourself. I'll get going now.

187
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,390
- Did you tell Xia Qian to come here?
- I accidentally told her.

188
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,530
You don't know how worried Miss Xia was after she knew that you had heatstroke.

189
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,820
She insisted on personally cooking mung bean soup for you.

190
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,830
- You're so meddlesome.
- Yes.

191
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,580
I'm meddlesome. I won't do it again.

192
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,220
Get out.

193
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,150
Brother! Brother!

194
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,750
Help me get a glass of water.

195
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,640
Help me pass the remote control. It's over there.

196
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,640
By the way, I can't walk.

197
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,530
So I won't be doing the cleaning for the time being.

198
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,860
Hasn't your leg already healed?

199
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,750
I saw you walking pretty quickly in the office the other day.

200
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,970
It was about to heal, but I was running around

201
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,400
for Sister Qian and Sheng Zhening to get back together, and I sprained it again.

202
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,590
Wait a second.

203
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,730
Help me wash those grapes.

204
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,220
Brother, help me bring over my phone.

205
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,750
Brother, help me bring over my phone, in my bedroom!

206
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,100
What's going on?

207
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,780
Stop.

208
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,880
Your leg healed?

209
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,630
Oh no, it hurts!

210
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,390
Didn't you sprain your right ankle?

211
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,210
Right.

212
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,760
You liar!

213
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,040
- Stop running! You liar!
- Brother, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

214
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,310
- Don't hit me!
- Sprained your ankle? You're running faster than I am!

215
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,490
It's so sweet.

216
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,020
You're in charge of the cleaning for this month.

217
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,030
Okay.

218
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,750
Wash the dishes, too.

219
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,340
Okay.

220
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,140
- Wipe the windows tomorrow, too.
- What?

221
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,590
Okay.

222
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,940
Get going.

[New City Center Block B]

224
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,010
I'm doing the monthly sales summary report today, so I won't be having lunch with you.

225
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,310
Aren't the sales summary reports usually done at the end of the month?

226
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,080
I want to finish it early so I can go to my hometown with Qianqian.

227
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,320
Don't be upset. I'll cook braised pork with preserved vegetable

228
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,620
for you tonight.

229
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,080
All right then. I'm off to work now. Remember to have lunch.

[New City Center Block B]

231
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,810
Wait a second. I forgot one thing.

232
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,520
What's up?

233
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,590
[New City Center Block B]

234
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,020
Xiao Liu, what's up?

235
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,240
Notify President Wu immediately. I'm heading to the office now.

236
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,040
President Wu, I'll cut to the chase.

237
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,450
Langyue Hotel previously snatching Jiangong's order at a super low price,

238
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,110
it was suggested by Lihe Capital. Right?

239
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,020
Also, I've come to understand that the so-called long-term business strategy the Marketing Department came up with

240
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,440
is nothing more than a plan to greatly reduce Langyue Hotel's room rates.

241
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,990
We are now in the tourism high season. Adjusting the rates at this time,

242
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,020
clearly Lihe Capital wants to manipulate Langyue Hotel,

243
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,980
and go into a price war with Evergreen Hotel.

244
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,960
"Manipulate" is an unpleasant word.

245
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,700
It's because of Langyue's outstanding performance

246
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,290
that Lihe Capital wants to support us

247
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,360
in competing with Evergreen Hotel for the top hotel of Jinhai City.

248
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,720
Even without such rash advances,

249
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,140
I'm confident that in two years,

250
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,420
I can bring Langyue to the same level as Evergreen Hotel.

251
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,660
Two years is too long.

252
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,620
GM Qin, that's enough. I've already decided.

253
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,790
A price war is imperative.

254
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,330
Langyue Hotel has adjusted the prices on all the major platforms.

255
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,020
In other words, the price war with Evergreen Hotel

256
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,060
- has already begun.
- Now that Langyue has suddenly lowered their rates,

257
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,670
many of our regular customers have switched over to Langyue.

258
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,560
Our individual guests are also decreasing. We need to do something about this.

259
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,750
Langyue has come prepared.

260
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,520
We have no choice but to accept the challenge.

261
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,420
Please give me some time.

262
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,230
I'll readjust our business strategies.

263
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,360
I believe in Evergreen's strength. It's still uncertain

264
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,880
who will win this war.

265
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,210
Since you've chosen to work in the hotel industry,

266
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,490
a war with Evergreen Hotel is unavoidable.

267
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,650
Besides, even if it's a price war,

268
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,860
it's a reasonable business approach.

269
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,950
You don't need to do anything.

270
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,010
Just maintain Langyue's current quality of its customer service.

271
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,710
Once we've replaced Evergreen Hotel,

272
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,720
I'll give you 5% of Langyue's shares.

273
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,270
GM Qin, please consider it.

274
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,210
I know that during these days,

275
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,790
you've been telling Xia Qian my news.

276
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,000
But regarding this price war,

277
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,620
you can't tell her anything no matter what.

278
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,230
I don't want to get her involved in this.

279
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,200
I know. If I say anything, I'll resign.

280
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,860
What are you doing here?

281
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,820
I thought we weren't going to have lunch together.

282
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,670
Oh, nothing.

283
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,150
I just wanted to talk to you about something that I can't figure out.

284
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,940
Give me a second. I'm almost done.

285
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,210
You go ahead with your meeting.

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,450
Sister Shuangshuang,

287
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,580
our corn sales have not been good.

288
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,950
The customer reviews said that it doesn't taste as good as other best-selling corn online.

289
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,340
Do we want to consider changing to another corn company?

290
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,920
Best-selling corn online.

291
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,630
- Can you pass me the information on the best-selling corn?
- Okay.

292
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,030
Cyclamate is 50 times sweeter than sucrose.
[Cyclamate is a type of sweetener]

293
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,800
This corn is so sweet because

294
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,110
large amounts of cyclamate are added.

295
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,510
But most of our livestream customers are mothers.

296
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,940
So, the products we sell must be absolutely safe,

297
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,760
so I can be at ease.

298
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,370
But, our sales...

299
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,580
Most of our products are profitable.

300
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,060
It's not a big deal, not making as much profit here.

301
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,730
Well, it's not totally "not a big deal."

302
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,830
It's just that I think, only this way

303
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,650
can I feel at ease.

304
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,960
Let's do what Shuangshuang says.

305
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,410
Feeling at ease is the most important.

306
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you think what I did was stupid?

307
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,950
It certainly doesn't follow the business principles that I know,

308
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,810
but now I think what you did is right.

309
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,040
Thank you, Boss.

310
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,860
Also, I heard about your corn problem.

311
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,710
You can share some corn recipes in your livestream.

312
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,150
After making the corn into dishes,

313
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,510
taste shouldn't be a problem.

314
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,540
Good idea.

315
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,350
Didn't you say you needed something from me earlier?

316
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,890
There's nothing, I figured it out.

317
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,420
You figured it out this quickly?

318
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,260
- Once it's done, I'll tell you.
- Okay.

319
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,950
What do you want to eat?

320
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,030
- Corn!
- Corn? You still want to eat corn?

321
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,440

Director Xue, I'm not here today to catch up.

353
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,860
There's something I would like to clarify.

354
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,040
Why are you using Langyue to attack Evergreen?

355
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,200
Since you've asked,

356
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,770
I'll tell you.

357
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,210
Originally, I could have

358
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,490
controlled Evergreen more directly.

359
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,920
But now I have a partner who decided to bail halfway,

360
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,060
I can only give up that original plan.

361
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,730
But now working with Langyue

362
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,660
has given me a lot of possibilities.

363
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,360

364
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,530
Yes.

365
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,030
Actually, working with Langyue is possible because of you.

366
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,260
Langyue was not my first choice,

367
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,970
but you managed Langyue too well,

368
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,700
Langyue is now strong enough to compete with Evergreen.

369
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,540
That's why I chose Langyue.

370
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,290
President Wu already told me that he would put you in an important position,

371
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,820
and even give you Langyue's shares.

372
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,600

I don't understand.

383
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,620
Is your past with Evergreen more important than

384

It isn't much, but it might help a little.

422

Then I won't see you out.

485
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,470
Hey, stop mopping the floor. I need to talk to you about something.

486
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,330
What is it?

487
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,360
In fact, Evergreen is in big trouble right now.

488
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,090
Do you know that we are in a price war with Langyue?

489
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,720
A price war?

490
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,710
What does it mean?

491
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,670
It doesn't matter. What matters is that Miss Xia learned about this.

492
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,540
She came to the company to speak to GM Sheng,

493
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,540
asking if she could return the money and dividend

494
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,270
that GM Sheng invested in Worth or Not. That way she could help a little.

495
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,430
But you know what GM Sheng said?

496
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,070
What did he say?

497
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,530
GM Sheng said he didn't want the dividend, she only needed to return the principal he invested.

498
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,850
That way he could have a clean breakup with Miss Xia.

499
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,920
No way! How can Sheng Zhening speak in such an irritating way?

500
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,560
- I'm so pissed off.
- Don't be so agitated.

501
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,980
I know he said something over the top. But he just wanted to push Miss Xia away by saying that.

502
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,850
This price war with Langyue will last for a long time.

503
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,940
He's afraid that Miss Xia will be worried without being able to help much.

504
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,460
I think Sheng Zhening is just cruel and cold-blooded.

505
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,590
And you. It's such big news, and you didn't tell me.

506
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,520
Didn't we agree to share information? Have you forgotten about our alliance?

507
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,710
I was afraid that you would accidentally spill the beans, and let Miss Xia know.

508
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,050
You just don't trust me, do you? But that's fine.

509
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,020
On the contrary, I think Hao Siyuan is a better choice for Sister Qian.

510
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,100
How could you switch sides?

511
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,980
You can't switch to his side. Don't betray us.

512
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,420
What else can I do?

513
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,550
I unlocked a new map in Ultimate Jianghu yesterday, and I found a new mission.

514
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,800
What is it?

515
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,530
The hero's junior sister who grew up together with him is the No.1 Beauty in Jianghu.

516
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:26,200
She looks a lot like Sister Qian, and they share the same name.

517
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,320
Her name is Xia Xia.

518
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,360
I think CEO Hao must have a crush on Sister Qian.

519
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,600
Clean up the livestream plan.

520
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,710
CEO Hao will be here for a meeting soon.

521
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,800
Okay.

522
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,630
Have a look. The livestream plan is ready.

523
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:57,240
I told you there's no hurry.

524
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,000
It's work. The sooner we can get it done, the better.

525
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,520
You're still as competitive as before.
