00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,630
[Checked in today. Ate the blue Dream Ocean Mystery. So happy!]

4
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,700
[Checked in today. Ate orange-flavored cake. So happy!]

5
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,350
[Checked in today. Ate the Calling Forest cupcake. So happy!]

[Checked in today. Ate Red Velvet. So happy!]

7
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you for your support.

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
There's someone who likes the cakes I bake,

9
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,380
it's the happiest thing that has occurred to me recently.

10
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,590
Recently I'm feeling a little down,

11
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,440
but because of your orders every day, I look forward to my life a little more.

12
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Thank you.

13
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,880
No need to thank me.

14
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
We have to believe that

15
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,250
those unhappy things will be over, we will be better in the future.

16
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,610
Xia Qian? Xia Qian?

17
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,340
Xia...

18
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,170
This child...

19
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,690
So much alcohol.

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,260
Don't follow me. It's not like I can't walk.

21
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,140
Miss Xia, you drank too much. I'll send you home.

22
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,860
I didn't drink a lot.

23
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,970
I'll send you home?

24
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,260
No need for you to send me home.

25
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,920
Stay there, don't move.

26
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,610
- Hey...
- Don't move!

27
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,200
Sheng Zhening!

28
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,710
Miss Xia...

29
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,870
Don't talk!

30
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,790
Sheng Zhening!

31
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,730
GM Sheng,

32
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,670
Miss Xia drank too much, I cannot control her.

33
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,510
I didn't drink a lot!

34
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,370
Hey.

35
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,370
You go back first, I'll settle this.

36
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,650
- Okay.
- Quick, go!

37
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,300
Okay.

38
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Quick!

39
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,890
You drank?

40
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,610
I'm not drunk.

41
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,480
I just have something to tell you.

42
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,890
What is it?

43
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,230
Photo.

44
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,750
This... I found it.

45
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,090
You said I couldn't find it forever.

46
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,920
I've found it.

47
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,050
Hold it!

48
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,020
But, Sheng Zhening, let me tell you.

49
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,910
I found it but I'm not happy.

50
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,780
Found it, not happy, too easy.

51
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,490
You did not hide it well. And...

52
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,450
your things are hidden so high.

53
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,080
Putting it in a place so high.

54
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,600
You said if I cannot reach it, I will think of you.

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,770
I've thought of you.

56
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,320
But...

57
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,290
where are you?

58
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,220
I'll send you home.

59
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,480
I...

60
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,330
I'm not going home yet.

61
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,100
Today, we'll say things clearly.

62
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,990
This period,

63
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,720
how have you been?

64
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,110
I've not been good at all.

65
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,540
I'll tell you honestly. My work schedule is packed every day.

66
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,020
Eat meals on time.

67
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,400
Sleep on time.

68
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,340
I can't miss you for one moment.

69
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,570
Really no solutions,

70
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,980
I still miss you.

71
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,500
I thought I could lie to myself,

72
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,610
but I can't do it.

73
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,310
How about you?

74
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,220
Were you the same?

75
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,880
Do you still have me in your heart?

76
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,930
Have.

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,930
Have.

78
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,900
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!

79
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,480
You are lying to me.

80
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,010
You have me in your heart!

81
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,430
You have me in your heart.

82
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,270
You lied to me.

83
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,640
How can you not?

84
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,350
No way.

85
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,280
Sheng Zhening.

86
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,180
You have to...

87
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,850
Hello?

88
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,110
Hi, hi. Are you Assistant An?

89
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm Xia Qian's mom.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh, Auntie, hi, hi.

91
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,540
Hi, hi.

92
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,060
I can't find Xia Qian and Xiao Sheng.

93
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,520
I didn't have a choice.

94
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,810
I asked Mu Xiaoyan for your phone number. I want to ask you,

95
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,170
do you know if Xia Qian went to Evergreen?

96
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,510
Auntie, don't worry. GM Sheng has sent her back.

97
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,900
She should be home soon.

98
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,100
Oh...okay, thank you.

99
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,660
You're welcome, Auntie. If there's anything you can call me.

100
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,210
Okay, okay. Bye.

101
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,170
She went to Evergreen?

102
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,710
Why did this child drink so much?

103
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,990
We just broke up. It's inevitable to have some mood swings.

104
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,210
Then you two...

105
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,230
Auntie, don't worry.

106
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,080
The things I promised you, I will definitely do them.

107
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,960
When she wakes up tomorrow, I will tell her properly.

108
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,230
Good.

109
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,850
Don't worry. We haven't had a lot of guests here recently.

110
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,120
Your friend can come and stay here anytime she wants.

111
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,710
We haven't decided when we'll go yet. I'll let you know when it's decided.

112
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,180
- Mom.
 - Sure, okay.

113
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,970
I'll talk to you later.

114
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,840
I mean, are you really going to take Xia Qian back to your hometown?

115
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,850
There's no sign of her and Zhening's relationship being fixed at the moment.

116
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,830
So I want to help her relax. She must be in a bad mood.

117
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Then... did she agree?

118
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,930
She hasn't agreed yet, and she hasn't told me when she wants to go.

119
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,620
How about buying a ticket for her directly?

120
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,720
And then I'll let her know and take her there.

121
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,130
That's not appropriate.

122
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,630
What if she has her own plans?

123
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,450
Does she?

124
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,010
Really?

125
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,790
You're reluctant to let me leave, aren't you?

126
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,260
How's that possible?

127
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,050
I'm just worried that after you leave,

128
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,890
I won't be able to take good care of Pudding.

129
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,480
You're not telling the truth!

130
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,670
You are reluctant to let me go. Right?

131
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,730
No.

132
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,080
- Yes or no?
- No.

133
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,550
Where's your weak spot?

134
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,030
You're up! The breakfast will be ready soon.

135
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,530
Mom. When did you come here?

136
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,880
I came last night.

137
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,530
- You cleaned up for me.
- Yes.

138
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,020
Do you feel any better? Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

139
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,260
Come over and have some congee.

140
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,290
You drank too much!

141
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,000
Mom.

142
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,650
I was drunk last night. Where did I go?

143
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,190
Don't you remember?

144
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,850
Not very clearly.

145
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,770
But I know that I left home.

146
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,530
Did I go to Evergreen?

147
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,140
Yes. You did go to Evergreen.

148
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,230
You fell asleep on the bench in Evergreen's garden.

149
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,390
Xiao Sheng's assistant called me and asked me to pick you up.

150
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,640
Did I meet him?

151
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,530
You didn't.

152
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,120
Good to know.

153
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,330
Xia Qian, you must be very sad after breaking up with Xiao Sheng.

154
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,530
But if you don't let go, it will cause trouble for him.

155
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,320
Think about it.

156
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,830
Xiao Sheng must have thought it through before he decided to break up with you.

157
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,540
Don't make things hard for him.

158
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,340
I'm not making things hard for him.

159
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,000
Mom, I was drinking, but I didn't want to get myself drunk.

160
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,050
I won't do it again. I won't make you feel worried.

161
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,490
I know that you will be very sad in the coming days.

162
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,330
But you have to believe that time will cure everything.

163
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,130
And I promise you. I will never interfere with your relationship again.

164
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,720
Whether you get married or not, it's all up to you.

165
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,850
As long as you're happy.

166
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,090
I know.

167
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,290
I still have an upset stomach. I'll go back to bed.

168
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,880
Hello? Xiao Sheng, you don't need to worry too much.

169
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,090
Xia Qian doesn't remember what happened last night.

170
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,050
That's great.

171
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,550
Also, Xia Qian agreed

172
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,760
that she will never go visit you again.

173
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,330
Okay.

174
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll be hanging up now.

175
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,460
GM Sheng has been so busy with work and in a low mood.

176
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,690
What about Miss Xia?

177
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,370
You mean Sister Qian?

178
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,960
She's just like before.

179
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,970
Miss Xia was drunk and came to Evergreen last night.

180
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,520
- I thought they could get back together last night.
- What?

181
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,890
- Sister Qian went to Evergreen yesterday?
- Yeah.

182
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,990
It was the first time I saw her like that.

183
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,790
But I don't know what happened exactly.

184
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,370
But I can feel that they're still in love with each other.

185
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,470
They just need an opportunity to get back together.

186
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,590
We have to figure out a way to create opportunities for them.

187
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,490
I just realized that you have so much stuff!

188
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,630
That's not too much. I've thrown away half of everything.

189
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,650
I'll take a nap, we can talk later.

190
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,760
- What is it?
- Apartment sharing agreement.

191
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,460
Since we've decided to share an apartment, I think we should make some things clear...

192
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,080
to avoid troubles.

193
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,570
What troubles?

194
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,730
Listen to me. You have to stick to every rule in here.

195
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,520
Sit up straight, please.

196
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,970
Just say it. I can lie down here and still listen.

197
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,960
Sit up straight!

198
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,960
First, the rent will be paid according to our agreement last time.

199
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,320
I will pay 60% and you will pay 40%.

200
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,900
- Paid every three months with one month deposit. I will pay for the utilities.
- Okay.

201
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,570
Second, you are not allowed to bring other people home, especially girls.

202
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,890
I don't have any girls to bring home.

203
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,160
Third, rest time is between 12:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.

204
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Unless there's a special reason, we can't produce any noise above 40 decibels,

205
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,120
to avoid disturbing each other.

206
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,150
40 decibels? How loud is that?

207
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,870
I'm not good at physics. I don't have a concept of it.

208
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,000
Really? Do you have to use such a professional device?

209

93.8. Please mind your noise level.

210
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,230
I will clean up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. You will clean up every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

211
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,650
For Sundays, we will take turns cleaning up.

I will have...

213

I will have the first and second levels of the refrigerator. You can have the third and fourth levels.

Please put your food accordingly and don't touch things that are not yours.

215
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,260
Hang your clothes timely after you're done washing. Don't leave them in the washing machine, as your roommate might need it.

Haven't you heard of it?

236
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,530
I've been playing a mobile game that they produced.

237
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,130
They're in the top two in the industry!

Oh, I remember it.

239
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,640
I read a feature on their boss. He's handsome.

240
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,340
You're too shallow.

241
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Their boss is not just handsome. He has a game designer background as well.

242
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,620
I heard that he personally took part in the design of all their games.

243
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,980
He's absolutely a talented young man!

I'm wondering if I can get a few skins from them after we become their partner.

Sister Qian hasn't decided whether we want to work with them or not.

Of course yes! Yes!

Their boss wants to come and see our office.

Their boss is coming in person?

- Yes.
- Are you sure?

250
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,030
I find it strange, too. We were supposed to visit their office,

251
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,630
but their owner says he wants to see our office.

252

327
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,340
promote these new features using your live streaming service.

328
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,270
Okay. I think this could work.

329
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,930
We should discuss the promotion strategy

330
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,480
and what you would like to achieve through promotion.

331
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,350
How nice, having a childhood sweetheart living next door.

332
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,260
Look at you, all infatuated.

333
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,110
Imagine. If the boy living next door turns into a brute,

334
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,830
your fantasy would probably be shattered.

335
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,430
Can you stop ruining it?

336
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:25,270
Don't you think it's been a long time since Sister Qian had a relaxed conversation with someone?

337
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,510
Maybe, this boy living next door

338
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,070
could be a chance for a new beginning.

339
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,280
- It can't be.
- What do you know?

340
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,450
Childhood sweetheart, long-awaited reunion, old flames rekindled.

341
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,710
These are all romantic cliches.

342
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,590
Destiny sends the boy next door here.

343
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,180
There must be a reason for it to happen.

344
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,800
I agree, it'll be great.

345
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,380
Okay. Now I have an idea.

346
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,400
We will come up with a promotion proposal immediately.

347
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,240
Great! Let's add each other on WeChat.

348
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,740
No problem. I'll scan your QR code.

349
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,030
Director Hao, may I add you as well?

350
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,120
Later, we can play together.

351
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,900
Very well.

352
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,580
I'll see you out.

353
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,630
This way, please.

354
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,830
Bye.

355
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,120
What a coincidence to bump into you today.

356
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,570
Actually, it's no coincidence. I came here to see you.

357
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,350
- Really?
- I saw your name

358
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,880
in the promotion proposal in our marketing department.

359
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,780
So I came to see if it's the little girl of the old days.

360
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,170
It seems then that there aren't that many people called Xia Qian.

361
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,310
Indeed. That little girl back then

362
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,240
is now in charge of a company.

363
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,670
Actually, I'm not surprised at all that you are in the gaming industry.

364
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,430
You were interested in computer games even when we were young.

365
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,900
I and the other kids came to your house all the time to play.

366
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,800
And just wouldn't go home.

367
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,350
You all ended up being dragged home by your parents.

368
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,210
Back then, my mom's attention wasn't on me a lot.

369
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,070
Your parents fed me a lot. Remember?

370
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,580
They were all really envious of me.

371
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,460
Because you could stay a bit longer to play?

372
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,590
- And that game we often played, Legend of Sword and Fairy.
- Right.

373
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,390
We were all obsessed.

374
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,500
Lin Yueru, Zhao Ling'er, and Brother Xiaoyao, who was my favorite.

375
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,120
Have you found your Xiaoyao yet?

376
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,500
Stop asking about me!

377
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,100
How about you? How have you been?

378
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,800
Me... I'm still single.

379
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,830
As you know, being in this business, you don't have much time for romance.

380
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,440
Indeed, everyone is busy.

381
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,210
For things like love, when you meet it, it just happens.

382
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,220
You can only go along with the flow.

383
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,510
Let's go.

384
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,290
Brother, big news.

385
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,520
What is it?

386
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,280
Have you heard of Ruifeng Technology

387
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,370
which created Ultimate Jianghu?

388
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,600
Ultimate Jianghu...

389
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,530
I heard that their game designer also likes PUBG.
[Player unknowns battlegrounds]

390
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,800
Yes. Do you know?

391
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,390
Their boss came to our office today to discuss business.

392
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,120
And guess what?

393
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,270
That person is actually Sister Qian's childhood friend.

394
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,980
Child sweetheart, the boy living next door.

395
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,720
I added him on WeChat.

396
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,580
His Moments show that he is still single.

397
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,380
So he is GM Sheng's potential love rival?

398
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,900
Xiaoyan, I'm available now. Shall we play?

399
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,120
Sure, bro. I'll be online right away.

400
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,690
How can you play with GM Sheng's potential love rival?

401
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,040
These are all sugar-coated bullets. Take your stand. Don't get bought over.

402
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,690
It's just a game.

403
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,960
Get me a Coke, will you?

404
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,880
Mu Xiaoyan, did you drink my milk?

405
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,720
- I did, so?
- So?

406
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,800
We agreed that I take the top two shelves and you the bottom two.

407
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,380
Why did you touch my stuff?

408
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,060
It's just a bottle of milk. What's all the fuss? I'll buy you some tomorrow.

409
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,390
I want it now.

410
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,110
I am playing with—

411
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,180
I'm in the middle of a game with Director Hao.

412
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,840
No games. Let's nip your potential betrayal in the bud.

413
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,360
Your food delivery.

414
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,300
Thanks.

415
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,290
Is this my order?

416
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,410
It is.

417
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,360
I didn't seem to order this much.

418
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,030
These are from the shop manager.

419
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,670
Hello! Thank you for your support all along.

420
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,540
Unfortunately,

421
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,100
it is time to say goodbye.

422
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,750
I'm closing the shop.

423
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,350
A final treat for you.

424
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,120
You are a heart-warming person.

425
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,990
I wish you all the happiness

426
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,040
in the days to come.

427
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,720
What took you so long?

428
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,000
What happened to your leg?

429
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
Were you beaten up?

430
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,530
Take these first.

431
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,610
They were sold out at the convenience store downstairs. So I tried many others.

432
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,590
I had to run to get these.

433
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,360
And I sprained an ankle.

434
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,100
- Does it hurt here?
- Down there.

435
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,930
Doesn't look serious.

436
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,850
What do you mean not serious? Sprain one yourself and see.

437
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,030
It's not the brand I usually buy.

438
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,170
I ran to so many stores and even sprained an ankle. Can't you just make do?

439
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,860
You are all rigid.

440
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,790
Look—

441
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,910
Look at me. How happy my life is.

442
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,720
It's late. Director Hao must be in bed now.

443
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,010
Do you want to play with me?

444
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,850
Are you sure you'll survive long enough?

445
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,280
My sklls? Prepared to be amazed.

446
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,100
Log in!

447
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,000
Enemies in the southwest. Get down. Don't stand there.

448
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,300
Wrong key.

449
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,330
I told you to attack the enemy. Why are you blowing me up?

450
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,050
Maybe call it a day? I'm really tired now.

451
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,070
No.

452
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,450
We have to make it tonight!

453
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,410
Come. I'll take you.

454
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,190
Hello! I will go abroad soon.

455
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,930
I've made cakes for our loyal customers.

456
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,780
Could you send me your address?

457
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,000
I will arrange flash delivery.

458
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,360
Very well, then. Thank you.

459
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,300
What would you like?

460
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,660
Mousse cake, then.

[Cake shop ownership transfer]

462
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,410
Little mousse?

463
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,570
- Who's little mousse?
- It's me.

464

- Thanks.
- Please rate our service.

- I'm too tired—
- Xiaoai.

Xiaoyan, you two get prepared. We will have a meeting soon.

476
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,790
Why is Director Hao here again?

477
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,760
I thought our streaming proposal wouldn't be ready just yet.

478
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,390
Didn't you see the group notice this morning?

479

We will see a lot of him. And he will follow up on the promotion.

This afternoon, he will go with Sister Qian to do offline research.

What? Offline research?

482
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,590
What offline research?

483
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,180
I think he is just seeking opportunities to be alone with Miss Xia.

484
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,670
My thoughts exactly. What should we do now?

485
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,440
Sheng Zhening and Sister Qian haven't even had a chance to reconcile.

might actually be a good thing.

489
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,340
What do you mean?

490
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,670
Jealousy could be a catalyst for the relationship.

491
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,410
I'll casually mention the news to GM Sheng.

492
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,790
Let's see how he reacts.

493
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,210
How come I didn't think of that?

494
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,370
I don't think Sheng Zhening can remain indifferent if he knows that Sister Qian is going out

495
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,530
with her childhood sweetheart.

496
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,410
Okay. I'll keep you updated.

497
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,270
Cool.

498
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,530
Hello?

499
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,200
What? How could it be? I'm on my way.

500
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,180
Here is what happened.

501
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,660
This morning, a patient of ours who suffered from mania was having an episode.

502
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,910
He took our nurse, Miss Zhou, hostage. Thanks to Dr. He.

503
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,640
He saved the nurse and brought the patient under control.

504
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,030
How is he now?

505
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,500
He... He fell down the stairs.

506
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,770
He has bruises all over. The feet were badly injured.

507
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,690
You should go and see him.

508
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,760
Thank you.

509
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,040
