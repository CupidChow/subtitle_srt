Any other ways?

Actually, it's not important if he likes your friend or not.

If you ask me, I'd say that you look prettier and he looks more handsome.

166
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,090
Everything else is just like before.

167
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,100
Ms. Chen. we're here to celebrate your birthday with you.

168
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,420
Although we stopped learning violin later, we missed you a lot.

169
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,960
Birthday? You've got the date wrong.

170
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,120
My birthday is the day after tomorrow.

171
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,820
- The day after tomorrow?
- Right.

172
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,580
[I need to stay here one more day. I'll be back the day after tomorrow.]

173
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm so sorry. I got the wrong date.

174
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,330
It's okay.

175
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,030
Sorry, I'm late.

176
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,430
Wait. Is that what you're wearing today?

177
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,680
Do I look nice?

178
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,400
The weather forecast says it's going to get a lot colder today.

179
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,990
Didn't you see the weather forecast?

180
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,490
I didn't. I just randomly grabbed a dress. My dresses are all like this.

181
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,420
It... It looks nice.

182
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's hurry up. There are wild swans in this park.

183
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,860
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

184
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,390
Put on my jacket.

185
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,010
No, I'm good. You can keep it.

186
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm not cold at all.

187
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,420
But you might catch a cold. That's not good.

188
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,150
See, they have worn a lot.

189
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,690
Here.

190
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,790
How about we just cancel today?

191
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,130
Thanks. We can't cancel.

192
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,840
We haven't seen the wild swans yet.

193
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,950
I heard it's somewhere around here. Where are they?

194
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,150
- Wild swans.
- Well...

195
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,660
We can watch the wild swans next time. Okay?

196
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,200
I don't want you to catch a cold.

197
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,820
Next time? No.

198
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,700
Or maybe we can go and have hotpot. I've made a reservation.

199
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,530
- Hotpot?
- Yes.

200
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,360
Forget about it. I'll send you home.

201
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,180
Hotpot makes you warm!

202
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,460
This place is the same as before. Nothing's changed.

203
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,810
Do you know why I learned violin back in those days?

204
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,320
Why?

205
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,970
Because of you.

206
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,390
Because of me?

207
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,290
Actually, I didn't like the violin at all.

208
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,790
Back in those years, practicing the violin with you was the happiest thing for me.

209
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,180
Would you like some roasted sweet potatoes?

210
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,280
I'll be right back.

211
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,120
Hi, Sir. I‘d like a box of sweet potatoes, please.

212
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,870
Would you like to try it?

213
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm good, thanks.

214
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,550
As I remember, you never ate street food.

215
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,790
I have realized since then that street food is pretty good.

216
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,490
Seems like you've changed a lot in the years we were apart.

217
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
Is it because of the girl, Xia Qian?

218
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,940
Maybe.

219
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,530
What are you busy with?

220
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
- You can go work on it.
- Okay.

221
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,290
Hello, GM Sheng? What's up?

222
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,680
I really want to know what Xia Qian is doing now.

223
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,190
But I can't contact her. So...

224
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,220
You should go and check what she's doing.

225
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,850
I'm working, GM Sheng. How am I supposed to slip away?

226
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,590
If the HR Department looks for you, ask them to call me directly.

227
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,270
Got it.

228
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,360
Hello, Miss Xia.

229
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,220
Thank you.

230
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,240
GM Sheng took a trip to another city.

231
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,600
Didn't he tell you what he was up to?

232
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,230
No.

233
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,670
Why are you here to visit him today?

234
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,480
Well, it's nothing urgent.

235
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,250
I haven't seen him for a while. I just wanted to see how he was doing.

236
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,120
GM Sheng has a friend. Her name is...

237
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,540
Qi... Qi Lin.

238
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,970
Do you know her?

239
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,650
Oh, Qi Lin.

240
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,640
I heard about her from GM Sheng.

241
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
They've known each other for a long time, since they were kids.

242
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,190
They're kind of like childhood sweethearts.

243
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,020
Really?

244
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,100
Why do you ask, Miss Xia?

245
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,860
GM Sheng, your GM Sheng.

246
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,920
He went on a business trip to another city with Qi Lin.

247
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,750
And it's not even for business.

248
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,860
I don't know what they're up to, but...

249
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,380
she is...

250
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,330
a childhood sweetheart.

251
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,810
It's okay if they want to go on a date.

252
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,310
But I'm his boss. He's got work. We've got a lot of work to do,

253
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,200
what if the work gets delayed?

254
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,570
Shouldn't I remind him to come back earlier?

255
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,570
Yes. Miss Xia, you're absolutely right.

256
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,680
GM Sheng is not thinking about dating anyone,

257
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,220
but what if they get in the mood for love on a business trip?

258
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,300
We never know. Love is unpredictable.

259
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,500
How could you have said that?

260
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
What if she misunderstands?

261
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,320
Misunderstanding is good.

262
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,810
Think about it. Even if Miss Xia cares just a little bit about you, she will get nervous.

263
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,020
Next time, before you make any decisions, you must let me know in advance. Is that clear?

264
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,500
Okay.

265
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,650

Why did you decide to move abroad?

I really wanted a green card.

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,770
So I got married to a local Chinese.

325
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,110
Then I gave birth to Ruirui.

326
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,770

that it was not the life that I wanted.

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,830
So I got divorced.

329
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,160
You have never changed.

330
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,930
Whatever your goal is,

331
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,700
you would work towards it right away.

332
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,170
In fact, I'm very regretful

333
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,990
that I didn't choose you.

334
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,860
I'm wondering if I still have a chance

335
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,950
to make up for it.

336
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,780
Let's call it a day.

337
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,040

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,380
Outstanding locations, authentic Cantonese cuisine.

344
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,060
- Good night.
- Delicious food for you to choose from.

345
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,870
A luxurious banquet hall,

346
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,680
with large-scale electronic performance lighting and professional audio-visual equipment,

347
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,650
which makes it more magnificent and gives you a brand-new visual experience.

348
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,810
- Levend Hotel provides accommodation, catering and entertainment
- Can you turn it down?!

349
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,230
- Sorry about that!
- at one place.

350
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,840
With over 100 suites of various kinds

351
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,600
which provide comfort with exquisite decorations.

352
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,670
With—

353
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm very sorry—

354
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,860
The subscriber you dialed has activated the call forwarding service.

355
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,060
Hello, Evergreen Hotel, front desk. May I help you?

356
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,490
Hello. I'd like to speak to Anan, GM Sheng's assistant.

357
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,200
Can you patch me through?

358
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm sorry, this is not our service.

359
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,780
Well...

360
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,270
Nevermind. Thanks.

361
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,790
It's all your stupid idea. She has turned off her phone.

362
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,300
It's all my fault.

363
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,250
I'm on my way to explain to her in person, okay?

364
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,670
No need. You will book me a return ticket right now, ASAP.

365
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,830
I'll tell her myself.

366
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,260
Now?

367
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,300
Do you have any idea what time it is? You'll be so tired traveling back and forth. Let me do it instead.

368
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,590
GM Sheng, you are overreacting. Maybe her phone is dead.

369
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,020
Now you can't think straight because of your feelings for her.

370
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,710
- I think—
- I'm fine being a simp!
(Simp is a slang insult for men who are seen as too attentive and submissive to women)

371
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,910
The type beyond salvation.

372
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,390
Fine. I'll book the flight right now.

373
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,880
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to be your sister!

374
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,760
What I did isn't obvious enough? I like you!

375
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,180
I want to be your girlfriend!

376
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,090
I can't have a girlfriend.

377
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,600
You and I won't work.

378
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,750
Can't you spare some more time?

379
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,760
Please bring my apologies to the teacher.

380
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,850
Looking at you right now,

381
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,600
seems like I have no chance at all.

382
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,730
Coming back this time, I was planning to be with you.

383
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,490
Sorry.

384
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,930
For the first time, I know I stand no chance. My blessings to the both of you.

385
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,480
Thanks.

386
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,880
The flight is at 11:30.

387
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,060
It is now 10:00. It takes at least an hour to the airport. You better hurry up.

388
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,130
Okay. Got it.

389
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,270
Sorry! Please wait. Hurry up.

390
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,170
One moment, okay?

391
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,230
Wait, I'll call you back later.

392
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,380
Could you run it a few more times?

393
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,070
Miss, we've run it over 20 times.

394
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,740
That's a lot. It's the end of our shift.

395
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,720
Five times. The last five.

396
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,010
Very well, Miss.

397
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,060
Mr. Sheng Zhening.

398
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,300
Your girlfriend is waiting for you at the front desk.

399
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,490
Please come to the front desk upon hearing this.

400
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,630
Mr. Sheng Zhening.

401
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,920
Your girlfriend is waiting for you at the front desk.

402
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,510
Please come to the front desk upon hearing this.

403
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,780
Mr. Sheng Zhening.

404
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,350
Your girlfriend is waiting for you at the front desk.

405
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,870
Please come to the front desk upon hearing this.

406
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,880
- Mr. Sheng—
- You are looking for me?

407
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,900
Why are you here?

408
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:40,270
♫ Teach me to be honest to this world and myself ♫

409
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,490
♫  Having each a simple day in our hands  ♫

410
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,480
I asked, "Why are you here?"

411
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,130
It's because...

412
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,020
♫  If you were not so persistent  ♫

413
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,200
You heard.

414
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,430
I made it very clear in the announcement.

415
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,930
I like you.

416
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,520
I just want to be your girlfriend.

417
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,000
But it's fine.

418
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,720
Anyway, I've said it out loud.

419
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,360
No matter whether you like me or not, I'm already—

420
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,060
♫  Love needs to be warmed up slowly, walking slowly  ♫

421
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,010
♫  Warm up slowly, from ordinary to impressive  ♫

422
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,680
♫  Slowly, we become more similar  ♫

423
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,760
♫  Our hearts are transparent  ♫

424
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,730
♫  Love needs to be warmed up slowly  ♫

425
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,780
♫  as we understand each other  ♫

426
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,710
♫  Slowly, I've found my angel  ♫

427
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,450
♫  Even if the shiny were wrinkled  ♫

428
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:52,000
♫  It is still happiness accumulated in life  ♫

429
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,080
♫ Up where the hot air balloon is closest to the sky ♫

430
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,860
♫ I have made a wish to the cloud ♫

431
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,800
♫ So the rain in which we got drenched later on ♫

432
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:12,390
♫ Was from my loud "I love you" ♫

433
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,350
♫  Love needs to be warmed up slowly  ♫

434
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,340
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

435
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,640
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

436
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,050
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

437
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:42,260
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

438
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,470
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

439
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,730
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

440
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,300
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

441
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,070
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

442
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,110
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

443
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,700
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

444
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,650
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

445
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,790
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

446
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,500
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

447
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,840
♫ I am here anyway ♫

448
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,730
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

449
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,850
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

450
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,310
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

451
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:41,480
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

452
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,610
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

453
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,610
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

454
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,920
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

455
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,380
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

456
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,490
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

457
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,800
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

458
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,080
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

459
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,530
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

460
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,390
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

462
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,030
