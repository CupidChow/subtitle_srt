All right.

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,100
Let's call it a day. It's time for bed.

5
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,100
You go in first.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,100
You go first.

7
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,800
Why?

8
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,970
I want to see you walk into the room.

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
So do I.

10
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,400
Then... rock-paper-scissors?

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
Sure.

12
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,200
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
One more game.

14

Or...

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
one more kiss?

Nope.

I'll make breakfast tomorrow. What do you want to eat?

20
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Maybe a sandwich?

21
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,980
Don't bother too much. Anything will be fine.

22

Hello?

25
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,600
Bring the tableware and kitchenware to me first thing in the morning.

26
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
That's a lot of food! Is this what you call "anything"?

27
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
I made everything I could. I accidentally made a bit too much.

28
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,300
Let's eat. Don't wait until it's cold.

29
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
What happened to the bowl?

30
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
This is not the bowl that I used to have.

31
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
I changed all the bowls.

32
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Not just the bowls. Plates, chopsticks,

33
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
knives, chopping board, frying pan.

34
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
By the way,

35
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,300
I changed your old sanitizer box to a sanitizing dishwasher.

36
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,700
Why?

37
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,400
It's awkward to use.

38
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
A sanitizing dishwasher

39
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
can effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria.

40
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
There's nothing like "the growth of bacteria."

41
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,700
It's because of your habit.

42
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
The table.

43
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
And the chairs.

44
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
You can't change them.

What happened?

48

Nothing serious.

49
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,700
I put them on the edge of the table and dropped them. I'll go and get something to sweep it up.

Hey, be careful.

But I just came back from abroad.

There was a mouse here. It ran away.

you're really not going to visit the cat again?

100
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,490
It will be inconvenient.

How about this?

102
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,640

install a camera at home.

104
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,340
You can see the cat anytime you want,

No, that's fine. My husband doesn't like being disturbed at work.

I'll wait for him in his office.

Dr. He and his wife are such a loving couple!

She brings cake and meals for him every day,

118
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,240
and I heard she drives him to and from work in a sports car!

You don't understand.

120

She's spying on him in disguise.

121
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,620
I heard that Xiaotong is being transferred away

122
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,490
just because she was sitting next to Dr. He to discuss work.

123
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,150
And his wife saw it.

124
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,790
Let me tell you...

125
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,070
The president transferred her away in person.

126
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,700
Obviously, Mrs. He is very close to the president.

127
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,990
When you're with Dr. He,

128
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,640
you should be careful how you speak and behave at work.

129
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,070
That's crazy!

130
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,550
She even came to the hospital to spy on her husband!

131
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,010
How can Dr. He possibly bear with it?

132
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,300
She's the young lady of Evergreen. Is there anything she can't control?

133
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,340
Dr. He, when did you get here?

134
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,760
These are the meeting notes. Transcribe them.

135

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,580
Yes. Just I moment! I'll be right there!

He's gotten used to it over the years. It's normal he can't change it.

154
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,330
If you confront him like that,

155
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,890
it will easily hurt his feelings.

156
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,540
More likely, it will hurt your relationship, too.

157
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,800
All of them.

158
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,080
These are all great places.

159
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,880
But I've got too much work these days.

160
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,940
I really don't have time for a vacation.

161
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,360
About the travel,

162
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,040
we can discuss it later.

163
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,590
Don't worry about work.

164
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,590
I've finished the report sheets.

165
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,600
I've also sent them to the client and gotten their approval.

166
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,740
They will transfer the final payments tomorrow.

167

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,900
I...

171
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,290
I want to go to a theme park.

172
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,260
A theme park?

173
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,570
There's a theme park nearby.

174
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,710
I really want to go.

175
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,260
Sure.

176
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,140
Tomorrow, we can go to the theme park.

177
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,180
Tomorrow?

178
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,740
Wait a moment.

179
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,210
It's peak season now.

180
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,770
The ticket is 30% more expensive than the regular season.

181
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,320
And there will be too many people. Even if we go,

182
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,520
we can't get on many of the attractions.

183
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,240
It's not a good time. We can wait until a later time.

184
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,350
Okay.

185
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,630
Hubby, you're home!

186
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,380
Hubby, I've prepared a lot of your favorite fruit. Eat some fruit.

187
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,850
No, I'm good.

188
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,800
Eat some fruit.

189
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,170
Mengmeng.

190
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,820
Have a seat. I want to have a chat with you.

191
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,100
What is it?

192
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,430
Well...

193
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,270
I don't like it when you go to the hospital too often.

194
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,410
I think it's my workplace,

195
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,850
and I don't want my colleagues to think that I can't balance work and my personal life.

196
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,310
I just want to take care of you. What's wrong with that?

197
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,020
Nothing.

198
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,410
Mengmeng, you're not wrong.

199
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,860
It's just that...

200
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,530
Every day, you bring food for me

201
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,480
and cakes for the nurses. It will impact our work relationship.

202
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,100
By the way, you sent flowers to my office the other day.

203
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,440
You know, if a patient is allergic to flowers

204
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,670
or has negative emotional reactions toward flowers,

205
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,160
then I am neglecting my duty as a doctor.

206
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,270
I'm sorry. I really hadn't thought of that.

207
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,400
Mengmeng, I know.

208
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,250
If you want me to spend time with you,

209
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,010
I can get off work earlier.

210
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,480
I can pick you up from your bakery.

211
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,490
And then we can go out for dinner.

212
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,520
Or we can buy some food and cook at home.

213
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,660
We can go to the movies, go shopping,

214
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,620
anything you like.

215
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,710
Hubby, do you not love me anymore?

216
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,260
Of course, I do.

217
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,620
- Then, do you find me annoying?
- Mengmeng.

218
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,910
Then, why are you finding so many excuses to prevent me from visiting you at the hospital?

219
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,780
Are you in love with someone else?

220
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,500
Is it Xiaotong, the good-looking nurse?

221
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,800
It has nothing to do with Xiaotong.

222
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,280
A new nurse?

223
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,480
Mengmeng, stop talking nonsense. Okay?

224
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,720
Why do you always think of others as your imaginary enemy?

225
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,640
I told you we are just colleagues. Don't overthink it.

226
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,790
When I first brought food for you,

227
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,920
I really just wanted to bring you food.

228
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,200
But when I saw the nurses

229
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,140
spending more time with you than I do every day,

230
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,020
I became worried.

231
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm worried that they'll take you away from me.

232
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,400
Mengmeng.

233
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,950
Mengmeng, I'm not an object.

234
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,280
People can't just take me away.

235
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,930
I love you, and I'll always be with you.

236
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,550
Nobody can take me away from you.

237
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,310
- But I'm just...
- There's no "but".

238
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,770
Mengmeng.

239
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,900
Xiaotong was transferred away. Is it because you said something?

240
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,040
I didn't do anything!

241
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,160
I really didn't ask the president to transfer her away.

242
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,530
Mengmeng,

243
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,170
how did you know that it was the president of the hospital that transferred her?

244
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,450
Because he did come to my bakery,

245
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,130
and it's true that I told him

246
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,560
that I think Xiaotong likes you.

247
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,950
But I really didn't ask him to transfer her away.

248
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,470
I believe in you.

249
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,590
But I'm worried that my colleagues at the hospital will think otherwise.

250
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,460
How about this, Mengmeng?

251
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,130
You can come to the hospital with me tomorrow.

252
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,520
Okay.

253
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,520
You want more?

254
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,260
Stop drinking. You don't have a high alcohol tolerance.

255
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,250
It's all your fault! You helped Sheng Zhening steal my girlfriend!

256
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,370
Give me back my girlfriend!

257
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,570
Give me back my girlfriend! Give me back Qianqian!

258
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,540
Where am I supposed to get a girlfriend for you?

259
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,120
Hey.

260
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,790
Hey!

261
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,890
Hey! Wake up!

262
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,530
Hey!

263
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,060
[23:34]

264
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,710
The surveillance camera is has been installed.

265
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,720
You can watch the livestream video at TP-LINK.

266
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,130
I'm watching the cat, not its owner.

267
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,520
You're awake?

268
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Why are you at my place?

269
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
This is my place.

270
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,920
Why am I at your place?

271
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,220
Where are my clothes?

272
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,450
I washed them.

273
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,390
You were drunk yesterday and threw up all over yourself.

274
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,170
I can't just leave you lying on the street.

275
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,160
Now, get changed

276
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,240
and come out for breakfast. I need to go to work soon.

277
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,890
Have some breakfast.

278
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,630
Okay.

279
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,030
- Have some milk. It will make your stomach feel better.
- Thank you.

280
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,060
Your clothes are hanging on the balcony. You can take them back when they're dry.

281
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,250
Okay. Thanks.

282
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,380
What happened to your neck?

283
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,530
Someone was drunk yesterday,

284
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,050
grabbed my collar and wouldn't let go,

285
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,980
crying, yelling, and asking me to get him a girlfriend.

286
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,920
I was drunk.

287
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,780
I'm sorry.

288
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,370
It's okay.

289
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,460
I've finished the book. You can have it.

290
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,800
I don't need it anymore.

291
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,320
All right.

292
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,270
If you ever get your eyes on a girl, let me know.

293
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,870
I'll help you pursue her.

294
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,560
You'll help me pursue girls?

295
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,900
What's wrong with that?

296
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,500
I've got much more advanced dating skills than you.

297
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,280
I've read 36 books on the tactics of love.

298
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,530
Why would I need your help to pursue a girl?

299
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,060
When GM Sheng was pursuing Xia Qian, I read at least three relationship books every day.

300
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,600
Now I have read at least 180 books on that topic.

301
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,090
That's called a last-minute effort.

302
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,850
Better than nothing.

303
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,310
You...

304
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,160
Auntie.

305
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,060
Hi.

306
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,760
Xia Qian asked me to bring these rheumatism patches for you.

307
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,660
- Put them over there.
- Okay.

308
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,560
Have a seat.

309
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,060
All right.

310
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,960
You don't have to do it. I'll deal with it later.

311
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,050
It's okay.

312
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,790
Feel free to drink whatever you want!

313
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,230
All right.

314
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,060
Sister!

315
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,280
Are you busy?

316
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,780
Hey! We've got a rare visitor! What brings you here?

317
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,440
I miss you, of course!

318
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,260
You're so busy!

319
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,920
Hey, you're here.

320
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,580
I have a piece of good news for you.

321
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,530
My daughter Tingting is getting married!

322
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,180
That's good news! Congratulations!

323
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,650
Thank you!

324
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,170
Still the same guy from college?

325
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,420
She broke up with that poor guy a long time ago!

326
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,230
Tingting's boyfriend now

327
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,980
works as a senior manager in his company.

328
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,150
He's got an apartment and a car in this city. There's no need

329
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,710
for me to worry about Tingting anymore!

330
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,540
Great, that's good news.

331
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,930
Is Qianqian going to

332
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,560
just marry her assistant?

333
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,420
Xiao Sheng is a nice guy.

334
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,280
What's nice about him? Sister,

335
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,860
as the saying goes, ”A man struggles upwards; water flows downwards."

336
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,000
Qianqian shouldn't just

337
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,770
get an assistant as her boyfriend.

338
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,170
Xia Qian doesn't have to marry a rich guy.

339
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,520
As long as she's safe and sound, that's all that matters.

340
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,830
Everything will go wrong for the poor couple.

341
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,220
Sister, you'll know it later.

342
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,800
I'll be on my way.

343
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,910
- You're welcome to visit any time.
- By the way, Sister.

344
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,670
I'll bring Tingting and her boyfriend here to dinner tonight.

345
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,310
Just make a few simple dishes! It doesn't have to be fancy.

346
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,880
That way you can meet my son-in-law, too.

347
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,140
Okay, okay. Take care!

348
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,600
Okay!

349
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,520
You don't have to move them...

350
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,570
Hey, Auntie, are you all right?

351
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,760
I might have been standing for too long. It's nothing serious.

352
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,430
How about we go out for dinner, so you don't have to cook?

353
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,260
Okay.

354
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,110
That's right.

355
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,430
Wow!

356
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,150
What a nice hotel!

357
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,200
Why didn't you have your wedding here?

358
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,560
Mom, do you know how much it costs to have a wedding at Evergreen?

359
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Let me put it this way. You can't get it scheduled even if you have money for it. They're fully booked until next year.

360
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,900
Wow. Their boss must make a lot of money every month.

361
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,620
It's just a random dinner.

362
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,580
Why do we have to do it at Evergreen?

363
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,970
I'm more familiar with the restaurant here.

364
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,570
You could have just made a few simple dishes at home.

365
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,330
Why make it so fancy?

366
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,420
Young people these days have no idea how to save money.

367
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,340
You're right, Auntie.

368
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,100
We are lavish indeed.

369
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,460
Since you care about us so much,

370
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,500
why don't you ask my cousin to pay for this dinner?

371
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,290
Look at her.

372
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,710
How could the host ask the guest to pay?

373
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,420
Xia Qian.

374
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,540
Go ahead. Eat some food.

375
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,280
- All your dishes are served. Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

376
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,740
Why did you order so much food?

377
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,100
Xiao Wei!

378
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,490
Yes, Manager.

379
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,250
I heard that GM Sheng is having dinner in the room.

380
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,010
Yes, I saw him having dinner inside.

381
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,700
Are you sure it's him?

382
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,600
It's definitely him.

383
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,020
Who are these guests?

384
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,260
I have no idea.

385
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,500
But since they're having dinner with GM Sheng, they must be important guests.

386
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,470
You can go back to work.

387
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,260
Xiao Sheng, forgive me if I'm too direct.

388
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,350
Don't take any offense.

389
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,880
I think a man

390
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,860
should be ambitious.

391
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,370
If you're always working as an assistant in Qianqian's company,

392
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,050
that's far from good enough.

393
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,270
Xiao Chen, is your company still hiring?

394
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,920
Maybe you can refer him.

395
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,980
I don't know which university you graduated from,

396
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,030
but our company only hires graduates of 985 and 211 universities.

397
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,990
Don't bother.

398
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,600
It's no bother at all! We're all family here.

399
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,230
Well, Xiao Sheng, which university did you graduate from?

400
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,850
I studied abroad.

401
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,250
Oh, you studied abroad!

402
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,360
I heard that overseas universities are designed for Chinese students.

403
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,740
Well... I heard the diploma

404
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,460
is not as good as a second-tier university in China, right?

405
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,360
Auntie, actually, he's...

406
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,080
Can we just eat?

407
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,100
Sister, I'm just asking.

408
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,570
There's a lot of delicious food. Just eat.

409
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,590
Excuse me.

410
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,970
That's not necessary.

411
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,900
It's just a family get-together. We don't need to drink.

412
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,410
This is specially prepared for GM Sheng and his distinguished guests.

413
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,820
- GM Sheng.
- GM Sheng?

414
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,040
How do you like it?

415
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,470
Okay.

416
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,220
He's GM Sheng. Who exactly is he?

417
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,140
Sister!

418
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,430
You're very lucky indeed.

419
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,690
You've found such a good son-in-law!

420
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,560
Xiao Sheng, Qianqian's cousin

421
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,380
has been looking for a new job.

422
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,520
Is there any manager role at Evergreen

423
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,360
that you can possibly refer to her?

424
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,650
Xiao Sheng has resigned from Evergreen.

425
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,500
He's now Xia Qian's assistant.

426
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,260
I think I've had enough. Let's go. I don't want to miss the bus.

427
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,460
Auntie, I’ll take you home.

428
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,500
Hey, Sister. Are you leaving so soon?

429
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,740
You can stay here and eat if you want.

430
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,710
Let's go. We're full.

431
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,250
Let's go.

432
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,390
Sure, sure.

433
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,220
This car looks nice.

434
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,500
Where's your car?

435
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,890
Over there. There.

436
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,280
Auntie, I'll drive you home.

437
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,780
We can give you a lift.

438
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,800
No, we're fine.

439
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,010
- Get in the car!
- Get in please.

440
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,870
Excuse me.

441
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,830
Auntie, I'll drive you home.

442
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,440
Go ahead.

443
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,770
All right.

444
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,930
All right. I'll be on my way then.

445
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,390
Take care, Sister!

446
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,750
I'll do it myself.

447
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,830
I'll be leaving, too.

448
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,110
- Take care, Qianqian.
- I will. See you next time.

449
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,140
You don't have to.

450
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,510
I'll open the door myself. You can drive.

451
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,060
Hey, Xiao Sheng.

452
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,310
Let's keep in touch!

453
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,670
Mom.

454
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Mom, don't work anymore when you get home.

455
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,100
- Okay.
- Rest well.

456
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,000
Stay safe on the road.

457
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Bye. Don't stay up late.

458
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
What "stay up late"?

459
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Let's go.

460
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,300
The rented car, the dinner, the expensive tableware...

461
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Where did you get so much money?

462
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
You didn't borrow from loan sharks, did you?

463
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,100
They were a nightmare.

464
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,600
Many people took the wrong path and it cost them everything.

465
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Don't worry. I didn't borrow from loan sharks.

466
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,800
I know you used to be rich. Now you are poor.

467
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,000
You can't go extravagant all the time. We have to be thrifty.

468
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
The two of us will work hard and keep our feet on the ground.

469
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
It will get better.

470
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,200
What if I can never make money for the rest of my life?

471
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,900
So what? I'll support you.

472
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,400
Then you must support me for life.

473
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
When did you rent this car?

474
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,800
At 9:00 p.m.

475
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,700
9:00 p.m. yesterday?

476
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,780
It's 8:40 now.

477
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Drive faster!

478
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
You only have 20 more minutes. You need to hurry and give the car back.

479
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Speed up.

480
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,200
If you miss, they will charge you for another whole day.

481
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Drive faster.

482
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,600
What? Are you getting bored?

483
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Are you hungry?

484
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,200
Be good.

485
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Aren't we returning the car?

486
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,500
Is this where you return the car?

487
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,490
Let's go.

488
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,720
Where are we going?

489
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Please.

490
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Are we going in?

491
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,800
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

492
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,200
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

493
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,600
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

494
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,300
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

495
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,600
Me?

496
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,800
- Go ahead.

- How was my dancing?
- Great!

512
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,100
What's going on? Tell me the truth. Why are we here?

513
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,800
Actually, I've been looking for a chance to tell you,

514
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm not bankrupt.

515
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
What do you mean? Tell me.

516
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Back then, the renovation of Building No. 2 was all on me.

517
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,600
So it was a bit tight.

518
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,800
Later, other shareholders also gave their approval for the renovation, which was a big relief.

519
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Besides, I just got my quarterly share.

520
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
So money won't be a problem.

521
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Then, before...

522
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
Even if you are not broke,

523
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,800
why did you book the whole place? You need to spend rationally.

524
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,400
The money is already spent.

525
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Fine. It won't happen again.

526
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
Again?

527
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,600
From now on, you will control my money.

528
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,000
We are not married yet. Who wants to control your money?

529
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,800
Then... for every penny I spend, I will go through you first.

530
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,000
You will be my private bargainer.

531
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Be prepared. I'll charge you a lot.

532
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Go right ahead. I won't bargain.

533
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Promise?

534
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,100
Hurry.

535
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Let's see where else we can have fun.

536
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,300
I just realized that an amusement park is an interesting place.

537
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,000
Much more fun than taking a cruise and going to Europe.

538
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,700
That, of course, depends on who you are going with.

539
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,100
What do you mean?

540
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,800
Nothing.

541
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
There's more.

542
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,400
Let's go.
