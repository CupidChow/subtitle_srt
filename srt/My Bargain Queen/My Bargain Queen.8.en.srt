00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,690
Director Yu has always been hesitant and if he sees all these negative comments about Evergreen, he'll definitely hesitate.

4
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,360
Ask Director Xue to talk to him soon

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,720
and see if there's any possibility of transferring the shares.

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,630
Okay.

7
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,500
Anything else you need me to do on Evergreen's side?

8
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,880
No.

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,460

Hello, Mom. What's up?

12
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey, Xia Qian.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,090
You must come home for dinner tonight.

14
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,660
I've got something very important to talk to you about. Did you hear that?

15
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,400
Okay. Got it.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
I have to go.

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,510

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,110
Look at No.6. What do you think?

20
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,890
He seems a bit too old.

21
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,200
I think he's much older than Qianqian.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,090
What's wrong with that? Older men know how to take care of women.

23
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,080
But he does look a bit ugly.

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,580
First of all, you, the mother-in-law, have to be satisfied.

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,820
That will affect the genes of our grandchildren!

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,300
I'm only asking you to give suggestions.

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,970
Be aware of your role!

28
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,320
Okay, okay.

29
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,760
I'll keep that in mind.

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,210
That He Zhijuan back then, do you think that "he looks like a human but acts like a dog"?
(T/N: looks good outside but rotten inside)

31
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,630
But I didn't like him. He doesn't look like "someone who can share a pot of food with us."
(T/N: implies someone who can share everything)

32
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,990
You see what happened in the end?

33
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,890
You're very insightful indeed!

34
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,870
Of course.

35
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,970
Then... Do you think you and I can share a pot of food together?

36
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,680
Are you trying to be punished? Do you want to wash the pots?

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,040
No... Hey, I think this one's a good choice.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,990
He looks like an honest guy.

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,610
This guy... He's got a fierce look.

40
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,580
He does! Why are you staring at him?

41
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,150
When did you come back?

42
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,630
You were so quiet! We didn't hear your footsteps.

Stop eating. Stop.

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,810
Just stare at the board.

Look closely. Look harder. You will start to like them.

How often does love at first sight happen?

Mostly it happens when you look at me, and I look at you,

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,720
we keep looking at each other

Fine. You don't have to look at them then.

I just want to have some homemade food.

I don't get to come home that often,

78

can I just have some quiet time to myself?

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,250
Nobody is stopping you from eating homemade dishes.

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,260
Well, the key is...

81
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,620
that we don't blind date like this anymore.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,270
Listening to recordings

83
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,000
or seeing pictures, these are outdated.

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,880
We use dating apps and dating platforms.

Don't worry. I know how to do it. Don't worry.

86
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,340
Then just show me your phone.

87
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,950
Let me see if there's an app, and if there's anyone suitable in the app.

She's got such a bad temper!

94
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,470
Are these men we picked not good enough?

Why did you take out all this stuff?

99
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,490
What's wrong with that? Is there anything I can't see?

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,400
No. Just look at it if you want.

101
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,240
Look at that, Hubby! You looked so silly and cute back then.

102
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,240
Mengmeng. Don't look at this.

103

What happened in the past is the past.

112
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
Don't think too much.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,620
I know that you must feel uneasy about it,

114
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,310
at the moment of our wedding,

115
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,540
you found out what happened between Xia Qian and me,

116
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,010
so you couldn't accept it.

117
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,480
Actually, I should have told you earlier.

118
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,840
But I was afraid that you would overthink it.

119
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,670
There's nothing between Xia Qian and me now.

120
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,130
But our wedding was interrupted.

121
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,430
And we didn't have a chance to finish our vows that day.

122
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,770
I think our wedding was incomplete

123
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,550
and imperfect.

124
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,600
That's not true.

125
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,190
At our wedding,

126
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,640
we had the blessings from family,

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,800
and the most beautiful bride. It is the most perfect wedding.

128
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Right.

129
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,500
You promised me that

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,350
you'll never overthink it again,

131
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,920
and we'll live a positive and happy life.

We're hoping to negotiate with the couple on behalf of Evergreen.

134
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,690
See if there's any solution.

135
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,560
This all happened because we accepted the order.

136
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,040
We should be taking some responsibility.

137
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,600
If we had been more careful and cautious with it,

138
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,340
maybe this would not have happened.

139
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,430
They just want to get back at Evergreen, and at me.

140
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,230
If this did not happen,

141
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,030
they would find other opportunities.

142
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,740
They?

143
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,750
It was more complicated than I thought.

144
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,670
Are you sure you want to get involved?

145
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,120
What else should I do?

146
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,730
In order to get good sleep,

147
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,550
I have to sort it through.

Financial planner, 34 years old.

149
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,000
This one looks handsome!

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Next one.

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,770
This Xiao Liu is good!

152
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey.

153
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,550
You're back.

154
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,060
Why are you back so late?

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,250
Is your leg better?

156
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,130
You're not here to pressure me again, are you?

157
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,110
Oh, no. I'm really not here to pressure you today.

158
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,670
I just wanted to send some food over to you.

159
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,290
Okay, since you're back, I'll leave.

160
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,850
Don't leave.

161
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,550
Sit here.

162
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,570
Thanks, Mom.

163
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,320
- You are my good mom as long as you don't pressure me to get married.
- You...

164
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't leave tonight. Just sleep here with me.

165
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,830
That's unusual. Something happened?

166
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,580
Nothing happened!

167
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,340
I haven't been sleeping well these days.

168
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,620
I'd get some good sleep if you were by my side.

169
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, I'll stay. But you have to promise me

170
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,980
that I will have my own room. When you sleep,

171
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,810
you move a lot as if you're doing Kung Fu.

172
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,280
You go to bed vertically but wake up horizontally, and vice versa!

173
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
If men know about it,

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,890
who would be willing to marry you?

175
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,340
And what's scarier is that when it's midnight, you—

176
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,510
Hey!

177
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,190
I've told you many times!

178
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,250
You can talk about anything else, except for this.

179
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,780
Fine. I know.

180
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,550
You should get your troubled self married as soon as possible!

181
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,940
Again?

182
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,100
Okay, I'll shut up.

183
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,040
What is that?

184
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,860
I've thought it through. It's so hard to marry a good man these days.

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,740
Let's just have a guy marry into our family,

186
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,790
so I don't have to worry.

187
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,400
The main point is, I've picked the guy for you.

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,240
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,090
The reputation of Evergreen is damaged.

190
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm bankrupt. I have a bunch of debts.

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,820
Aunt Dou promised me that

192
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,310
as long as I marry you and take your surname, she will help me with the debt.

193
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,850
What do you think of your mother's taste?

194
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,340
Look at his body. Look at his face.

195
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,930
If Evergreen didn't close down, you couldn't take this advantage.

196
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,440
Xiao Sheng, I don't have other requirements for you.

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,170
Just have two kids in three years. Can you do that?

198
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,470
I will try my best.

199
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,850
Louder!

200
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,480
I will try my best!

201
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,290
That's good.

202
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,870
Let's not wait.

203
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,530
How about this? You two get married tomorrow.

204
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,750
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

205
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,930
That's right. I had nightmares for the entire night.

206
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,750
You kept yelling "Sheng... Sheng..." Sheng something-Ning.

207
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,700
Sheng... Sheng what Ning?

208
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,760
Sheng Zhening?

209
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,660
That's right! That's the one!

210
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,990
Why was I calling him?

211
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,860
You were saying something about, "I'm not having your baby!"

212
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,620
Who is Sheng Zhening?

213
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,250
- He's so handsome.
- Really?

214
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,480
And he's nice.

215
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,480
Mom, I read a novel recently.

216
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,900
Sheng Zhening is the main character.

217
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,870
I like him so much.

218
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,670
I had a dream about marrying him last night.

219
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,770
Is there anything wrong with your brain?

220
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,910
Why are you dreaming about that nonsense? Can a fictional character marry you or have a baby with you?

221
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,620
How was that nonsense? Can't I have a dream?

222
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,560
Just eat.

223
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,880
[Sheng Zhening]

224
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,240
Who's that?

225
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,010
A female friend.

226
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,090
Hello?

227
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,320
Hey, I'm downstairs. Come on down.

228
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,330
Wait.

229
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,800
What are you doing here?

230
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,710
There's really no need. I can go there by myself.

231
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,050
It's fine. It's on the way.

232
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,570
Is it?

233
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,250
Okay. Thank you.

234
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,570
Who was that?

235
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,900
A client.

236
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,310
We have great conversations. A new female friend I made.

237
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,790
Have great conversations... a client...

238
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,270
A guy or a girl?

239
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,180
A female friend!

240
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,650
You are so nosy.

241
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,850
I'm going. She's waiting for me.

242
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,080
Are you done eating already?

243
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,650
I will eat with my female friend.

244
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,010
Okay, can you clean up?

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,980
Hello.

246
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,500
Let's go.

247
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,440
You are driving me?

248
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,060
Get in.

249
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,560
[Mom]

250
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,530
What's up, Mom?

251
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,810
Let me ask you. Do you have a boyfriend?

252
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,920
Why are you doing this again?

253
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,310
Where do I find a boyfriend?

254
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,180
What are you talking about? I saw everything.

255
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,210
And you are still lying saying he's a female client.

256
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,590
Was that him? How long have you known each other?

257
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,390
When are you bringing him home to meet your mother?

258
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,260
Hey, I'm outside.

259
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,360
I will talk to you when I get back tonight.

260
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,460
No, no, no! You have to explain yourself right now.

261
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,170
You were screaming a name last night. Sheng... something-Ning.

262
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,920
Was that him? And you were talking about not having his babies.

263
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,180
Don't tell me you are pregnant.

264
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,360
Hello? Hello?

265
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,070
- Hello?
- What's going on? Why is the reception so bad?

266
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,200
Hello? What's going on?

267
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,450
Hey! And she hung up on me!

268
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,520
Maybe I've been using this phone for too long.

269
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,450
It's been having problems. I ought to get a new one.

270
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,600
Is your mother upset?

271
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,460
No, she's not.

272
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,460
She's like that, easily gets excited.

273
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,830
She's always suspecting something. It's fine.

274
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,150
Are you not sleeping well these days?

275
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,040
I am.

276
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm just weird like that.

277
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,410
I always sleep well and never have dreams.

278
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,810
Oh.

279
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,390
Han Chao's car is already here.

280
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,200
I think he must be inside.

281
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,630
Let's go.

282
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,670
Han Chao has been avoiding people. I've heard that

283
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,280
he has a special relationship with this tea house.

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
He saves good tea for them.

285
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,220
Every month this time, he comes here to meet friends and drink tea.

286
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,420
He doesn't bring his wife here?

287
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,960
Seems like you are a clingy type, Miss Xia.

288
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,190
You would still hang out with your husband after getting married.

289
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,450
Besides working hours, couples with a good relationship

290
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,220
will keep a bit of personal space for each other,

291
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,960
and for the remaining time, of course they will hang out with each other.

292
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,820
You do think a lot. Seems like you have planned it out.

293
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,070
Is it not good?

294
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,550
Is Mr. Han Chao here yet?

295
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,320
Mr. Han isn't meeting anyone today, is he?

296
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,710
We made the appointment last minute. How about this?

297
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,510
We will talk to him after he's done.

298
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,870
Get us a private room and bring your best tea.

299
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,700
We will drink tea as we wait.

300
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,690
Let's go.

301
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,590
Please, come with me.

302
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,070
Let go.

303
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,760
Work with me. Don't mess this up.

304
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,150
Careful with the stairs.

305
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,770
This way, please.

306
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,290
This one is nice. What do you think?

307
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,720
The room facing south has a lot of sunlight and the view is not bad.

308
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,200
Honey,

309
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,910
I don't like other rooms. I just want this one, okay?

310
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,510
Whatever you say, goes.

311
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,100
This one.

312
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,370
Please settle in. I will bring the tea.

313
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,240
If you hold me this tight or get this close to me again...

314
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,580
you better watch out.

315
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,180
I didn't expect you that you could pretend to be girly.

316
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,000
You should be this adorable more often.

317
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
It's for work.

318
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
What else could I do? Also, I'm always adorable.

319
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Stop mentioning things like this from now on.

320
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,070
Don't you think the greeter's attitude was very strange?

321
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,300
He made it sound like Han Chao is doing something despicable here.

322
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,600
I just saw a woman in the room next door.

323
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,100
She doesn't look like Mrs. Han.

324
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,800
She can't be.

325
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
- They sound happy.
- When I go to this kind of place later, I'll bring you.

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
It sounds like only two people.

327
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,910
Isn't it supposed to be a gathering for a group of friends?

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Interesting.

329
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,300
Sorry for not knocking.

330
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
So sorry for disturbing you.

331
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Let's go.

332
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
My purse.

333
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
No need to walk me out. I will come when I'm free.

334
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,800
But I don't want you to leave.

335
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Be good. I will come to you whenever I'm free.

336
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,500
Hug-hug.

337
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,500
Jerk.

338
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Boss Lady, there was a couple just now looking for Mr. Han.

339
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Who are they?

340
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,300
They are in this room.

341
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I have to go.

342
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you still mad?

343
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,380
Stop the car. I need to get off and calm myself.

344
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Why do you get so upset with other people's business?

345
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
He's such a jerk!

346
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Stop being angry, okay?

347
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
How's this? I will take you to eat something nice.

348
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
What do you say?

349
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
After seeing what happened and people like him,

350
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
how can you not be mad?

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
For what?

352
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,900
Stop the car.

353
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm worried that you will do something stupid.

354
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Are you worried that I will go back and beat him up?

355
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm worried about you telling this to his wife.

356
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Shouldn't I though?

357
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
I was cheated on for many years and thought I was happy.

358
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,300
I was enjoying it like a fool. How was that good?

359
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
I understand how you feel,

360
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,400
but it's other people's business. You need to separate them.

361
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Also, based on our relationship with Mrs. Han, it's not appropriate

362
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
for us to tell her. Isn't that so?

363
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Okay, I got it.

364
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
Or else, I wouldn't be this irritated.

365
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,100
I'm going to a meeting. I'll have Anan drive you home later.

366
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,000
It's okay. I will call a taxi.

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,100
I think I left my phone in your car.

368
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,600
- Give me your car key.
- Okay.

369
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,400
Just give it back to Anan after getting your phone.

370
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
Go ahead.

371
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
GM Sheng.

372
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,300
Mr. Han.

373
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,200
I couldn't find you the whole day and didn't expect you would show up here.

374
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
Are you here to eat?

375
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
You don't know why I'm here, do you?

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
Let's talk.

377
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Oh, right.

378
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
We haven't talked about how you vilified Evergreen.

379
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you about to apologize to Evergreen

380
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,000
or are you planning on telling me who asked you to do this?

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,200
I came here to make a deal with you.

382
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,400
We don't even trust each other. Why would I want to make a deal with you?

383
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Control yourself.

384
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,700
As long as you don't tell my wife what you saw today,

385
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,400
I will withdraw the lawsuit against Evergreen.

386
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I was wondering what the deal could be.

387
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,400
I didn't think you would be worried about being discovered for cheating.

388
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Isn't that tiresome?

389
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,800
Every man makes this mistake.

390
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Also, I always go home after playing around. Nevertheless, my love is real.

391
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,600
So,

392
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
you wouldn't do your worst.

393
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
I believe that you misunderstood me.

394
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm not interested in your family business at all.

395
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
I wouldn't be the person who stabs you in the back either,

396
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,000
or holds nasty secrets like these as bargaining chips.

397
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,100
But you vilified Evergreen,

398
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,000
I will get back at you in other ways and you will be convinced.

399
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,400
Sheng Zhening, are you trying to be noble here?

400
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Based on what I know, Evergreen is a mess right now.

401
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,000
I wonder how long you will last.

402
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
For this,

403
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,800
you don't need to worry about. You know so well about Evergreen,

404
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,100
it seems like the people supporting you aren't far from me.

405
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Right, another thing,

406
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,100
I need to correct you. Not every man likes to cheat.

407
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
GM Sheng.

408
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,800
Your key.

409
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Girl, eavesdropping is not good.

410
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,500
GM Sheng was making a lot of sense, I was just learning.

411
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,200
The way you are looking at me is not very appropriate.

412
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,200
This is how I look at everyone. You are overthinking.

413
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm so tired.

414
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I told you not to go, but you just had to.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
That's right. Did you achieve anything?

416
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,900
Han Chao is a jerk!

417
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,200
He's messing around with another woman behind his wife's back.

418
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
They haven't been married for that long. Does his wife know?

419
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
She definitely doesn't. It was so hard for me to keep the secret, Shuangshuang.

420
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
I really wanted to run to Yan Caiting and tell her

421
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,600
to wake up, her husband is cheating on her.

422
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,300
Calm down first. Don't be so riled up.

423
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,380
Did you want someone to tell you the truth back then?

424
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Someone could have reminded me in a gentle way

425
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,000
or just told me directly. I could have accepted them all.

426
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,800
So I didn't have to be in such a shock when I found out.

427
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,900
Sister Qian, I understand you. It's okay.

428
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,200
- It's good.
- Love is so complicated.

429
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

430
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,600
- I've made an appointment. This is my trial coupon.
- Sure.

431
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,500
Please wait, I'll register for you.

432
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,200
Please wait, Ms. Yan. Your massage therapist is getting ready.

433
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
Thank you.

434
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Yan...

435
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
This way, please.

436
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
Miss Xia!

437
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Ms. Yan?

438
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Right, I should call you Mrs. Han.

439
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Call me whatever you like.

440
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
What are you doing here?

441
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Our company got a group buying project. I'm here to help my client try it out.

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,700
Your work seems fun.

443
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,400
Hello, could you put us in the same room?

444
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Sure.

445
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,100
Is that okay?

446
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,000
Of course, so we can talk.

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

448
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,900
This way, please.

449
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,300
Thank you.

450
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
It's so comfortable.

451
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Mrs. Han.

452
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,900
Your skin is so nice.

453
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,200
It looks like getting treatments here does work.

454
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You were born with good skin, Miss Xia.

455
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Unlike us, we have to spend so much time on maintaining it.

456
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
That's not true.

457
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,400
You have someone who loves you.

458
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,100
You radiate from within, which is better.

459
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,200
Right!

460
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,400
How is it going with you and GM Sheng?

461
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Who?

462
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
You and GM Sheng.

463
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,200
He and I?

464
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We are not an item.

465
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,200
We are like "frienemies."

466
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,400
I think the two of you are cute. You guys would make a good couple.

467
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,000
How's Mr. Han?

468
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
How is he doing lately?

469
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,000
Have you seen the video online? It's between men.

470
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Just let them handle it themselves.

471
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,200
You misunderstand me. I'm not trying to help him in any way.

472
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
I just want to ask...

473
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,200
Is everything going well with your marriage?

474
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,200
Miss Xia, what you are saying is kind of strange.

475
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,700
Don't you find it impolite?

476
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,200
Mrs. Han, I...

477
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

478
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I was being impolite.

479
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Sorry for offending you.

480
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,300
I need to go. Get some good rest here.

481
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
Bye.

482
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,400
See you next time.

483
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,850
Someone from work.

484
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,950
I met Xia Qian today. Do you remember her?

485
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,240
- The one who negotiated our wedding date?
- Yeah.

486
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,460
I thought she was there for Evergreen.

487
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,920
But it was just a coincidence.

488
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,140
Regarding this matter, you should not worry about it.

489
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,860
Just leave it to me.

490
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,350
I'll use the restroom.

491
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,670
Hello, Ms. Yan?

492
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,740
Help me check on someone.

493
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,230
Hello, Ma'am. Would you like some tea?

494
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,490
This place was rented not long ago, right?

495
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,820
Han is always stingy.

496
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,150
Don't you think being with him is a rip-off?

497
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,290
I'm not planning on being with him for my whole life.

498
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,660
As long as we're happy now, I'm okay.

499
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,250
Well, he's obviously got a lot of experience.

500
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,670
He always chooses girls like you,

501
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,040
so he can easily get away when he's at home.

502
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,050
You're very generous indeed, Sister.

503
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,730
Knowing who he truly is, you still got married to him.

504
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,150
Well, he begged me to, crying,

505
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,170
saying that he would change. I don't know about that,

506
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,860
but he's given me everything he has. He's just having fun once in a while.

507
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,080
[A new message]

508
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,180
We took this photo when we were in the Aegean.

509
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,230
I heard that you like the Aegean a lot, too.

510
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,810
Did he take you there?

511
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,230
I don't think he will have any chance to take you on a trip anymore.

512
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,490
Sheng Zhening!

513
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,760
You said one thing and did another. You played dirty.

514
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,170
- How can you still pretend to be a gentleman, a decent man?
- What are you doing?

515
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,880
Go away.

516
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,340
Anan.

517
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,840
Mr. Han, I don't understand what you're saying.

518
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,780
You're still pretending.

519
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,620
You promised not to tell my wife. But now she knows it all.

520
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,490
Okay. Even if it wasn't you, it would have been that stupid woman by your side.

521
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,900
Watch your mouth.

522
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,120
We'll settle it all at once, the old and the new.

523
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,910
Wait for my lawyer's letter.

524
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,650
Security!

525
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,390
Send him out.

526
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,330
We'll wait and see.

527
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,130
Han always says that he is busy,

528
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,500
and he has no time to take me on trips.

529
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,960
But I didn't know until today

530
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,700
that when I was sick at home, he took some other woman to the Aegean.

531
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,950
I've said it ten million times that it was my dream.

532
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,570
But he did it with another woman.

533
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,070
Ms. Yan, I understand your feelings right now.

534
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,720
I feel that I'm just like a joke.

535
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,910
I've forgiven him again and again,

536
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,970
I thought he would have settled down with me.

537
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,340
But now I've finally seen it through.

538
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,400
If there's anything I can help you with,

539
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,360
I'll definitely try my best.

540
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,290
I think I can help you...

541
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,630
with Evergreen.

542
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,260
Really?

543
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,000
That would be great.

544
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,810
As a matter of fact, I've always been curious,

545
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,460
exactly who wants to destroy Evergreen.

546
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,770
And who is the one behind all this?

547
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,870
I remember back then,

548
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,970
a woman came to us and asked us to agree to your terms.

549
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,250
She said that if we cooperated,

550
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,960
we could get a considerable amount of reward.

551
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,890
Hello. I'm here on behalf of Lihe Capital.

552
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,470
I hope you can agree to Xia Qian's request to change the date.

553
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,930
Thank you.

554
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,640
I hope this can be a successful collaboration.

555
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,130
Who gave money to this woman?

556
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,110
Han mentioned it before.

557
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,580
I think it was...

558
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,740
Lihe Capital. I tried to persuade him.

559
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,420
I told him not to get involved.

560
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,650
But he wouldn't listen.

561
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,990
Mrs. Han,

562
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,560
I don't care why you and Mr. Han did this

563
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
or who asked you to do so.

564
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,430
If there's anything, please talk to me. It has nothing to do with her.

565
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,770
Don't get it wrong. She's here to help us.

566
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,510
I told you he cares about you. See?

567
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,070
Well, please tell Han Chao

568
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,120
that if he wants to take it to court,

569
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,460
I'll definitely be standing by Evergreen's side.

570
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,630
Understood.

571
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,800
[Worth or Not]

572
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,980
Ms. Yan just told me that

573
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,310
it was Lihe Capital behind all this.

574
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,630
Is there any enmity between Evergreen and Lihe Capital?

575
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,440
I heard people say

576
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,540
that Lihe Capital is planning on acquiring Evergreen.

577
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,330
Now, it seems that they've started their action.

578
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,470
Hey. Don't worry about it.

579
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,690
In business relationships, these are not unusual.

580
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,640
What's more, Mrs. Han has agreed to record a video statement for us. Anything else,

581
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,380
let's just leave it to Evergreen's PR Department.

582
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay.

583
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh, I almost forgot. I need to visit my mom.

584
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll drive you there.

585
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,010
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

586
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,340
It feels like you've really become my driver.

587
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,020
Let's go.

588
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,250
Here we are.

589
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,270
Thank you, GM Sheng, for driving me here.

590
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,320
You've done such a big favor for Evergreen, I should be the one saying thank you.

591
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,030
You're welcome. See you!

592
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,910
Wait. Wait.

593
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,500
Wait.

594
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,760
Since you're here,

595
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,480
why don't you have some barbecue skewers with us?
