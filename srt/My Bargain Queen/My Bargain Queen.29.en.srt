00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,110
[Episode 29]

3
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,770
- Hello?
 - Are you Qin Hebo's relative? Mr. Qin had an accident and is now at the hospital.

4
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,560
What? Was he seriously injured?

5
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,500
Are you okay?

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,630
You scared me! How did you injure your head?

7
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,310
I'm fine.

8
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,050
That's good. I was so worried.

9
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,550
But... who are you?

10
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,860
Wait. Stop making jokes at a moment like this.

11
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,970
The doctor said that I was hit hard on my head

12
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,830
and I...

13
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,090
What's happening? Does it hurt?

14
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,520
My head is hurting so much it's like it is exploding when I try to remember something.

15
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,060
Doctor! Doctor!

16
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,850
Why does it hurt so much?

17
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,620
Are you okay?

18
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,480
Are you someone important to me?

19
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,110
Are we close?

20
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,620
You really don't remember me?

21
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,870
Of course, I'm very important to you!

22
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,020
- Qin Hebo!
- You're Qin Hebo?

23
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,520
No! You're Qin Hebo. I'm Fu Shuangshuang!

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,550
You've liked me for a long time.

25
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,990
- I liked you?
- How can you...

26
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,590
Then why would I not remember you at all?

27
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,820
You can't forget about me! It's all my fault!

28
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,000
I shouldn't have hesitated all this time.

29
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,600
I actually stopped hating you a long time ago.

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,030
I just wanted to wait until you got back from your business trip to tell you

31
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,210
That I like you and I've liked you for a long time.

32
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,860
And I can't stop loving you, I can't control my feelings for you.

33
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,070
Please don't forget about me, okay?

34
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,320
Can you repeat what you just said?

35
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,240
- Say that again.
- I...

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,020
It's so nice to hear it. Say that again.

37
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,190
Why should I say it again? Are you teasing me again?

38
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,250
I'm not teasing you.

39
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,660
I've been waiting for so long, and you finally said it.

40
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm getting a headache. What did I say?

41
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,560
Did you get hit in the head as well?

42
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
- Oh, I'm having such a terrible headache.
- What should we do?

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,460
Just pass it to me, and you'll be fine.

44
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,000
How about this?

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,330
- It still hurts.
- Mr. Qin Hebo, it's time to take your medicine.

46
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,780
I am fine now.

47
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,530
[Ning Meng]

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,030
Hello, Ning Meng.

49
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,090
Do you have time tomorrow afternoon?

50
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,660
What's up?

51
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,390
It's about you, my brother, and Zhijuan.

52
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,300
I'd like to sit down and make it clear to you.

53
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,860
- Is it still necessary?
 - It's good for everyone to sort it out.

54
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,970
You don't want this to always be so awkward, right?

55
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,520
Tastes bad.

56
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,190
Is this spicy as well?

57
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,130
Okay?

58
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,130
We've tried all the drinks as well.

59
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,680
What's up? Are you selecting the products? Did you taste anything bad?

60
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,860
If we sell this milkshake on our livestream channel,

61
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,270
we'll definitely receive tons of complaints!

62
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,360
Why are you back? I thought you were working at Evergreen.

63
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,630
The app is now released. I don't have to go there every day.

64
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,260
Are you going to recommend the crab in the livestream?

65
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,030
The crabs are great.

66
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,790
It's big and has a lot of tomalleys. And the price is reasonable.

67
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,630
Oh, pregnant women can't have crab.

68
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,190
Remind the viewers when you livestream.

69
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,460
Note it down for me.

70
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,900
Xiaoai, is it true that pregnant women can't have crab?

71
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,930
I thought it was just a myth.

72
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,190
The crab is cold-natured, and it contains a lot of fat.

73
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,860
It's hard to digest. So pregnant women shouldn't eat it or shouldn't eat too much.

74
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,340
Do you think she's afraid to come?

75
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,780
When my brother takes me to the hospital, will I give myself away?

76
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't worry. I've arranged everything for you.

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,900
Just act it out. It'll be fine.

78
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,290
Is it in this room?

79
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,180
Okay.

80
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,160
- Ning Meng.
- You're here.

81
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,490
Manager Chen is here as well.

82
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,350
Manhui is the best candidate as my sister-in-law in my heart.

83
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,960
Why can't she be here?

84
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,050
Ning Meng, I thought you asked me to come here to talk about...

85
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,630
I want to tell you that you should stop pestering my brother now that you've broken up!

86
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,680
If that's what you want to say,

87
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,590
then I don't think it's necessary for us to chat today.

88
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,880
Mengmeng, now that she's gained a higher social status by dating your brother, she won't let go easily.

89
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,910
She's so shameless. She doesn't even know what a decent breakup means.

90
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,600
Don't leave before we make things clear.

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,870
Don't go too far.

92
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,270
Enough is enough. Don't make it awkward for everyone.

93
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,370
- I'm leaving.
- You can't leave.

94
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Why not?

95
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,600
Okay. I'll help you.

96
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,680
What are you doing?

97
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,130
- What are you doing? I'm calling people.
- Don't you just want me to give you a push?

98
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,010
And pretend to have a miscarriage? What else?

99
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,470
And you have blood squibs. You two are very well prepared.

100
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,320
Do you know how many people will be hurt if you do this?

101
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,920
Xia Qian! What's happening? What are you doing?

102
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,560
She's not pregnant at all.

103
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,920
The other day, I saw her eating crab in the cafeteria.

104
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,450
I thought it was strange then.

105
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,280
Then, in your office,

106
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,510
I found her check-up report.

107
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,620
I went to visit the doctor according to the address.

108
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,140
It's true that Miss Ning Meng has been doing her health check-up in our hospital.

109
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,300
But she's not pregnant.

110
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,620
And this is not my signature either.

111
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,170
I'm afraid there's a misunderstanding.

112
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,550
I'll leave you guys to chat.

113
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,860
Please excuse me.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,020
Ning Meng, have you been lying to me this whole time?

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,560
Mengmeng, how could you do this?

116
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,130
I just don't like her.

117
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,410
Now, I don't like you either.

118
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,380
Let's not mention what an awful thing you did to try and harm Xia Qian.

119
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,700
Look at what you did.

120
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,620
Have you ever thought about He Zhijuan's feelings?

121
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,180
You should be able to see from these few days how much he wanted that child.

122
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,000
You've made up such a lie. How could he accept the truth?

123
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,730
I don't want to talk about it anymore. You should reflect on yourself.

124
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,860
Brother Zhening! Brother Zhening!

125
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,330
I had no idea that Ning Meng was doing this.

126
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,590
I didn't know that she's wasn't pregnant.

127
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,310
And I didn't know that she was using this to frame Miss Xia.

128
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,410
Manager Chen,

129
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,220
do you think that you're clever and everybody else is a fool?

130
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,400
Brother Zhening, I think you've misunderstood.

131
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,280
If there's nothing else, go back to your work.

132
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,430
It's still working hours.

133
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,530
Hubby, please don't go.

134
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,360
I know I was wrong. I mean it.

135
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Hubby, I'm so sorry. I really mean it.

136
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,910
Can you please stay?

137
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,590
Hubby, I'm begging you. I really know I was wrong.

138
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,160
I mean it!

139
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,140
Hubby, I'm begging you. Can you give me another chance?

140
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,780
Please, I'm begging you. Don't go.

141
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,390
Hubby, please, I'm begging you.

142
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,730
Manager Chen's probation is ending soon, right?

143
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,410
How is her performance so far?

144
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,040
Her performance is not too good.

145
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,750
But Manager Chen is Ning Meng's friend, and her father...

146
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,330
When do we ever rely on nepotism at Evergreen?

147
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,250
Sorry, I've thought too much.

148
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,820
Whether she should stay, do it according to Evergreen's rules.

149
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,240
Okay, will do.

150
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,750
- I'm going inside.
- Xia Qian.

151
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,530
I'm so sorry that you were mistreated because of Ning Meng.

152
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,630
Don't apologize. It's not your fault.

153
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
All in all, it's because I cared too much about her,

154
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,720
I never expected that she would make up such lies to trick me.

155
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,020
Although Ning Meng was willful back in the day,

156
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,980
but she was still a kind and upright girl.

157
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,990
I don't know when she turned into this.

158
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,910
Don't worry too much.

159
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,250
We can take it easy on her.

160
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,330
Zhening, I know you're angry, but you should still care about her.

161
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm afraid she will do something extreme again.

162
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,580
I know.

163
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,400
I‘ll talk to Ning Meng about it.

164
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,600
The good news is, we won't have to hide from other people anymore.

165
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,920
It's been a long day. You should go back. I'm going in too.

166
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,510
- Okay. I'll watch you go in.
- I'll watch you leave.

167
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,830
Bye.

168
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,610
Does your head still hurt?

169
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,240
Not too bad.

170
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,400
If you feel unwell, let me know at any time.

171
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,990
Right, what was it that suddenly got you to think it through?

172
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,020
Think what through?

173
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,010
You agreed to be my girlfriend.

174
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,980
I just thought that... I'd been suppressing my feelings, and that didn't feel good.

175
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,730
I was thinking too much about the future.

176
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,660
But now, I just want to feel in the present.

177
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,660
Don't worry.

178
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,320
I won't let you down this time.

179
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,460
Maybe you can drive me to the hotel first, and then you can go back to rest.

180
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,730
You just got discharged.

181
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,160
If you stay in the hotel alone, there will be nobody taking care of you. Is that okay for you?

182
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,790
It should be fine. It's just a scratch.

183
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,310
Why don't you come home during this time?

184
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,760
Turn right.

185
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,090
What are you doing?

186
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,490
I'll sleep on the sofa, and you'll sleep on the bed.

187
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,600
No. Well, I'm sleeping on the sofa, of course.

188
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,820
How could I let you sleep on the sofa?

189
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,490
I'm your boss, you should listen to me.

190
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,460
You haven't recovered yet. You're the boss,

191
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,890
but I'm the boss's girlfriend.

192
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,500
You should listen to me. Go sleep on the bed.

193
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,430
Boss's girlfriend? Stop meddling with me.

194
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,260
I like to meddle with you. Just go inside.

195
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,800
I don't care.

196
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,190
I'm lying down here. Or you can try to carry me away.

197
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm going to drag you in. Hurry up!

198
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,760
I'll sleep on the sofa!

199
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,500
Acupoint!

200
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,950
Then how about

201
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,430
we both sleep on the bed?

202
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,760
What are you doing? I'm still...

203
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,520
You haven't recovered yet.

204
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,870
Does that mean if I recover, I can...

205
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,360
No, no. I mean you haven't recovered yet.

206
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,420
I can turn it off.

207
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,260
Then... there's one more light on this side.

208
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,170
Please turn it off. I still haven't recovered yet.

209
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,960
My arms are not long enough.

210
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,560
I can't reach it. You do it.

211
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,960
Fine, I'll do it.

212
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,900
Why don't you turn it off?

213
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,900
I'm hurt! And my arms are short too.

214
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,060
Little guy.

215
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,390
Let's go.

216
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,970
Baby, go have some fun.

217
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,530
Why are you suddenly in the mood for cooking breakfast?

218
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,660
Isn't that what a boyfriend should do?

219
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,890
You should wash up. It'll be ready soon.

220
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,030
I'm looking forward to breakfast.

221
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,270
We're having breakfast! Here's your breakfast.

222
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,400
This is yours. Don't forget to eat it.

223
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Breakfast is here.

224
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,360
Smells so good!

225
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,140
Try it.

226
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,570
By the way, did you give the cat a name?

227
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,570
We should name the cat.

228
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,770
I thought of a name for it before.

229
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,130
You did? What is it?

230
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,190
I want to call it Tiger.

231
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,130
Tiger? That's so lame.

232
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,730
Well, the older generation says that a lame name means a long life.

233
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,930
No! Calling it Tiger sounds so weird. We should think of a new name.

234
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,670
What do you want to call it?

235
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,270
Pudding.

236
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,830
- Pudding?
- Yeah.

237
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,960
Is there any special meaning to it?

238
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,970
Nothing special. It's just cute.

239
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,870
And a lot of things in the world are meaningless.

240
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,870
I wanted to call it Tiger because I want it to be healthy.

241
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,100
And you want to call it Pudding.

242
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,900
Maybe call it Tiger's Pudding?

243
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,170
Pudding can be its nickname. The full name is Tiger's Pudding.

244
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,580
We can call it Pudding for short.

245
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,510
So it's still called Pudding, right?

246
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,130
Tiger's Pudding.

247
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,380
Tiger's Pudding! I can't help you there.

248
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,160
Now your name is Pudding.

249
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,900
See? The full name is too complicated.

250
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,870
Pudding. Right?

251
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,900
Pudding. Pudding.

252
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,200
Hey, hey! Look at what happened to her.

253
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,420
I heard that even her degree in the U.S. was fake.

254
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,150
Her dad paid a huge amount of sponsorship fees to get her admitted.

255
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,440
And then because she wasn't good enough, she didn't even graduate.

256
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,190
Seriously?

257
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,380
From what I think, never take more

258
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,590
than you can chew.

259
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,590
Tell me about it.

260
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,020
You'll end up making a fool of yourself.

261
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,430
GM Sheng?

262
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,710
How's Mengmeng doing lately?

263
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,170
Since He Zhijuan left, she's been really upset.

264
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,060
Even with a caregiver watching over her,

265
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,050
she's been eating very little.

266
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,580
Ning Meng hasn't eaten today again.

267
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,230
I see. I'll handle it from here.

268
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,330
Mengmeng, I'm here.

269
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,520
Guess what is in here?

270
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,820
I made it myself.

271
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,860
So much good stuff.

272
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,830
Mengmeng. Quick, it's getting cold.

273
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,380
Brother, Zhijuan has left.

274
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,580
I know.

275
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,830
Are you still mad at me?

276
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,380
Mengmeng,

277
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,680
I know Chen Manhui was partly responsible.

278
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,630
But have you reflected on your problems?

279
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,930
If you keep acting like this, not only will you ruin your marriage,

280
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,110
even I will lose faith in you.

281
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,520
Mengmeng.

282
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,650
Since you were young, everyone in our family doted on you.

283
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,980
After our parents passed away,

284
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,390
I never forced anything on you.

285
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,300
Sending you abroad to study,

286
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,560
letting you choose the job you like, I've always backed you up.

287
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,410
The only thing I ever objected to was your decision to marry He Zhijuan.

288
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,800
I admit I was biased about him.

289
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,370
But since you got married,

290
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,630
I could tell how much he adored you.

291
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,340
He put up with your temper.

292
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,250
That's real love.

293
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,700
I hoped the two of you would have a happy marriage.

294
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,150
But you've been going further and further,

295
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,150
getting way out of line.

296
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,880
I can't keep letting you do this.

297
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Brother, it's my fault.

298
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,190
I know it's all my fault.

299
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:25,510
Can you talk to Zhijuan for me? I want him to come back.

300
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,930
Please...

301
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,210
I can try, but not at the moment.

302
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,650
Right now he is still furious. How can I persuade him?

303
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,750
Give him some time.

304
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,830
And you... When his rage wears off,

305
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,470
you must make a sincere apology.

306
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,980
I will. As long as he is willing to come back, I'll do anything.

307
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,980
Okay, then. Eat something.

308
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,610
You can't solve things on an empty stomach.

309
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,340
GM Sheng.

310
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,550
Bye, GM Sheng.

311
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,480
Why are you here?

312
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,820
Work is over. Have you finished?

313
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,220
All finished.

314
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,720
Great. I'll drive you home.

315
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,050
Now it's obvious, right?

316
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,130
Team Leader Xia is the winner.

317
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,580
In that case,

318
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,920
should we move this back?

319
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,570
No more drama, right?

320
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,570
Aunt, we are back together.

321
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,610
I knew you two would get back together.

322
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,330
Xiao Sheng, not that I'm making my own daughter sound good,

323
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,330
but you won't find another girl

324
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,550
as good as my daughter.

325
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,140
You should treat her well.

326
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,840
And you!

327
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,440
You wouldn't be able to find another boyfriend as good as Xiao Sheng either.

328
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,580
Don't ever take it for granted.

329
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,810
I know.

330
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,770
I'm serious.

331
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,100
Of course, I know!

332
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,570
Let's celebrate. I'll cook for you myself. Let's drink.

333
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,470
Aunt, please don't trouble yourself.

334
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,750
Of course, we should celebrate!

335
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,260
I want sautéed shrimp.

336
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,350
I want sautéed shrimp too.

337
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,230
Okay! Sautéed shrimp.

338
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,710
And stir-fry razor clams.

339
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,770
That's also what I like.

340
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,660
I'll be right back. Very quick.

341
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,910
They even like the same food.

342
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,860
Copycat.

343
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,450
Your phone.

344
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,570
You can check for me.

345
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,980
Someone called Cindy sent you a voice message.

346
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,580
GM Qin, I heard that you got injured recently.

347
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,390
Are you okay? Shall I pay you a visit?

348
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,270
What is it? Why are you spacing out?

349
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,030
Who is Cindy?

350
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,780
A colleague?

351
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,860
How come I have never heard of her?

352
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,870
Why does she show so much interest in you?

353
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,380
Okay...

354
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,760
Why a selfie all of a sudden?

355
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,130
You haven't answered my question. Who's Cindy?

356
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,770
Cindy is a supplier for our hotel.

357
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,880
Here, take a look.

358
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,760
Our chat history.

359
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,730
No need.

360
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,870
Your profile picture! How come...

361
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,590
It'll save loads of trouble.

362
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,230
If you still worry, I'll give you my password.

363
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,120
520222.

364
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,670
520 is...

365
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,090
I love you. What about 222?

366
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,100
2 means double, "shuang."

367
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,600
Shuangshuang the fool. The foolish Shuangshuang.

368
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,510
You are the fool!

369
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,590
There, no more secrets in front of you.

370
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,590
I'll head back, then.

371
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,920
Isn't the app feedback inquiry tomorrow?

372
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,230
Yes.

373
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,840
It's too late. You can sleep here tonight.

374
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,770
Let's go together in the morning.

375
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,740
Very well, then.

376
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,240
You wash first. I'll sort things out.

377
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Am I being too eager?

378
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,650
No.

379
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,870
We've been together so long.

380
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,400
Isn't this too direct?

381
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,450
What's wrong?

382
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,870
Too much dust.

383
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,080
I'll beat it.

384
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,930
I'll do it. You go to bed.

385
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,350
I...

386
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,390
Okay, then.

387
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,950
Xia Qian, can you actually do something big for once?

388
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,160
[New City Center]

389
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,870
Later, you need to go back to the office. Right?

390
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,920
I have a meeting this evening, so I probably won't be able to pick you up.

391
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,300
Morning, GM Qin.

392
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,510
You go ahead.

393
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,330
Bye.

394
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,980
No wonder you didn't show up to work.

395
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,710
Is it official?

396
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,270
About time!

397
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,820
Sister Shuangshuang, you have me to thank, don't you?

398
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,420
- Treat me to some food, then.
- Yes, yes.

399
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,710
Whatever you like, my treat!

400
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,050
- It's going to cost you.
- You drama queen.

401
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,270
Wait...

402
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,900
You two are on a roll!

403
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,280
Got stiff neck or something?

404
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,680
It's a mosquito bite. I scratched it.

405
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,270
No need to explain. I'm an adult. I understand.

406
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,600
What is there to understand? I'm serious!

407
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,180
Don't. Trying to explain is covering it up.

408
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,900
What are you thinking of?

409
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,620
- Wicked girl!
- You'll be live streaming soon.

410
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,460
- Better cover it up. Otherwise, the impact might be bad.
- It's not what you think.

411
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,650
- Fine, it's not.
- No, no, no. I better have it.

412
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,220
It might have a negative impact.

413
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,190
You do it.

414
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,070
What do you think it is?

415
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,360
I think it's...

416
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,560
They are so sweet.

417
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,040
Zhening,

418
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,100
it's late. I'll go and wash up

419
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,380
I'll go to bed, then.

420
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,860
Why don't you pick up?

421
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,710
I did switch it off— I didn't!

422
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,740
What is it now?

423
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,000
How about sleep in my room tonight?

424
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,980
Look, Zhening, such heavy rain!

425
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,910
There's lightning! I'm a bit scared.

426
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,260
It'll be easier if Qianqian were scared of the thunder.

427
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,700
Zhening, how about...

428
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,900
you join me in my room tonight?

429
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,130
Gross.

430
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,890
Whatever.

431
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,590
Why are you still here?

432
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,320
I... I was reading documents in bed.

433
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,860
And I spilled a glass of water.

434
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,230
The sheets are all wet.

435
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,400
You spilled a glass of water? Well...

436
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,130
Then you have to sleep in my room.

437
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,940
- Probably.
- Get your pillow, then.

438
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,130
I'm exhausted.

439
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,620
This...

440
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,640
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

441
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,050
What happened to your neck?

442
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,630
A mosquito bite.

443
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,040
Then why put on a band-aid?

444
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,770
It's all your fault.

445
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:38,000
Jiayu thought it was a hickey.

446
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,270
I had no idea.

447
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,010
Well, then...

448
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,420
What are you saying?

449
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,740
What are you doing?

450
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,650
You know how I dislike being misunderstood.

451
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,200
Right? Since I already took the blame,

452
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,530
I might as well commit the crime.

453
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,700
Commit the crime?

454
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,210
Hey!

455
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,890
Qianqian?

456
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,340
What are you laughing at?

457
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,120
Zhening, we look like the cowherd

458
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,740
and the weaver girl.

459
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,420
With a huge milky way between us.

460
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,350
Separated by two bowls.

461
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,150
Isn't that a bit miserable?

462
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,170
Should we sleep on the couch today instead?

463
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,140
The couch?

464
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,820
- What is it?
- It's too cramped.

465
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,380
No, it's fine.

466
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,860
What was that sound? Stay here, I'll take a look.

467
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,870
Who would come at this hour?

468
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,280
Be careful.

469
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,790
Careful.

470
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,850
In the middle of the night,

471
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,090
why are you sleeping here?

472
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,060
My cousin's family came to visit. They are sleeping at my place. The child makes too much noise.

473
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,800
I couldn't sleep. So I came here to find some peace.

474
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,500
It's just one night. You two go ahead.

475
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,140
- You are sleeping here?
- Yeah.

476
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,390
That can't happen.

477
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,200
Where should I go, then?

478
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,540
I'll figure something out.

00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,950
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

489
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,880
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

490
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,990
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

491
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,400
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

492
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,140
♫ I am here anyway ♫

493
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,030
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

494
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:36,120
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

495
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,760
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

496
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,740
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

497
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:52,130
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

498
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,900
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

499
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,230
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

500
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,600
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

501
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,720
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

502
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,880
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

503
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,330
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

504
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,760
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

505
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,690
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

506
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,660
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

507
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,190
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

508
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,140
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

509
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,320
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

510
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,050
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

511
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,430
♫ I am here anyway ♫

512
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,270
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

513
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:10,520
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

514
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,820
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

515
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:19,050
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

516
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:26,320
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
