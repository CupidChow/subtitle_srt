There's no one here. That's kind of strange.

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,200
This is not too high.

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,730
Zhening,

7
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,430
we have reserved the entire park for ourselves.

8
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,670
Shall we get an annual pass?

9
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,300
Can you get a couple more?

10
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,030
Well, that's not enough.

11
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,320
We should also get a set of half-year passes.

12
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,480
Or...

13
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,730

It's getting late. You should sleep.

17

You should rest early, too.

18
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,420
Also,

19
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,530
I think we should not let Ning Meng know about us for now.

20
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,210
Got it.

21
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,710
Hubby, have some breakfast before you go to work.

22
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,130
Sure.

Hubby,

24
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,680
I won't bring food for you to the hospital anymore.

25
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,380
I'll get up early to make breakfast for you, okay?

26

Okay. Thank you, Wifey.

27
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,040
Look at these heart-shaped eggs. Are they cute?

28
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,950
- Yes, they are.
- And I drew a smiley face on top.

29

They're very cute.

Nothing. I just feel so happy now.

Me too.

33
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,480
Eat some food.

34
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,580
No, I want to watch you eat.

35
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,800
Sofa, washing machine, and TV. Don't send them over.

36

What about the clothes for Miss Xia?

37

Just send one over. Remember to take off the tag.

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,150
On Taobao.

You're having a board meeting today. Why was I not invited?

49
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,540
Director Gao, when did you come back?

50
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,320
I was abroad on a business trip for just a few months,

51
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,020
and now we have a new GM after I returned?

52
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,660
Director Gao, you were abroad and had no idea of Evergreen's personnel changes.

53
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,880
This is quite normal.

54

What's the agenda of today's meeting?

Why are they missing from the VIP list this time?

60
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,630
There's more reason to invite them for the 30th anniversary.

61
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,250
Director Gao, what do you mean? You've been nitpicking since you came.

Nothing.

I think that for such a big event like the 30th anniversary,

64
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,730
GM Sheng must come back to do this.

If GM Sheng doesn't come back,

66

the Housekeeping Department won't cooperate.

67
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,250
Since Director Gao insists on it, I will ask GM Sheng to come back.

He said that if you don't come back, the Housekeeping Department won't cooperate.

What did GM Qin say?

Further education?

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,060
This opportunity is different from before.

88
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,020
Our partnering clinic, Philip Psychological Clinic, adopts a treatment approach that is based mainly on face-to-face interviews

89
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,220
and uses medication as support.

90

This is the same as your specialization.

91
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,210
It's a rare opportunity.

92
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,350
We can only send one person, and we have a few candidates.

93
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,470
But I think you have the biggest chance.

94
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,680
Thank you, President.

95
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,330
I did pay attention to this clinic. Their psychological counselors are very experienced.

96
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,440
Although they adopt a rather conservative approach, the recovery rate of their patients is very high.

97
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,900
Thank you, President, for giving me this opportunity.

98
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,890
There's no need to thank me.

99
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,750
You should be grateful for your own effort.

100
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,040
It's not that. I know that this clinic has world-class psychological counseling services.

101
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,710
My seniors and I have always wanted to go there.

102
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,780
So this opportunity is very competitive.

103
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,410
The candidate not only has to be skilled at work,

104
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,830
but also excellent in every way.

105
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,530
I will take everything into consideration.

106
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,640
Thank you, President.

107
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,610
- Keep working hard!
- I will.

108
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,490
Take care, President.

109
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,250
For this anniversary gala, we need to invite a lot of Evergreen's long-time clients for sure.

110
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,310
Those clients have been supporting Evergreen since the previous GM Sheng.

111
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,780
If you are not there, they'll become suspicious.

112
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,990
Also, you coordinated all the previous anniversary galas.

113
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,160
You have more experience than I do.

114
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,290
You've rested for so long,

115
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,630
isn't it time to come back?

116
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,390
I know.

117
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,050
You've worked so hard during my absence.

118
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,310
It's my job.

119
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,660
Right. When I come back this time, don't arrange any specific position for me.

120
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,920
The main reason for my coming back is to assist you.

121
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,750
As you wish.

122
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,710
Hello?

123
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,060
Zhening, are you coming home for dinner?

124
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,460
I am.

125
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,110
Great! I'll wait for you.

126
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,420
All right, I'll be back soon.

127
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,730
Are you in a relationship?

128
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,080
Then hurry up and leave, don't make her wait.

129
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,260
But I need to pay the check.

130
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,450
As usual?

131
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,850
Okay!

132
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,430
- Charlie!
- Yes?

133
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,350
What's up?

134
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,020
I saw you wearing a ring a few times before,

135
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,160
but it is suddenly missing today.

136
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,270
I guess they broke up.

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,590
I saw him smiling while checking his phone.

138
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,010
I guess they didn't break up.

139
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,320
I lost the ring, I ordered a new one but it's not in stock.

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,570
GM Sheng, you won!

141
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,810
- Put it on my tab.
- No problem.

142
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,350
Thank you!

143
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,210
I'm heading out now.

144
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
All dishes are here.

145
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,390
- GM Qin had something for you?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,890
I'm going back to work at Evergreen.

147
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,460
You scared me! I was worried something bad had happened.

148
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,310
We can't work together anymore.

149
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,290
Going back to work at Evergreen is good.

150
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,890
What is the saying? "If love can last forever,

151
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,340
would a day or night matter?" Right?
(T/N: reference to a Chinese poem from the Song dynasty)

152
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,820
Aren't you sad at all?

153
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,480
Why? I'm not a kid.

154
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,500
There, there. Have some food.

155
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,790
Have some food.

156
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,560
After GM Sheng fell in love, he did change a lot.

157
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,160
You were the one who made better guesses.

158
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,990
What about you?

159
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,460
I have a feeling that you've been interested in her for a long time.

160
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,630
When it comes to love, the more you want to suppress it,

161
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,120
the harder it fights back.

162
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,790
Sanity won't work.

163
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,580
Why don't you drink with me?

164
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,120
All right.

165
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,830
Here.

166
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,320
How is it? Is it too tight or too loose?

167
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,150
Just right.

168
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,520
Why are you looking at me?

169
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,930
I want to kiss you.

170
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,000
You're almost late for work.

171
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,460
I'll see you when you come back tonight.

172
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,660
How do I look?

173
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,730
To tell you the truth, after spending so much time with you,

174
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,100
I almost forget you were the GM of Evergreen.

175
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,130
As long as you remember that I'm your boyfriend.

176
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm leaving now.

177
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,760
By the way, I won't be back for dinner.

178
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,770
Put the dishes in the sink after you finish dinner,

179
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,490
and I'll wash them.

180
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,160
Got it.

181
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,740
Bye.

182
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,920
President, your cake is ready.

183
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,970
How much is it?

184
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,530
How can I accept your money?

185
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,300
You're sharing my cake with your friends,

186
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,400
that's free advertising for me.

187
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,030
I should thank you for that.

188
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,080
I really do think it's delicious.

189
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,130
You use the best ingredients,

190
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,760
and it does taste very different.

191
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,560
I just looked at the recipe and then made it with my intuition.

192
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,730
Maybe it's because I was picky as a child,

193
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,520
now I have an advantage in gourmet cooking.

194
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,890
Xiao He is so lucky to have a wife like you.

195
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,360
He does nothing else but works all day.

196
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,730
Zhijuan is not the articulate type.

197
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,230
I hope you can help him out in the future.

198
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,830
Xiao He is very capable.

199
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,660
The hospital wants to help him grow.

200
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,300
Although I was being conservative when I talked to him,

201
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,990
you can be assured.

202
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,030
He will definitely be the chosen one to study abroad this time.

203
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,420
Study abroad?

204
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,620
What are you doing?

205
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,160
Sister Qian, there's something I'd like to ask you.

206
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,430
Go ahead.

207
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,600
Are you really dating Sheng Zhening?

208
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,670
Yeah.

209
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,990
I thought you said he's hard-to-please, unreasonable, and doesn't have the spirit of contract?

210
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,140
What do you like about him?

211
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,030
Did I say anything like that?

212
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,710
You've got such a bad memory!

213
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,440
I don't remember.

214
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
I didn't realize how great he was back then.

215
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,420
Meeting at the banquet hall at 8:30, and board meeting at 9:30.

216
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,300
Then we'll visit Mingcheng Group at 11:00.

217
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,890
At 2:00 p.m., the Catering Department will confirm the menu for the anniversary.

218
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,560
Let's move the meeting with the Catering Department to 1:00 p.m.

219
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,510
But it takes at least one hour's drive from Mingcheng Group to the hotel. Your lunch...

220
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,080
I'll just grab some food on my way back.

221
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,610
Okay.

222
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,220
From 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m...

223
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,050
Livestream e-commerce?

224
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,100
This is Lie'er, the famous livestreamer.

225
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,550
Lie'er?

226
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,560
Here's the thing. Last week, a livestream e-commerce company spoke to me.

227
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
They often need to negotiate prices with the vendors.

228
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,560
The lower the price, the more the buyers.

229
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,950
They need to find a balance point in the price.

230
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,490
That's why they want to work with us.

231
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,310
Actually, I'm quite interested in this livestream e-commerce model.

232
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,790
So I consulted them about it.

233
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,270
They said that if we're interested and are willing to collaborate,

234
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,190
they can sign a livestream contract with us and let us try.

235
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,220
What do you think?

236
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,510
I think it's a pretty good idea.

237
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,220
You've just watched for a little while, and you think it's pretty good?

238
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,210
Let me tell you. Bargaining with the vendors is what we're good at.

239
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,910
Now there's just one more step.

240
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,720
We just have to sell the discounted products.

241
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,980
One more step, but more commission as well. That way we can earn more.

242
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,190
I've thought about that.

243
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,310
We're good at bargaining, but we're not good at selling the products.

244
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,060
I'm not sure if we can make that money.

245
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,590
We can learn.

246
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,410
Let's have a try then.

247
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,410
Okay. Let's give it a try.

248
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,360
So we want to shoot a promotional video with you, GM Sheng, as the lead character,

249
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,500
to help the public get to know the leader of Evergreen and the corporate culture of our hotel.

250
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,190
This is not a good idea.

251
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,660
What Evergreen achieved today is the result of all of us working together.

252
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,930
I think we should make a video about the excellent employees,

253
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,200
the story between our long-time customers and our hotel,

254
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,190
and their blessings to us.

255
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,100
Being genuine is the most important thing.

256
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,870
Understood.

257
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,570
[What are you doing?]

258
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,480
What are you doing?

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,270
[I'm eating.]

260
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm eating. Have you eaten? Are you tired from work?

261
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,230
I've eaten. Don't worry about me.

262
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,960
GM Sheng, the wine we ordered for the anniversary has arrived.

263
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,620
When will you come back approximately?

264
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,330
Has the invitation been designed yet?

265
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,280
I forgot. I'll arrange it right away.

266
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,490
Has the theme of the promotional video been confirmed?

267
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,760
Yes. We'll discuss it again during tomorrow's meeting.

268
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,230
Time is running out. We'll work overtime tonight.

269
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,060
Got it.

270
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,770
Hubby, you are back. I'm sure you haven't eaten.

271
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,270
I'm going to prepare you something.

272
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,940
Mengmeng, come sit down.

273
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,030
I want to talk to you about something.

274
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,280
Today, President came to me.

275
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,510
He said you told him we are having a baby this year.

276
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,340
So he reserved that study abroad opportunity for another doctor.

277
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,580
I do indeed have that idea. We've been married for a while,

278
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,100
we should plan for a baby. Right?

279
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,880
Do you know how rare this opportunity is?

280
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,390
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in my career.

281
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,360
Zhijuan,

282
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,200
I don't want to separate from you. I don't want you to leave the country.

283
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,700
Can you not be mad at me?

284
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,800
Studying abroad is part of my job,

285
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm not leaving you.

286
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,760
Can you not keep living in your own judgments?

287
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,050
Do you know how important this is to my career?

288
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,450
You said you want to spend more time with me.

289
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,080
That's right.

290
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm already tightly tied up by your side,

291
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,750
where can I go?

292
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,770
Hubby, I'm wrong! I made a mistake!

293
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,240
I'm going to text the president tomorrow that

294
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,970
we are now not having a baby.

295
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,160
You can go study abroad. Oh! Let me do it now, okay?

296
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,070
- Are you not feeling well?
- Nothing.

297
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,020
Something suddenly came up at the hotel,

298
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,880
I won't be able to join you for breakfast. Sorry.

299
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,440
Be careful.

300
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,460
Thank you so much, Anan.

301
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,710
You are welcome.

302
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,050
That's right,

303
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,910
What made you decide to bring back GM Sheng's luggage here?

304
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,610
It's too tiring for him recently.

305
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,080
It takes 40 mins to drive from my house to the hotel. That's almost two hours' return.

306
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,520
Now, if he moves back here,

307
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,520
he'll have more time to rest.

308
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,490
You are so considerate, Miss Xia.

309
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,760
Have you discussed this matter with GM Sheng beforehand?

310
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,510
I know this is for my own good, but...

311
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,260
There is no but, no negotiation.

312
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,240
Sheng Zhening,

313
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,550
you need to listen to me on this unconditionally.

314
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,960
There was so much luggage, you should have waited for me to pack them.

315
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,990
Okay.

316
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,710
Whatever you say, I got it.

317
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,900
You brought the luggage over, right?

318
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,250
Yes.

319
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,250
I thought you and Miss Xia had discussed this.

320
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,140
I'm innocent!

321
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,370
One self-reflection statement,

322
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,020
- and deduct two months bonus.
- No.

323
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,680
She didn't discuss this with you?

324
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,250
I thought she did.

325
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,750
I...

326
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
Have you made a decision on the livestream?

327
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
No problem. We can give it a try.

328
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,510
Can we meet this afternoon?

329
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,900
This afternoon? I can.

330
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,370
Then, we'll meet at your office at 2:00 p.m.?

331
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,510
Okay. See you later.

332
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,930
I'm sorry... Can we change our meeting location to Evergreen Hotel?

333
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,130
No problem.

334
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,650
Great!

335
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,000
I have read the contract, there shouldn't be any problem.

336
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,460
I still need to confirm with our legal department.

337
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,960
I hope we can seal the deal soon.

338
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,560
Good. When we launch the project,

339
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,990
we'll provide you full support on the preparation in the early stage,

340
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,850
till the technical aspect in the late stage.

341
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,090
Also, we will send a team of specialists to assist you.

342
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,150
That's wonderful!

343
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,310
That would save me a lot of preparation time in the early stage,

344
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,690
we can get ready to go online as soon as possible.

345
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,320
Yes.

346
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,100
If you have further questions, feel free to reach out.

347
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,190
Then, we'll just need to sign the contract.

348
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,230
Excellent.

349
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,250
- Looking forward to it.
- Looking forward to it.

350
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,870
- If there's anything, you can call me.
- Sure. Goodbye.

351
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,190
[Anan]

352
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,130
Hello?

353
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,640
Anan, is GM Sheng at the hotel right now?

354
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,330
He is.

355
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,980
Do you know his exact location?

356
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,580
I'm not sure about his exact location. I'm outside right now and won't be back until later.

357
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,740
But according to his schedule,

358
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,390
he should be at the restaurant to discuss the gala menu with the head chef.

359
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,580
What is it, Miss Xia? Do you need anything from him?

360
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,730
There is a reason, of course.

361
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,780
I need to discuss something with him.

362
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,650
You go ahead. I will hang up now.

363
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,200
I want to take advantage of this Anniversary Gala,

364
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,220
to promote our Building No. 2.

365
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,850
Building No. 2's restoration is almost done.

366
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,250
It is a great opportunity to do a warm-up with our guests.

367
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,340
Come to my room.

368
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,800
I miss you.

369
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,390
I know you are really busy.

370
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,270
I'm here to see you today,

371
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,290
I didn't do it on purpose.

372
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,130
I miss you too.

373
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,490
Why don't you pick up the call?

374
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,240
It must be regarding the Marketing Department meeting. It's okay.

375
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,380
Can you not pick up the call?

376
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,230
What happened to your forehead?

377
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,280
I sleepwalked last night

378
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,040
and bumped into something.

379
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,790
Maybe I should move back.

380
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,530
I'm worried about you being alone.

381
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,260
GM Sheng,

382
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,580
the Marketing Department wants me to ask you when we can start the meeting,

383
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,390
so they can prepare for it ahead of time. Can you give them a time?

384
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,950
Give me ten minutes.

385
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,950
GM Sheng will be there soon.

386
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,090
Oh, Miss Xia is there as well?

387
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,450
Perhaps I should cancel the meeting.

388
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,600
Cancel it!

389
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,940
Change it to tomorrow!

390
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,120
You cannot cancel the meeting.

391
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,990
GM Sheng is heading there now.

392
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,370
So... who should I listen to?

393
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,760
Okay. Wait a moment.

394
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
Are you sure just a moment?

395
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,950
Confirmed!

396
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,940
Okay!

397
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,630
This status...

398
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,530
I'm leaving now.

399
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,440
Let me hug you a bit,

400
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,610
just ten seconds.

401
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,480
Okay.

402
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,340
As you wish.

403
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,560
Still working overtime?

404
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,280
Is the kitty sick?

405
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,430
I'm sorry,

406
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,480
your call cannot be connected at the moment.

407
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,250
Please try again later.

408
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,900
Turns out that you are vomiting hairballs.

409
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,220
I thought you were sick.

410
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,560
Hey, kitty, you must stay well.

411
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,870
It seems your owner can't take care of you at the moment,

412
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,220
but you need to stay strong.

413
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,880
Being his cat is not easy at all.

414
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
Sorry for what you've been through.

415
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,750
Scared me.

416
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,120
Hebo, I heard that

417
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,730
you invited Sheng Zhening back to Evergreen.

418
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,300
That's true.

419
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,960
Director Gao, the long-time shareholder of Evergreen, is back.

420
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
That was his idea.

421
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,470
And he still has a lot of influence at Evergreen.

422
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,830
I better not stand up to him.

423
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:52,090
Besides, it's the 30th anniversary. Sheng Zhening should be present.

424
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,590
The GM Qin that I know

425
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,520
isn't so passive.

426
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,430
Power outage at Building No. 2, the reviewer getting trapped in the elevator,

427
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,790
changing the renovation price comparison budget,

428
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,760
leading Sheng Zhening to make massive purchases of termite-infested

429
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,730
African logs.

430
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,520
You used to be very decisive about these things.

431
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,960
Also, how are things going

432
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,890
with Director Gao? Should I step in?

433
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,060
No need. I have my plan.

434
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,510
Shutting Director Gao up is easy.

435
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,590
It's his stocks that I want.

436
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,200
Very well, then.

437
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,360
Hebo, a word of advice.

438
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,680
Don't get softened up just because Sheng handed over the general manager post to you.

439
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't forget what I told you before.

440
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,730
He remains one of Evergreen's biggest shareholders.

441
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,030
It'll be easy for him to kick you off from your current position.

442
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,820
Only when Lihe Capital acquires Evergreen,

443
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,040
gives you your shares, and calls on the entire board to back you up,

444
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,960
your place as the general manager

445
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,090
can truly be secured.

446
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,650
Understood, Director Xue. I'll hang up.

447
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,030
I'll let you know when I have news.

448
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,940
- Watch out!
- I'm sorry.

449
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,120
Are you blind?

450
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,630
Your Evergreen Hotel's Building No. 2 renovation materials

451
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,280
are being bargained and managed by my company.

452
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,560
I am working hard so that your hotel can save money.

453
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,250
When I did the price comparison,

454
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,270
how come it didn't occur to me that there's a risk of termites in the wood?

455
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,520
If it had been written on the report, maybe they wouldn't have bought it.

456
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,560
I am usually very sensitive about those details.

457
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,550
[Old Driver]

458
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,470
- Hello?
- Hello, Shuangshuang.

459
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,640
Did you come to my place today?

460
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,330
I saw that you forgot your bag here.

461
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,160
I noticed that the kitten vomited at noon.

462
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,660
I called you, but the line was busy.

463
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,750
So I came by to feed it. It was vomiting hairballs. Nothing serious.

464
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,500
So that's where my bag has been. I've been looking.

465
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,880
Anything important in it? Should I bring it over now?

466
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,370
No need. Nothing important.

467
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,970
You can just courier it tomorrow. I'm in the middle of something. I'll hang up now.

468
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,090
Why did you buy me this watch?

469
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,910
Your horrifying sleepwalking habit is beyond understanding.

470
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,850
What if one day you sleepwalk to the street

471
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,660
and get hit by a car?

472
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,850
This watch has a built-in GPS.

473
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,470
I'll know if you sleepwalk at night.

474
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,140
This is way too much.

475
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,420
Don't underestimate this watch, it has a lot of functions.

476
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,470
You can make and receive calls with it.

477
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,080
If your cell phone battery is dead, you can call me using this.

478
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,720
And I can locate you through it. Double security.

479
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,810
- Fine. Fine.
- Your watch looks so lame.

480
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,080
What so lame? Can't you talk nicely?

481
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,270
Honestly, it's really lame.

482
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,430
He knows nothing. It's very cute. You look good with anything.

483
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,720
I think so, too.

484
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,640
Men are damn good liars.

485
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,470
- Aren't you one of them?
- I'm different from him.

486
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,940
How different?

487
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,450
- I'm—
- Indeed different.

488
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,660
What's with him today? Acting so weird.

489
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,310
Maybe... he's poisoned?

490
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,680
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

491
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,500
Lie'er is so cool. The goddess of my dream.

492
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,690
If we can invite her, it will be phenomenal.

493
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,080
Wow! If we can invite her, then my dream will come true.

494
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,820
In your dreams!

495
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,290
A fast learner, aren't you?

496
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,130
- Come on in!
- Look.

497
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,890
She should see your moves.

498
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,550
Your dream has come true.

499
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,570
Am I dreaming?

500
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,630
Why did you stop? You were dancing so well.

501
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,290
Be serious!

502
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,080
Are you dreaming? Does it hurt?

503
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,700
- A little.
- Funny kid.

504
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,080
Don't encourage him.

505
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,540
Allow me to introduce to you.

506
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,440
These two are our new project supporting partners,

507
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,930
Lie‘er and Xiaoai.

508
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,920
- Let's welcome them.
- Welcome!

509
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,330
Lie'er doesn't need any introduction. Everyone knows her.

510
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,320
She's an experienced and excellent live-streamer.

511
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,730
She will be leading our first few live-streaming sessions as a guest.

512
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,840
This is Xiaoai, she is also an outstanding brand selection manager.

513
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,610
Anyway, if we have any questions about live streaming in the future, we can directly seek help from them.

514
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,870
No, not "seeking help," it sounds so formal. If you have any questions, just feel free to ask.

515
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,380
Great!

516
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,840
Welcome to dinner tonight. I'm buying.

517
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,340
I bought a contour stick when you live streamed yesterday.

518
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,180
You did? That's a very good gift for your girlfriend.

519
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,010
Haven't got one yet. I'll save it for later.

520
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,690
- Save it, save it.
- Funny guy.

521
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,410
- Qianqian.
- What is it?

522
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,700
- I'll leave you to talk. This is Xiaoyan.
- Okay.

523
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,520
Qianqian, I won't join you tonight.

524
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,220
I'm not feeling well. You guys go ahead.

525
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,620
Not feeling well? Are you okay? Should you go to the hospital?

526
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,330
No need. It's just I haven't been sleeping well the last few days.

527
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,410
Just a little headache. Maybe getting a cold.

528
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,280
Very well. We've got this.

529
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,950
Have some good rest.

530
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,870
I'll get back to work, then.

531
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,880
Qianqian.

532
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,530
I'm afraid my work hasn't been satisfactory lately.

533
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,250
Sorry for letting everyone down.

534
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,000
Nothing to be sorry for.

535
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,450
Everyone has bad days at work.

536
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,440
We are a team, we'll share the good and bad times together.

537
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,220
What's it with you today? Something's bothering you?

538
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,260
Nothing. Just a bit under the weather.

539
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,760
Nothing to worry about. Go ahead.

540
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,960
You were looking for me, GM Qin?

541
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,920
Can you courier this bag for me?

542
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,450
Sure. To where?

543
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,830
Forget it. No need to courier.

544
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,350
Very well.

545
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,220
You!

546
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,670
Yes, I'm talking to you.

547
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,170
Did you do something wrong so she doesn't want to see you anymore?

548
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,990
Or are you not cute anymore so she's tired of you?

549
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:53,620
Why isn't she coming to see us?

550
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,930
It seems that she doesn't want to see us.

551
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,850
If she doesn't, do you?

552
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,020
Do you? Perk up. Do you?

553
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,860
If you don't want to, then I'll ask for myself.

554
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,380
Don't blame me.

555
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,360
Let me buy you dinner tonight.

556
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,200
I'll bring the bag also. Same old place. See you there.
