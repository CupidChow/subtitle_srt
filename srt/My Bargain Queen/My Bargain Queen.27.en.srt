00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,030
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,290
I bought some food for you. It's in the breakroom fridge.

4
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,450
You can get it there. I made some marks.

5
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,770
You'll be able to recognize it immediately.

6
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,820
Hello?

7
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,150
I asked Anan to buy the food for you.

8
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,980
I told him to buy a bit more.

9
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,320
It's really not just a little bit more. It's too much.

10
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,500
Now the whole fridge is filled with my food.

11
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,880
Then you can just eat more.

12
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,010
It's okay if you can't finish it. You can share with your colleagues.

13
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,630
- Who thought themselves better than everyone? It's a common fridge.
- I have to go.

14
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,050
I'm so sorry.

15
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, take this.

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,870
I bought these to share with everyone.

17
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,030
It's Team Leader Xia's food! No worries then.

18
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,720
I heard that Xia Qian came to work at our company.

19
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,290
What?

20
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,090
The other shareholders made the decision.

21
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,810
What's that smell?

22
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,160
What are you doing?

23
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,740
You said you didn't want to go out and preferred eating at home.

24
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,540
I wanted to give you a surprise.

25
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,530
Well, it is a surprise indeed.

26
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,490
It's more of a shock! In the future when I'm not home,

27
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,270
you can't enter the kitchen and cook.

28
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,380
Well, what do we do with this?

29
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,080
This... We can't even feed it to the cat.

30
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,820
I never thought that we would end up ordering food delivery at home.

31
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,160
By the way, in the future, you can't enter the kitchen when I'm not here.

32
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,430
Well, what if I need to get...

33
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,440
You can enter the kitchen, but you can't touch the stove.

34
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
Then what if...

35
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,060
You can touch the pan, but you can't pour oil and cook.

36
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm assuming you haven't changed the bandage today.

37
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,100
Not yet.

38
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,210
I'll change it for you.

39
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,560
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone and escape?

40
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,700
How could I leave you alone?

41
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,400
It's okay. I'll change it myself.

42
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,490
Well... let's eat then.

43
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Thank you.

44
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,370
Fu Shuangshuang, are you out of your mind?

45
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,920
Please stop your work for a moment.

46
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,730
This is Miss Chen Manhui.

47
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,390
She will be our deputy manager for now.

48
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,790
Let's welcome her.

49
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,440
I‘m so glad to be working here with you.

50
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,540
This way, please.

51
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,880
Miss Chen, this is your desk.

52
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,350
You can get familiar with the environment here.

53
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,920
Let me know if you have any questions.

54
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,080
Who is that? Manager Wang treats her with extra care, too.

55
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,320
Her father is the Vice GM of Mingcheng Group.

56
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,630
And she's also the best friend of GM Sheng's sister.

57
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,870
All right.

58
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,180
Hey.

59
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,630
I finally get to see you.

60
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,890
People are watching.

61
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,080
She's so timid.

62
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,190
There's no one around.

63
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,860
GM Sheng, I'm so sorry. Here's your document.

64
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,940
And she calls me GM Sheng.

65
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,780
We're just faking a breakup. Is it necessary to try this hard?

66
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,070
That's not going to work. I have to find a chance to see her at lunchtime.

67
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,240
What? She broke up with GM Sheng?

68
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,100
It happened last week.

69
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,580
I thought you all knew.

70
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,440
No.

71
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,610
Don't tell anyone else. Or they'll think I'm releasing the news on purpose.

72
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,860
You can rest assured. I never gossip.

73
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,560
See you later.

74
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,950
Miss Xia broke up with GM Sheng.

75
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,300
They broke up?

77
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,450
I was very respectful to her earlier.

78
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,030
What wasted effort.

79
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,460
She's so hypocritical. We should stay away from that kind of person.

80
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,940
What color is that?

81
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,270
It makes you look so fair.

82
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,400
- Really? I've got an extra one at home. I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
- Yeah, it's so pretty.

83
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,410
- That's so nice of you!
- You've even got fragrance here?

84
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,700
This is so expensive!

85
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,680
No. It's just ordinary stuff.

86
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
I'm so jealous of you!

87
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,880
This looks so nice.

88
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,280
- These are so fancy.
- She's got small lips.

89
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,150
Look at all this stuff on her desk! I love all of them.

90
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,380
- This brand...
- This one is super expensive!

91
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,240
- Well, it's not that expensive.
- Isn't this the limited edition?

92
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,280
- I'm so jealous of you!
- This is super fancy!

93
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,550
- She's got everything here.
- Look at that! I want that, too.

94
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,440
Oh, look! Her toner looks fancy.

95
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm sorry. They're all mine.

96
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,100
I brought them to share with everyone.

97
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,500
Would you like some, Miss Xia?

98
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,080
No, thanks. I brought my own lunch.

99
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,650
Your lunch?

100
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,780
I didn't see a lunchbox when I put all the stuff in there.

101
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,610
Is this what you're looking for?

102
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,980
Yeah. Who put it here?

103
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,410
It was here when I put my stuff in the fridge this morning.

104
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,470
I hope it hasn't gone bad.

105
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,050
I don't think so.

106
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,550
Who wrote this project proposal?

107
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,400
It's Xia Qian, the team leader of Group A.

108
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,250
Ask her to come here. Now!

109
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay. I'll go get her right away.

110
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,900
Team Leader Xia. GM Sheng is looking for you.

111
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,840
Can he wait? I haven't finished my lunch yet.

112
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,980
Stop eating! You can eat later.

113
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,060
Okay, fine.

114
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,950
- GM Sheng.
- GM Sheng, Miss Xia is here.

115
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,610
Manager Wang! Manager Wang!

116
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,390
The hotel app proposal that Xia Qian wrote

117
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,290
seems to have some serious problems.

118
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,180
GM Sheng is bawling at her in anger.

119
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,210
You don't even know how to write a project proposal. What are you doing?

120
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,850
Don't think that since you've achieved something with the semi-finished food project,

121
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,900
you've gained your foothold in Evergreen and you don't have to work hard.

122
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,840
Let me tell you. I can dismiss you from your position at any time. Do you understand?

123
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,820
How's the food?

124
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,350
- Delicious.
- Take it slow.

125
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,860
We have plenty of time. There's no need to rush.

126
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,420
Should I yell, too?

127
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,270
GM Sheng! I understand my problem.

128
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,280
I will work on improving it.

129
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,920
He must be very furious.

130
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,790
I actually read her project proposal.

131
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,220
I don't think there's any problem with it.

132
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,530
I don't know why it made GM Sheng so dissatisfied.

133
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,420
I think it's because GM Sheng resents her because of their breakup.

134
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,560
He's creating difficulties for her on purpose.

135
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,050
That makes sense.

136
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,650
Here's what you'll do.

137
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,420
Rewrite the project proposal.

138
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,230
And a 5,000 words self-criticism letter.

139
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,450
If this happens again, I'll definitely fire you!

140
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,060
Fire me again? 5,000 words? Isn't that too much?

141
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,820
8,000 words. How's that?

142
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Keep eating.

143
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,090
Okay, GM Sheng. I got it.

144
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,920
Just rest. I'll get some water for you.

145
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,720
Jiayu, you can't go!

146
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,760
Fill the glass! Keep drinking!

147
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,520
I'm dreaming again.

148
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,560
Yeah, right. Dreaming.

149
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,530
This dream looks so real.

150
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,650
What are you doing?

151
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,020
Shuangshuang. You're drunk.

152
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,540
I didn't expect you'd be so stubborn in my dream.

153
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,150
- Get off.
- No...

154
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,100
I can see you very clearly.

155
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,530
In my dream, I have a say. So don't resist!

156
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,120
No, you're drunk. You're not sober now.

157
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm not drunk!

158
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,020
Take this off.

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,330
You're drunk, Shuangshuang.

160
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,490
Why is it so difficult to take this off?

161
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,460
Shuangshuang, you're drunk.

162
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,700
You're disobedient! Don't resist!

163
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,850
Let me kiss you.

164
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,300
Shuangshuang.

165
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,700
Shuang...

166
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,630
Have some water with honey.

167
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,660
Why are you here?

168
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,990
What are you talking about?

169
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,690
Don't you remember what happened last night?

170
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,890
You... "Don't resist!"

171
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,520
Aren't you going to admit it?

172
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,760
Who changed my clothes for me?

173
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,790
Needless to say.

174
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,450
What? It can't be.

175
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,250
It wasn't a dream!

176
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,930
It wasn't a dream.

177
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,190
Oh my god.

178
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Why isn't he leaving?

179
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,290
Well... I had no control of myself after I got drunk.

180
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,520
My mom said that I would turn into someone different when I'm drunk.

181
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,890
That was not me at all.

182
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,900
Okay, okay. You don't need to explain it.

183
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,890
I know that you're not an easy girl like that.

184
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,000
You like me.

185
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,170
It's true that I like you.

186
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,970
But this makes me feel so insecure.

187
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,270
So... I will let it pass.

188
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,090
It's okay. As long as you admit that you like me.

189
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,690
I won't let it pass.

190
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,060
This is so frustrating.

191
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,800
Be careful, sir. Watch out.

192
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,900
Sir, please put it next to the smaller fridge.

193
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,590
Just put it there.

194
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,990
We've been asking the admin for a new fridge so many times,

195
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,790
but there was no progress.

196
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,420
Why are they suddenly doing it today?

197
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,860
Don't tell anyone else.

198
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,670
I heard that GM Sheng is dating Chen Manhui.

199
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,900
- Really?
- I've been very close to her lately,

200
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,830
and she's always invited to GM Sheng's family events.

201
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,070
She went to a piano concert with them a few days ago.

202
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,510
Although she didn't say it explicitly, I think it must be the truth.

203
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,630
Good morning, Sister Shuangshuang.

204
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,090
Morning.

205
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,230
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

206
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,030
How do you know?

207
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,170
Anyone with a discerning eye can easily see it.

208
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,730
Then... you have to keep it secret for me!

209
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,200
Keep it a secret?

210
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Why? What's so embarrassing about that?

211
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,160
Because I haven't thought it through! It was just a drunk confession.

212
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,610
I didn't want to do it! It's too early...

213
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,130
Sister Shuangshuang! What are you talking about?

214
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm talking about your crazy behaviors after you were drunk!

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,810
- My crazy behaviors?
- Yeah.

216
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,550
You can barely control yourself when you're drunk. Do you know?

217
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,050
When GM Qin asked me to change your clothes for you, you caught me and wouldn't let go,

218
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,710
and you were trying to kiss me!

219
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,160
You changed my clothes for me?

220
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,530
Yeah! Who else do you think it was?

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,670
Go back to your work.

222
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,770
I have a feeling that there's something going on between Brother Zhening and Xia Qian.

223
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,400
But I don't know what it is.

224
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,960
You mean they might get back together?

225
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,210
Maybe.

226
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,830
As the saying goes, it's easier for women to pursue men.

227
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,290
But there's no progress at all between you and my brother. You should try harder.

228
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,680
I need an opportunity to be with him alone!

229
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,220
He's so busy every day.

230
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,460
And if I bother him every day, it would make me look immature.

231
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,080
I'll figure out a way.

232
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,640
I'm going to check out the hotel in the Nanhu Tourist Destination with Manager Wang of your department,

233
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,750
I might need to stay a night there.

234
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,160
I'm thinking whether I should bring you with us.

235
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,690
Absolutely not. This is too conspicuous.

236
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,320
I've got to go.

237
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,880
The design company sent us the user interface designs of the app. Please take a look.

238
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,620
Okay, leave it to me.

239
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,140
Why do we need to create an E-commerce app?

240
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,440
E-commerce is very popular these days.

241
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,560
Everyone wants a share of the market.

242
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,090
Isn't Evergreen working on their app, too?

243
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,260
The reason that Evergreen can have its own E-commerce app

244
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,420
is because they have their own hotels, ranches,

245
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,480
vegetable gardens and factories for bedding products.

246
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,390
That's their advantage to enter the E-commerce market.

247
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,610
But compared to them, we have rather limited products to offer.

248
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,310
Although our product offering is limited,

249
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,380
we can work with other factories.

250
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,100
This is a decision of the board. We have to get a share

251
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,770
of the E-commerce market.

252
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,600
As this is the decision of the board, I'll find a designer as soon as possible.

253
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,760
- Manager Chen.
- Hi.

254
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,660
Manager Wang.

255
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,510
- Are you looking for me?
- Here's the thing.

256
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm supposed to go on a business trip with GM Sheng this afternoon.

257
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,570
But I'm feeling a bit unwell now.

258
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,630
I hope Manager Chen can go on my behalf.

259
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,360
Okay.

260
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,270
By the way, Miss Chen. In the future,

261
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,000
I hope you can speak for me when you're with Miss Ning Meng.

262
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,830
Did Ning Meng ask you to...?

263
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,230
Okay.

264
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,840
Brother Zhening!

265
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,350
Why are you here?

266
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,810
Manager Wang is feeling unwell. He asked me to come instead.

267
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,290
This is the first time that I'm on a business trip with you, Brother Zhening.

268
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,040
If I do anything inappropriate, please let me know. I'll learn from you.

269
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,930
Since Manager Chen is here for work,

270
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,040
I think we can address each other with our work titles.

271
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,630
Okay. I got it, GM Sheng.

272
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,110
After they come back from the trip, I think Manager Chen and GM Sheng will be officially dating.

273
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,430
- I don't think it will happen so fast.
- You don't understand.

274
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,500
The employee goes on a business trip with the boss. It's the best opportunity

275
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,520
for a man and a woman to have sparks of love.

276
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,990
I heard that Manager Wang was pretending to be sick,

277
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,610
and that GM Sheng personally asked for Manager Chen to go on the trip with him.

278
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,420
Well, looks like they both have feelings for each other. After they come back this time,

279
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,760
Manager Chen will become Mrs. Sheng!

280
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,540
- Who knows.
- Hey, I think they're a good fit for each other.

281
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,280
Hey, let me say, Manager Chen is a great person.

282
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,870
If she becomes Mrs. Sheng then we will have good days ahead of us.

283
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,910
You guys are so close. When the time comes, make sure to take care of me too.

284
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,530
Earlier...

285
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,310
Jiayu said that last night

286
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,010
she changed my clothes.

287
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,130
So, we...

288
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,060
Although I'm not any honorable gentleman,

289
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,970
I wouldn't take an opportunity at your expense.

290
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,380
My lying was so I could hear you tell me that you still had feelings.

291
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,690
I-I said that? I wasn't sober at the time.

292
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,180
You just heard drunk talk.

293
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,950
Right.

294
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
There is something from work

295
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,690
that I want to ask for your help.

296
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,890
Work.

297
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,300
What's up?

298
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,150
I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend.

299
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,430
What? Me?

300
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,810
Pretend to be your girlfriend?

301
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,770
The thing is... I scheduled a meeting with that designer couple.

302
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,930
For dinner, tomorrow evening.

303
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,500
But I am still missing a partner.

304
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,750
The designer's wife coincidentally went to the same college as you.

305
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,820
Also the same major. I think you two would have much in common to talk about.

306
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,230
This is not within my work description and is not written in the contract.

307
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,290
I know it isn't within the contract,

308
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,130
but that designer took on another company's project.

309
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,830
I want to invite him to complete this project first, the two-month app project.

310
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,900
So, tomorrow's dinner party is really important to me.

311
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,650
I am not asking you to do something from the position of a superior,

312
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,380
but from the position of a friend

313
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,460
to ask for a favor. Please, help me.

314
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,790
Of course, this isn't just a free favor.

315
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,380
If you are willing to have dinner with us,

316
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,060
you can pay off part of the debt.

317
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,990
I don't plan to make this deal with you.

318
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,110
I am full.

319
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,180
Want to trick me again? I won't fall for it again.

320
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,860
What do I do?

321
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,950
Hello. Don't worry.

322
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,150
I will surely invite the designer over.

323
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,940
The most important thing right now is that I don't have a partner for the dinner.

324
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,650
I will take responsibility, rest assured.

325
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,060
If I cannot invite over the best designer,

326
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,880
then I will quit my job as general manager.

327
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,820
- What...
- I will do as promised.

328
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,650
Shuangshuang, if there isn't anything else, I will be leaving now.

329
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,350
Wait.

330
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,900
The deal you talked about,

331
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,500
it's not that I can't agree.

332
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,360
But the debt payment you said is it still valid?

333
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,400
How much can it pay off?

334
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,650
All of it?

335
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,550
50,000 Yuan.

336
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,330
That is okay. Then let's clap on it, no regrets.

337
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,840
Then it's settled.

338
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,820
See you tomorrow.

339
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,050
To save you.

340
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,650
Assistant An.

341
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,510
Manager Chen, in an hour there will be a meeting for you to prepare.

342
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,450
At GM Sheng's room?

343
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,410
Yes, please excuse me.

344
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,040
Thanks.

345
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,360
Hello, Ning Meng. I will be going to a meeting with Brother Zhening.

346
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,790
At his room, just the two of us.

347
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,100
What does Brother Zhening like to see girls wear?

348
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,870
I don't know about that either.

349
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,650
Just nothing too over the top is good.

350
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,960
Come in, the door is open.

351
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,950
GM Sheng.

352
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,280
Thank you.

353
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,590
I think that if this meeting has more people participating in the discussion,

354
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,220
there could be more ideas flowing.

355
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,090
I also think so.

356
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:08,190
Manager Chen, what are your thoughts on the hotel E-commerce app?

357
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,700
I think it shall be in accordance with the headquarters in terms of the strategies.

358
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,720
Of course, towards boosting consumption, we need some more innovation.

359
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,550
What kind of innovation?

360
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:27,250
What kind... I haven't thought it through yet.

361
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,630
The strategies applied at the headquarter and the holiday resort should be completely different.

362
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,440
First, they have different positioning and target audiences.

363
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,430
Therefore, the E-commerce strategy shall be operated in completely different ways.

364
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,600
How would it be the same?

365
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,680
What did I say? If we brought you along, it would've been better.

366
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,770
If you were here, tonight's meeting wouldn't have been so unproductive.

367
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,630
Then, will you stay another day?

368
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,640
No need.

369
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,050
Actually, this time was to inspect. To actually resolve the problem is still far.

370
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,920
Then that is good.

371
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,640
Do you mind that I went on a business trip with Chen Manhui?

372
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,710
To say I'm not bothered, is impossible. But I trust you.

373
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,760
I haven't noticed before but I have strong possessiveness.

374
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,080
I already knew that.

375
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,160
How did you know?

376
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,720
Have you noticed these few days I was the one to reach out to you?

377
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,400
Every time you were in a rush and hurriedly ended the calls.

378
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,260
But today, you took the initiative to contact me.

379
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:07,350
And the things you say have been more than before. I know you care about me.

380
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,060
Anan said the grapes here are really great.

381
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,450
I will bring some back for you as an apology.

382
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,430
- Assistant An.
- Yes. Morning Manager Chen.

383
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,970
Is GM Sheng not in the room?

384
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,900
He left for headquarters at 7:00 a.m.

385
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,980
Really? I thought we would ride back together tomorrow morning.

386
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,480
You don't have to worry about that. GM Sheng had instructed me to drive you back.

387
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,270
This...

388
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,360
This isn't for you.

389
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,850
Let's go.

390
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,780
Brother Zhening brought a box of grapes back and I saw Xia Qian was eating grapes at lunch.

391
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,320
It should be a coincidence.

392
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,850
I don't know, but Xia Qian irks me more and more.

393
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,020
Is this okay?

394
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,880
Then, let's go.

395
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,600
Team Leader Xia, Manager Wang says he needs the proposal by tomorrow.

396
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,460
Tomorrow? Wasn't it next week that we discussed the exchange?

397
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,150
The meeting was advanced, we might need Team Leader Xia to work harder.

398
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,440
Sure. I will do my best.

399
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,240
[Zhening]

400
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,820
Then, Team Leader Xia, work hard.

401
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,610
What is it?

402
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,810
I finished all my work today, there isn't much left to do. I will bring you home tonight.

403
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,450
Tonight? No, I need to work overtime.

404
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,810
It's not convenient for me to take calls right now, I am hanging up first.

405
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,700
Here.

406
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,450
What?

407
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,320
Cheers.

408
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,670
Shuangshuang what a coincidence.

409
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:29,370
Professor Gu is also my teacher. My final paper almost didn't make it because of him.

410
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,050
Professor Gu is super strict.

411
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,900
Hey, do you remember the Roast Duck Bowl at our school?

412
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,340
Of course, I remember. I remember back then

413
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,560
we would run after class ended to get it or it would sell out.

414
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,030
I'm glad to remember things about our school, I really miss it.

415
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,620
Here, don't just chat and forget to eat.

416
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:53,780
I'm happy. It's hard to meet someone who is from my school and also my junior sister.

417
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,550
Eat. Eat some first.

418
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,770
GM Qin, how did you and Shuangshuang meet?

419
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,420
It's a long story.

420
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,310
Then let's talk about something simple. Where did you first meet?

421
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,220
The first time? The first time, on the rooftop.

422
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,560
- Rooftop?
- Oh, so romantic.

423
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,660
Actually, it isn't that romantic.

424
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,320
Oh...

425
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
Here.

426
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,070
GM Qin when did you start liking Shuangshuang?

427
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,640
Actually, I-I don't really know myself.

428
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,440
I started liking her before I realized it.

429
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,050
So love at first sight.

430
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,490
- Then how about Shuangshuang?
- Me?

431
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,540
I... Well not as early as him.

432
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,860
Along the way.

433
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,010
Plus, I forgot the exact time.

434
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,440
Let's not talk about us, there's not much to say. What about you two. You guys are also very romantic.

435
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,440
- Us? Our story is a long story.
- We met in high school.

436
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,490
It's like childhood sweethearts. There are a lot of stories.

437
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,260
That's great! What we want to hear.

438
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,760
Okay. Sure, let's keep chatting.

439
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,360
Take a break and have a midnight snack?

440
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,630
You scared me. Why are you here?

441
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,730
Only you are working overtime, I confirmed it. No one else.

442
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,300
Let's go.

443
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,850
Come on.

444
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,480
Today, I'm super happy. Let's meet again another time.

445
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,430
Then we will leave our hotel app to you.

446
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,280
- Okay.
- Bye-bye, thank you!

447
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,770
Oh, are you all right?

448
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,820
They said goodbye?

449
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,690
Yeah, they just left. Are you good?

450
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,380
Are you really drunk or faking it?

451
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,390
Are you really drunk or faking it?

452
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,780
Are you all right?

453
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,990
I'm happy today.

454
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,010
What?

455
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,110
Actually,

456
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,740
it's not that bad being my girlfriend.

457
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,430
Mister, can you drive slower.

458
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,070
Sure.

459
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,050
I have something to say. Let's change our contact names on our phones.

460
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,130
I almost got caught during your call to me today.

461
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,290
Think of some codenames?

462
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,850
Codenames? Niu Lang Zhi Nu. 
(TN: Chinese folklore about two starcrossed lovers of a Cow Farmer and a Celestial Princess)

463
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:40,270
Don't you think this Niu Lang is a little...

464
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,560
I'm just joking, pretend I didn't say anything.

465
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,160
Then, how about two numbers?

466
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Numbers? Think of some.

467
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,540
89 and 10

468
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,620
- Meaning?
- 8, 9 are never far away from 10.

469
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,230
GM Sheng.

470
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,050
It's a little cheesy.

471
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,460
I think it's romantic.

472
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,370
Change it then. But I want 89 you take 10.

473
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,540
Sure.

474
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,910
Team Leader Xia, you are still working?

475
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,260
Yeah, why did you come back?

476
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,810
I forgot my keys.

477
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,020
Quickly go get them then.

478
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,250
Who is that?

479
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,040
A coworker, we are discussing the plan.

480
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,620
Okay, then.

481
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,100
- That was scary. Quick she's back.
- Bye-bye.

482
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,060
I'm leaving first, working hard.

483
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,660
I can't hold it in anymore.

484
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,580
She didn't notice that it was me, right?

485
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,640
No, if she knew it was you, she would have come over to say hi.

486
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
Don't be so daring next time. This is too scary.

487
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,060
Did you change it?

488
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,210
Eat some more.

489
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,800
Team Leader Xia is dating in the office?

490
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,910
I saw it clear as day.

491
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:25,100
A man was with Team Leader Xia for the evening shift and sharing a midnight snack together.

492
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,700
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

493
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,030
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

494
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,400
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

495
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,610
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

496
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,900
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

497
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,190
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

498
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,680
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

499
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,440
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

500
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,460
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

501
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,100
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

502
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,990
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

503
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,150
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

504
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,880
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

505
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,310
♫ I am here anyway ♫

506
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,170
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

507
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,250
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

508
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,000
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

509
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,940
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

510
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,060
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

511
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,050
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

512
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,300
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

513
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,800
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

514
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,880
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

515
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,130
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

516
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,470
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

517
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,940
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

518
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,700
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

519
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,830
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

520
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:53,320
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

521
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,280
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

522
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,510
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

523
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,140
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

524
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,590
♫ I am here anyway ♫

525
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,430
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

526
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,660
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

527
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,940
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

528
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,040
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

529
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,410
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
