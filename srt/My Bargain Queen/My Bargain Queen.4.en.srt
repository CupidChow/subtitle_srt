00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,830
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,200
Well... you kept the cat secret for me as well.

4
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,140
We are friends and friends help each other.

5
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
What's wrong?

6
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,560
In fact...

7
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,590
In fact...

8
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,370
I'm a spy.

9
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,350
What spy?

10
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,570
A corporate spy.

11
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,020
I don't even know Qin Hebo.

12
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,920
I made it all up.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,710
My goal is to actually

14
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,180
steal something from him.

15
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,540
Steal what?

16
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,690
You have to swear you won't tell anyone else.

17
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,010
I swear.

18
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,940
Your hotel's wedding guest list for May.

19
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,540
That's it?

20
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,160
This is such a big secret.

21
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,310
Why didn't you react at all?

22
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,080
Then, why don't I tell you a secret, too?

23
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,230
I am also a spy.

24
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,840
What spy?

25
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,860
My goal is to take over the entire Evergreen Hotel.

26
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,780
I'm not joking with you.

27
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,040
I am also not joking with you.

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,970
Forget it. Just take it as if I never said anything.

29
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,010
Meow.

30
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,630
I have so many hardships.

31
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,910
If you can understand me, that would be great!

32
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,010
Okay, I understand. It's fine.

33
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,740
You go ahead. It's okay.

34
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,980
Something just came up, the agent can't come. Let's eat.

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,450
Okay.

36
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,100
If there's no other way, you can get him drunk

37
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,540
and when he is unconscious, trick him into giving you the password.

38
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,130
GM Sheng,

39
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,070
why don't we drink?

40
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,670
What did you say?

41
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,970
It was just a suggestion.

42
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,780
Don't take it too seriously.

43
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,950
During work hours, you can't drink alcohol. Understand?

44
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,930
You didn't drink.

45
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,750
Why are you dizzy?

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,390
What are you doing?

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
I am dizzy.

48
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,410
Are you okay?

49
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,190
I can support you until there.

50
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,050
Excuse me.

51
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,450
What is this?

52
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,850
D-Don't take it off.

53
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,230
You have a fever.

54
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,610
It is a high fever, 39℃.

55
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,040
You must have gotten it from Anan. I put this on so you will feel better.

56
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay.

57
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,280
The medicine is right here. Remember to take it later.

58
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,830
Okay.

59
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,250
You didn't eat anything for dinner.

60
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,390
If you take medicine on an empty stomach, you will feel uncomfortable.

61
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,730
You can't even hear what I'm saying.

62
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,930
Sheng Zhening?

63
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,060
Sheng Zhening?

64
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,280
Wake up, drink some of this mung bean soup I made.

65
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,980
No, no.

66
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,770
I don't like sweets.

67
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't like sweets?

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,990
Let me tell you,

69
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,740
this mung bean soup doesn't have sugar.

70
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,120
But this is the best food to break your fever.

71
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,200
When I was little, I used to drink this; I didn't need medicine.

72
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
Listen to me.

73
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,040
You want me to feed you?

74
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,940
What are you doing?

75
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,760
Your hands are dirty.

76
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,490
Brother,

77
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,810
I washed them.

78
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,280
I washed them three times. Three times. Three times.

79
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,460
Oh.

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,180
Hurry, you need to work with me.

81
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,810
I am using a physical cooling method. It will make you feel a lot better.

82
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,910
Thank you.

83
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you not feeling well?

84
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,220
Xiao He.

85
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,560
Director Lu, you're looking for me?

86
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,880
I just attended a regular meeting and they decided,

87
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,690
starting next week, two of my patients will be transferred to you.

88
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,770
What's wrong?

89
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,740
According to the initial tests, your treatments may be more suitable than mine.

90
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,020
Xiao He, your...

91
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,300
It's fine.

92
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,630
Xiao He, what's wrong? You seem absent-minded.

93
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,950
Oh, nothing.

94
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,150
My last patient's condition is a bit complicated and I am still figuring out the solution.

95
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh.

96
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,770
I heard that you were getting married soon. Have you guys set the date yet?

97
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,400
Almost.

98
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,580
You are getting married pretty young.

99
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,990
Soon you will understand what a sweet burden is.

100
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,060
Director Lu, stop teasing me.

101
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,840
Okay, I won't bother you anymore. I'll head out.

102
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,850
I can't wait to celebrate with you at your wedding.

103
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,290
Take care, Director Lu.

104
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,540
GM Sheng, you're better?

105
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,810
You've recovered? The fever is gone?

106
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm totally recovered.

107
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,640
Where is she?

108
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,230
Miss Xia took care of you last night, so I told her to go get some rest.

109
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,590
Good.

110
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,970
Miss Xia sent over some mung bean soup.

111
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,050
Got it.

112
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,880
That thing... did you tell her?

113
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,590
What thing?

114
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,710
You mean the thing about turning her down?

115
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,430
I didn't tell her.

116
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't tell her yet.

117
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,930
GM Sheng, are you...

118
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,920
I'll tell her when we go back.

119
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,030
If I accidentally see her again, it'll be awkward.

120
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,590
Oh.

121
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,940
Miss Xia said you can't drink coffee when you're sick.

122
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,810
In the future, just change the coffee to milk for breakfast.

123
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,920
Okay.

124
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,370
You can go.

125
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,410
Hello? Ms. Ning Meng?

126
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,880
I have a situation.

127
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,060
For the schedule thing,

128
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,410
I really can't help.

129
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,960
Sister Xia, don't say that. You're my only hope.

130
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,800
I know and can understand your situation.

131
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,170
But you must understand my situation, I already promised you and will do everything I can to help.

132
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,060
If I really had a choice, I wouldn't give up.

133
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,990
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,140
Also, I will refund your order.

135
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,410
Sister Xia, I remember you said before.

136
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,210
Isn't there also an option regarding the May wedding list?

137
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,410
I've tried already.

138
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,960
I don't have Sheng Zhening's computer password, so I can't see the documents.

139
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,220
Sister Xia, I may know his password.

140
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,750
How do you know it?

141
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,610
Sister Xia, this is...

142
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,820
It's a long story. Let's meet up and I'll explain.

143
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,780
I'll go to your room.

144
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,370
Okay, I'll wait for you.

145
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,310
You said Sheng Zhening is your brother?

146
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,040
Previously, he broke the contract because he found out that I hired you.

147
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,910
Wait.

148
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,270
Are you two, brother and sister, messing with me?

149
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,190
Sister Xia, I'm really not.

150
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,700
Then, why didn't you tell me earlier?

151
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,500
If I told you, would you still take this order?

152
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,540
Of course not.

153
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,940
You need to be clear. This is the conflict between you and your brother, so solve it yourselves.

154
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,760
Isn't it inappropriate for an outsider like me to be involved?

155
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,900
I know I put you in a hard spot.

156
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,360
Sister Xia, I really want to have this wedding.

157
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,550
I believe that if my brother was willing to spend time to understand the relationship between me and Zhijuan,

158
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,120
he wouldn't have objected.

159
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,470
But I don't know why, this time he just won't listen to anything I say.

160
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,710
I also understand his temper.

161
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,960
If he makes a decision, it doesn't matter what I say.

162
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,510
Sister Xia, if you don't want to help me, I really don't know what to do.

163
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,420
Then your...

164
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,050
Your boyfriend.

165
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,200
Is he really that great that you won't marry anyone else?

166
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,130
When I was at my most difficult and saddest time,

167
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,700

That you are over him?

331
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,580
I think you have psychological distortions after being dumped.

Listen to me, Shuangshuang.

333
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,640
For whatever reason and no matter how hard it is,

334
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,110
I'm definitely going to complete this order.

335
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,940
Okay.

Hello?

337

GM Sheng, Miss Xia has suddenly decided to leave the hotel.

338
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,460
I've tried everything I could, but couldn't change her mind.

339
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,120
- She returned?
 - Yes.

340
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,520
She just returned. She was soaking wet.

341
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,980
I thought you went to the beach together. What happened?

342
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,320
Okay. I'll be right back.

343
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,870
Okay.

344
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,760
Good for you! How did you get the list?

345
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,350
It's a secret.

346
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,140
A secret? I don't even need you to tell me about it.

347
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,950
You must have bribed Qin Hebo's driver, and asked him to steal it for you.

348
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,530
You can even guess it?

349
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,260
No wonder you are a corporate spy.

350
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,870
No, it's intuition.

351
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,160
Tell me. How much money do you want?

352
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,300
Don't talk about money. It hurts our friendship.

353
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,900
How about this? You owe me one this time.

354
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,730
Maybe I'll need your help in the future.

355
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't believe you're so generous!

356
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,200
Something's not right. You must be up to something.

357
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,980
I'm up to nothing.

358
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,740
I'm doing it for you as a friend.

359
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,060
You can't be having a crush on me, right?

360
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,700
Don't think about it, I'm telling you!

361
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,050
I'm very realistic. I'm not interested in an old driver.

362
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,370
I don't want to disappoint you.

363
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,410
Yeah, right.

364
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,950
You've just recovered, and you walked in the rain.

365
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,180
Please don't get yourself sick again.

366
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,910
Did she say anything before she left?

367
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,150
Here's some information that Miss Xia put together for the car bulk-buying project.

368
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,900
She compared Evergreen's car orders in the past five years,

369
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,400
and did some research on the car agency we're working with.

370
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,280
She found out that Manager Xu in our Procurement Department has been doing something fishy.

371
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,510
He's been colluding with the agent and accepting kickbacks from our orders.

372
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,390
Until now, we've lost at least one million yuan.

373
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,230
What do we do?

374
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,730
Stick to the rules. Submit all the evidence and relevant information to the authorities.

375
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,360
I actually don't think Miss Xia is a bad person.

376
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,720
She's smart and hardworking.

377
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,960
It doesn't look like she's here just to steal things from you.

378
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,740
I'm tired. You can go now.

Starting tomorrow, I don't have to go to work at Evergreen!

Sister Xia, you've changed your mind?

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,060
Yes. I've got Evergreen's wedding list for May.

404
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,590
But we may need to promise them compensation when we negotiate.

405
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,790
As long as they're willing to change their wedding date,

406
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,960
I can even pay for their whole wedding!

407
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,920
Okay, I understand. I'll make some preparations.

408
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,690
Thank you, Sister Xia.

409
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,430
No problem. It's my job.

410
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,200
- I'll count on you for it.
- Don't worry.

411
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,730
I’ll be on my way then.

412
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,530
I'll see you then.

413
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,760
This is the list and information of our clients who are having their weddings in our hotel in May.

414
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,220
There are so many couples. Do you think Miss Xia will talk to each one of them?

415
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,570
I don't think so.

416
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,320
It will be very ineffective.

417
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,560
She will definitely find the couples that are most likely to be persuaded.

418
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,730
And make a critical hit.

419
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,790
How about this couple who booked for a wedding on May 5th?

420
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,620
- Impossible.
- Why?

421
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,190
We can tell that the couple who booked for May 5th are Evergreen's old customers.

422
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,620
The groom's graduation dinner and his sister's wedding banquet were both held at Evergreen.

423
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,190
Obviously, Evergreen Hotel means a lot to them.

424
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,260
What about the couple who booked for May 25th?

425
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,110
They both work office jobs and they don't make a lot of money.

426
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,060
- Do you think they'll be persuaded?
- Nor will they.

427
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,400
The couple who booked for May 25 may not be rich,

428
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,590
but they met each other at Evergreen Hotel.

429
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,490
Evergreen Hotel witnessed their love. It's impossible.

430
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,460
The couple who booked for May 8th might change their mind.

431
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,190
"Is the wedding ceremony about the two of us or about the two families?"

432
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,400
"I always dreamed about taking a wedding trip to the Aegean, but my dream didn't come true."

Although the bride wants a wedding trip, they've booked our hotel.

434

They must have thought it through.

It's such an important event. Can we persuade her?

438
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,100
It's exactly because it's such an important event, that she should follow her heart.
