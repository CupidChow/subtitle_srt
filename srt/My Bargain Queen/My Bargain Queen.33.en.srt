[Episode 33]

3
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,360
- Bye! See you tomorrow!
- Bye-bye!

4
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,190
Bye-bye!

5
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,310
Team Leader Xia! Team Leader Xia!

6
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,140
You work so hard! You've been working overtime so much recently.

7
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,630
I have no choice. We have a great deal of feedback on the app.

8
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,330
Thanks for working so hard! We're heading home!

9
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,420
Okay. See you.

10
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,300
Bye-bye!

11
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,780
Let me tell you, Team Leader Xia

12
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,690
is waiting for GM Sheng.

13
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,630
- Really?
- Of course!

14
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,230
I was working late,

15
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,020
and several times, I saw GM Sheng

16
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,740
picked her up from work in person.

17
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,320
That's the benefit of working overtime? I want that, too!

18
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,590
GM Sheng, you've been working the whole day. You barely ate anything.

19
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,750
Please take a break.

20

[Anan]

21
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,670
- Hello?
 - Hello, Miss Xia.

22
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,410
Can you please come to GM Sheng's room now?

23
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,340
It's urgent.

24
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,500
What happened? Has the doctor been here?

25
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,070
Yes. He took some medicine just now and fell asleep.

26
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,780
Miss Xia.

27
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,230
Actually, it's also hard for me to see you and GM Sheng being like this.

28
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,730
You didn't contact him, and he doesn't feel it's right to reach out to you either.

29
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,740
Why is he sick all of a sudden?

30
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,230
Do you remember the team-building order of Jiangong Group?

31
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,060
- Yes.
- Langyue took it away.

32
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,770
Jiangong Group has been one of our biggest clients.

33
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,660
After Langyue took the order away,

34
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,820
GM Sheng has been working so much every day.

35
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,690
He had no time to take a break.

36
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,870
I think his immune system became weak because he was too tired. So he caught a fever.

37
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll spend some time with him.

38
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't leave.

39
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm not leaving.

40
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,950
I'll be here with you.

41
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,250
Why is it you?

42
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,160
He should be fine now.

43
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm leaving.

44
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,160
Shall I ask someone to drive you home?

45
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,220
No, there's no need. Anan,

46
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
please don't tell him that I came here to see him.

47
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,250
Why?

48
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,630
There's no reason.

49
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,400
We'll definitely get back together.

50
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,570
But not now.

51
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,760
- I'm leaving.
- Take care.

52
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,780
Sister Qian, have some coffee.

53
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,690
Thank you, Xiaoai.

54
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,680
Sister Qian is working on a new marketing plan for Evergreen. It's too complicated.

55
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,470
It involves so many different categories.

56
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,730
Do you know how to create a data model?

57
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't know how to do it. Shuangshuang was in charge of that before.

58
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,450
Sister Qian is working too hard.

59
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,600
You're up.

60
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,500
Have some breakfast.

61
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,140
Notify the Marketing Department there is a meeting at 9:30 a.m.

62
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,200
GM Sheng,

63
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,800
the doctor suggested that you should rest for a few days.

64
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
My fever has gone down. I'm fine.

65
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
I'll notify them.

66
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,500
Wait a moment, Anan.

67
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Well...

68
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,200
Was Xia Qian here last night?

69
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
No.

70
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,100
Why do I have a feeling

71
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,900
that I saw her?

72
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,500
It might have been a dream.

73
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,900
I heard you call Miss Xia's name in your dream yesterday.

74
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
You can go.

75
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

76
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,400
Did you say that the accident involving Old GM Sheng was related to Qianqian?

77
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I don't know the details, but their engagement got canceled, too.

78
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
How is Qianqian now?

79
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Qianqian is working like crazy. Nobody can stop her.

80
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Langyue took away an order from Evergreen,

81
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,500
and Sister Qian is working on a new group buying plan as a backup.

82
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm calling you

83
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
to ask if you're busy and if you can come and help Sister Qian.

84
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,900
There are too many categories involved in the new plan.

85
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,300
We might need to build a data model for it. Neither Xiaoai or I know how to do it.

86
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,800
- So...
- No problem, I'll help you guys.

87
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
That's great.

88
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
I'll wait for you.

89
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,700
Boss, I want to ask for some leave.

90
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Can I take a few days off from Money Box?

91
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,700
Why?

92
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Evergreen has experienced some troubles.

93
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,800
Qianqian must be having a hard time. I want to go help.

94
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Go.

95
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,800
Why? Were you worried that I wouldn't let you go?

96
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,600
No.

97
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,900
Xia Qian is such a good friend of yours.

98
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300
I understand your feelings.

99
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
Thank you.

100
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
Evergreen got into trouble

101
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,600
because the Jiangong Group order was taken away by Langyue Hotel.

102
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,360
Don't you want to get some information out of me?

103
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm sure it wasn't you who did it.

104
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
I believe what you said last time,

105
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,200
that you'll improve your relationship with Sheng Zhening.

106
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
I trust you.

107
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,480
Langyue will lose money

108
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,100
by accepting the order of Jiangong Group.

109
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,800
I also found it strange.

110
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
So I'm looking into it now. I'll let you know if there's any update.

111
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
All right, don't worry.

112
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,790
Boss Xia.

113
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Shuangshuang!

114
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I heard that you need help with data modeling.

115
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm here as part-time help.

116
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
Mu Xiaoyan!

117
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Don't blame him. He told me because he wanted to help you.

118
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,500
Right. It's still Sister Shuangshuang who understands me.

119
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
Thank you.

120
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,100
Where's the data?

121
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,400
It's all of this.

122
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
No problem.

123
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
Sister Shuangshuang is here!

124
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,100
I prepared snacks for everyone.

125
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,000
Great!

126
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,400
This is my favorite.

127
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
Done!

128
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you, Shuangshuang.

129
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's no need to thank me.

130
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Take a look.

131
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,520
You did it, I trust you.

132
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm almost done, too.

133
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
What are you doing?

134
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,300
I'll send these over to Manager Wang.

135
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
What's the rush? You should go upstairs and take a break.

136
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
You're not an immortal.

137
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,400
You know me. I won't sleep well if I don't send these over.

138
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,300
You've been working all night. You must be tired. Go sleep in my room.

139
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Is it so urgent?

140
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,800
Yeah. I won't rest well until I finish.

141
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
You work too hard.

142
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm fine, really.

143
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Mom.

144
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
I bought breakfast for you. Let's eat.

145
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,100
I'll skip breakfast. I need to send some documents.

146
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,400
Where are you going? You should eat first.

147
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,800
I've got work to do.

148
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
It's urgent. I'm leaving.

149
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Shuangshuang hasn't had breakfast yet. You two can eat.

150
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Aunt, Qianqian is taking some documents to Evergreen.

151
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
She'll be back after she's done.

152
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,800
How can she always work so hard like that?

153
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,000
I understand her. Maybe she wants to keep herself busy.

154
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
That way she won't think about anything else.

155
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
Let me carry that.

156
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,800
Let's eat breakfast.

157
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,100
We can save some food for them.

158
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
Great.

159
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,600
This group buying plan is very good.

160
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,200
If we can launch it before the holiday,

161
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
maybe we can improve our business by a large amount.

162
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
That's what I'm thinking, too.

163
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,200
Manager Wang, can you give it to GM Sheng for me?

164
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Wouldn't it be more convenient if you give it to him yourself?

165
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I can't. It's work. We should follow the procedures.

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Fair enough.

167
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,000
Thank you, Manager Wang.

168
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm leaving now.

169
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Go ahead.

170
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,700
Since everyone agrees that Team Leader Xia's plan is feasible, all departments should implement it as soon as possible.

171
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,500
That's all for today's meeting. You may leave.

172
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Manager Wang.

173
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,100
When Xia Qian gave you the plan, did she say anything?

174
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,800
She didn't.

175
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,000
GM Sheng, did you like the engagement gift that I prepared for you and Team Leader Xia?

176
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,100
What gift?

177
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
The engagement gift...

178
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
GM Sheng, Manager Hu from Haiyu Group is waiting for you in the office.

179
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Let's head down now.

180
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,300
Nothing else. GM Sheng, I'll leave you to your work.

181
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,500
You're awake.

182
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
Mom.

183
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Don't move. Lie down.

184
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,800
What happened? Why am I in the hospital?

185
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
What do you think happened?

186
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
You don't sleep, you don't eat.

187
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
How could you not end up in the hospital?

188
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Don't you know that you have hypoglycemia?

189
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
How can you not take good care of yourself?

190
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
I was taking chicken soup to you,

191
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
and I saw you passed out on the ground.

192
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,400
If I didn't show up,

193
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
I don't know what could have happened.

194
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Look at you.

195
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,130
Mom.

196
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm sorry to make you worry.

197
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Xia Qian,

198
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
I know it's hard for you.

199
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
How about this?

200
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Let's call Xiao Sheng and ask him to come over.

201
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm fine.

202
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,000
And he's been quite busy recently. Let's not distract him.

203
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm fine.

204
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
I haven't eaten for so long,

205
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm hungry.

206
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Look at you... I was in a rush and left the chicken soup at home.

207
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I'll make you an instant white fungus soup. You can eat it first.

208
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
Here.

209
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,900
It's a bit hot.

210
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Here. Eat.

211
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,900
Is it hot?

212
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
What else do you want to eat?

213
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,800
I want fried prawns.

214
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Stop messing around. You're still in the hospital hooked up to an IV. You can't digest it if you eat greasy food like that.

215
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,700
I want it!

216
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Or Wasabi Octopus.

217
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,000
I want it!

218
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
I'll get you something else.

219
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,900
Wait for me.

220
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,600
Keep an eye on it. There's a bell here.

221
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,200
Mom.

222
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,230
Thank you.

223
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,800
Wait for me.

224
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,790
Come and see me.

225
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,200
GM Sheng, you called me?

226
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Did Xia Qian come here?

227
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,300
Miss Xia did not come here.

228
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,200
This is a candy box, always hanging on her bag.

229
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
If she didn't come here,

230
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,800
why is it on my sofa?

231
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Actually, it was Miss Xia who asked me not to tell you.

232
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That day you had a fever, Miss Xia took care of you the whole night.

233
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,800
She waited for your fever to subside, then she left.

234
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,600
GM Sheng,

235
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,100
actually, I have something to say but don't know if I should.

236
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Actually, it's tough for both of you to be separated for a long time.

237
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Why don't you take the initiative?

238
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,000
You're a man, right?

239
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,200
Also, today, I heard from Mu Xiaoyan,

240
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
when Miss Xia was busy doing the group purchase plan at the office,

241
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
she fainted at Worth or Not's door.

242
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
After that?

243
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Now she's at home, she's okay.

244
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,500
So much. How am I supposed to eat it all?

245
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,200
Eat some. Fruits will not take up space and will replenish vitamins.

246
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
- Can't eat.
- Eat some.

247
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,900
Mom.

248
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,700
Give it to me.

249
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,200
I know how to eat.

250
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,400
You go back quickly. How can Uncle Hu handle it by himself?

251
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Tonight, I'm not going back. I will sleep here, I'll accompany you.

252
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,200
No need.

253
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,400
Don't worry, I know how to take care of myself.

254
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,500
Later on,

255
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
I'll finish this fruit then go to sleep.

256
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,400
If you need anything, please call me.

257
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,700
Sleep early.

258
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,100
I know.

259
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Don't you often get hypoglycemia?

260
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,900
After you have it, it becomes more convenient.

261
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Now, I'm so happy.

262
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Isn't it great to be happy?

263
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Xiao Sheng!

264
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,110
I want to talk to you.

265
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
About your father's car accident,

266
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
I feel really sorry.

267
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,900
Auntie, It is already in the past, and you don't have to be sorry.

268
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,600
Moreover, Xia Qian shouldn't need to feel responsible for it.

269
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,000
But this thing will always be in the middle of you both.

270
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,300
Can you let it go?

271
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,500
Xia Qian is my daughter,

272
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,400
I know her too well. She is stubborn.

273
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,200
This thing even if you let it go,

274
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,700
I believe Xia Qian might not let it go.

275
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,900
Do you think it will be good for both of you?

276
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,800
Xiao Sheng, the journey both of you took

277
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,200
was really not easy. I can see it all.

278
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Honestly, you are a good child.

279
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,990
I really like you.

280
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,000
If this thing had not happened,

281
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,100
I believe you would have been my good son-in-law.

282
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,600
But now this has happened,

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't have the confidence to support you and Xia Qian together.

284
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Aunt,

285
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
if you have something to say, say it directly.

286
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,700
I know now both of you are in the phase of being deeply in love.

287
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
As long as both of you have each other in your hearts,

288
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,000
any difficulties will be overcome.

289
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,200
But real marriage life is not like that.

290
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,800
I have been through married life.

291
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,000
Even the most loving couples,

292
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
getting married, being together, living together a long time,

293
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,200
will have conflicts.

294
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,300
You think about it. When you get to that point,

295
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,600
what will Xia Qian do?

296
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,800
Xia Qian because she feels guilty,

297
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
will not quarrel with you.

298
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,600
She will hide all her real feelings.

299
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,200
She will try very hard to maintain the marriage.

300
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Do you think this kind of marriage will be blissful?

301
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,000
Again I will say something that you won't like to hear.

302
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,600
I am also selfish, I'm also a mother.

303
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm not willing to let my own daughter

304
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,000
live with self-blame and guilt.

305
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,600
It's better to not prolong the pain.

306
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
I hope you break up with Xia Qian.

307
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,400
And it's you who should initiate it.

308
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,500
[10]

309
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,100
Hello?

310
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,400
What are you doing?

311
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm not doing anything.

312
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,600
Too boring upstairs, so I'm sitting outside, getting some fresh air.

313
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,080
I heard you were sick.

314
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,700
Just...

315
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,700
low blood sugar is acting up again. I'm okay.

316
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
It's okay.

317
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,300
Wel...

318
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm doing okay. It's really nothing, don't worry about.

319
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Zhening.

320
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,400
Zhening?

321
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,800
I'm here.

322
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
I...

323
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,700
Do you have any plans tomorrow?

324
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,300
I...

325
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,240
No, I don't.

326
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,140
>Are you looking for me?

327
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,400
If you don't have plans, will you meet me tomorrow?

328
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,000
I have something to tell you.

329
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,100
Okay.

330
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,820
Okay.

331
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,650
Sister Qian.

332
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,400
Meiya Cosmetics Company contacted me and told me that their Director Hu is flying to Japan for something urgent,

333
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
he wants to change the product selection time to this afternoon.

334
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
Do you have time?

335
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,800
No time. This afternoon I have something to do.

336
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,000
How about this? You tell them that we will hold a meeting after he comes back.

337
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,300
Okay.

338
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,030
Sister Qian.

339
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
What are you doing this afternoon?

340
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,800
Zhening wants to meet me.

341
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
Sheng Zhening?

342
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Why is he looking for you?

343
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
How would I know?

344
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,700
Why are you so curious?

345
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,200
Nothing.

346
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,400
What did Sheng Zhening say to Sister Qian exactly? Sister Qian rejected a client just to see him.

347
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Seeing her state, she definitely did not sleep well yesterday.

348
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,780
I think they're getting back together.

349
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,860
Getting back together?

350
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,770
How do you know?

351
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,200
GM Sheng already knew that Miss Xia came to see him the day he had a fever.

352
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,170
And he knows that Miss Xia still cares about him.

353
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,830
And I told him last night that Miss Xia fainted.

354
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,530
- What happened afterward?
- After that,

355
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,590
he ran out immediately.

356
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,890
Based on common logic, they're definitely getting back together.

357
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,890
Wait a moment. If they're getting back together, they should have done it yesterday.

358
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,070
Why wait until today?

359
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,250
I've no idea.

360
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,450
But based on my years of experience reading relationship books,

361
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,630
when the affection between two people hits the lowest point,

362
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,210
it will bounce back,

363
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,190
and they will get together no matter what challenges there are.

364
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,460
I was worried that something bad would happen.

365
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,940
Let's just wait.

366
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,660
Zhening.

367
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,060
Have you been waiting for a long time?

368
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,990
I just arrived here, too.

369
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,720
How have you been?

370
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Not bad.

371
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,830
Zhening.

372
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,930
I've thought it through during this time.

373
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,470
- I want to tell you that the two of us...
- Xia Qian, let's break up.

374
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,850
Hello, are you ready to order?

375
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,890
No, we're good.

376
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,810
I've been thinking a lot lately,

377
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,030
I thought I could get over my father's accident.

378
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,720
But it was so deeply rooted

379
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,420
that I will never be able to get over it.

380
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,190
If we keep doing this,

381
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,840
it will hurt us both.

382
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,860
I totally understand what you said. That's true.

383
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,470
This will be...

384
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,970
a challenge that neither of us can overcome.

385
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:32,370
Rather than leaving a problem that can't be solved in our relationship,

386
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:36,030
we'd better end it now. Right?

387
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,940
I'm sorry.

388
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,840
Don't say sorry.

389
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,850
It's a decision that we made together.

390
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,160
Maybe breaking up is the best thing to do.

391
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,730
I don't know what I should say.

392
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,090
Thank you, Zhening. During this time I've been with you,

393
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,330
I... I've been very blissful.

394
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,240
And I was very happy. I will cherish it.

395
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,800
Thank you.

396
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,030
And this. I'll return this to you.

397
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,060
Okay. I'm leaving now.

398
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,290
♫ Are you treating silence as being mature? ♫

399
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:07,410
♫ No one can understand you? No one can comfort you? ♫

400
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:17,500
♫ He had no choice but to tell a lie, you probably told one too ♫

401
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:23,000
♫ Forgiving the past, so you can understand the story ♫

402
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,730
♫ We are selfish, guarding our worries ♫

403
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,870
♫ Don’t pry into the reservation, don’t criticize the flaws ♫

404
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:39,540
♫ We are adults, but also kids ♫

405
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,710
♫ Don’t blame the world that nobody knows you  ♫

406
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,760
♫ There is moonlight shining into the searching night ♫

407
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,970
♫ Without experiencing it,
how would you know how to rely on someone? ♫

408
00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:00,020
♫ In every difficult situation, treasure yourself more ♫

409
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,950
♫ Don’t blame the world that nobody loves you  ♫

410
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:10,290
♫ After experiencing the separation,
a reunion becomes so beautiful ♫

411
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:15,380
♫ If there isn’t luck, have more courage ♫

412
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:24,800
♫ Every dropping tear has its meaning ♫

413
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,760
GM Sheng, where are we going now?

414
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,660
Back to Evergreen.

415
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,870
Next up, we are recommending a type of tea for you.

416
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,130
This is it.

417
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,460
I saw comments from you saying that it tastes bitter,

418
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,380
but in fact, it's not.

419
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,670
You have to settle down and really taste it.

420
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,080
That's how you can taste the real flavor.

421
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,470
It's tasty!

422
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,130
Okay, that's all the products we're recommending today.

423
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,230
Please stay tuned.

424
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,340
I'll keep recommending the best products for you, allowing you

425
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,150
to spend the least amount of money on the best products.

426
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:23,730
Bye-bye! Thank you! Bye!

427
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm so tired. Help me clean up. Hey!

428
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,200
Sister Qian! You're back!

429
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,620
How did it go? What did Sheng Zhening say?

430
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,460
We... broke up.

431
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,910
I'm fine.

432
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,790
Didn't you say they were getting back together?

433
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,390
Why did they break up?

434
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,530
How would I know?

435
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,520
What happened? Can't you be more reliable?

436
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,420
I have no idea either.

437
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,790
Theoretically, they should be getting back together.

438
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,840
Forget about it! I shouldn't have listened to you.

439
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,110
I asked Sister Qian to dress up when she left.

440
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,250
Who knew Sheng Zhening would do this?

441
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,060
If I knew this was happening, I wouldn't have let her go.

442
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,790
I had no idea this would happen.

443
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,430
And GM Sheng is no better than her.

444
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,360
He locked himself in his office after he got back, and wouldn't even let me in.

445
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,350
What the hell is all this? Why did they break up?

446
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,180
I know. Who knows why they broke up.

447
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,510
Hello.

448
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,150
- Is this Miss Xia?
- Yes.

449
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,070
I'm so sorry, we forgot to mail the veil of your wedding dress to you last time.

450
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,340
Is it okay if we mail it to the same address as last time?

451
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,880
Miss Xia?

452
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,180
I'm here.

453
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,820
Don't mail it for now.
