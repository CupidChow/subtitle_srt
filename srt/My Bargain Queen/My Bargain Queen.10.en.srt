3
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,030
Are you okay?

4
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,990
Sorry.

5
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,300
I'm Korean.

6
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,470
Korean?

7
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,530
Well, are you a friend from Korea?
(T/N: he is speaking in Korean)

8
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,630
I grew up in the US.

9
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,060
Okay? So I can't speak Korean.

10
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,620
Just a little bit.

11
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,630
So...

12
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,680
Let me take you back to your room?

13
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,050
No, no, no.

14
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,620
You look, there is my room.

15
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,900
Thank you!

16
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,930
No.

17
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,640
Thank you.

18
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,950
You look so familiar.

19
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,340
Have we met before?

20
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,610
Really?

21
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,760
No. I don't think so.

22
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,670
Don't you remember me?

23
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,290
The elevator?

24
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,020
No.

25
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,360
Oh, there.

26
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,360
It's my room.

27
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,820
Hi.

28
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
Get out!

29
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,640
What?

30
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,300
You speak Chinese?

31
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,850
Good, then.

32
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,610
Easy for us

33
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,370
to communicate.

34
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,620
What are you doing?

35
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,610
I said get out, did you hear?!

36
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,330
Or else I'll scream.

37
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,560
I own this hotel.

38
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Go ahead.

39
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,470
Try and see if anyone will come and save you.

40
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,740
I said get out!

41
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,010
Are you going to

42
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,410
keep pretending?

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
Let go of me.

44
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,530
Miss Xia.

45
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,610
Get up!

46
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,320
Sheng Zhening!

47
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,700
I have confirmed just now.

48
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,790
This man is the reviewer.

49
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,150
How about the arrangements?

50
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,450
All set. We are ready to go tomorrow.

51
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,430
Be careful with the details.

52
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,010
Make it immaculate.

53
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,710
Don't worry. There won't be any problems.

54
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,730
GM Sheng, I'm sorry.

55
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,360
I shouldn't try to find the reviewer without consulting you.

56
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,380
You've been working here long enough.

57
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,520
You should know that

58
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,980
every guest is a reviewer.

59
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,640
Indeed.

60
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,100
GM Sheng, please don't be angry.

61
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,940
I'll write a 5,000-word self-reflection statement.

62
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,520
Plus, forego my one-month bonus.

63
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,620
For you to remember the lesson.

64
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,780
For me to remember the lesson.

65
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,490
Anything else?

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,100
One more little thing.

67
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,200
What you did to Miss Xia today,

68
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,420
wasn't it a bit out of line?

69
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,640
I told her to go to find the reviewer. You should blame me.

70
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,820
Why do you spare the criminal and go after the accessory?

71
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,280
And you even did that...

72
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
did that...

73
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,450
to her.

74
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,600
Could it be that you have fallen in love with Miss Xia?

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,880
Your annual bonus, do you still want it?

76
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,620
I'll get going, Boss.

77
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,180
So many clothes at home, why are you still buying?

78
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,680
This is for tomorrow.

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
Tomorrow?

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,930
Yes.

81
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,910
By the way, you need to take a day off tomorrow.

82
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,750
We are going to Building No. 2 for a make-up oath-taking ceremony.

83
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,790
What oath-taking ceremony?

84
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:28,460
You know, our wedding was incomplete and I don't feel comfortable with that.

85
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,450
But... it's too much work.

86
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,440
Not at all. I've got everything sorted.

87
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,790
You only need to show up.

88
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,770
Very well, then.

89
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,470
I'll listen to you.

90
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,130

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,410
Nice.

92
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,240
A bit tight, though.

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,550
Not at all. You look really nice.

You said it's just a simple oath-taking ceremony.

- Okay.

128

Mr. He Zhijuan,

129
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,560
please deliver your oath to your beloved.

130
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,640
There is a saying like this,

131
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,130
"I've been waiting

132
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,460
for the only matching soul in this world."

133
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,370
But I had no idea

134
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,630
how I could feel the existence of that soul.

135
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,780
Until I met you.

136
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,680
Mengmeng, you made me realize

137
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,990
that I am only complete when I'm by your side.

138
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,280
You complete my soul.

139
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,790
I've been thinking,

140
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,610
will I be happy with someone who's similar to myself,

141
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,450
or will it last longer if we have complementary traits?

142
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,850
But after we've gone through days and nights,

143
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,900
I realized

144
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,960
that it is because we're heading in the same direction,

145
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,050
so it didn't take long

146
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,560
for us to find each other in the world.

147
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,910
If I can only make one wish in my whole life,

148
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,480
I only wish we could be like now,

149
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,320
simply walking happily together.

150
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,030
Miss Ning Meng, please say your vow to your love.

151
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,290
My vow is the question I'd like to ask Zhijuan.

152
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,420
Zhijuan,

153
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,160
will you love me

154
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,920
and be loyal to me until forever?

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,790
Of course, you're my wife.

156
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,920
I will always love you.

157
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,380
I want you to swear that if you ever betray our love,

158
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,660
you will never be happy with anyone else.

159
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,410
Zhijuan!

160
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,660
Can you promise me?

161
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,890
Yes.

162
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,340
Be prepared.

163
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,440
Hold on a second!

164
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,230
Why are you here?

165
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,930
Does that have anything to do with you?

166
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,210
Now, Mr. He Zhijuan, you may lift the veil

167
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,880
and kiss your bride.

168
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,060

169
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,220
The elevator broke down. Call someone.

170
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,570
Sir, what's happening to you?

171
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,220
Hey, Sir!

172
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,040
There's no signal.

173
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,500
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

174
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,690
I have claustrophobia.

175
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,430
What do we do?

176
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,150
See if he's all right.

177
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,870
Hey, Sir. Are you all right?

178
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,570
- Hi.
- What happened?

179
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,320
The circuit broke down. GM Sheng is trapped in the elevator.

180
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,060
I can't wake him up!

181
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,180
Hey. What are you doing? Hey!

182
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,350
CPR.

183
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,300
No! Hey!

184
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,980
Why? Why not?

185
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,430
You just can't. Hey, no! I mean it!

186
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,160
I'll do it!

187
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,220
Brother!

188
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,050
The door is open.

189
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,480
Sheng Zhening!

190
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,650
Is there anyone hurt?

191
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,110
- Brother!
- Help the injured guy get out first!

192
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,690
- Brother! Are you okay?
- He's awake.

193
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,590
Help my brother get out! Please!

194
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,920
Take it slow, Sir.

195
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,170
Help my brother get out! Now!

196
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,580
Take it slow. Be careful.

197
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,370
Brother! Hold on!

198
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,960
Be quick! Save my brother now!

199
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,640
Here, hurry up.

200
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,620
Xia Qian!

201
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,300
- Brother!
- Xia Qian!

202
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
Hurry up! Be quick!

203
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,990
What happened?

204
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,040
I've no idea.

205
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,370
You're unsafe here. Come over.

206
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,280
Lean your head and your back against the wall.

207
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,550
Bend your knees, just as I'm doing.

208
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,990
Are you scared?

209
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,400
Not really. I'm scared,

210
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,810
because I'm thinking if anything happens,

211
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,690
there will be a lot of regrets in my life.

212
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,220
What regrets?

213
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,180
A lot of them.

214
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,690
For example,

215
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,660
I haven't seen the aurora yet.

216
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,280
I want to take my mom to a Michelin restaurant.

217
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,390
And I haven't met a guy who can sing a love song for me.

218
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,020
What song do you want to hear?

219
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,580
Why? Are you singing it for me?

220
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,330
Why not? It'll take some time before we get rescued.

221
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,570
All right, you can sing a song. That will fulfill one of my wishes.

222
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,720
♫  Having each simple day in our hands  ♫

223
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,850
♫  is already something extraordinary  ♫

224
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,600
♫  If you were not so persistent  ♫

225
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,790
♫  I wouldn't have known what love is  ♫

226
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,450
♫  No matter how old we get, this time  ♫

227
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,920
♫  We will slowly learn to walk with love  ♫

228
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,090
♫  Love needs to be warmed up slowly, walking slowly  ♫

229
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,020
♫  Warm up slowly, from ordinary to impressive  ♫

230
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,730
♫  Slowly, we become more similar  ♫

231
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,780
♫  Our hearts are transparent  ♫

232
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,780
♫  Love needs to be warmed up slowly,
as we understand each other  ♫

233
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,750
♫  Slowly, I've found my angel  ♫

234
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,570
♫  Even the shiny was wrinkled  ♫

235
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,050
Are you still nervous?

236
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,240
Not anymore.

237
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,460
Thank you.

238
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,760
You're welcome.

239
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,330
Old fashioned.

240
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,350
That song is too old. Actually, between the two of us—

241
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,920
What? Sheng Zhening got trapped in the elevator?

242
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,760
He's already out. He's fine now.

243
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,630
Is that how you do it?

244
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,300
I'm sorry, Vice GM Qin. I should have been more thoughtful.

245
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,560
But there's one more thing that I haven't told you.

246
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,980
I scheduled Ning Meng's wedding oath ceremony today as well.

247
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,820
Who told you that you can do it without my permission?

248
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,050
This is the only way we can deny our involvement.

249
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,960
Vice GM Qin, more and more shareholders are now aware of it.

250
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,790
I think they will hold a shareholders meeting soon.

251
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,020
So I think you should get ready for it.

252
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,920
You can leave now.

253
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,420
Come in.

254
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,940
GM Sheng, someone is looking for you.

255
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,970
Thank you so much for saving me yesterday.

256
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,520
I heard that you performed that...

257
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,530
some first-aid measures on me.

258
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,160
I'm sorry that Evergreen has brought you so many troubles.

259
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,080
- Thank you.
- Please have a seat.

260
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,930
Anan, make some tea.

261
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,810
To tell you the truth, I am the reviewer of your hotel this time.
[Reviewer: Li Zhipeng]

262
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,170
The incident that happened in Building No. 2 was supposed to make you lose a star.

263
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,100
But Evergreen Hotel is indeed the most comfortable and the most customer-oriented hotel I've stayed in.

264
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,110
To simply put it, the services passed.

265
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,620
But the facility itself does need an upgrade.

266
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,080
GM Sheng, if you're willing to renovate Building No. 2,

267
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,550
I may consider not reporting the star-rating results at this time.

268
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,250
After the renovation is done,

269
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,380
I'll come back and review again.

270
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,920
Thank you.

271
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,280
I don't agree with the idea of renovating Building No. 2!

272
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,380
Neither do I.

273
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,240
The revenue of Building No. 2 has never been ideal.

274
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,020
It's not worth it to invest a lot of money to renovate it.

275
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,120
We should sell Building No. 2 soon

276
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
while it's still functioning.

277
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,270
At least we can cut the losses on time.

278
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,420
- Indeed.
- It's best to sell it.

279
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,900
We can't sell Building No. 2.

280
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,510
I don't agree with the idea of selling it.

281
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,450
Building No. 2 is where our business started.

282
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,130
It's also the icon of Evergreen.

283
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,970
If we sell Building No. 2 now,

284
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,870
we're telling our peers in the industry that Evergreen is going downhill.

285
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,240
This is "killing the hen to get eggs."
(T/N: focus only on short-term benefits, not long-term development)

286
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,310
You lose more than you gain.

287
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,660
That makes sense.

288
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,790
I don't think we should renovate Building No. 2 now either.

289
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,170
We haven't figured out how much it would cost to renovate Building No. 2,

290
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,110
but it's definitely a huge amount.

291
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,430
So I think we should

292
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,410
have further discussions on this.

293
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,330
- Vice GM Qin is right.
- How long do we need to wait?

294
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,990
If that's the case,

295
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,550
the renovation costs for Building No. 2

296
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,990
will be paid by myself.

297
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,400
- It's not a small amount.
- That's right!

298
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,620
Zhening!

299
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
I know that Building No. 2 is very important to you,

300
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,350
but you're doing it your way.

301
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,780
I understand.

302
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,740
But I have to protect Building No. 2.

303
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,080
You're going against the shareholders.

304
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,850
This will make it difficult for you to manage the hotel in the future.

305
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,260
What's more,

306
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,330
there are many uncertainties that will affect the renovation of Building No. 2.

307
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,640
If you put all your money into it,

308
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,520
what if anything unexpected happens?

309
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,580
To play it safe,

310
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,450
I still advise you to sell Building No. 2.

311
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,430
Brother Hebo.

312
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,010
Rationally, I agree with what you said.

313
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,970
But emotionally, I can't agree.

314
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,750
You know that Building No. 2 was built by my father.

315
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,790
It was very important to him.

316
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,070
My dad is gone now,

317
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,770
and I should be the one protecting Building No. 2 for him.

318
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,070
Besides, the shareholders don't want to renovate Building No. 2

319
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,750
only because it's a long-term investment,

320
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,900
and can't make a profit in the short run.

321
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,350
But if you look at this long-term,

322
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,790
the benefits of renovating Building No. 2

323
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,250
will outweigh the drawbacks for Evergreen.

324
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,190
I understand.

325
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,250
I respect your decision.

326
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,470
Hey, who do you think the girl inside is?

327
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,200
A girlfriend of GM Sheng?

328
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,320
Hello, GM Sheng!

329
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
GM Sheng.

330
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,210
It's all in the flashdrive.

331
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,260

495
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,600
I'm starving.

496
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,420
You go ahead. I need to fetch something.

497
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,830
Hurry!

498
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,420
Hurry up!

499
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,170
What is it, Sister Qian?

500
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,970
I don't know why

501
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,700
I'm really sleepy this morning. I'm letting some fresh air in.

502
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,370
Come and eat.

503
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,730
Hurry, they are getting cold.

504
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,890
I think I just saw GM Sheng from Evergreen in the courtyard. That tall guy.

505
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,530
What was he doing here?

506
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,880
How could that be? You were mistaken.

507
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,920
- What are the fillings?
- It's your favorite.

508
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,310
Great!

509
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,680
Oh, right.

510
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,680
My mom asked me to bring something over.

511
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,530
- Mo Xiaoyan, give me your car key.
- Car key?

512
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,310
Thanks! Bye now.

513
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,570
You never let me use it.

514
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,990
Get in.

515
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,350
You won't find a taxi at this time. I'll drive you.

516
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,790
Before you go home after work, let me know first.

517
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,380
Make sure Mo Xiaoyan and the others don't see you.

518
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,010
I really don't mind you staying over at my place.

519
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,570
Just don't let them know. If my mom finds out, I'll be dead.

520
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,400
Really? That serious? Going to work and after work.

521
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,060
Eventually, they'll see us. You can't hide it forever.

522
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,370
You have to listen to me and do what I say.

523
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,360
Got it.

524
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,120
Don't forget.

525
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,110
