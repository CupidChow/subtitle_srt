00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,870
You don't need to bring your pajamas. I already bought couple's pajamas.

4
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello, Mengmeng. What's up?

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,550
Brother, can you come over?

6
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,500
What happened?

7
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,290
Qianqian, I've got some problems here.

8
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,360
I can't travel with you tomorrow.

9
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,430
Why can't GM Sheng go with you?

10
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,620
It's Ning Meng. She's suffering from bipolar disorder again. She's emotionally unstable.

11
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,310
Zhening took her to the psychiatrist.

12
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,540
I don't believe her! I think she did it on purpose.

13
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Forget about it. Whatever the reason is, being healthy is the most important.

14
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,570
Sister Qian, aren't you angry?

15
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,370
I'm a little upset.

16
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,880
But I don't want to put Zhening in a difficult position right now.

17
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,120
Love really does makes people more cautious.

18
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,540
Well, it's worthwhile to step back for some people.

19
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,080
You don't understand, do you?

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,990
Let's get back to work. Quick.

21
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,490
- Hello?
- Hello, Shuangshuang.

22
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,090
I won't be back for dinner tonight. I've got work.

23
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,820
Okay, got it.

24
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,320
By the way, when does the live streaming start tomorrow? I want to go check in at the office.

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,720
It starts at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,150
By the way, can I talk about the ingredients

27
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,720
of cosmetic products on the livestream channel?

28
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,060
Fans have asked me questions about the ingredients of cosmetic products,

29
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,270
and I spent some time doing research the last few days.

30
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,740
It's your channel. You can decide.

31
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,300
Okay.

32
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,870
Good morning, Miss Xia. GM Sheng asked me to drive you to the airport.

33
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,530
Okay.

34
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,800
Here are some mosquito repellents.

35
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,560
GM Sheng said there will be a lot of mosquitos and insects in the mountains, and asked you to take them with you.

36
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,760
I'll take it. Thank you.

37
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,700
I just checked the weather report. It will be rainy in Shaxi for the next few days.

38
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,450
Be careful not to catch a cold. Take care of yourself.

39
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,930
I will.

40
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,220
Brother, I'm feeling a bit unwell.

41
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,190
Can you get me some medicine?

42
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,030
I've got a lot of work to finish.

43
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,550
- I'll leave you to it. 
- Okay.

44
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,250
I'll get the medicine for you.

46
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,230
To understand the content of citrus extract in this face mask,

47
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,790
let's take a look at the ingredient list.

48
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,130
In fact, it contains a lot of citrus extract.

49
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,040
On the contrary, it has very little content of preservatives.

50
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,250
So we highly recommend this type of face mask.

51
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,450
We recommend products

52
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,910
that use natural extracts from plants.

53
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,710
Thank you for watching today, and I'll see you tomorrow.

54
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,570
Bye-bye!

55
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,230
Done.

56
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,470
How was it? The numbers for today were not bad, right?

57
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,180
The viewers were so passionate! And they interacted with me much more often!

58
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,730
Come check it yourself.

59
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,560
I'll take a look!

60
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,260
Is the computer broken? How is it possible that we got so many more viewers today?

61
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,100
I've no idea.

62
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,590
Is that really true?

63
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,070
Oh my god!

64
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
I think Shuangshuang signed a resource exchange agreement.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,440
That's how she got such good numbers.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,100
What is a resource exchange agreement?

67
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,990
A resource exchange agreement is an agreement that you sign with a livestreaming platform.

68
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,230
The platform puts your channel on their homepage to increase exposure.

69
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,910
But at the same time, you have to meet their demands

70
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,900
of reaching a certain sales number in a limited amount of time.

71
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,160
What? A resource exchange agreement?

72
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,920
When did you do it? Why didn't you tell me about it?

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,960
Don't feel burdened. I don't want to pressure you.

74
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,870
But if I fail to meet their standard,

75
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,180
we'll have to pay a lot of penalty fees!

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,540
What if you go bankrupt because of this?

77
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,060
I should have enough money for that. I don't think it will make me bankrupt.

78
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,640
But...

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,570
Don't be so hesitant. The higher the risk, the more we can profit.

80
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,270
We've got such good numbers today. Shouldn't you treat us to dinner, GM Qin?

81
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,010
Dinner! Dinner!

82
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,200
Forget about dinner. I have to go home for dinner. I'll give you a bigger bonus this month.

83
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,740
If GM Qin won't treat us to dinner, I'll do it.

84
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,990
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

Please pay attention to the traffic conditions and avoid traveling.

- Hello?
- Please be careful if you travel on a rainy day.

94
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,530
What's the matter?

95
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,730
I fell asleep and didn't hear the phone ring.

96
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,210
I saw the news about the landslide in Shaxi.

97
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,470
Really? I didn't know it.

98
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,510
But it's been raining the whole day.

99
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,220
I saw the bad weather and didn't go out. I'm staying in my room.

100
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,970
- As long as you're fine. Take care.
- Okay.

101
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,940
When are you coming back?

102
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,760
Maybe two days later.

103
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,960
Okay. When you decide on the date,

104
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,650
let me know in advance and I'll pick you up.

105
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,190
Okay.

106
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,570
Doctor! Hurry! Come here!

107
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,610
- What happened?
- I made two phone calls.

108
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,360
And I feel a little uncomfortable. Don't touch it.

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,980
It's fine. Keep it dry before the stitches are removed.

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,970
Don't eat spicy or greasy food for the next few days.

111
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,950
And I'd like to ask if there will be a scar on my chin.

112
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,420
It's not a big wound. Just take some rest. It should be fine.

113
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,790
Okay.

114
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,620
Oh, the wound might give you a lot of pain after the anesthetic wears off.

115
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,470
You can take some pain killer then.

116
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,410
Okay.

117
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,880
- This looks delicious.
- GM Qin won't even treat us to dinner. He's so stingy.

118
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,560
People say that rich people are stingy. How true is that.

119
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,880
Who's stingy?

120
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,140
GM Qin, what brings you here?

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,000
The girl who cooks for me stood me up.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,120
How dare she!

123
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,980
I can't believe she stood up her boss!

124
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,740
But you didn't fire her. She must be a great cook.

125
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,300
Well, she cooks all right.

126
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,810
I'm just used to her food.

127
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,610
Oh.

128
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,630
Let's order.

129
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,620
Order some food.

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,950
This one's great. What was the one you wanted?

131
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,770
This one.

132
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,760
Shuangshuang, have some steak. It's delicious.

133
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,050
- Have some fish.
- Thank you, GM Qin!

134
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,370
GM Qin, why don't you eat?

135
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,270
Have some food!

136
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,530
I mean, don't you think the light is too bright in this room?

137
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,880
I don't think so. What's wrong with your eyes?

138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,950
It's hurting my eyes.

139
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,520
I think it's not too bright.

140
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,990
The steak is really delicious.

141
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,920
- Is it going to rain today?
- Yes.

142
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,730
Oh, my quilt is still hanging outside!

143
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,470
- No, no. I have to go home.
- You should hurry up.

144
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,990
I'll come with you.

145
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,140
Don't leave. I ordered a lot of delicious dishes and they're not served yet.

146
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,400
You should eat my portion too. Don't waste it.

147
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,900
Right, hurry up.

148
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,370
- Be careful on the road.
- Okay.

149
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,120
Well.

150
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,170
No...Why are you back?

151
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,340
Forget about it.

152
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,050
I can't get a cab. And it takes one hour by bus.

153
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,780
When I get home, the quilt will be soaking wet. I'd rather stay here and eat more food.

154
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,320
No, you can't. How can you sleep if your quilt is wet?

155
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,870
Can't get a cab? I'll help you.

156
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,630
Have some more.

157
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,840
Hello?

158
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,060
Drive the car to the restaurant.

159
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,090
Okay. And take someone home for me.

Done. The driver will be waiting for you downstairs. He'll drive you home in my car.

Here. These are all yours.

Did the doctor say how long the therapy will take?

I don't know. It depends on how well I recover.

Then, will you go to the hospital with me tomorrow?

- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

173

What happened to your face?

174
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,580
What?

175
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,890
I just arrived here today.

176
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm not used to the local climate.

177
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,200
I have an allergy. My face is swelling.

178

Is it serious? Let me see it.

179
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,590
It is serious.

180

But I can't show it to you. It's too ugly.

181
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,930
I'm so sleepy.

182
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,070
I want to go to bed early.

183

Hello, is this Shaxi Boutique Hotel?

Haven't you recovered from your allergy?

187
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,750
Not yet.

188
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,200
It takes time to recover from facial allergies.

189
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,410
It'll take another two days, I guess.

190
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,080
Is it still painful?

191
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
No.

192
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,230
It's just a facial allergy. It's not painful.

193
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,390
I'm just feeling a little bit uncomfortable. Don't worry.

Why are you here?

197
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:14,290
If I didn't come here, I wouldn't know how long you're going to hide it from me.

198
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,790
Does it still hurt?

199
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,830
It was really painful before.

200
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,120
But when I see you, it doesn't hurt anymore.

Don't stand too close.

Where's my brother?

204
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,740
Oh. GM Sheng is on a business trip. He asked me to take you to the hospital.

205
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,060
Did he go to find Xia Qian again?

206
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,210

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,310
Open up.

- Ahh.
- No! It hurts.

209

I remember everyone was in a panic.

210

I was running, and someone pushed me from my back, and I hit the rock with my chin.

211

If this kind of thing ever happens again, you should tell me immediately. You can't hide it from me.

Okay, understood.

Would you like to take a shower and get changed?

216

I was in a hurry when I left. I didn't bring any clothes with me.

217

Because you like it.

I thought you were coming here with me, so I put them in the suitcase.

You should at least eat something.

She's so cunning.

Who knows. This type of girl will do everything she can to make a man stay with her.

Oh my god. I'm fine, I'm just nauseated.

Got it. Uncle Hu's here.

How did it happen?

Pregnancy might cause hormonal disorders,

447
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,260
which could trigger a relapse of her dipolar disorder.

448

To see if it's an actual relapse, we still need to observe further.

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,990
Maybe two bits?

484
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,580
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

485
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,880
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

486
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,370
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

487
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:35,470
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

488
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,790
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

489
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,980
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

490
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,530
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

491
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:52,480
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

492
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,310
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

493
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,950
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

494
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,970
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

495
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,980
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

496
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,790
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

497
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:18,190
♫ I am here anyway ♫

498
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,020
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

499
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,160
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

500
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,810
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

501
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,800
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

502
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,960
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

503
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,840
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

504
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,220
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

505
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,650
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

506
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,670
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

507
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,000
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

508
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,280
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

509
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,860
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

510
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,680
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

511
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,660
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

512
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,270
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

513
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:39,200
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

514
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,360
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

515
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,010
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

516
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:52,420
♫ I am here anyway ♫

517
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,320
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

518
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,480
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

519
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,220
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

520
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,010
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

521
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:16,080
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
