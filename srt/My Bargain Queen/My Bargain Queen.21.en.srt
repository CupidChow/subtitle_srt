[Episode 21]

3
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,480
Dad. Dad.

4
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,140
Are you awake?

5
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,980
Where am I?

6
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,040
Am I in Heaven?

7
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,930
You're in the hospital.

8
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Do you know who I am?

9
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,640
Yueyue?

10
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,590
You're not in Heaven. You're good. The surgery went very well.

11
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,790
Don't worry.

12
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,840
Do you still feel unwell?

13
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,630
No, not really.

14
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,160
You can rest then.

15
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,650
I'll get the doctor for you.

16
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,450
Yueyue. Yueyue.

17
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,910
I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,670
It's okay. The past is all in the past.

19
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,870
- Shuangshuang. Are you free this afternoon?
- I'm free.

20
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,890
Well, Aunt Wu set you up on a blind date and asks if you would have coffee with him this afternoon. I said yes.

21
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,450
What? I didn't say yes! Why don't you ask me before you say yes!

22
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,470
If I don't say yes, will you go?

23
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,400
Let me tell you. This guy runs a business growing organic vegetables.

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,120
His company provides vegetables for big brand hotels. Have you heard of Evergreen Hotel in Jinhai City?

25
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,790
That's his client, too. His business is doing really well.

26
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,530
And I've met this guy before. He's tall.

27
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,380
- And fair-skinned.
- Fine. You can go if you want. I won't go.

28
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,580
Hey, you...

29
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm getting a headache again. It's so painful.

30
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,650
Mom, stop acting. Again, seriously?

31
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm so sorry, but my mom forced me to come.

32
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm not really interested in a romantic relationship now.

33
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,940
Don't be sorry. I was asked to come here by my mom as well.

34
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,260
Miss Fu, I think you're very frank. I have an idea. How about we collaborate on this?

35
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,220
Collaborate?

36
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,500
On what?

37
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,490
We can pretend to be dating.

38
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,170
This way our family won't set us up on on blind dates again. What do you think?

39
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,350
Hello, nurse. May I ask... Hey! Xia Qian!

40
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,870
Mom, why are you here?

41
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,520
What do you mean? I found this when I was cleaning your room.

42
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,350
Hey, were you going to tell me about it if I hadn't seen this?

43
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,600
Mom.

44
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,360
I really didn't mean to hide it from you. The thing is...

45
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,790
You're afraid that I won't let you take care of him?

46
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,330
No. It's mainly because...

47
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,790
Well, I just don't want to worry you.

48
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,090
How can I not be worried? Look at you! You look so down.

49
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,800
Look at him. He's been carefree for half his life and never asks for help.

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,990
Now he's become an old man suffering from a brain tumor.

52
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,790
And he has you taking care of him.

53
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,020
I didn't even have a chance for you to take care of me! If I knew that, I should be sick first and let you take care of me.

54
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,330
Come on.

55
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,850
My mom is very healthy. How can she be sick?

56
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,330
All right, all right. Even though you're healthy, I'll still take care of you every day.

57
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,970
That's about right.

58
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,840
Xia Qian, I have to be honest with you about something.

59
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,480
In fact, all these years I've been hiding something from you, and I'm going to tell you today.

60
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,400
In fact, it's not true that he never came to see you over these years.

61
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,740
He did and I knew it.

62
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,450
But the reason that I didn't tell you about it, is because I know him too well.

63
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,350
I was afraid that you would have hopes for him to stay, and then he would leave again.

64
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,720
Then you would have been hurt and felt sad again.

65
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,150
Mom, I understand. I already know.

66
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,410
You already know?

67
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,600
Zhening told me all about it.

68
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,180
Then... will you blame me for it?

69
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,470
Why would I blame you?

70
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:37,260
Xia Qian, you really have to live through things to understand the truth about life.

71
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,150
I always thought that I'd never want to see your father again.

72
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,620
But when I found out he was sick, I came here immediately.

73
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,030
After all, he's your father.

74
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,930
You have a sharp tongue but a soft heart. We're the same. I'm just like you.

75
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,260
I hate you.

76
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,110
And, Mom, here's what I think about this.

77
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,140
What happened had happened. We shouldn't waste our time blaming him for it.

78
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,240
How is he?

79
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,150
The surgery went well. But he still needs to rest. He's on bed rest now.

80
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,430
Maybe you can take this...

81
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,690
It's just a few steps away. You should go see him.

82
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,600
I never expected that

83
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,250
you'd be like this when we meet again.

84
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,900
You can just see our daughter if you want.

85
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,950
Why do you have to make yourself look so bad?

86
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,630
You've visited her before.

87
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,580
I just don't understand you. When can you be more reliable?

88
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,530
Do you know what I've been through all these years, raising Xia Qian all by myself?

89
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,660
I dared not get sick. I dared not have any accidents.

90
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,180
Do you know why?

91
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,320
It's because Xia Qian was still a child back then.

92
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,460
If anything happened to me, if there was an accident, what could she do?

93
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,620
Could she go find you to help her?

94
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,610
But when I come to think of it,

95
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,400
Xia Qian really has grown up.

96
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,280
She's mature.

97
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,210
What does this mean?

98
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,400
It means that I've educated her very well.

99
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,810
But on a second thought, I think what you said was right.

100
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,570
Even if you don't see her your whole life, she's still your daughter.

101
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,130
Father and daughter, you two really do have a bond.

102
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,560
Well, get better soon.

103
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,700
Xia Qian's grown up now. I don't need to worry about her anymore.

104
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,170
You can visit her whenever you want.

105
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,760
You don't need to come and find her in secret.

106
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,670
But remember one thing.

107
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,550
If you ever make her cry, I won't forgive you.

108
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,390
Mom, you've been looking after him and didn't have a chance to eat.

109
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,730
I bought some food downstairs for you.

110
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,560
I'm good.

111
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,570
You can look after him since you're back. I still have work to do at the barbecue house.

112
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,060
I made some chicken soup. You should have some.

113
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,990
And feed some to him when he wakes up.

114
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,230
- Shuangshuang!
- Yes?

115
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,350
Shuangshuang, where are you going?

116
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,790
I am going to watch a movie with Xiaolin since he asked me out.

117
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,590
Nice, nice.

118
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,170
After the movies, you guys should go shopping. No need to rush back.

119
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,390
Okay, I won't return home early then.

120
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,360
Bye-bye, Mom.

121
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,990
Be careful!

122
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,300
Don't worry.

123
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,550
Draw prettily.

[Tickets]

125
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,770
Sorry for being late.

126
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,720
It's fine, I just arrived too.

127
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,340
Do you have a movie you want to see?

128
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,630
I... anything is fine.

129
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,040
Let's go have a look.

130
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,230
Hello, what are the showing times for this movie?

131
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,000
I am sorry, all of the movie showings have been booked by someone.

132
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
Booked?

133
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,340
They're all booked?

134
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,890
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,720
Today, I may have made you come for nothing.

136
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,880
It's fine. But...

137
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,090
How about this. Why don't we take a selfie so we have evidence to show our moms?

138
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,140
That works.

139
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,840
- Let's just take it here.
- Okay.

140
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,220
Let's take some pictures here.

141
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,950
Sure.

142
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,750
The sunlight is so bright I'm squinting.

143
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,850
Yes, it is a bit bright.

144
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,530
I think these should be enough.

145
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,680
Now we don't have to go out on dates anymore, just send it to our parents.

146
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,930
This is a good strategy. Please send them all to me.

147
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,510
Okay.

148
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,330
Zhening,

149
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,580
during this time I have always wanted to say thank you.

150
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,190
Only a thanks? Nothing to show for it?

151
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,910
How should I show it?

152
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,660
You know.

153
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,970
That's it?

154
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,900
What else do you want?

155
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,760
You—

156
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,810
Turn more.

157
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,110
I heard that your hotel's Building No.2 will soon be open.

158
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,430
If you ever need someone to perform,

159
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,130
our band is available. As for the cost,

160
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,880
of course it is for free. For free.

161
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,070
Y-You guys continue.

162
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,500
Go. Let's go look over there.

163
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
What do you mean free?

164
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,220
No more kisses!

165
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,490
These two kid's relationship developed pretty fast.

166
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Have a look. Look how suitable they are.

167
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,770
Suitable. Very suitable.

168
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,220
Then, Boss...

169
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,870
What... What does Xiaolin's family do?

170
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,860
His family grows these types of organic vegetables.

171
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,890
And specifically sends them to those big hotels.

172
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,100
In Jinhai City, there is a big hotel called the Evergreen Hotel. Have you heard of it?

173
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,760
They are also one of their clients.

174
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Their business is quite good.

175
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,640
That's good. That's good.

176
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,480
Today, you worked hard.

177
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,190
Did you want to drink something? I'll go buy it.

178
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,780
Water is fine.

179
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,900
Okay.

180
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,240
- Thank you.
- No problem.

181
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,520
No peeking

182
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,210
It's this one, right?

183
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,970
Shuangshuang, I'm sorry.

184
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,250
Haha, I knew you would take a peek.

185
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,890
I didn't take a peek. You fell by yourself.

186
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,710
"Shuangshuang, I'm sorry."

187
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,550
It's good that you're sorry.

188
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,420
- Shuangshuang.
- I didn't peek.

189
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,650
Shuangshuang!

190
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,850
- Thank you.
- No problem.

191
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,600
Hello?

192
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,570
What?

193
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,560
Okay, okay, okay. I'll be back soon.

194
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,010
What's wrong?

195
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,200
Work-related stuff. Jinhai City's Evergreen decided to terminate our contract.

196
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,810
Jinghai City's Evergreen Hotel?

197
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes.

198
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,630
I may have to head back and get to work.

199
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,150
Then please go.

200
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,540
Okay.

201
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,050
[Poen Jasmine]

202
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,230
I'll make you break up.

203
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,720
Were you the one who messed with Xiaolin's family business?

204
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,300
Yes.

205
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,340
Didn't you already leave Evergreen?

206
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,820
Even though I left Evergreen, I still have a small bit of influence

207
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,270
to impact you two.

208
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,860
Why did you do that?

209
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,430
You already know, so why are you asking?

210
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,330
- I—
- When provoked, even a rabbit can bite people.

211
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,130
Right now, immediately, arrange for someone to reinstate their collaboration contract.

212
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,960
Why?

213
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,080
Why?

214
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,800
What does it take for you to let go of Xiaolin?

215
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,710
You have only known him for a couple of days, why are you pleading for him?

216
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,280
That is our business not yours. It's private. Can you not drag other people in?

217
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,880
You dragged another person in first.

218
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,900
You went to the movies with him. You went on a date with him.

219
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,510
Right?

220
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,100
Then, what do you want me to do?

221
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,760
Then you should promise me not to ever go on another date with him.

222
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,230
Fine.

223
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,270
- You agreed that quickly?
- Yes.

224
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,860
Then I should add another requirement.

225
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,710
Then you should go on a date with me.

226
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,120
Date?

227
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,400
Can you not make such a melodramatic plot?

228
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,750
In the world of love, melodrama is hard to avoid.

229
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,390
That is how it is in a drama.

230
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,260
To celebrate,

231
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,130
eat some pears.

232
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,150
Breakup.
(T/N: the word for pear is "li" which has the same pronunciation as the "li" in the word for breakup)

233
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,430
Break. Up.

234
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,630
So sour. Too sour.

235
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,630
[Liping Barbecue]

236
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,160
Your head is already a mess, you should drink less.

237
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,580
Thank you.

238
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,940
Since my daughter has forgiven you,

239
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,440
then what else can I do?

240
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,260
I'm sorry.

241
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,240
That's enough. I just hope that you can be more reliable, more grounded.

242
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,250
I definitely will.

243
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,920
That's enough, don't drink anymore. You should eat instead.

244
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,220
- You should eat.
- I eat this every day, you eat.

245
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,350
How is it? Does it taste good?

246
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,650
I'm full.

247
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,800
Just like that, you're full?

248
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,320
Is the food not suitable to your taste? Or...

249
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,920
I eat depending on my mood.

250
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,450
Then let's watch a movie.

251
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,000
If you watch a movie, your mood will get better.

252
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,880
Then I guess I will reluctantly watch a movie with you.

253
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
So you're the one who booked the whole cinema yesterday.

254
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,200
I thought you were afraid of horror movies.

255
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,700
Today is different from the old days.

256
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Keep the social distance.

257
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,260
You booked the whole cinema. I can sit wherever I want.

258
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
But I'm afraid.

259
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,100
Dad.

Yueyue, a record company in Shanghai listened to our demo

262
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and wants to sign a contract with us immediately. It happened so fast and it's a rare opportunity.

263
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to you.

264
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,700
Maybe in the near future,

265
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,200
you'll be able to see Dad singing on a big stage.

266
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
By the way,

267
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,700
I sneaked out in secret and didn't finish the discharge process.

Please help with it.

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,700
I'll do it.

271
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
I put on a dress, had dinner with you,

272
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,000
and watched a movie. Our date has come to an end.

273

Can you stop creating troubles for Xiaolin?

274
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
You really do care about Xiaolin a lot, don't you?

275
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,800
No, what does that have to do with you?

276
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
Who are you to me?

277
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Of course it matters.

278
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,400
Then going off what you said, our date is not over yet.

279
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,400
- It is over.
- Not yet.

280
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
People kiss before they end a date.

281
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
When did we agree on that?

282
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,000
Now you have an additional request?

283
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,100
You must be crazy.

284
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,590
Are you serious about it?

285
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
No, no. Wait a moment.

286
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,820
If...

287
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,400
I kiss you, you'll let go of Xiaolin?

288
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,400
Yes!

289
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,000
Fine!

290
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
What are you doing?

291
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,600
Fu Shuangshuang, I'm telling you.

292
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,200
You can ignore me, or torture me,

293
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
but you can't fall in love with anyone else!

294
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Because I know that you're in love with me!

295
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,500
That's too much!

296
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't like anyone else. And it's impossible too.

297
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
We are a fake couple, anyway.

298

You...

299
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
That was too much!

300
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,900
From this angle.

301
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Zoom in.

302
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,200
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
Okay.

304
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Sir, here's your water.

305
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,600
What brings you here to watch the video shooting?

306
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Xiaoai. It was because of her.

307
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
She's a loyal fan of Mr. Bao.

308
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,200
Zhening, can you do me a favor?

309
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
What is it?

310
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,600
Xiaoai wants an autographed photo of Mr. Bao.

311
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,700
He looks like a nice guy.

312
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,400
When he has a moment, I think it should be fine.

313
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,300
Did you see what he did? Does he still look nice?

314
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,200
Hey, are you free tonight?

315
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,400
Tonight?

316
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,800
I want to ask you for a favor as well.

317
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,400
The girl at the back! You're in the frame! Can you move?

318

Hey, we're talking about you. Leave.

319
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Look at him!

Tonight, I will be your valet.

What you need to do is to rate our service and provide feedback.

323
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,100
Is that the favor you're asking for?

324
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,600
You have to take it seriously.

325
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
I got it.

326
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,300
Let's start from the service in the dining hall.

327
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,400
So from now on,

328
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,100
I'm going to become a very picky customer.

329
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,700
I hope our service can make you happy.

330
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
We'll see.

331
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm so full.

332
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,700
The food was perfect. And the service was great.

333
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,500
We'll keep working on it.

334
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,880
Is the air conditioning too cold for you?

335
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,600
Thank you for your coat.

336
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
I don't know what happened.

337
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Maybe I stayed in an air-conditioned room for too long yesterday. I feel a bit cold.

338
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Okay. I'll ask the housekeeping department to turn the temperature up.

339
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm still staying in that same room.

340
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,600
If you need anything, I'll be there for you 24 hours.

341
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,500
Am I the only guest in Building No. 2 now?

342
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,300
Are you afraid to sleep alone?

343
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,900
I can stay with you if you want.

344
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,800
No.

345
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,200
This is the first time I've stayed in a hotel without anybody else.

346
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
It feels a bit weird.

347
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,390
All right, you should go rest.

348
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,500
See you.

349
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,400
The rumor is true. Peter Bao likes to use teaching piano as an excuse

351
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
to seduce and assault girls.

352
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
The girls are afraid to speak up because of

353
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,900
their reputation or Peter Bao's influence.

354
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,200
Don't publish these photos yet.

355
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,800
We must wait until the opening ceremony is over,

356
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,100
and Peter Bao has become the brand ambassador.

357
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
Understood.

358
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,500
Did you talk to the media influencers?

359
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,800
I've got it all ready. I'll make sure that after the opening ceremony,

360
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,000
there will be news about Peter Bao's sexual assaults everywhere on the internet.

361
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
Remember, do let the influencers

362
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,100
emphasize the fact that Evergreen hired a misbehaving celebrity as their brand ambassador.

363
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
I'll help you.

364
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,780
Wait a moment.

365
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,500
What's wrong?

366
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,700
If the highest rating is 10 points, how much would you rate yesterday's service?

367
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,500
- 7 points.
- What?

368
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,400
I thought you would give at least 8 points.

369
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Can you tell me why you deducted the points?

370
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,000
The main problem is you, the valet.

371
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,800
There are three reasons for deducting points. First.

372
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,900
I said I was cold yesterday and you said you would

373
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,000
turn up the AC temperature for the whole hotel corridor area.

374
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,200
I was the only guest, but what if there are other guests?

375
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,100
Don't you think they would be happy about it?

376
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,400
Second.

377
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,600
You were worried that I was afraid to sleep alone,

378
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,000
and you said you'd stay in the same suite with me.

379
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,400
That's not part of the valet's duty, is it?

380
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,800
Third.

381
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,200
Why would a valet tie the shoe laces for a lady customer?

382
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,700
Isn't that a bit too impudent?

383
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm not professional enough. These points deserve to be deducted.

384
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,800
But it will be hard to improve my services anymore.

385
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Let's go.

386
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,220
Xiao Qin, what happened to your lips?

387
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,170
It's nothing. Just a burn.

388
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,690
Be careful.

389
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,630
Let me ask you something. Have you heard of Xinjie Investment?

390
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:56,990
A little. Not much, though.

391
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,650
Listen. It's actually a good deal.

392
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,700
Low threshold. With ¥50, you can make an investment.

393
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,550
Besides, with a small investment, you get high returns.

394
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,850
If you join me in this investment, you'll make a fortune.

395
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,640
If you are short on money,

396
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,210
you can also ask your relatives and friends to join if they are interested.

397
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,220
Think about it.

398
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,260
I'm full. Excuse me.

399
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,920
- You're full already?
- I'm also done.

400
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,220
No, you'll stay. When we are done, you'll do the dishes.

401
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,890
Just a moment.

402
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,420
I...

403
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,990
Wash this, wash them all.

404
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,140
Sure.

405
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,820
Here, clear the table.

406
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,810
Sister Qian, are you going to Evergreen this evening?

407
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,350
Yes, Zhening asked me to check on the swimming pool and the bar at Building No. 2.

408
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,580
How about we go together?

409
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,280
You are coming as well?

410
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,130
Mr. Bao is playing at Evergreen this evening.

411
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,120
He gave me a ticket last time.

412
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,350
Sure thing.

413
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,770
Xiao Qin, one of my relatives owns an orchard on the mountain.

414
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,590
He told me that the fruits are growing ripe.

415
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,150
Later, you and Shuangshuang go and help them pick. Also, bring some back.

416
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,700
Sure.

417
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,220
Stop!

418
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,660
You can't use dish soap like that.

419
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,600
That's too much.

420
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,060
The more, the cleaner, isn't it?

421
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,840
That makes it worse.

422
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,250
Don't waste.

423
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,070
Hi. Enjoying your stay?

424
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,050
Hotels are more or less alike.

425
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,880
I'm used to it.

426
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,220
I heard from the housekeeping manager that the presales at Building No. 2 are looking good.

427
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,800
Indeed, having Mr. Bao in our advertisement actually works.

428
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,420
That's great.

429
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,150
I'm off to the gym. Continue with your work.

430
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,660
Okay.

431
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,480
Don't you want some?

432
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,920
Do you worry that Qi Lin might sabotage the opening ceremony tomorrow?

433
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,550
She always does things with an agenda.

434
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,750
When she goes all quiet. It makes me a bit nervous.

435
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,890
Whatever happens, I'm here with you.

436
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,970
Help me out!

437
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,050
Let's not talk about that. Try the drinks.

438
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:34,080
I was about to tell you. The color looks terrible.

439
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,050
Let me take a sip.

440
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,150
It's a 3.

441
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,770
Fine.

442
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,470
Have you learned to play the piano?

443
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,310
I did. Between age 5 and 18.

444
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,190
Later, I gave up and went to college. No regrets.

445
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,020
I don't have your talent.

446
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,260
You are too kind.

447
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,110
I think everyone has their own style.

448
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,560
You have your own sparks.

449
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,670
I'm particularly curious about your insights on music.

450
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,920
Shall we continue our discussion in my room?

451
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,630
No, I'm afraid it'll be out of my depth.

452
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,460
You've heard me play.

453
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,060
Now it's your turn to share.

454
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,400
What's with Xiaoai?

455
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,810
We agreed to meet at the coffee place at 10:30 and go back to the office together.

456
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,550
And she is not picking up.

457
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,190
Don't worry just yet.

458
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,990
Let's wait.

459
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,530
Hello?

460
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,170
Okay. I'll be right there.

461
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,570
I still have some work. It's for tomorrow's ceremony.

462
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,490
You go ahead.

463
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,320
A dim environment helps focus on the music

464
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,050
Do you know this piece?

465
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,630
I do. It's "Claire de Lune" by Debussy.

466
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,990
It's beautiful.

467
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,150
This is a typical impressionist piece.

468
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,480
Debussy's creativeness

469
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,870
portrays tranquility, haziness,

470
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,650
even a touch of melancholy.

471
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,130
This cool tone of emotion, the interaction between the dark and the bright

472
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,540
frees the mind for the wildest imagination.

473
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,530
The music portrays the serenity of the night

474
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,620
and the pouring moonlight in the mind.

475
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,820
Xiaoai,

476
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,260
in your eyes, what's a musician like?

477
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,060
I think a good musician composes poetry with notes.

478
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,460
In a sense, a good musician is also a good poet.

479
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,490
A master of the mind.

480
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,300
You are unique.

481
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,620
Shall we drink?

482
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,430
Xiaoai, another?

483
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,120
I can't drink anymore.

484
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,590
One is enough to get me tipsy. No more.

485
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,070
Then... shall I escort you back?

486
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,130
Let's go.

487
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,250
Here, stand up.

488
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,460
Are you okay?

489
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,000
Xiaoai?

490
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,990
Are you okay?

491
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,830
Here, relax.

492
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,370
What are you doing?

493
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,440
Just relax!

494
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,830
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

495
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,130
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

496
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,560
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

497
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,690
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

498
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:36,030
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

499
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,230
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

500
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,760
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

501
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,500
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

502
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,590
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

503
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,190
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

504
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,060
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

505
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,270
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

506
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,960
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

507
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,330
♫ I am here anyway ♫

508
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:18,230
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

509
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,360
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

510
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,090
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

511
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,940
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

512
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:37,970
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

513
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,110
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

514
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:57,400
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

515
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,760
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

516
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,990
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

517
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,260
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

518
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,570
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

519
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,070
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

520
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:22,880
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

521
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,910
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

522
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,490
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

523
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,430
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

524
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,570
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

525
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,170
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

526
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,600
♫ I am here anyway ♫

527
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,530
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

528
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,660
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

529
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,330
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

530
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:05,160
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

531
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:12,600
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫
