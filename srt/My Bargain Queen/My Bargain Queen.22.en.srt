Hello? Who said you can call me right now?

4
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,380
Didn't I tell you?

5
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,780
If you have a problem, solve it yourself.

Xiaoai, are you okay? Come on! It's okay.

10

Relax, relax.

Xiaoai!

00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,830
Xiaoai!

14
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,170
She is just drunk. I didn't do anything.

15
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,720
Get away!

Are you okay?

17
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,220
Let's go. I'll take you back.

18
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Move!

19
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Slowly.

20
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,970
I didn't know he was that kind of a person.

21
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,040
It's so devastating.

22
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,800
Yes, I really didn't expect it. It scared me.

23
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,750
But I feel like I should let Zhening know.

24
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,250
Forget about it.

25
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,580
He is Evergreen's spokesperson.

26
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,280
Tomorrow, he will perform at the opening ceremony.

27
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,280
If they replace him at the last minute, it would probably bring a huge loss to Evergreen.

28
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,850
Besides, I blame myself for being blind.

29

[Qi Lin: We can take action now.]

33
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,600
He is the spokesperson of Evergreen Building No. 2,

34
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,080
as well as a famous international musician.

35

He is the famous violin player,

Mr. Lu Ming. Please give a round of applause and welcome him.

37
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,890
Were you the one who planned this all?

38
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,850
When did you discover it?

39
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,800
From the beginning, when you continually pushed for my promotion plan.

40
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,540
That was a bit abnormal.

41
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,580
You didn't have a single flaw.

42
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,940
It was Peter Bao who exposed himself.

43
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,870
If I didn't arrive on time,

44
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,820
that Peter Bao would have taken advantage of Xiaoai.

45
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,270
Anyway, that is the situation.

46
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,920
Xiaoai told me not to tell you,

47
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,080
but I thought about it and decided it was something you should know.

48
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,950
I'm wondering if Qi Lin will use Peter Bao

49
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,010
to attack Evergreen.

50
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,340
Please find all entertainment articles regarding Peter Bao.

51
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,700
Hurry, I need the result before the opening ceremony.

52
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,420
The information you can get, I can get too.

53
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,110
I was worried you would have a backup plan.

54
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,320
The opening ceremony was held as scheduled,

55
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,430
but Peter Bao was switched out at the last moment.

56
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,460
You are scrupulous.

57
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,450
But you still won. Suddenly changing the spokesperson,

58
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,210
means the early promotion funds were wasted.

59
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,630
At the same time, many of Peter Bao's fans

60
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,180
canceled their reservations at Building No. 2

61
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,310
In the end, I still lost. I had given you a chance.

62
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,080
Zhening, to acquire Evergreen, Lihe Capital put in a lot of gambling chips.

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,630
Can't we just nicely talk it over and discuss the possibility of a friendly acquisition?

64
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,020
You know you can benefit from this.

65
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,360
You know better than me about Lihe Capital's business philosophy.

66
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,950
If Evergreen were in Lihe's hands,

67
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,960
it would be torn apart.

68
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,480
The result would be that it would be sold at a high price to another company.

69
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,950
I don't want my father's business philosophy to be ruined like that.

70
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,400
What? It's all lost?

71
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,250
What about the money I invested?

72
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,790
The investment company's boss ran away. All our money is gone.

73
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,400
I mortgaged my house for that investment.

74
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,780
If the money is gone, then my house—

75
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,740
Your house? It could get taken away by the bank.

76
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,190
Hello?

77
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,020
Auntie!

78
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,270
Auntie!

79
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,550
Auntie! Are you okay?

80
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,090
How is Mr. Bao? Did he return to the United States?

81
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,030
He is facing over 10 counts of charges, going to jail is unavoidable.

82
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,870
His career may also be gone.

83
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,970
That is the best. He deserves it.

84
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,030
Although we cut our loss right away,

85
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,010
the occupancy rate of Building No. 2 is not as high as expected.

86
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,400
I thought about it.

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,310
Do you want to promote Building No. 2's rooms in our livestream?

88
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
That is not a bad idea.

89
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,510
Yes, I can show the fans

90
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,420
all the different rooms and services in Building No. 2.

91
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,510
Maybe we can attract new customers.

92
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,290
We can try.

93
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,420
Mom, are you okay?

94
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,110
Shuangshuang, she's fine. Don't worry.

95
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,330
The clinic doctor checked her just now.

96
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,630
He said she's fine. She was just shocked and fainted.

97
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,020
She woke up earlier. Later, she went back to sleep after taking some medicine.

98
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,460
It's fine. Don't worry.

99
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,740
Thank you. Luckily you were there today.

100
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,790
You... didn't eat?

101
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,520
Good thing you were there today. Thank you.

102
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,500
You are finally willing to talk to me?

103
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,050
Then, how much money did you pay back for my mom?

104
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,940
Not that much.

105
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,340
How much is not that much?

106
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,290
Just not that much.

107
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,260
¥500,000.

108
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,560
¥500,000?

109
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,060
- I will definitely pay you back.
- You.

110
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,410
You don't need to give me special treatment. I will definitely pay you back this money.

111
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,500
And there will also be interest.

112
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,150
The interest will be calculated following the bank's interest rate on loans.

113
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,800
Okay, just do as you said.

114
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,650
In fact, I had no other intention when I paid your mother's debt.

115
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,660
I just didn't want the one I care about to feel upset.

116
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,830
But don't let it become your burden. Don't be burdened.

117
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,430
But if you still want to go on a blind date,

118
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,220
I'm afraid I will still ruin it.

119
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm definitely going to be the bad guy.

120
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,190
But don't feel burdened.

121
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,110
Is it delicious?

122
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,230
Friends on the livestream channel, look how bright and sunny it is.

123
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,260
It would be great if I could sit here and have an afternoon tea,

124
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,600
to experience the chair that Charlie used to sit on.

125
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,570
Smells great. Now let's go see

126
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,870
the room of him and his wife,

127
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,410
where all the romantic moments took place.

128
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,710
To experience what it feels like to work here just like him.

129
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,180
Imagine, after a tiring day,

130
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,190
we can have a cozy warm bath in here.

131
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,100
The warm water comes out really quickly.

132
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,590
Listen to the music, and let the warm water run,

133
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,590
that's how you experience life.

134
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,590
Xiao Qin, have some meat.

135
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,600
- Don't hold back, eat more.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,850
Xiao Qin.

137
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,430
Well, we're not close friends or family.

138
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,880
And you helped us so much.

139
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm wondering why.

140
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,190
Well, in fact,

141
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,500
it's not exactly true that we're not close friends or family.

142
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,530
I mean, since the first time I met you, I have been feeling very close to you.

143
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,820
It's like you're my family.

144
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,610
I think that's fate.

145
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,250
Exactly!

146
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,130
The first time I saw you, I felt very close to you as well.

147
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,270
And I think you look very kind.

148
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,960
I think we will get along very well.

149
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,990
You do?

150
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,490
Yeah. Xiao Qin, you did such a big favor for us.

151
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,820
In the future, you can stay in our inn for as long as you want!

152
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,930
Well, can I live here for my whole life?

153
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,900
No problem. You can stay as long as you want.

154
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,470
You can still live here in your next life!

155
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,450
I can live here until my next life!

156
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,060
- Hey, have some meat. Here.
- Okay. Thank you.

157
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,760
Mom, you should eat too. Eat more,

158
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,890
- and speak less. Eat.
- Oh, look at her.

159
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,920
You should eat too.

160
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,080
Be careful.

161
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,890
Take it slow.

162
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,350
Look at her!

163
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,380
- Have we all finished eating?
- Yes.
- I'll clean up then.

164
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,670
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,490
Put it down. Shuangshuang, wash the dishes. Clean them up.

166
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,240
- I can just clean it up.
- Let Shuangshuang do it. Shuangshuang!

167
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,070
- Oh, okay.
- Hurry up!

168
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,210
Clean up the dishes!

169
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
Let me do it.

170
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,670
Give it to me. Here, give it to me.

171
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,900
Just leave it. Come.

172
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,890
Actually, you don't need to...

173
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,930
Although I lent money to you,

174
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm still a volunteer at your inn. Right?

175
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,450
It's okay.

176
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,990
Hey! Shuangshuang!

177
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,850
Why did you break the bowl again?

178
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,830
- It wasn't me.
- It was me.

179
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,530
- No worries, no worries.
- Sorry.

180
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,860
Hey, what are you doing? Don't move. It might cut your finger. Shuangshuang!

181
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,880
Use a broom to sweep it. Hurry.

182
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,390
Go, grab a broom!

183
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,860
Don't move. Don't move.

184
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,460
Just leave it. We'll deal with it.

185
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,100
- I'm so sorry.
- No problem at all.

186
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,720
- Shuangshuang, hurry up!
- Okay!

187
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,010
We've been live streaming for three days,

188
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,260
and we only got 50 new reservations for Building No. 2.

189
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,840
We still don't have enough fans.

190
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,080
You said it yourself.

191
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Fans need to be accumulated over time.

192
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,750
And now you want to "become a fatty with one bite"?
(T/N: similar to "build Rome in a day")

193
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,060
I really want to help you.

194
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,030
Since we're on that topic,

195
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,480
our team at the hotel knows some people from the film industry.

196
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,390
I've asked the marketing department to talk to them. Here's what I think.

197
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,260
I will provide part of Building No. 2 for them to shoot films.

198
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,930
I won't charge them any fee, but there's one condition.

199
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,690
The crew members have to stay at Building No. 2.

200
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,380
That way, the occupancy rate will definitely increase in a short amount of time.

201
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,270
And this will advertise for Building No. 2 at the same time.

202
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,120
So don't worry about it.

203
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,130
Miss Fu, thank you for coming to our interview.

204
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,050
We'll let you know the results soon.

205
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
When exactly can I get the result?

206
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,230
I'm sorry, I can't say for sure either.

207
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,750
Thank you.

208
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,990
Sorry, we don't think you are a good fit for our company.

209
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,840
We will let you know if there are other roles suitable for you.

210
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,530
Miss Fu, you can go back now. We'll let you know.

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,350
I'm sorry, Miss Fu. Your work experience does not meet our requirements.

212
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,760
It's foodie time! Today, Xiaoyan will taste

213
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,530
a very popular noodle with spring onion oil.

214
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,990
Chow it down! It smells so good!

215
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,040
I have to say that this noodle is...

216
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,940
The only weakness is it doesn't have one.

217
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,370
It's delicious.

218
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,120
Today is the worst day of Xiaoyan's live streaming career.

219
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,860
Stop mentioning it. I saw a lot of irrelevant comments.

220
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,640
They kept talking about Evergreen's delicious food, making the scallion noodles not smelling good.

221
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,890
I have an idea.

222
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,600
Can we collaborate with Evergreen?

223
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,770
I mean, sell some of the pre-prepared food

224
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,120
on our livestream channel.

225
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,630
Well, this is a good idea.

226
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,490
Maybe we can both benefit from it.

227
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,600
By the way, we have a quality control meeting tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Do you want to come and give it a try?

228
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Sure. I'll go there and give it a try.

229
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,490
It's just a discussion of the intention.

230
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,390
You only need to do a simple project brief. Don't stay up late working on it.

231
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,830
Who's staying up late? I'm not staying up. Sure.

232
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,890
[Monday September 14th]
[Good morning]

233
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,760
[Waiting to be picked up; You are no. 20, you'll be picked up within 45 minutes.]

234
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,400
Zhening, what brings you here?

235
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,470
I knew you were going to stay up late.

236
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,260
And it's not easy to get a cab in the morning.

237
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,550
So I came here early to pick you up.

238
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,500
I can only be confident when I prepare it well.

239
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,930
Let's make it clear.

240
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,470
In the QC meeting, you have to assess the project from an objective and fair perspective.

241
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,910
Don't lower your standard for me.

242
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,720
Okay. Got it.

243
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,300
I must be objective and fair.

244
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,850
So that's all about the content of the project. Do you have any questions?

245
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,470
I think it's great. Miss Xia has thought through a lot of details.

246
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,820
What's the target audience of the product?

247
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,140
Evergreen's food, in terms of both the ingredient and the making process, is top-notch.

248
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,340
So the price will not be low. Our main target audience is working professionals who value the quality of life.

249
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,990
What's your plan on the upfront production cost?

250
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,580
GM Sheng, here's my plan.

251
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,780
We will do a pre-sale on our livestream channel.

252
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,610
The money we get from the pre-sale will be used for production.

253
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,040
Compared with money, what we need more from Evergreen is your technical support.

254
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,390
One thing that concerns me the most is the taste of the food.

255
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,910
Can you make sure the taste of the pre-prepared food

256
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,100
can be the same as what we can taste in the restaurant?

257
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,820
I can't guarantee that right now. But we will get the sample ready as soon as possible,

258
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,910
I hope you can be the one to ensure the quality.

259
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,860
E-commerce has been Evergreen's weakness.

260
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,830
I hope we can use this project to test the water.

261
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,080
Manager Liu, you will be working with Miss Xia on this project.

262
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,910
Will do, GM Sheng.

263
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
I look forward to our collaboration.

264
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
I look forward to our collaboration.

265
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,940
You were all serious just now.

266
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,660
For a second, I thought you didn't know me.

267
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,100
Didn't you say that we should be objective and fair?

268
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,390
Yes, objective and fair,

269
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,430
but you can be gentler in your attitude.

270
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,870
Very well. I'll definitely do that next time.

271
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,010
Should we have lunch together?

272
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,770
I can't. I still have some work at the office.

273
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,330
Next time?

274
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,580
What is it?

275
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,470
I'm fine.

276
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,050
- Hypoglycemia again?
- I just need a minute.

277
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,900
Here, have a candy.

278
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,760
When did you prepare these?

279
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,630
I always carry them.

280
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,710
Much better now.

281
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,890
Let me take you home, then?

282
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,170
I heard that GM Sheng's girlfriend got the green light at the quality control meeting.

283
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,400
The bar of our quality control meeting is notoriously high.

284
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
You would also pass if you were his girlfriend.

285
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,120
You're so right. Who would dare to interrupt his girlfriend's project?

286
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,220
Have some soup.

287
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,150
Shuangshuang, look who is here.

288
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,930
He is here to refer you to a job.

289
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,060
That's right, I heard you are job hunting recently.

290
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Our company is recruiting for an accountant, would you like to give it a try?

291
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,090
No, no. I can't bring you more trouble.

292
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,900
Why did you stop me just now?

293
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,020
What they said wasn't completely wrong.

294
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,120
If I was not your girlfriend,

295
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,160
I could hardly see you,

296
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,350
it would be even more difficult to present the project details face to face.

297
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,060
Because of this, I also got the opportunity to join the quality control meeting.

298
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,040
It is true that I got all of these because I'm your girlfriend.

299
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,140
Why do I still complain when I benefit from this?

300
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,650
I really don't care what others say.

301
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,490
If I want people to stop talking behind my back,

302
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,850
the only thing I can do is to do my best on this project.

303
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,780
My goal is to get the most benefits for both Evergreen and Worth or Not.

304
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,800
- It's okay.
- You don't need to see me out, just stop here.

305
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,160
Xiao Lin, take care. Come see us when you are free.

306
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,560
- Sure. I'm leaving.
- Bye-bye.

307
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm leaving, bye.

308
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,190
- Bye, Auntie.
- Take care.

309
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,830
Okay.

310
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,560
Hey, child!

311
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,660
Why are you turning down a perfect job opportunity?

312
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,830
If I accepted it, he would have gone bankrupt.

313
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,260
- What did you say?
- N-N-Nothing.

314
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,570
You always give me a headache.

315
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,630
- Hello?
- Is this Miss Fu?

316
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,270
Yes, it's me. Hello.

317
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,540
Hello. I'm calling from the HR Department of Ivy Technology.

318
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,230
Unfortunately, you didn't pass the interview for the administration position.

319
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,990
Thank you. Thank you for letting me know.

320
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,740
But our Sales Department is recruiting.

321
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,160
Would you be interested?

322
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
Yes.

323
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,620
- Yes.
- If that's the case, please come over to our office.
- Will do.

324
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,670
Goodbye.

325
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,980
Try it.

326
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,470
If the sauce is sealed properly, it'll not lose its taste and texture.

327
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,230
The spring onion oil noodles and this dessert are more challenging.

328
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,460
If we leave spring onion oil for too long, it won't taste as good.

329
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
This really lives up to its reputation.

330
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,540
For the spring onion oil noodles, how many days can we keep them fresh?

331
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,340
If we want to keep the taste and texture, no more than 3 days.

332
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,470
Maximum 3 days? Then we can't mail it on time to remote locations.

333
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,970
We'll lose those market shares.

334
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,460
It is not impossible, we just put in some additives,

335
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,200
then we can prolong its freshness,

336
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,950
and it will not change the taste and texture.

337
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,610
Evergreen emphasizes organic and healthy food.

338
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,760
If we add preservatives, it'll go against our initial objective.

339
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,810
How did you make the noodles so tasty?

340
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,700
Chef Fang, can you give me more samples of the noodles?

341
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,090
I want other people to taste it as well.

342
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,370
- No problem.
- Thank you.

343
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,240
Tasty, very tasty.

344
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,610
How is it?

345
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,880
- I found the noodles are a bit hard.
- Hard?

346
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,020
- I took it out from the pot too soon.
- So need to cook longer.

347
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,650
I don't understand,

348
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,180
why this spring onion oil noodles, from Evergreen,

349
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,740
tastes so much better than the others? What are the secret ingredients?

350
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,430
It is from an exclusive secret recipe, they won't tell you.

351
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,070
I think there is nothing special.

352
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,450
Good chefs usually keep things simple.

353
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,050
Evergreen has good ingredients, so it tastes great.

354
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,290
If there must be a secret recipe, I think they replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.

355
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,920
That's why it tastes succulent and delicate.

356
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,410
I've to say,

357
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,610
even with your own cooking, you can be confused today and lucid tomorrow,

358
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,620
how can you criticize the chef from Evergreen? Hurry and eat.

359
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,980
Hurry up. Give me more of your thoughts.

360
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't have any more thoughts, can you give me more?

361
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,850
That's it.

362
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,900
Hi, Sister Wang.

363
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm almost at your place, I will be there soon.

364
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,920
I'm sorry, Xiao Fu. I'm not home.

365
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,470
Didn't we schedule to meet at your place today

366
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,990
to try our company's new beauty products?

367
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,340
I don't have time now, perhaps next time.

368
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,600
Hello? Hello?

369
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,920
We have confirmed our products.

370
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
Check it out.

371
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,230
What we need to do now is the preparation for the product launch.

372
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,640
Xiaoyan, prepare a livestream proposal.

373
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,750
We'll conduct a pre-sale on our livestream tomorrow.

374
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,790
Got it.

375
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,160
Xiaoai, can you work on the budget?

376
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,800
What happened?

377
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,450
Sister Qian, can I have another job?

378
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,730
I have been very bad at math since I was a child.

379
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,800
It used to be Sister Shuangshuang's job.

380
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,570
I wonder how is she doing right now.

381
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,370
All right, let me do it.

382
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,950
Hi, ladies! Today, I am bringing you

383
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,280
a special surprise.

384
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,000
That's it, the Evergreen luxury gourmet food gift box.

385
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,540
Last time, some ladies said they want to taste the food from Evergreen.

386
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,540
If you have this, you can bring Evergreen's restaurant to your home.

387
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,510
How's the taste? Let me give it a try.

388
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,830
Is it ready? How's it?

389
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,790
Let me see.

390
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,620
Ready.

391
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,560
How is it?

392
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,400
2,000 units. Really.

393
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,500
We sold 2,000 units on the first day!

394
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,110
Zhening, I'm so happy,

395
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,490
I didn't expect this at all.

396
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,700
I feel like I'm dreaming.

397
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,520
Do you want to eat together to celebrate?

398
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,200
Sure. Oh, I can't.

399
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,140
I need to follow up with the products.

400
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,760
We might perform well at the initial launch, but we can only maintain our long term sales number

401
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,550
based on the initial buyers' feedback.

402
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,960
Today, is Chef Fang at the hotel?

403
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,860
I want to go through some details with him.

404
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,780
GM Sheng, Chef Fang resigned.

405
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,980
Hi, Mr. Qin, I'm the president from Lang Yue International Hotel, Wu Zhiwen.

406
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,210
I heard you left Evergreen.

407
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,390
I wonder if you are interested in our hotel's General Manager position?

408
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,820
I know Lang Yue International Hotel is a leading hotel chain.

409
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,590
However, I do not have the experience to manage hotel chains.

410
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,800
- I'm afraid...
- Mr. Qin, you are too humble.

411
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,160
You managed Evergreen for so many years,

412
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,620
we can see your abilities.

413
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,120
Why don't you think about it?

414
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Mom!

415
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,960
- Bring me some water! Hurry, I'm so thirsty!
- How about this?

416
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,610
Let me think about it. I'll get back to you, okay?

417
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,050
Okay. Thank you!

418
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,570
Hurry up! Need to bring out the dishes. Hurry!

419
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,200
Is it ready? The customer has asked a few times already.

420
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,340
- Hurry up! Table 6 is waiting.
- Hurry.

421
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,300
It's almost ready.

422
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,430
Chef Fang handed in his resignation letter today. He said he quit because something happened at home.

423
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,000
We haven't been able to contact him since then.

424
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,700
From now on, stop all operations at the Catering Department.

425
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,370
We'll lose a lot of income.

426
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,080
The reputation of Evergreen Catering cannot be measured by money.

427
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,870
Contact headhunters right away, find a head chef as soon as possible.

428
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,570
Understood.

429
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,860
Here, for you.

430
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,590
I'm exhausted.

431
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,840
Look at you. You've just worked for a few days, you already look skinnier.

432
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,960
Do I? It's fine, just treat it as weight loss.

433
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,860
Xiao Qin! Great, you are here. I need to tell you something.

434
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,150
Later, you and Shuangshuang can eat out.

435
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,350
I'll go to my mother's place and stay for the night.

436
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,040
Okay.

437
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,580
- Hello?
- Shuangshuang!

438
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,340
- Hi, boss!
- We have a business dinner tonight.

439
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,430
I've already sent the address to your phone. Come quickly.

440
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm already home.

441
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,350
Do you want your commission or not?

442
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,700
It's not that.

443
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,690
Okay, j-j-just wait for me.

444
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,930
Hurry up.

445
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,920
What is it?

446
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,110
My boss wants me to attend a business dinner.

447
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,600
- I'm off.
- We're not eating?

448
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,990
- You go ahead.
- I...

449
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,950
You don't need to worry about the pre-prepared products.

450
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,170
I can refund the deposit to the clients.

451
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,860
If we do that, it'll discredit our livestream channel.

452
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,130
Let's wait a couple of days.

453
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,130
See if we can find a qualified head chef.

454
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,650
Also, Chef Fang has been Evergreen's chef for so many years.

455
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,490
How come he quit all of a sudden?

456
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,570
Qi Lin was probably behind this.

457
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,220
How's it going with Chef Fang's son?

458
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,860
All sorted out.

459
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,090
The admission process in the US has been completed.

460
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,360
Also, Chef Fang would like to know

461
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,280
when his green card will be ready.

462
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,380
Tell him not to worry.

463
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,090
We will keep our promises.

464
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,990
Shuangshuang!

465
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,430
How come you got so drunk?

466
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,790
- Mom, I'm home!
- No.

467
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,560
Take my bag!

468
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,740
How come you got so drunk? How did you drink like this?

469
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,840
It's fine. I'm okay.

470
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,230
Mom, why are you carrying me?

471
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,640
- Yes, your mom is carrying you.
- How come you have so much power?

472
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,770
- Your mom is Hercules.
- You put me down.

473
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,780
Who asked you to drink this much?

474
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,810
Don't go, Mom. Sleep by my side.

475
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,660
It's just a job. Do you have to drink this much?

476
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,930
Hey, where are you going? Breakfast first.

477
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,960
- I'll eat at the office.
- No need.

478
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,800
I've already helped you resign.

479
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,030
Resign? No.

480
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,180
Why did you do that? It was so difficult for me to find this job.

481
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,390
It's too slow to earn money like this.

482
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,600
I expect you to pay me back the ¥500,000 within a year.

483
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,140
Within a year?

484
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,410
Where could I possibly earn ¥500,000 within a year?

485
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,330
You don't have to worry. I've already got a job for you.

486
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,900
What job?

487
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,270
I plan to start a livestream company,

488
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,920
and employ you as the bargainer and the streamer.

489
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,280
Let's talk over breakfast.

490
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,700
According to the list provided by the headhunter,

491
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,820
Hu Zhen is the best fit.

492
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,200
Chef Hu

493
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,670
and our Chef Fang were trained by the same master.

494
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,750
He should know Chef Fang's style very well.

495
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,960
Let me give you a heads-up.

496
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,110
Signing him won't be easy.

497
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,030
I heard that many high-end restaurants gave him very attractive offers,

498
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,990
he turned them all down.

499
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,420
It's worth a shot.

500
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,310
[182-]

501
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,170
[Uncle Hu]

502
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,800
I pressed it wrong.

503
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,910
182-220-1075.

504
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:18,070
- Hello, Sheng. What is it?
- How can it be?

505
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:23,160
Hello? Are you Hu Zhen, Chef Hu?

506
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,510
- Too much fire.
- I can't do this, can you take over?

507
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,820
I'll handle these. You do those.

508
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,750
Next, put this in.

509
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,810
I taught you just a few days ago. How come you forget so quickly?

510
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,480
Sorry. I'm getting old. I can't remember it right away.

511
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,190
Maybe you could teach me again?

512
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,470
Your cooking isn't consistent at all.

513
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,920
If not for fear that you'll be jobless, I would've fired you long ago.

514
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,280
I know that.

515
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,260
Hey, time for the oyster sauce.

516
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,070
Uncle Hu is Chef Hu.

517
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,500
It's different from the legend.

518
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,090
Since Xiao Sheng is Qianqian's boyfriend, I'll definitely help!

519
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,030
Thanks, Uncle Hu!

520
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,010
Uncle Hu, why did you choose to work for our restaurant?
