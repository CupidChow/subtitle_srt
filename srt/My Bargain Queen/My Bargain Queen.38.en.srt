[Episode 38]

3
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,790
Oh, yes. How's it going with Sheng Zhening?

4
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,470
I couldn't contact him over the phone and was unable to find out where he went.

5
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,870
But my colleague at the Sales Department will let me know tonight about GM Sheng's meeting time and location for tomorrow.

6
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,130
CEO Hao?

7
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,990
Why are you here?

8
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,320
Xiaoyan, haven't knocked off work yet?

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm organizing the documents.

10
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,120
You have something for me?

11
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,710
I've signed the contract. I was passing by, so I delivered it to you.

12
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,710
I appreciate it.

13
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,290
No worries.

14
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,920
Where's Sister Qian, she's not around?

15
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,660
Sister Qian... she... is on a business trip.

16
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,420
Miss Xia went to look for our GM Sheng.

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,230
CEO Hao, sorry.

18
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,420
Regarding love, you really cannot force it.

19
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,550
And I feel that you are such an outstanding person.

20
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,920
This time, it's Sister Qian who is in the wrong.

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,660
Also, "there are plenty of fish in the sea."

22
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,370
I feel you can find someone more, much more outstanding than Sister Qian.

23
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,870
What did Qianqian do wrong?

24
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,450
She...

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,210
She is already together with you, but still gets tangled with her ex-boyfriend,

26
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,650
it's definitely her fault.

27
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,630
I think you are all mistaken. I did confess my feelings to her,

28
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,280
but she didn't accept me.

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,990
What?

30
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,450
Let's eat!

31
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,590
Auntie, today you've made all the dishes that I love to eat.

32
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,920
Oh, yes? Since you like them, eat more.

33
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Eat.

34
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,100
It's so funny. The guest in Room 104 told me

35
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,900
that he likes to eat these dishes and asked me to cook them for him.

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
In the end, I cooked them but he's not eating.

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,080
How weird it is!

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Maybe something came up.

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,220
Eat this.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,760
These are sautéed shrimp.

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,730
Does it taste good?

42
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,480
Good, right?

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,440
I want sautéed shrimp.

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,410
I want sautéed shrimp, too.

45
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,370
Okay! Sautéed shrimp.

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,790
And stir-fry razor clams.

47
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,180
That's also

48
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,910
what I like..

49
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,190
I'll be right back. Very quick.

50
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,090
They even like the same food.

51
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,000
Copycat.

52
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,380
Auntie, just now you mentioned the guest in Room 104.

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,520
Do the customers here need to register their information?

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,550
Yes, of course, they do.

55
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,070
Can you let me take a look?

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,530
This...

57
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,950
Auntie, I know it's difficult for you. Can you help me? I'll just take a quick look.

58
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,040
Okay, come, come over here.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,410
Thank you.

60
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,380
Here it is.

61
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,130
Let's see.

62
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,930
This, you take a look.

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,780
Hey! Hey, Qianqian!

65
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,280
The guest in Room 104 just left.

66
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,480
Hey, Xia Qian!

67
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,050
Xia Qian, where are you going?

68
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,670
Sheng Zhening.

69
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,120
What do you mean by hugging me?

70
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,780
Let go!

71
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,730
Sheng Zhening, you're too much.

72
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,110
Do you know how long it took to find you? Why did you hide?

73
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,760
I know I was drunk when I went to look for you at Evergreen.

74
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,380
It's you who sent me home.

75
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,270
That day at the amusement park, you were the one in the mascot (costume).

76
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,060
You have me in your heart.

77
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,750
Why did you still purposely avoid me?

78
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm not done yet, wait for me to finish.

79
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,990
The cafe.

80
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,460
I went there not to break up with you.

81
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,990
I even brought the ring.

82
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,580
I thought you would reconcile with me.

83
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,680
But you told me you wanted to break up.

84
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,240
It was raining that night.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,390
You didn't want to stop the car in front of me.

86
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,130
You'd rather see me go off together with someone else.

87
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,620
This is what you meant by a clean breakup?

88
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,440
You just can't let me go.

89
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,060
Yes, that's right.

90
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,320
I was also hypocritical, I didn't know what to say.

91
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,510
Me and you, we really cannot just use a few apologies to clear things up.

92
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,200
But I want to tell you now,

93
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,700
I love you very much.

94
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,300
Xia Qian,

95
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,310
I won't be like this in the future.

96
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,620
Believe me, we will definitely solve our problem.

97
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,620
From now on, let's give each other a chance.

98
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,260
Let us face it together.

99
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,790
Don't cry.

100
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,600
Why did you come here?

101
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,360
You wrote it?

102
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Yes, I did write.

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,450
What did you write?

104
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,850
I wrote... It's a secret.

105
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,830
[Every day to have hamburgers that I cannot finish.]

106
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,080
Every day to have hamburgers that you cannot finish?

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,860
Yes, every day to have hamburgers that I cannot finish, that's about it.

108
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,240
Okay, okay! It's a secret.

109
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,500
I just saw it.

110
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,920
Let's go.

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,840
[Believe me]

112
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,400
Dad, don't be angry. Brother only wanted you to be happy.

113
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,350
You don't say anymore, I know what I'm doing.

114
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,130
[Good luck. Make it to the dream school.]

115
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,850
Why is it...

116
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,990
[Good luck. Make it to the dream school.]

117
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,340
There's actually something I've been meaning to ask you.

118
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,090
Ask.

119
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,620
You and the Hao guy...

120
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,430
Did you agree to be his girlfriend?

121
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,690
When did I become his girlfriend?

122
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,380
It was that night.

123
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,390
The two of you walked out of the house. I even personally saw you two hugging.

124
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,280
Were you monitoring me?

125
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,830
Hao Siyuan and I...

126
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,320
Let me show you. This is what we did.

127
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,840
It was a hug between friends.

128
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,660
- So that's it?
- Yes.

129
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm realizing you don't trust me at all.

130
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,420
This isn't like you,

131
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,260
It isn't... It isn't like that.

132
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,380
Hello, Mengmeng? What's up?

133
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,140
Hello, Brother? I remember now. When Dad had his accident,

134
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
he was pressing on the brakes.

135
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,130
But it didn't slow down.

136
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,330
Dad was afraid of the car going out of control so he swerved the steering wheel

137
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,200
and crashed into the cement.

138
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,500
So I don't think the accident was caused by the sky lantern,

139
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,710
but because of brake failure.

140
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,020
Are you sure?

141
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,860
Yes.

142
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,440
Okay. Wait for me to get back.

143
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,080
- What's going on?
- It's Mengmeng.

144
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,430
What's the matter?

145
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,150
Mengmeng said that my dad's accident was probably not because of you guys,

146
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,660
- but because of brake failure.
- What does she mean?

147
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,970
She didn't say too much on the phone. I won't be able to ask her

148
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,020
about the details until we get back.

149
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,500
The report did say that the car accident may have been caused by the sky lantern,

150
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,450
but we can't eliminate the possibility that it may have been the driver's error as well.

151
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,930
All these years, I have always thought that the argument I had with my dad

152
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,260
affected his mood and caused the accident.

153
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,830
But I've also been thinking that my dad had been driving for years.

154
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,160
A sky lantern couldn't have

155
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,500
caused such a severe car accident.

156
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,320
Tomorrow, we'll go back and clear up the situation.

157
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,930
All right. Let's go.

158
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,090
The Blessing Pavilion really works.

159
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,700
They've become a couple so soon.

160
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,100
- What did you say?
- In short,

161
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,520
the sky lantern probably wasn't the direct cause of the car accident.

162
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,030
I may have misunderstood you before.

163
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,460
You don't have to carry all this on your shoulders now.

164
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,200
It was me who interrupted your life.

165
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,130
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,580
Zhening, I saw the transfer price for the Evergreen Hotel vegetable base.

167
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,010
I don't think it's reasonable.

168
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,840
You put in a lot of work.

169
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,570
It's fine.

170
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,800
I'll buy it back when Evergreen's funds return.

171
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,840
- Auntie.
- Qianqian, you're awake.

172
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll cook you some braised pork with preserved vegetables today. What do you think?

173
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,420
Thank you, Auntie. But I won't have a chance to eat it today.

174
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm about to check out and go back.

175
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,980
And also, the guest in Room 104

176
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,160
is checking out with me.

177
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,070
Your problem is solved?

178
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,740
Did the guest in Room 104 help you?

179
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,430
- All right, all right.
- Come on!

180
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,910
I saw that you two came back holding hands last night.

181
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,840
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

182
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Young people should have a few more relationships.

183
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,000
No, no. Once is enough.

184
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,260
I used to only just hear about it. I didn't expect that the Blessing Pavilion

185
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,340
really would work.

186
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,480
I should pray for Shuangshuang some other time.

187
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,350
Shuangshuang doesn't need it. Isn't she—

188
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,930
- She's what?
- She's doing great.

189
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,960
Shuangshuang is outstanding. She's also cute and attractive.

190
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,250
There are definitely a lot of people who are pursuing her.

191
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,920
Really?

192
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,260
Why can't I see it?

193
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,090
Auntie, don't worry about Shuangshuang.

194
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,630
Rest assured. I'm going to go pack.

195
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,890
- All right, go ahead.
- Thank you, Auntie.

196
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,890
Go ahead.

197
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,920
I'll give it a try.

198
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,680
Mengmeng, give it a good thought.

199
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Besides the brake failure,

200
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,770
can you remember anything else?

201
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,450
I can remember only that.

202
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,100
But I'm certain that Dad indeed did press on the brakes,

203
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,470
but it didn't help.

204
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,100
I remember Dad always got his car repaired

205
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,980
at a car dealership near our home.

206
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,440
Anan. Go to that car dealership,

207
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,840
and find the person who did my dad's car maintenance.

208
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,190
Maybe we'll find something.

209
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,830
Okay.

210
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,700
Mengmeng, you don't look well.

211
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Take care of yourself.

212
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,940
Brother, I want to delay going abroad until Dad's accident is clearly investigated.

213
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,460
That's fine.

214
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
Also, I...

215
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,510
Zhijuan and I got a divorce.

216
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,730
I think this is better for everyone.

217
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,490
Auntie, we encountered each other on our business trip.

218
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,140
We both can't let each other go.

219
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,470
Auntie, don't worry.

220
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,870
I'll definitely love Qianqian dearly. What you're worried about

221
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,980
will never happen.

222
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,610
Mom, Ning Meng just remembered

223
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,980
that Old GM Sheng's car accident was caused by brake failure.

224
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,670
But we still don't know why the brakes failed.

225
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,350
We'll keep investigating.

226
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,080
But we can be sure that it was not because of the sky lantern.

227
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,240
So, what you're worried about doesn't exist at all.

228
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,320
I have to be with Zhening.

229
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,550
You have to believe in us.

230
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,920
Xiao Sheng, I'm really sorry.

231
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,370
I said such harsh words to you before.

232
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,660
Auntie, feel free to let me know any requests you have for me. I will try my best to get them done.

233
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,620
Thank you.

234
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,690
Thank you for showing sympathy to a mother.

235
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,320
Don't take the past to heart.

236
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,820
Mom.

237
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,390
I know you worry about me...

238
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,440
and protect me.

239
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,590
But you really can't make choices and decisions for my life.

240
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,820
I'm perfectly clear on what I want.

241
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,940
I will also take responsibility for my choices.

242
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,850
Please believe in me.

243
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,350
Actually these days, I haven't had much of an appetite

244
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,610
and haven't slept well. I've been thinking if

245
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,520
what I'm doing is right or wrong.

246
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,440
But seeing the two of you today,

247
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,940
I know that I was wrong.

248
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,590
Xia Qian, I promise you again.

249
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,120
I definitely won't interfere

250
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,950
with your relationships anymore.

251
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,050
- I've heard her say this at least ten times.
- You...

252
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,570
All right, all right. This ends here.

253
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,870
But you have to compensate me.

254
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,930
I want to have sautéed shrimp and stir-fried razor clams.

255
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,450
What's wrong with your brain...

256
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,570
You should also ask Xiao Sheng what he wants to eat.

257
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,850
You're only thinking about yourself.

258
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,270
I'll have whatever she wants to eat.

259
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,630
Okay. Sautéed shrimp, razor clams.

260
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,880
Why are you staring at us?

261
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,070
You're not allowing me to look at you?

262
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,400
Cheers!

263
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,740
Do you think we should take credit for Miss Xia and GM Sheng getting back together?

264
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,150
Not only that.

265
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,140
I should take the most credit.

266
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,820
Why do you get the most credit?

267
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,190
Of course, I do. I ran around for them

268
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,750
and gave you information

269
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,710
- on Sister Qian on time.
- No, no, no. Forget it.

270
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,180
What did you even do? You were about to change sides and became a...

271
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,130
What's that called? A fence-sitter.

272
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,760
If it wasn't me who turned things around

273
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,860
and told Miss Xia of GM Sheng's itinerary at the risk of getting fired,

274
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,400
- would they have made up?
- All right, all right.

275
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,700
It's all in the past now.

276
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,420
All that matters now is that they've made up. Come.

277
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,430
Drink up. I've already had four and you're still on your first one.

278
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,000
Bottoms up!

279
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,490
By the way, I heard from Xiaoyan that Qianqian and Zhening are back together.

280
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,060
That's great.

281
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,210
And he also said that Old GM Sheng's accident wasn't because of them either.

282
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,710
It was because of brake failure.

283
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,090
Brake failure?

284
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,150
Yes. I don't know the details,

285
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,510
but it's not because of the sky lantern that Qianqian released.

286
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:49,390
What a relief. Qianqian's relationship is already too complicated.

287
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,740
I just hope they can always be happy together.

288
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,810
Mom.

289
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,870
Oh, okay. I'll send you the address.

290
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,360
Okay.

291
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,080
- What's up?
- My mom is asking for my address to send me some preserved vegetables.

292
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,000
I can make braised pork with preserved vegetables for you.

293
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,200
But my mom is better at making it.

294
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,950
She's a professional. It's absolutely delicious!

295
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,760
Do you miss home?

296
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,480
A little bit.

297
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,790
Now I've quit my job. When you are free, we can go back to your hometown together.

298
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,350
Great! But when we're back this time,

299
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,180
can we officially tell her about the relationship between us?

300
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,230
Let's wait.

301
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,370
Okay.

302
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,860
The address.

303
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,180
Oh, I'll send it to her.

304
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,400
GM Sheng, no bank is still willing to loan money to us.

305
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,140
And the big investment companies are sitting tight.

306
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,950
Investors in the market generally have more faith in Langyue Group, sponsored by Lihe Capital.

307
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,960
That's what I expected.

308
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,790
What do we do now? With Evergreen's current cash flow, we won't be able to make it for long.

309
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,510
I have invited Mr. Wilson from Belgium here to talk about strategic cooperation. If we reach an agreement,

310
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,320
there will be a steady flow of luxury tour groups from Europe staying at Evergreen.

311
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,710
This way, we can at least ensure the occupancy rate.

312
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,450
Although we have to lower our room prices,

313
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,390
the increased occupancy rate will help us with the cash flow and we can survive for a bit longer.

314
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,070
He should be here now.

315
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,300
- Hi.
- Hi, Ning. How are you?

316
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,480
Fine.

317
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,360
- Please.
- Thank you.

318
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,330
I'm interested about the cooperation you told me last time on the phone.

319
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,400
Yeah. Let's have a good chat this time.

320
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,300
Thank you, Sir.

321
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

322
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,750
GM Sheng, you're amazing!

323
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,060
Stop kissing up to me. Go talk to the manager of the Housekeeping Department and tell him,

324
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,040
although we lowered the room rates, the quality of the services must be the same standard. We can't slack off.

I asked you to look into the car dealership. Any progress?

327
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,270
It happened such a long time ago. They don't remember much.

328
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,190
And the guy who repaired Old GM Sheng's car no longer works there.

329
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,160
But please rest assured. I will definitely find him.

Go ahead.

Give it back to me.

334
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,580
I returned all your stuff to you. When are you going to return my stuff?

335
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,620
What's your stuff?

That's too ugly! What is that?

You're imitating me!

- I'm not that ugly!
- Do I look similar?

339

I'm like this.

Just go look for it. The photo, right?

341
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,140
I hid it.

00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,460
It's in the room. Go look for it.

Tell me... In a relationship,

the boyfriend doesn't want the girlfriend's family to know about their relationship.

349
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,710
Does that mean that the boyfriend doesn't have faith in their relationship?

350
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,150
GM Qin doesn't want your family to know about your relationship with him?

351
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,130
Yes. He said he doesn't want to do it now and wants to wait until later.

352
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:05,960
GM Qin means he'll let them know later. It's not that he's not willing to tell them. These are very different.

Of course!

GM Qin cares too much about you.

356

You asked him the question so abruptly, and you two haven't been dating for a long time.

357
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,260
When you asked the question so abruptly, he was probably not ready for it.

Is that so?

359
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,780
Yes. It's so natural for the guy to be afraid to meet the future mother-in-law.

GM Sheng, there's one more thing.

374
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,980
You asked me to find the guy who repaired Old GM Sheng's car. I found him.

375
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,250
He said he checked Old GM Sheng's car before the accident. Everything was normal.

376
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,750

What kind of people did Dad meet? Or did anything happen?

I remember that Dad took me out of the restaurant

and we went to the parking lot.

Then we got in the car.

385

And then someone called Dad and he got off the car.

After that, Dad quarreled with someone.

Didn't you say it last time?

You said you didn't want her to know about our relationship for now.

No, that's not what I meant.

I meant that I want to find a job first

and then tell her about it.

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,360
Where does he work? Does he have time these days?

482
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,460
We should sit down and have a meal together.

483
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,930
You're having a meal with him right now.

484
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,520
Yes. The only single guy in our company. My boss.

485
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,460
I like my boss.

486
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,300
I appreciate him and I admire him.

487
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:00,320
But I don't know how he feels about me.

488
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,000
Mom, I've said it already.

489
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,830
You know your daughter has never been in love with anyone.

490
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,830
Just give me one word. Yes or no.

491
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,530
Well...

492
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,970
I didn't expect that you would say it ahead of me.

493
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:24,430
The reason why I asked for a meal together today, Auntie, was because I wanted to tell you...

494
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,810
that I've been in love with Shuangshuang for quite a long time.

495
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,460
I've been pursuing her for a long time,

496
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,930
and she finally said yes.

497
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,240
I didn't expect that you would say it first.

498
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:53,130
Mom, you didn't come all the way here to bring pickled vegetables to me. Right?

499
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,270
Now there's no need to hide it from you.

500
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,300
A while ago, didn't your friend come to our inn for a vacation?

501
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,990
Qianqian. What's up?

502
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,930
I took her to make a wish under the big tree.

503
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,970
And it worked.

504
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,130
I thought maybe I should make a wish for you, too.

505
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,930
And she said immediately, "No, she doesn't need it."

506
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,000
And then she equivocated.

507
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,130
I felt that something must have happened to you.

508
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,800
I didn't expect you would give me such a big surprise!

509
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,700
Mom, you've introduced so many guys to me,

510
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,800
you've never thought about him?

511
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,100
He stayed in our inn for such a long time!

512
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,670
To be honest, I think he's too outstanding in every way.

513
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,160
So I didn't even think that way.

514
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,460
This is great.

515
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,100
Now you've found such a good partner, I can rest assured.

516
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:58,030
I won't have to worry about you anymore. I'll head back tomorrow.

517
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,100
I will leave you to enjoy some romantic time together!

518
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,840
No, Mom. Why don't you stay a few more days?

519
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,340
Now I'm not worried about you. But I still have to look after the inn.

520
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,160
Don't worry, we'll be very happy.

521
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,330
That's great! I can finally rest assured.

522
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,600
Why didn't you ask your mom to stay a few more days?

523
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,330
I couldn't keep her. She was in a rush to head back.

524
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,140
And she felt relieved after knowing that we're together.

525
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,170
By the way, you don't have to worry.

526
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,060
She doesn't care if you have a job or not.

527
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,130
I think I've got that sorted out.

528
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,740
The HR Department of Nuosi Hotel will call me in a couple of days.

529
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,230
As long as we reach an agreement on most of the terms,

530
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,110
and if nothing unexpected happens, I should receive the offer in a day or two.

531
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,630
Really?

532
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,010
Nuosi Hotel... Is it nearby Money Box?

533
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:10,640
We can go to work together and even have lunch together.

534
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,900
[Nuosi Hotel HR]

535
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,820
Pick it up!

536
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,500
Hello?

537
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,510
Mr. Qin, we're very sorry,

538
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,350
but we've found the right person for the position of Vice GM.

539
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,320
We can't work with you this time. I'm very sorry.

540
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,370
Okay, got it. That's fine.

541
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,830
- Thank you.
 - Okay, bye.

542
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,170
What's up?

543
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,020
They just said that they have already found the right person for the job.

544
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,840
Why?

545
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,590
I have no idea. Yesterday it all went well during the interview.
