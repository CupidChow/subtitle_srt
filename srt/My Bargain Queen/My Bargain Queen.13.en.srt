[Episode 13]

3
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,860
Manager Wang, have some water.

4
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,020
Thank you, Ms. Xia.

5
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,830
Ms. Xia, please take a seat.

6
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm good. You can sit.

7
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,910
Then I'll stand up as well.

8
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,230
I'm really sorry.

9
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,410
I haven't finished the proposal yet.

10
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,070
Could you give me one more day?

11
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,730
There's no need. The one you handed in yesterday was good enough.

12
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,190
I reviewed it carefully after I got back yesterday.

13
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,220
That budget report was very detailed and scientific.

14
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,020
- I'm sorry that I was too careless yesterday.
- Is that so?

15
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,960
We'll just purchase the products based on your budget report.

16
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,630
I'm looking forward to our collaboration.

17
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes, yes! Looking forward to it.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,490
- I'll be leaving now.
- You're leaving?

19
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,020
- Thank you, thank you.
- This way, please.

20
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,760
Okay.

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,090
- Thank you.
-Take care.

22
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,720
How did it go?

23
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,480
He just told me that there's no need to redo the budget report.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,020
The original one was good enough.

25
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,850
- Isn't that great?
- Don't you think it's weird?

26
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,750
At least you don't have to work overtime.

27
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,090
And you don't have to blame me for not waking you up last night.

28
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,520
Why didn't you wake me up?

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,460
You were sleeping like a rock. How was I supposed to wake you up?

30
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,580
It was my employees who caused trouble for you.

31
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,750
Well, won't you reconsider making an investment?

32
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,180
You're the founder of Huixin Technology.

33
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,370
How's that related to me?

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,210
You gave me the seed money.

35
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,340
If it weren't for the US$1,000 and your encouragement at that time,

36
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,390
I would have given up and returned to my hometown.

37
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,060
So you're my original investor.

38
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,070
I lent the US$1,000 to you for your living expenses.

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,720
I didn't make any investment.

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,160
Okay, Okay. I'll always keep your 10% shares for you.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,410
Unless my company is out of business, you can take it whenever you want.

42
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,290
You usually don't like to socialize, and rarely ask people for help.

43
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,750
This time, is it because of her?

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,260
You're doing great as an assistant!

45
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't have much time today.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,230
Let's meet some other time and have a good chat.

47
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,230
Great. See you!

48
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,700
Bye.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,120
Sheng Zhening! Have you finished your weekly report?

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,950
Almost done.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,160
Isn't that Manager Chen from Huixing Technology?

52
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,290
Who?

53
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,140
Chen Zixuan.

54
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,380
- You know each him?
- I don't.

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,560
Then, what were you talking about if you don't know each other?

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,300
He said I was a good assistant.

57
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,960
You're lying.

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm sorry, you made a mistake.

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,460
We're not a couple.

60
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,450
She's... She's my little sister.

61
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,090
Xiaoyan, my friend is still in love with that guy,

62
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,930
but he only thinks of her as a sister.

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,570
I see.

64
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,530
Then, what should she do now?

65
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,970
What else can she do? Pursue him.

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,790
How? He thinks of her as a sister.

67
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,620
Let me tell you. It's easier for a girl to approach a guy than a guy to approach a girl.

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,420
And if a man treats a woman as a sister, there must be something fishy.

69
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,540
It'll work.

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,530
Then tell me exactly what she should do.

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,150
Don't rush. Just like the silent drizzling rain, wait for the opportunity.

72
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,720
Wait for the opportunity?

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,230
That's so abstract. Can you make it more specific?

74
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,000
Just show him that she cares about him in an unexpected way.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,230
In an unexpected way...

76
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,530
Five heart-shaped eggs for you.

77
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,160
Isn't it delicious?

78
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,490
- GM Qin, we have problems with the renovation of Building 2.
- What happened?

79
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,790
It's not a big deal though. We're short of high-end eco-friendly paint.

80
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,490
The shareholders think it's too expensive and are not willing to pay for it.

81
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,530
So the construction team is asking if we want to use a cheaper one.

82
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,950
The paint is really important. We can't just use another one.

83
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,920
If the shareholders are not willing to pay,

84
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll pay for it myself.

85
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,060
GM Qin, you've put so much effort into helping GM Sheng renovate Building No. 2.

86
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,920
The shareholders don't seem too happy about it.

87
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,530
Never mind what they think. Do as I said.

88
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,020
Okay.

89
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,690
Xia Qian, my friend told me that he's very satisfied with your work.

90
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,260
I should thank you for recommending my company.

91
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,290
You're welcome.

92
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,090
By the way, Xia Qian, are you dating anyone now?

93
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,780
Of course not.

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,160
That's great!

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,130
I have a cousin who's still single. He's very nice.

96
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,800
And he owns a restaurant and a bar. He's also well-off.

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,030
- You guys should meet.
- There's really no need to.

98
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,570
- Also, I'm now—
- No, Xia Qian. You see,

99
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,530
I've introduced a business for you and it worked.

100
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,100
Maybe this matchmaking thing could work as well!

101
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,530
You should go meet him.

102
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,000
If he's not the right one, I won't force you at all.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,470
- But if he's not the right one, why should I waste my time—
- It's a deal!

104
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,830
- Xu Lu!
- Trust me!

105
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,260
I have an eye for this.

106
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,090
It tastes so bitter!

107
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,760
Hi! Can you get me some sugar and cream, please? Thanks.

108
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,090
We've run out.

109
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,300
I saw them on the table when I came in.

110
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,230
- Help yourself.
- Hey!

111
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,930
Your assistant...

112
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,360
He's just like that. He is a character.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,430
Try the fish.

114

[Xu Lu]

115
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,370
- Hi, what's up?
- Hello, Xia Qian.

116
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,260
Let's meet at Sunset Bar at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. See you then.

117
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,040
Okay. See you tomorrow afternoon.

118
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,830
Where are you meeting?

119
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,330
At a bar. At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

120
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,120
It's the first meeting, and you're drinking already?

121
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,980
He owns the bar.

122
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,640
We're just meeting there. We don't have to drink.

123
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,340
But...

124
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,200
But... what if you get along,

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,660
and are in the mood for drinking?

126
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,080
Why are you suddenly so interested in whether I will drink?

127
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,130
As your assistant, I feel that it is my responsibility and obligation to remind you

128
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,000
that drinking is not good for you.

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,970
Okay.

130
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey, what if he's in the mood and treats me to good wine?

131
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,980
Shall I drink it or not?

132
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm full.

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,820
You're full already?

134
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Dr. He, there's a new client scheduled for this afternoon.

135
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,390
Right. You need to prepare some assessment forms for me.

136
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,370
Oh, by the way. Please look at this.

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,550
This seems like...

138
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,000
What brings you here?

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,010
Hubby, I'm here to have lunch with you.

140
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,050
- Dr. He, I'll go back to work.
- Sure.

141
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,040
I've made a lot of food. Why don't you eat with us?

142
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm good, thank you. I'll leave you guys to enjoy your lunch.

143
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,460
Bye.

144
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
That's a lot of food!

145
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,730
Of course, I've spent the whole morning preparing for it.

146
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Let me help.

147
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,520
Here.

148
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,360
Hubby, I made all these myself.

149
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,720
Tell me if you like them.

150
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,330
It's delicious.

151
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,830
Mengmeng, I thought you were busy at the bakery. You don't have to cook for me every day.

152
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,360
The food at the hospital cafeteria is pretty good.

153
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,250
Why? You don't like the food I made?

154
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,850
I'll make some other dishes tomorrow.

155
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,330
No, I love it.

156
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,870
You don't want to eat with me?

157
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,620
No.

158
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,170
Mengmeng, you've misunderstood.

159
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm worried about you. I'm afraid you'll be tired.

160
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,510
Here.

161
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,910
This way, please.

162
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,960
Thank you.

163
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,510
Would you like anything to drink?

164
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,650
Well...

165
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,020
May I have a cup of coffee?

166
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,340
Sure.

167
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,450
Are you Xiao Yan?

168
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,390
I'm over here!

169
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,620
- Xu Lu.
 - Xia Qian!

171
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,370
I'm really sorry.

172
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,480
He went out of town today to purchase inventory.

173
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,680
and the flight was delayed. He probably can't fly back today.

174
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm so sorry.

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,010
I apologize.

176
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,510
Sure, sure. No worries. I'll be leaving then.

177
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,880
Sure, okay. I'll call you later.

178
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,730
Great. Talk to you soon.

179
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,770
Hi, please cancel my coffee.

180
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,590
Thank you.

181
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,800
Do you work nearby?

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,640
You have hypoglycemia, too?

183
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,240
Here.

184
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll take it as a gift then.

185
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,650
Bye.

186
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,030
GM Qin, you're so early.

187
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,330
We're not even open yet.

188
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,870
Do me a favor. Same as usual.

189
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,050
Okay.

190
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,880
In a bad mood?

191
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,150
The liquor...

192
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,350
can help you relax for a short while.

193
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,730
But when you step out of my bar,

194
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,820
there are lots of things you still have to face.

195
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,470
What do you think, GM Qin?

196
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,930
You're a bartender, and you're trying to talk your guest out of drinking? Don't you want to make money?

197
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,620
Of course, I do.

198
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,480
But I want to earn your money slowly, GM Qin.

199
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,030
It really makes me curious.

200
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,550
GM Qin, you can have whatever you want.

201
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,950
What could bother you? I'm very curious.

202
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,140
It's nothing serious.

203
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,340
It's just that sometimes a drunk mind speaks a sober heart.

204
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,660
I see.

205
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,780
Stop feeding the chickens. Let's have dinner together.

206
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,490
We don't need to write this down?

207
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

208
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,510
I think actually...

209
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,240
Hubby.

210
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,140
- Mengmeng.
- It's time to get off work. It's getting late.

211
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,780
Dr. He, you can go home first. I'll prepare the documents.

212
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,550
Thank you for your help!

213
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,440
Hubby, it's time to go.

214
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,420
Thank you, Xiaotong.

215
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,200
Thank you.

216
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,820
You've treated me to dinner so many times, this time it's my turn.

217
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,720
No, it's my treat.

218
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,220
You've been treating my chicken to food as well.

219
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,430
But the owner of the chicken hasn't eaten yet.

220
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,340
So you'll eat with me.

221
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,640
Is there anything serious you want to talk to me about,

222
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,020
or did you just want to have dinner with me?

223
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,640
Actually, there is one thing we need to talk about.

224
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,180
What is it?

225
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
Excuse me.

226
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,590
- Thank you.
- This is the honey water for you.

227
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,740
The honey water is for you.

228
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,040
For me?

229
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,630
I smell alcohol on you. I assumed you drank with a client?

230
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,500
The honey water will help you sober up. You shouldn't drink alcohol before you eat anything.

231
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,620
It's bad for your stomach.

232
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,160
Okay.

233
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,230
Right! What is it that you wanted to say?

234
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Well... Right, I wanted to ask you,

235
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,230
the cat is losing whiskers, is that normal?

236
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Oh, the cat.

237
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,280
It's fine. My cat lost whiskers too when it was young.

238
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,930
It's quite normal during puberty. It won't happen when it grows up.

239
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,230
That's good to know.

240
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,590
Well, shall we eat first?

241
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,870
Here, try this.

242
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,370
This is their specialty.

243
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,340
You should try this, too.

244
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,220
Okay...

245
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,390
And this. Try this.

246
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,290
Here.

247
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,910
Wait a moment.

248
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,720
You've got something there.

249
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,510
You are losing your whiskers, too?

250
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,540
I'm just joking!

251
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,310
I'll wipe it for you. There's something there. Don't move.

252
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,460
All done.

253
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,890
Have some food.

254
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,750
Isn't that delicious?

255
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,950
I didn't see you when I came back to the office this afternoon.

256
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,200
I felt a little unwell, so I came back directly.

257
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
What happened? Are you all right?

258
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm all right.

259
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,770
How did the blind date go?

260
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,480
The guy didn't show up. It's rescheduled for tomorrow.

261
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,810
Tomorrow... You have to go again?

262
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,850
I have to.

263
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,870
Based on my blind date experience,

264
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,270
if I want him to stop pestering me, the best way is to tell him directly

265
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,390
that I'm not interested, and please don't call again.

266
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,920
Let's eat.

267
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,350
By the way,

268
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,590
the temperature will drop tomorrow. Make sure you wear an overcoat. Don't catch a cold.

269
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,680
Okay, I will.

270
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,720
Right.

271
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,710
There is something

272
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,370
I've been holding off to tell you.

273
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,630
Maybe now is the time to tell you.

274
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,720
What is it?

275
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,980
The first time we met, I was drawn to you.

276
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,130
And I liked you a lot.

277
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,620
So, if you don't mind,

278
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,430
you can be my little sister

279
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,450
and call me big brother.

280
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,410
Don't worry. I'll treat you as my own sister.

281
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,340
Just like Ning Meng.

282
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,170
Ning Meng?

283
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,610
Little sister?

284
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,040
Being a little sister is fine.

285
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,550
It'll give her more access to him.

286
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,020
Tell your friend not to feel disappointed.

287
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,460
I think they are making progress.

288
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,100
You think so?

289
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,300
Where is Sister Qian?

290
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,930
She's on a blind date.

291
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,980
Blind date?

292
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,580
Where did she go?

293
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Tell me now!

294
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,850
You look very nice today, Miss Xia.

295
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,370
Thank you.

296
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,240
In fact, there is a person I like.

297
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,350
But she is not from a well-off background.

298
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,140
My family objects to our relationship

299
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,850
and forces me on blind dates.

300
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,010
I see.

302
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,780
No need to apologize.

303
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,460
In fact, I'm also here to tell you I don't trust blind dates.

304
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,110
Perfect. So this won't be awkward.

305
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,210
Likewise.

306
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,470
Try our drinks.

307
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,600
You own this bar?

308
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,590
Yes, I do.

309
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,280
- Boss, the bartender made a new drink, can you try it out?
- Okay, thank you.

310
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
You are the guest. You'll be more objective.

311
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,750
See if you'll like it.

312
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,210
Sure.

313
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,590
Unique color.

314
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,280
And the taste?

315
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,880
Refreshing, isn't it?

316
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,660
They are drinking?

317
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,520
Is she into him?

318
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,430
Who's drinking?

319
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,170
Check the staff group chat.

320
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,700
Miss Xia, here is the membership card for our bar.

321
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,840
- Please come back when you have time.
- Sure.

322
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,070
My company has a lot of young staff.

323
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,270
- I'll bring them here when I have time.
- Please come often.

324
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,640
Okay. I'll call you in advance.

325
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,500
Sure, no problem.

326
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,880
Then if there's nothing else, I'll be off.

327
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,750
Sorry to interrupt.

328
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,340
She's my girlfriend.

329
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,940
We fought today, so she ran out.

330
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,490
Mr. Lin, he's my friend; a bit mental.

331
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,310
Sorry about that, we need to go.

332
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,340
What are you doing?

333
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,410
Sheng Zhening, let go of me.

334
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,260
Let go now.

335
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,420
You said you would make it clear with him.

336
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,860
Does it take that long to make it clear?

337
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,820
And why were you drinking with him?

338
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,170
Well...

339
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,770
What does that have to do with you?

340
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,200
Of course, it has to do with me!

341
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,770
Didn't you say I could ask you if I have questions?

342
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,360
If you keep going out on blind dates every day, how can I ask you?

343
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,550
I just learned how to do statements.

344
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,720
I can't even write a weekly report.

345
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,660
Why can't you invest more time in me?

346
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,900
Am I the boss or are you the boss?

347
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,290
Sheng Zhening! Come!

348
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,190
Let's drink.

349
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,600
Thanks. Today, you ruined their blind date for me.

350
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,640
You like Sister Qian, don't you?

351
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,930
So do I.

352
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,630
Here, have one.

353
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,370
Drink it.

354
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,580
Drink it, it's fine.

355
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,110
Drink it.

356
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,450
Mo Xiaoyan drank a lot. The doctor has already pumped his stomach; he's fine now.

357
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,750
Sheng Zhening is fine. Don't worry.

358
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,090
I don't get it. How come they bought bootleg liquor?

359
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,140
Who knows. Cheap, maybe.

360
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,760
Unbelievable.

361
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,820
I'll stay with Xiaoyan.

362
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,330
You can leave with Sheng Zhening.

363
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,530
He should be able to walk.

364
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,300
Okay.

365
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,600
What a smell.

- I can drink more.

Steady. I'll hail a taxi.

374
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,860
No...

375
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,410
No taxi. I feel dizzy.

376
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,190
You feel sick?

377
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,820
Here, hold onto me.

378
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,640
Lean on me.

379

How much did you drink? You smell so bad.

380
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,770
Steady.

381
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,640
Look at you.

382
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,230
Why did you drink so much with Mu Xiaoyan?

383
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,750
Can you still walk? If not, we'll get a cab?

384
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,230
I can.

385
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,260
I want that.

386
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,740
Want what?

387
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,090
The roasted sweet potato?

388
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,720
Yup.

389
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,690
Fine.

390
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,620
You stand here. I'll go and get it.

391

392
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,980
I'm coming, too.

393
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,460
Hi, Madam.

394
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,150
Stand still.

395
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,380
I'll take one roasted sweet potato, please.

396
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,340
Don't touch! It's hot.

397
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,390
What are you doing?

398
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,180
Here.

399
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,050
- Thanks.
- Take care.

401
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,200
I'll peel it for you.

402

Does it hurt?

403
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,540
- I'll blow it.
- I burned it.

404
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,680
It's fine.

405
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,640
It's fine, you don't need to blow anymore.

406
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,810
Wait.

407
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,000
It's a bit hot, eat slowly.

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,070
Take this.

410
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,840
Sheng Zhening!

411
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,910
It's okay.

412
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,240
I got burned.

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,000
You got burned?

414

Blow it for me.

415
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,730
Blow it.

416
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,690
Blow... Blow...

417
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,280
How can you get burned without even touching the sweet potato?

- Sit still.

- No more?
- It's enough.

Sobered up yet?

422
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,550
No more drinking.

423

No more drinking?

424
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,080
Why did you drink that much?

425
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,890
Goodness...

426
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,860
You smell. What are you mumbling?

427
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,360
I like you.

428
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,080
Sleep tight.

429
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,890
I...

430
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
What? What did you say?

431
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,810
I... like... you.

432
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,290
Is there something on my face?

433
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,830
Nope.

434
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,570
Then, why are you staring at me?

435
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,670
Don't you remember what you said last night?

436
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,360
What did I say?

437
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,700
When you get drunk,

438
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,710
sometimes... you talk nonsense,

439
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,980
acting strange.

440
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,530
So...

441
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,250
If I offended you in any way,

442
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,480
I didn't mean to.

443
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,770
The alcohol is to blame.

444
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,280
Really?

445
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,720
So... what did I say?

446
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,020
You said you liked...

447
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,000
roasted sweet potatoes.

448
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,820
I'm really not into street food, but

449
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,110
roasted sweet potato is an exception.

450
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,430
It's delicious.

451
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,930
I asked you to eat more but you wouldn't.

452
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,260
That friend of yours doesn't like to dress up, does she?

453
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,880
Dress up?

454
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,640
Probably not.

455
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,880
She has to dress up a bit. Be more feminine.

456
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,120
Then the guy won't see her as a sister.

457
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,130
- You are here.
- Shuangshuang.

458
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,160
It's your turn to take care of him. He's much better now.

459
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,980
So... this is roughly what happened.

460
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,250
Mo Xiaoyan, do you think that guy has feelings for my friend?

461
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,220
What?

462
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,820
How come you and Shuangshuang both have a "friend" that I don't know?

463
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,280
I've known you two this long. Could there be any of your friends that I don't know?

464
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,210
My high-school mate. You know her.

465
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,840
I think a drunk "I like you" doesn't mean he really likes your friend.

466
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,340
As you said, he didn't call her name.

467
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,830
Therefore, he might be refering to someone else. Right?

468
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,140
But his saying of "I like you,"

469
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,550
really bothers my friend.

470
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,780
Before, they got along fine.

471
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,340
But ever since that "I like you,"

472
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,240
my friend really feels awkward around him.

473
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,020
No need to be bothered. Ask her to test him.

474
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,800
How?

475
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,070
Still nothing from her.

476
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,800
I think we should slow down.

477
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,700
Play hard-to-get. Suck-ups end up gaining nothing.

478
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,220
What's a "suck-up"?

479
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,290
It's not important.

480
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,990
[Simps end up gaining nothing.]
I think we can't just keep on giving without her knowing.

481
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,160
You have to ignore her sometimes. When she is used to your existence,

482
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,610
suddenly you're aloof, then she will realize how much you mean to her.

483
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,520
How come suddenly you know so much about this?

484

I was expecting those questions from you, Boss.

So I read a lot of books on relationships in advance.

489
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,480
Text him. See if he replies immediately.

00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,400
[Not yet. You?]

496
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Not yet. You?

497
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:34,210
Ask him out. See if he's keen.

498
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,470
Do you want to go out together to buy roasted sweet potatoes?

499
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,940
Also, don't revolve your life around her.

500
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,810
She needs to know that you are a busy man.

501
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,150
No. I'm busy.

502
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,780
[No. I'm busy.]

503
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,580
How is it?

504
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,260
Very aloof. My friend probably overthinks.

505
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,930
No need to jump to conclusions so early.

506
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,240
There's a more direct way.

507
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,130
More direct?

508
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,050
Um... I'm sorry.

509
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,660
Dragging you out this late.

510
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,860
No worries.

511
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,960
It's just a contract. Is drinking really necessary?

512
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,540
I didn't want to, but what could I do?

513
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,540
Ah... I'm dizzy.

514
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,220
Can I lean on you for a moment?

515
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,530
Go ahead.

516
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,530
Try close contact.

517
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,860
See if he responds.

518
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,010
Be cool! You must be cool.

519
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,060
Don't let your guard down because of a little gesture.

520
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,930
Be cool.

521
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,560
What's wrong?

522
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,700
- I sprained my ankle.
- Can you still walk?

523
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,500
I can't.

524
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,060
What now? Can you carry me on your back?

525
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,980
- Huh?
- Carry me.

526
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,170
I'll hold onto you. Here.

527
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,640
Take it slow.

528
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,450
It's not that bad.

529
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,450
Just a slight sprain.

530
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,390
How did I let that happen?

531
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,290
You are getting old.

532
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,950
The ground wasn't even.

533
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,620
All right.

534
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,370
Easy, take it slowly.

535
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,150
