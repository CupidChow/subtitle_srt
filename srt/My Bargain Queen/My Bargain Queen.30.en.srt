[Episode 30]

3
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,310
- You're staying here?
- Yeah.

4
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,960
You can't.

5
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,240
Where else can I stay?

6
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,860
I'll figure out a way.

7
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,560
GM Sheng, I've picked Mu Xiaoyan up. It's all arranged. Don't worry.

8
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,220
Where do I sleep?

9
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,560
You can sleep here tonight.

10
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,860
On the sofa?

11
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,870
No way! Just on the sofa?

12
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,320
Hey. Hey.

13
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,710
Take it or leave it.

14
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,070
You should be grateful that you have a place to sleep. If you don't like it, find a place to sleep yourself.

15
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,760
What are you looking at?

16
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,090
Leave. Now. Hurry.

17
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,040
Don't you have a second bedroom?

18
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,660
Fine! I'll sleep on the sofa. Why are you so rude?

19
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,710
Hey! Can you get up and turn off the light for me?

20
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,170
Hey! Hey! Can you turn off the light for me?

21
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,830
Hey!

22
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,540
Moving forward, we need an extra lock.

23
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,240
Or anybody can just come in. That's not going to work.

24
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,350
Of course not.

25
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,820
You can go buy it tomorrow.

26
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay.

27
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,550
Oh my god. What a heavy rain!

28
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,030
So heavy.

29
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,820
So heavy. Look at the lightning!

30
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,590
Oh, Xiao Sheng! You're here!

31
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,030
Aunt! What brings you here?

32
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,860
Why shouldn't he be here?

33
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,860
Of course. It's raining so hard. It's not good to drive back.

34
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,280
Didn't I ask people to fix the apartment so the rain doesn't leak in?

35
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,430
It's raining so heavily. I wanted to check if it's leaking.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,370
It's leaking! See, I knew he lied. I told him it wasn't fixed and he wouldn't admit it. Let me check the second bedroom.

37
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,540
What about the second bedroom?

38
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,610
Oh my god.

39
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,950
What? It's leaking as well! The bed is wet!

40
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,510
Aunt, it's wet because I spilled some water on the bed.

41
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,290
Oh. You spilled water on it.

42
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,530
Well, that room's leaking, and the bed in this room is wet.

43
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,660
How are you two gonna sleep tonight?

44
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,780
Oh. Xiao Sheng, you can sleep on the sofa.

45
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,190
You, come home with me.

46
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,950
Stop messing around. The sofa

47
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,390
isn't even b-b-big enough for him alone. Come home with me.

48
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,470
Why am I going home?

49
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,700
Hurry up! Stop messing around. Xiao Sheng needs to go to work. Come home now.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,450
Quickly. Hurry up! Let's go!

51
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,000
Hurry up!

52
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,650
Rest early.

53
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,940
- Rest early. Come with me.
- Stop rushing me!

54
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,810
- Let's go.
- Stop rushing me!

55
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,200
Change your shoes. Take your bag. Hurry!

56
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,630
- What's happening? Is it a fire?
- Lizard! There's a lizard on my bed!

57
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,340
Lizard?

58
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,030
Did my son get out?

59
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,940
Your son?

60
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,460
Don't panic. It's my pet.

61
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,870
What the hell is wrong with you? You keep that as a pet? And you even brought it to my place?

62
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,000
I was afraid my nephew would kill it. I didn't expect it would run away.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,890
Go find it! Now!

64
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,820
Don't be nervous.

65
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,940
Son.

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,500
Where are you?

67
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,360
Come out, my son.

68
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,240
Son! Where are you?

69
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,650
Son.

70
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,290
Here's my son. You must be scared.

71
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,720
Good night, son.

72
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,970
Mom.

73
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm going home.

74
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,980
What's the rush? You can go back after breakfast.

75
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,840
- Let me do it.
- Don't touch it. It's dirty.

76
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,590
I still have some bread at home. If I don't eat it, it will expire.

77
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,320
Then go.

78
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,430
You agreed so readily today.

79
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,180
See you!

80
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm always like that.

81
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,490
Look at her. What's wrong with her?

82
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,130
Rainy days are the best time to sleep.

83
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,280
I had such a good sleep.

84
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,980
Did you?

85
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,340
How was your sleep? I saw you sleeping so soundly last night, so I didn't wake you up.

86
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,320
Thank you.

87
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,960
You want some sandwiches?

88
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,460
Sure!

89
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,460
Hurry and eat up.

90
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,770
This sandwich is delicious.

91
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,800
It will be even better if you put mayonnaise instead of ketchup.

92
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,510
Hey! What are you doing?

93
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,160
It's delicious.

94
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,480
Hey, brother. Your apartment is nice. How much is the rent per month?

95
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,990
¥6,500.

96
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,970
That's quite expensive.

97
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,930
It must be a lot of pressure to pay the rent, living here alone.

98
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,820
What does that have to do with you? Eat your food.

99
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,120
Brother, do you need a roommate? We can share the rent.

100
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,200
I can afford it. Thanks.

101
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Don't say no so soon. Think about it.

102
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,750
If two people share the apartment, we can split the rent.

103
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,950
You can sleep on the bed,

104
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,560
and I can sleep on the sofa. How's that?

105
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,980
GM Sheng.

106
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,390
Okay, I'll pick you up right away.

107
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,660
I'll clean up.

108
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,250
You can go.

109
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,240
Here's your bag, Brother.

110
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,690
Stop being nice. I won't share the apartment with you.

111
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,760
Leave after you finish your food.

112
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,330
And bring your son with you, too.

113
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,650
Bye, Brother!

114
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,240
It's fine if you don't want to share the apartment. What an attitude!

115
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,910
My son. My son!

116
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,800
Sorry, I have to go on a last-minute business trip.

117
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,940
Call me when you're back. Love you.

118
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,580
Hello?

119
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,320
I have to go on a last-minute business trip.

120
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,630
I should be able to come back the day after tomorrow.

121
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,830
The roof will be fixed by then, right?

122
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,790
I'll ask the repairman to come over right away.

123
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,790
I'm sure it will be fixed. And I checked the weather forecast.

124
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,940
It will be sunny the whole week.

125
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,010
It won't be rainy again.

126
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,290
All right. Wait for me to be back.

127
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,790
GM Sheng, I thought we were coming back tomorrow.

128
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,720
Why did you tell Miss Xia that it's the day after tomorrow?

129
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,730
I see. You want to give her a surprise.

130
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,250
After we come back, help me prepare flowers

131
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,990
and scented candles.

132
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,410
No problem.

133
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,490
Hello, kids. Today I'm going to introduce

134
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,620
a children's book, The Little Prince.

135
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,430
Oh no.

136
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,420
It should be this one.

137
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,370
I'm back.

138
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,530
- What are you doing?
- I'm making some preparations.

139
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,150
We are going to recommend children's books on our livestream channel.

140
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,910
I think it will be better to tell the story in a lively way,

141
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,670
because we’re recommending it to children.

142
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,060
Well, you should get well prepared. When we have children in the future, you—

143
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,070
No, I mean...

144
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,480
D-Do you like kids?

145
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,830
I do.

146
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,210
Do you like boys or girls?

147
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,290
I like both. I hope in the future,

148
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,180
I can have a pair, just like my name, a son and a daughter.
(T/N: "Shuang" means a pair in Chinese)

149
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,520
Then you should read more of these children's books.

150
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,430
In the future, you can

151
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,180
play games with them.

152
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,380
- And tell them stories.
- And tell them stories.

153
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,680
That's what I'm thinking, too. So I need to be well prepared.

154
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,700
Be prepared to be a good mom in the future.

155
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,670
Then...

156
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,380
my babies can listen to my storytelling,

157
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,740
and I'll read the stories to them.

158
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,560
I'll listen your to storytelling, and you'll read them to me. Okay?

159
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,350
All right.

160
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,640
[Sister-in-Law]

161
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,650
Are you hungry?

162
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,720
A little bit.

163
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,130
I've made some soup. I'll go check if it's ready.

164
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,870
The soup's here!

165
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,400
Time to eat...

166
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,790
I understand the situation about the kid. I'm dealing with it.

167
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,200
Please stop calling me.

168
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,700
[New City Center Block B]

169
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,090
Sister Shuangshuang.

170
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,180
Is there something on your mind?

171
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,030
Not really.

172
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,350
Don't keep it to yourself if there is anything.

173
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,310
If you need a listener, I'm always here.

174
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
- Then... I'll tell you about it, but don't tell anyone else.
- Okay.

175
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,780
- You swear first.
- I swear.

176
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,170
Qin Hebo. He might have a kid.

177
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,130
- What?
- Quiet!

178
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,650
How is that possible?

179
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,730
I don't know. He's been making secret phone calls behind me these couple of days.

180
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,050
And on the phone, they talked something about a child.

181
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,080
But for GM Qin's age,

182
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,950
it's normal to have a child.

183
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,050
That is...

184
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,480
What are you going to do?

185
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,810
I don't know.

186
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
Why don't you give GM Qin some time and let him deal with it?

187
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,130
Should I pretend to know nothing about it?

188
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,580
Well, wouldn't it be more awkward if you speak frankly about it?

189
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,740
- Right.
- Look at the TV dramas.

190
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,750
Those who become a stepmother at a young age will definitely suffer.

191
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,450
No, I don't want that.

192
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,640
Let me take this call.

193
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,210
Hello?

194
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, okay. Let's go back together.

195
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,430
Is it the start of another love and hate rich family drama?

196
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,640
Hello, is this the flower shop?

197
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,490
You can send over the flowers now.

198
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,270
I'll wait for you.

199
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,940
How can his plan be designed this way?

200
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,350
Manager Wang,

201
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,150
I have to trouble you for something.

202
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,220
- What's the matter?
- Can I take a day off tomorrow?

203
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,850
How about a few days later? There are many problems with the app these days.

204
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,460
I'm afraid I can't permit your leave for tomorrow.

205
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,050
How about this? I'll work overnight and get all of my work done.

206
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,410
If so, won't you be too tired?

207
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,870
I'm fine.

208
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,550
What's happening tomorrow? Is it important?

209
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,960
Manager Wang, it's very important indeed.

210
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,510
Okay. Thanks for working late.

211
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,920
- Thank you, Manager Wang.
- No worries.

212
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,170
I'll cook. You can take a rest.

213
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,390
It's fine. I'm not too tired. I'll get changed and come help you.

214
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,250
When are you sending ¥500,000 to me?

215
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,970
¥500,000?

216
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,810
I'm done changing. Why are you still here?

217
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,870
What are you thinking?

218
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,730
I want to talk to you.

219
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,900
A very serious talk.

220
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,810
Come with me. Sit here.

221
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,460
Sit still.

222
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,780
This is very serious.

223
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,320
What I'm going to say next, I've thought through every single word.

224
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,650
I've been thinking about it the whole day today.

225
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,640
But I think we have to be frank about it.

226
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,950
When you were making the phone call in your bedroom yesterday,

227
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,980
I heard it all.

228
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,280
So... you know about it?

229
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,060
Can you accept it?

230
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,310
I'm not a petty-minded person.

231
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,270
After all, it's your child, your flesh and bone.

232
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,190
I'm a nice person and I like children.

233
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,610
Although it might be difficult for the kid to accept me now, I'll try my best.

234
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,360
I mean it.

235
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Are you okay?

236
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,500
What did you say? M-My kid?

237
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
Yesterday you said,

238
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,000
"I understand the situation about the kid. Please stop calling me."

239
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,030
I-I was talking about my cousin's kid.

240
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,450
Your cousin's kid?

241
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,000
I... I misunderstood.

242
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Then, why do you need to care for your cousin's kid?

243
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,400
The kid is struggling with school,

244
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,200
but he wants to study abroad. So the family wants me to help him.

245
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,900
But I also saw that they were asking ¥500,000 from you.

246
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This... I already found a school for him and paid his tuition,

247
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but they still hope I can pay ¥500,000 for his living expenses.

248
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Why are you responsible for

249
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
your cousin's kid?

250
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,400
My parents passed away early,

251
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
so I lived at my uncle's house since I was young,

252
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,020
Oh, I see.

253
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,300
I never heard you mention it before.

254
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Then, do they treat you well?

255
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,200
It doesn't matter if they treat me well or not anymore.

256
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,040
The important thing is that they gave me a shelter

257
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,770
where I could grow up.

258
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,100
I know now and I understand.

259
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,600
Actually, I always wished I could have a warm home.

260
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
But I don't know why,

261
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,300
seems like I am the only one that treats them like family.

262
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
They treat me like an ATM.

263
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,880
You have a home now.

264
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
In the future, we will get married.

265
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
I will become your wife

266
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,300
and give birth to a daughter and a son.

267
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,200
We will be your family. You will read bedtimes stories to them

268
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,700
and play with them. Everyone will grow up happily.

269
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,240
Because you are the kids' father.

270
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,200
And Tiger is also a part of the family!

271
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,600
It's Pudding.

272
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
Pudding.

273
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
Thank you.

274
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
You're back?

275
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,300
Sorry, I accidentally fell asleep.

276
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,300
Maybe you weren't surprised.

277
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,500
It's okay. You are my greatest surprise.

278
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,000
Let's...

279
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
continue with the surprises.

280
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,400
The flowers all wilted, it isn't romantic.

281
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,000
If I propose now, is it a bad time?

282
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Forget it, I will just find another romantic time to propose.

283
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,330
Thank goodness Qianqian didn't wake up.

284
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,100
She didn't wake up, right?

285
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,800
She didn't.

286
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
What?

287
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You took back the ring?

288
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
Why?

289
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,200
I felt like the situation wasn't appropriate.

290
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
After all, it is a proposal.

291
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,400
I need to be cautious.

292
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Then Miss Xia didn't notice, right?

293
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,800
Probably not, she is a deep sleeper.

294
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,560
He clearly put the ring on me.

295
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,720
Why did he take it back off?

296
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,890
It will happen sooner or later. Don't worry about it.

297
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:56,380
Exactly, I think he just wants to give you a super big surprise.

298
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,140
Just pretend you don't know and look forward to it.

299
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,330
GM Sheng, regarding Miss Xia's proposal, I have a plan.

300
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,130
Have a look.

301
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,550
We can find a bustling square and do a huge romantic confession.

302
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,360
Surrounded by many people's blessings, you can put the ring on Miss Xia's finger.

303
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,560
You can announce to the whole world that starting today she is your woman.

304
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,210
This is the plan you came up with for an entire morning?

305
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't you think it is a little cliché?

306
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,660
There's more.

307
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,530
Every girl dreams to be a princess.

308
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,960
We can rent an island

309
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,150
and let Miss Xia arrive directly in a love charter flight.

310
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,130
You can be in an old church

311
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,860
and ride out slowly on a white horse.

312
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,910
Fireworks, firecrackers, and flowers can all be arranged.

313
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,050
I can guarantee that she will never forget.

314
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,790
Have you been watching too many TV dramas?

315
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,690
There's still more. Here is a totally different idea.

316
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,970
We can trick Miss Xia into a haunted house or escape room.

317
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,860
We can first frighten her, and when she has almost collapsed, you can suddenly show up.

318
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,760
We can have a hero rescuing the beauty scene. What do you think?

319
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,320
I think it's a bad idea.

320
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,910
GM Sheng, is all this really necessary?

321
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,350
Last time for the 30th hotel anniversary celebration, you were not even this invested.

322
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,080
Can that be the same? Proposals only happen once a lifetime.

323
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,800
That's true.

324
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,790
It's actually not that complicated.

325
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,450
Just find a place that holds special meaning to the both of you.

326
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,630
A place that holds special meaning?

327
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,330
Sister Qian, don't worry about it.

328
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,640
I bet in the next two days, he will definitely propose.

329
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,180
Wait.

330
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,630
I observed the stars, and I can tell that today you will be wearing a ring.

331
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,630
[10]

332
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,010
Zhening.

333
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,140
Hurry! Hurry!

334
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

335
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,960
Do you have time this afternoon? Let's go to the amusement park

336
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,790
and relax.

337
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,560
What? What? What?

338
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,460
Don't say anything.

339
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,110
Amusement park? Okay.

340
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,380
All right, wait for me. I will pick you up.

341
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,340
This afternoon, he plans to take me out.

342
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,270
- Didn't I say so?
- It's coming.

343
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,910
- You, leave.
- Hurry!

344
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,050
- What are you doing?
- Put on makeup and get cleaned up. Hurry.

345
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,360
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

346
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,450
You completed the task pretty well, it is just that the formation was a bit messy.

347
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,860
But good job, you guys can have those bubble machines.

348
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,610
Go play.

349
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,780
GM Sheng,

350
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,430
I will be there right away.

351
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,300
Did you secretly practice on your own?

352
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,420
- T-The quality of the balloons are bad.
- He didn't...

353
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,410
- Did you see that? What is going on?
- It's fine.

354
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,090
This is your prize.

355
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,750
I like this.

356
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,050
Here is your reward.

357
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

358
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,150
Does GM Sheng know qigong?
(T/N: a type of martial arts)

359
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,780
- I don't think so.
- You also don't think so?

360
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,180
We said to pop five balloons. Where did the sixth one come from?

361
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,590
Such a romantic environment, he will probably propose.

362
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,560
Proposing in this environment wouldn't be too bad.

363
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,620
This side is so beautiful.

364
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,130
How should I propose later?

365
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,020
- Qianqian, I—
- Zhening.

366
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,860
Hurry up, come over and take a look.

367
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,820
I will be there right away.

368
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Hurry up and take a look.

369
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,130
I'm coming.

370
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,870
Hurry up.

371
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,530
What's wrong?

372
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,690
Nothing.

373
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,190
- What was that?
- Nothing.

374
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,750
Wow, so beautiful!

375
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,190
Yes, it is such a nice atmosphere. Hurry up and propose.

376
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,330
Is it only beautiful?

377
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,490
It's so beautiful.

378
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,540
Hurry up! What are you waiting for? The sun is about to set.

379
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,930
Look, look over there.

380
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,160
Is he not proposing today?

381
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,970
