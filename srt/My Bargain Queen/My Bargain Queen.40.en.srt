00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,750
[Episode 40]

3
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,130
Yang Da, can you tell us

4
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,690
what Director Xue did before?

5
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,530
That year, Old GM Sheng

6
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,380
had some evidence against Xue Qingyun's illegal financing.

7
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,030
Xue Qingyun wanted to talk to Old GM Sheng.

8
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,840
Before the talk, he asked me to tamper with the brakes

9
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,270
on Old GM Sheng's car.

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,220
That year, my daughter needed to have surgery, and I needed the money.

11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,370
Director Xue said, after finishing this, he would give me a large amount of money.

12
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,380
It was enough for my daughter to treat her sickness

13
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,690
and I would have a good life. I was eager to save my daughter, so I made the wrong decision.

14
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,760
So, I did it. Then the accident happened.

15
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,830
After Old GM Sheng's death, Director Xue did give me

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,670
some shares of Lihe Capital.

17
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,360
But I couldn't save my daughter. This is karma.

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,240
To redeem my sin, I donated all my money.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,560
I thought doing that could make me less guilty.

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,530
But the reality isn't like this.

21
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,960
The reality is, I live in pain and guilt every day,

22
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,050
and suffer in self-blame. This is karma for sure.

23
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,980
Enough!

24
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,130
Framing. They are framing me. Did you hear?

25
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,930
Both of them and Sheng Zhening are framing me, can't you hear?

26
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,220
At this time, you are still trying to talk yourself out of this?

27
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,540
My dad treated you as his friend and nicely advised you,

28
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,120
but you returned his kindness with evil because of money.

29
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,960
I don't know what you are saying.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,130
But Sheng Zhening, I will sue you.

31
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,030
You framed me, I'll hire a lawyer to sue you!

32
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,100
Xue Qingyun,

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,590
I have the witness and evidence.

34
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,680
Whether it is framing or not, we'll find out when we go to the police station.

35
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,970
I won't go!

36
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,990
Director Xue, you don't need to go, because

37
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,890
the police are at the entrance waiting for you.

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,400
With Xue Qingyun's illegal and evil acts,

39
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,990
he could not escape the law in the end.

40
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,910
The driver Yang Da, the accessory criminal, turned himself in,

41
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,340
he will also be punished according to the law.

42
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,660
This time, it's all thanks to Mengmeng.

43
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,940
- You've worked hard, Mengmeng.
- It's not my work.

44
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,850
It's all because of Sister Xia leading me.

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,940
- You have worked hard.
- Not at all, you've worried a lot.

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,770
When did you two make up?

47
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,160
GM Sheng.

48
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,030
- You have something for me?
- I've thought about something for a long time,

49
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,030
I still think I need to tell you.

50
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,990
I saw the news regarding GM Qin online. Things in the past,

51
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,440
GM Qin did indeed ask me to do them.

52
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,320
Sorry.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,790
But GM Qin didn't sabotage Miss Ning Meng's wedding.

54
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,120
He was framed.

55
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,180
Even though GM Qin didn't say it, but I know

56
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,160
in his heart, he always treasures the relationship with you

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,890
and Miss Ning Meng.

58
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,530
Thank you, I got it.

59
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,510
You didn't sabotage Mengmeng's wedding.

60
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,060
Why didn't you explain it to me?

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Emily told you?

62
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,090
I did a lot of wrong things.

63
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,490
One more or one less, it doesn't make much difference.

64
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,370
Of course, it makes a difference. At least,

65
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,010
I know Mengmeng's place in your heart.

66
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,760
You are not a cold-blooded person.

67
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,870
Sorry.

68
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,430
Let the past stay in the past, why apologize?

69
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,210
Thanks.

70
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,910
Oh yes.

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,340
Take this information back home and have a look.

72
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,170
A few days ago, Emily told me about a person called Yang Da.

73
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,380
Later I did some research, and there's really a problem.

74
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,520
This Yang Da was Director Xue's driver and had worked for him for over a decade.

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,830
But not long after Old GM Sheng's accident,

76
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,570
he suddenly resigned.

77
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,030
After he resigned, Director Xue gave him 0.8% of Lihe Capital shares.

78
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,810
Think about it. Why would a big company give shares to a driver?

79
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,300
Mengmeng recalled that my dad had a quarrel with a person

80
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,660
on the day of the accident. That person was Director Xue.

81
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,230
So I suspect my dad's car accident

82
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,890
had something related to him.

83
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,400
So this Yang Da may be the key to the mystery.

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,030
I'll go look for him immediately,

85
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,010
to see if I can find something else.

86
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,460
We definitely can't let Director Xue know that we are trying to find Yang Da.

87
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,990
Are you afraid that we will fan the air once he finds out?

88
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,420
The news that Evergreen is in a crisis during this period

89
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,330
should be spread throughout investment circles.

90
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,920
No one is willing to lend money to Evergreen.

91
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,940
But at this moment, Huayu Capital has made a good offer.

92
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,940
I asked Anan to check. The boss of Huayu Capital

93
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,900
once worked with Director Xue.

94
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,540
So you suspect that all of these things were plotted by Director Xue?

95
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,940
Lihe Capital did spend a lot of money in order to suppress Evergreen.

96
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,250
I believe Director Xue must be under great pressure.

97
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,300
So, he might use extreme measures.

98
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,060
Since Director Xue is setting a trap for me,

99
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,010
then I will cooperate with him.

100
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,850
Let's act separately. I'll go to Huayu Capital for financing.

101
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,320
I will leave Yang Da to you.

102
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,420
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

103
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,980
- Charlie, the bill.
- Coming.

104
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,070
Let me take it.

105
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,330
All right, stop fighting. It's on me today.

106
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,340
Because from today onwards, my life has entered a new stage.

107
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm married!

108
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,340
Two bosses, congratulate me.

109
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,740
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Here.

110
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,540
It turns out that you two reconciled a long time ago.

111
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,150
Why didn't you tell me? Do you know how long Shuangshuang and I have been worried?

112
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,070
Don't blame Zhening for this. I planned this all.

113
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,350
To be on the safe side, I told Zhening not to tell you.

114
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,760
I also didn't tell Shuangshuang.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,050
I swear, from now on I won't lie to you again.

116
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,470
This is the last time.

117
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,030
Dad, Xue Qingyun was brought to justice.

118
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,600
Evergreen also won the price war with Langyue.

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
Everything is now settled.

120
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,230
You can rest in peace.

121
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,090
Dad, Brother and I are very well.

122
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,660
Don't worry.

123
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,280
[Father Sheng Shaoxuan; Mother Ning Shuying]

124
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,840
Let's go.

125
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,520
Walking for so long, aren't you thirsty? I'll go buy a couple of bottles of water.

126
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
Okay.

127
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,180
For those days, I'm really sorry.

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,550
It's all in the past.

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,130
In fact, putting aside all prejudices,

130
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,130
in my heart, you are a very talented person.

131
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,460
Beautiful, kind, thoughtful, and sensible.

132
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,260
Not like me.

133
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,690
I always feel insecure and worry about everything.

134
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,350
Ning Meng, I've always wanted to ask you.

135
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,080
How are you and He Zhijuan?

136
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,910
We are already divorced.

137
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,900
We met once before.

138
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,250
He always talked about you.

139
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,090
I think that it's a pity if you two just let it go like this.

140
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,020
Ning Meng,

141
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,800
I'll tell you a secret.

142
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,200
But you have to promise me that you won't tell your brother.

143
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
What secret?

144
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,460
When I knew that He Zhijuan's girlfriend was you,

145
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,660
I was a little bit lost.

146
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,560
- Why?
- You know him.

147
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,420
Well, he is very sensitive

148
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,090
and longs to have a family.

149
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,640
He likes his girlfriend to cling to him and rely on him

150
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,690
to give him a sense of security. I can't do it, but you can.

151
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,300
But we have already divorced.

152
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,410
You can still resume your marriage.

153
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,760
I think that if you two restart and know each other again,

154
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,000
it may not be a bad thing.

155
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,520
What are you guys talking about that you are so happy?

156
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,070
I'm not telling you. This is our secret.

157
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,330
You should call her Sister-in-Law now.

158
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,920
Yes, yes, yes, Sister-in-Law.

159
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,750
Here, let's drink some water.

160
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,990
- Don't tell him.
- I won't.

161
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,530
These are the wedding plans we chose before.

162
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,120
You take a look.

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,760
I remember these plans.

164
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,340
Also, this one. These are the crowns to match the wedding gown.

165
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,090
Take a look.

166
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,820
Didn't have this one before.

167
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,400
You don't like it?

168
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,180
Zhening, now that Evergreen has just recovered,

169
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,580
I think we should make it simple.

170
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,640
Evergreen is not as poor as you think, okay?

171
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,080
Did you forget the words someone said?

172
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,350
At the amusement park.

173
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,850
You said that I'll be your personal bargainer.

174
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,120
Every cent you spend, you'll have to report to me.

175
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,240
Okay, my bargain queen, how do you intend to do the wedding?

176
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,340
I want to spend the least amount of money to hold the warmest and most romantic wedding.

177
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,780
Is it okay? Can we?

178
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,720
Okay! Not looking at these anymore.

179
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,400
- Director Lu.
- Ning Meng.

180
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,410
- Director Lu, long time no see.
- Long time no see.

181
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,120
You want to come to my office for a while?

182
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,830
No need.

183
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,470
You are here to find Doctor He?

184
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,900
I couldn't contact him on the phone,

185
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,670
so I came to the hospital to find him.

186
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,220
But there's nobody in his office.

187
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,700
Doctor He didn't tell you? Our hospital has a

188
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,870
project to help disaster victims with mental counseling.

189
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,480
Doctor He signed up. He already left a week ago.

190
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,580
There's a letter, hold on.

191
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,330
Doctor He told me that if you came to find him, to give this letter to you.

192
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,120
- Thank you, Director Lu.
- I'll go back to work.

193
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,930
Thank you.

194
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,060
Mengmeng, when you see this letter,

195
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,720
I would have already left this city.

196
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
Please forgive me for using this way to say goodbye.

197
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,650
That time when we broke up, you asked me

198
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,360
can hypnotism help to forget the past?

199
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,460
You said you wanted to forget everything about me.

200
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,370
Actually, after listening to that, I was a little sad,

201
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,810
because I didn't want you to forget me.

202
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,670
This time I voluntarily applied to

203
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,120
help kids who have PTSD after the earthquake.

204
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,890
I will work hard to make myself better.

205
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,450
Hopefully, if we can meet again in two years,

206
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,590
you will give me a chance to know you again.

207
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,990
Hello, Master Wu?

208
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,750
I'm not renting out the cake shop anymore.

209
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,570
Yes.

210
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,400
I... I want to continue operating it.

211
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,290
[Worth or Not]

212
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,820
Stand up!

213
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,480
What's up?

214
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,230
I'm announcing, we have a new bargain order.

215
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,570
- What is it?
- What task?

216
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,330
Mine.

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,910
Bargain for my wedding.

218
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,770
Our wedding dresses use premium fabrics and top-notch cutting.

219
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,690
As for the bridesmaids' dresses, they have low-key elegance,

220
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,270
so they won't steal the thunder of the bride.

221
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,260
To tell you the truth, a lot of bridesmaids who wore our dresses

222
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,600
found partners at weddings.

223
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,900
Miss Xia, is this piece suitable?

224
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,860
All these are very suitable.

225
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,710
These blue, yellow, pink ones, I like them very much.

226
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,850
But...

227
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,210
All right, I want these two white pieces.

228
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,750
How much?

229
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,230
Miss Xia, this price.

230
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,840
It's already the final price, other people wouldn't get this.

231
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,330
Miss Xia, our cost is more than this amount.

232
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,790
Then forget about it. Sorry, I've taken so much of your time.

233
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,670
I will go to other places to take a look. Thank you.

234
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,780
Miss Xia!

235
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,040
- We'll sell them to you at your price.
- That's great.

236
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,590
Help me pack them up.

237
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,940
- Okay.
- Help me by ironing them a little bit, too.

238
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,410
Why was the salesperson willing to sell them to you?

239
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,740
Because I increased the salesperson's sunk cost.

240
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,570
Sunk cost?

241
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,360
This is an economic term.

242
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,460
To simply put it, the more costs you put in the initial stage,

243
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,370
you'll also need to put in more and more costs in the later stage.

244
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,400
For the salesperson, time and energy are the costs that she needs to put in.

245
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
She already put in a large number of costs.

246
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,790
To prevent losing these sunk costs,

247
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,640
she will try her best to close the deal.

248
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,700
I already gave a very low price on the planning fees.

249
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,940
No, I feel that a lot of fees stated in your proposal,

250
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,130
there's no need for them. The venue decoration part.

251
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,780
Why did you choose such expensive fresh flowers?

252
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,740
I feel the ordinary lisianthus flowers are also good.

253
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,180
- The effect is almost the same.
- Yes.

254
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,470
In these empty areas, there are no people.

255
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,080
Why did you choose such expensive fresh flowers? Artificial flowers?

256
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,790
Artificial flowers, okay? As a wedding planning company, you would have these props?

257
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,680
Yes, we do.

258
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,580
That's great, we'll change it to artificial flowers.

259
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,670
And also, the part where we welcome guests, I don't like this style.

260
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,240
I like simple, low-key, and welcoming.

261
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,140
GM Sheng, Evergreen is a big business, this small money...

262
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,230
Tell me. Evergreen's money is not money?

263
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,140
Evergreen's money, does it blow down from the strong wind?

264
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,820
Besides, every customer has the right to

265
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,000
use the least money to buy the product that he wants the most.

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,540
Right?

267
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,280
Right.

268
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,010
This is the lowest price that I've given so far.

269
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,100
We are also choosing the style that we like. Looking forward to it.

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,030
Looking forward to it.

271
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,980
Congratulations.

272
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,780
See you then.

273
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,950
GM Sheng, I have to say something about you.

274
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,500
Not bad. Whatever I said about bargaining at Evergreen, you still remembered.

275
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,980
Of course I remembered.

276
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,990
Manager Ma, that's a little out of line now.

277
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,650
Is Evergreen's money not money either? Did it get blown here along with the wind?

278
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,260
Evergreen is your customer. Customers have the right to buy what they want at a reasonable price,

279
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,110
isn't that true?

280
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,930
Tell me the truth.

281
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,150
At that moment, did you feel that I was very aggressive,

282
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,430
really hard to interact?

283
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,190
No. I only felt

284
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,020
your competence was too outstanding,

285
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,620
I only wanted you to work for Evergreen.

286
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,710
Good foresight.

287
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,180
It's also in line with your business-like character.

288
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,380
And for the wedding,

289
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,060
the food, drinks, alcohol, I will let Evergreen take care of everything.

290
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,300
The cake for the wedding, I've asked Mengmeng to prepare.

291
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,010
What do you think?

292
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,710
You arrange it.

293
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,140
Zhening, we are about to get married.

294
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,210
Till now, I still couldn't react to it. Is it too fast?

295
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,180
Fast?

296
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,550
I don't think so.

297
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,460
I feel that the time is too slow instead.

298
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,540
GM Sheng, you're looking for me?

299

[Performance Appraisal Report]

300
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,200
GM Sheng, you gave me an S!

301

This quarter, you performed your job very well.

302

And my wedding is this weekend. Will you be the best man?

305
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Best man?

306
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,500
You're not willing to do it?

307
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,600
No, no, no. I'm willing to do it! Of course, I am!

308
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
GM Sheng, please rest assured.

309
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll do my best to be your best man!

310
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I had a suit tailor-made for you.

311
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,100
Try it on. See if it fits.

312
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'll leave then, GM Sheng.

313
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,000
I got a raise!

314
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,000
Look at me. Do I look a bit fat?

315
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,700
Says who?

316
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,500
You look great.

317

Do you have any thoughts on our wedding?

320
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,800
I've thought about it. I want to have a destination wedding with you.

321
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,700
We haven't traveled together yet.

322
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,100

I'm afraid I can't take your order today.

485
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,210
Okay.

486
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,870
I’ll come back some other day.

487
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,350
Wait!

488
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,420
I forgot that there's one more cake.

489
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,580
Today is

490
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,340
the 100-day celebration

491
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,470
of my brother's baby. If you don't mind,

492
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,720
we can go together and enjoy the cake.

493
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,140
I know. We're choosing clothes for a baby girl.

494
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,640
We'll be there later. Very soon.

495
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,740
Why did you buy so many clothes?

496
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,550
Isn't it nice to have more choices?

497
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,420
Look. How's this one?

498
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,480
This is too small! This is for newborn babies. Qianqian's daughter is already 100 days old.

499
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
Are you sure she can wear this?

500
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,400
I... prepared this for our baby.

501
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,360
Isn't that too early?

502
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,300
It's always good to be ready.

503
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,210
Okay.

504
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,580
But why are these all pink?

505
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,400
I thought little girls love pink.

506
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,360
How do you know it will be a girl?

507
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,740
It's a father's intuition.

508
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,090
What if it's a boy?

509
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,150
If it's a boy... we'll swap him with Zhening's daughter.

510
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,340
Really?

511
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,340
You... You mean it?

512
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,010
I'm just joking!

513
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,860
If we don't have a girl, you can keep giving birth until we have one.

514
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,750
- No!
- Keep trying!

515
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,580
These clothes won't be enough! Look at you!

516
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,590
Give birth to triplets.

517
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,230
Are you still going back this time?

518
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,650
Come, the meat is ready!

519
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,420
- No, I'll stay.
- Good.

520
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,040
It's here!

521
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,100
What's she doing? You're scratching people?

522
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,310
Baby! Look who's here!

523
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,570
She's such a good baby!

524
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,110
- Where am I supposed to put this meat? This is...
- Right away. Put it here.

525
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,090
- This is for Guoguo.
- Yes.

526
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,640
Her mom will receive it for her.

527
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,150
- Thank you, Boss Qin.
- And this too.

528
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,740
Yours doesn't look as generous as his.

529
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,520
- Thank you! Guoguo, look at this.
- How is that?

530
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,570
- Do you like them?
- It's so big, post it to show others.

531
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,260
Wow!

532
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,250
She loves it! Look at that!

533
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,520
Let's get seated and enjoy our dinner!

534
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,140
- We're coming!
- Time for dinner!

535
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,400
Coming.

536
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,110
Sit, sit.

537
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,810
I would like to propose a toast.

538
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,530
Let's wish the baby to grow up happily and healthily! Okay?

539
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,940
- Toast for the baby!
- Happy 100-Day!

540
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,330
- Let's wish the baby health and happiness.
- Happy 100-Day!

541
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,420
- Happy 100-Day!
- Thank you, thank you!

542
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,030
Time to cut the cake, Baby.

543
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,790
The baby is too young to cut the cake.

544
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,590
What are you thinking?

545
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,610
The baby GM Sheng is talking about is Miss Xia.

546
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,110
Of course! How can the baby cut the cake? I'll do it.

547
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,950
Time to cut the cake!

548
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,890
I wish she can grow up happily.

549
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,420
5 seconds. Look at the camera.

550
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,790
- Look there!
- I'm coming!

551
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,600
Come! Come!

552
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,400
I need to remind you.

553
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,190
Don't call me "Baby" in front of so many people again.

554
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,210
They were all watching us. It's a bit awkward.

555
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,510
I just got used to it.

556
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,500
I blurted it out unconsciously. But I think it's fine.

557
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,160
No.

558
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,590
Okay.

559
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,290
It's raining. Let's hide from the rain.

560
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,810
Hurry up.

561
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,390
Come here.

562
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,890
Why is it suddenly raining?

563
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,440
[Evergreen Hotel. Perfect is Possible]

564
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,790
Don't you think this place is familiar?

565
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,980
It's the place where you kissed me.

566
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,320
What?

567
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,520
- You kissed me.
- You kissed me!

568
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,560
It was you who started it.

569
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,840
- Me?
- Yes.

570
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,410
Fine. I admit that I did it on purpose.

571
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,530
Great.

572
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,290
Then I'll have to... take revenge.
