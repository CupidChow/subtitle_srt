Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is unavailable. Please dial again later.

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,900
Well...

6
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Coming!

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
Is this the Poen Jasmine Holiday Garden?

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes, it is.

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
Are you Mr. Qin?

10
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,400
We didn't get through your phone.

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,200
I don't suppose there's a base station here.

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Look at you! You're all wet.

Fu Shuangshuang!

14
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,800
- Wait.
- Here's your room.

15
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Aren't you going to give me a room tour?

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's everything you need.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Don't be angry.

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm just here to tell you that I've left Evergreen.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
- Can you listen to my explanation?
- We used to be friends.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
I won't throw you out because of the heavy rain today.

21
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,300
But when you wake up tomorrow, I don't know you, and you don't know me.

22
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,940
How's Building No. 2 going?

23
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,950
Qi Lin still did nothing?

24
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,400
Building No. 2 will reopen soon.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
At this point in time, it's hard for her to talk other shareholders into selling their shares.

26
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
I think before the grand opening,

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
she won't be able to make any big moves.

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
That's good news.

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Look at this.

30
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,700
I found some cases similar to your father's on the internet,

31
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
and there was one case that's exactly the same.

32
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,000
In the end, the patient regained consciousness.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,500
It said here that his family played his favorite music for him every day.

34
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
And he eventually regained consciousness. Take a look.

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not playing music for him! I don't want to care about him.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He is pretty good right now.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
You should stop worrying about him, too.

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,300
All right.

39
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,900
Didn't you tell me you don't want to wake him up?

40
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm not trying to wake him up. I just want to beat him up.

41
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
But as you see,

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,400
with his condition now, he won't have any reaction even if I beat him up or yell at him.

43
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,800
I have to wait for him to regain consciousness, and then I can vent my anger when I beat him up. Right?

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah, I don't think you mean it.

45
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
What happened to me?

46
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,500
I dislike and hate him so much.

47
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,800
But seeing him like that,

48
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I just couldn't bear it.

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't think I'm the emotional type.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,700
This should be "blood is thicker than water."

51
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,480
Is it?

52
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,780
How do you want to wake him up then?

53
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,220
I read about it on the internet.

54
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Acupuncture. It might work.

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Does it work?

56
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,000
We can at least try. I've seen comments saying that it works.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
All right.

58
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
- Let me help you with it.
- No, I'm okay.

59
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,100
- No, thanks.
- I'll help you.

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,400
I'll help you.

61
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, I won't move.

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
I've prepared this new fold-away table for you,

63
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
so it''ll be more convenient for you.

64
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,300
Do you like it?

65
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,200
You can't say no.

66
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
One more spoonful.

67
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Good for you. You know it's bitter?

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Why were you so cooperative when I fed you food before?

69
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I thought you had dementia!

70
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
How can you tell what's tasty and what's not?

71
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
This is bitter.

72
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,600
But good medicines all taste bitter!

73
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,400
You have to take it.

74
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,270
Open up your mouth!

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,100
Good.

76
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
What's up?

77
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,820
Just a moment.

78
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,400
You have to make sure of the price, I'm telling you.

79
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,600
No! You have to stick to the price that I gave you.

80
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
We can't compromise a cent.

81
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
No! What do you mean by "they said it"?

82
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,900
We've signed the contract already.

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Anyway, I'll figure out what to do with the price.

84
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,200
We can stick to your earlier version of the contract.

85
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,070
Hello?

86
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,690
Can you find a place with a better signal?

87
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
I said that I'll figure out the price,

88
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,400
and we'll use our version of the contract. Did you hear me?

89
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
How about this?

90
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Let's do... the day after tomorrow.

91
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,600
Maybe in the afternoon. We'll go there.

92
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Okay? I have to go. See you!

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,900
Why did you spill it?

94
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,030
Were you moving around?

95
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
I think I put it down properly.

96
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,500
What happened?

97
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,200
Was it hot?

98
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,700
I think it has cooled down.

99
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
That's not enough for today's dose.

100
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
No, I'll get another bowl for you.

- Excuse me.
- Hi.

103
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,500
I saw the ad on the door that says "Tour Guide Service."

104
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,470
What is it?

105
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,260
Oh, that.

106
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,400
That means we'll take you on a tour to the tourist destinations.

107
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,690
We provide the transportation, food, and tour guide. ¥500 a day.

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,100
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

109
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,990
Well, do let me know if you need it.

110
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,790
Still doesn't work at all?

111
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,410
Maybe he doesn't want to face reality deep down.

112
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,600
As a father, he was absent for 20 years.

113
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,230
How could he make up for it?

114
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,110
There's a saying that goes,

115
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,340
"You'll never wake up someone who's pretending to sleep."

116
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,060
That keyboard, did he give it to you before he left?

117
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,480
He bought it for me when I was a kid.

118
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,140
Didn't he teach you to play "the Variation of Little Star”?

119
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,920
Maybe you can play that for him.

120
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,720
Will it work?

121
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,980
This is the bond between you and him.

122
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,250
Just give it a try. Maybe it will work.

123
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,310
Let's eat first.

124

- Hi. Welcome.
- Hi.

125
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,370
This keyboard is kind of old, but I'd like to get it repaired.

126
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,590
I don't know if that's possible.

127
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,050
Okay. I'll check.

128
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,020
It's probably too old.

129
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,530
- Yes, we can get it repaired.
- That's great.

Fu Shuangshuang! It's time to get up!

132
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,900
- You've got a job!
- What job?

133
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,750
To be the tour guide for our guest in Room 102!

134
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,360
For whom?

135
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,350
Our guest in Room 102!

136
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,090
No!

137
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,410
I already got his payment, how can you not go?

138
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,660
You already got his money?

139
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,180
There's more reason for me to not go.

140
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,630
Well, forget about it. I'll have to do it myself.

141
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,150
It has been raining a lot recently.

142
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,890
My lower back is aching again!

143
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,430
My back!

144
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,820
Have fun! Enjoy!

145
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,020
Don't worry.

146
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,170
You sold your daughter in such a short while.

147
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,060
- Let me help you.
- None of your business.

148
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,070
Fasten your safety belt.

149
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,960
Let's go!

150
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,650
Do you remember this song?

151
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,160
You taught me to play this when I was a child.

152
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,480
I know you're heartless!

153
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,730
It's so hot!

154
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,330
He still cares about you.

155
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,930
Or he wouldn't have cried.

156
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,560
I hope so.

157
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,290
But he's still suffering from dementia.

158
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,630
Then, what's your next plan?

159
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,250
Next week, his favorite band will have a concert in China.

160
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,660
He promised to take me there to watch it when I was a child.

161
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,190
It's like an agreement we had.

162
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,990
I'll take him to watch the concert next week and see if that can help him remember something.

163
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
Good idea.

164
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,330
Guest, please follow me.

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,600
We're at our first destination at Yangliuqing. The Blessing Pavilion.

166
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,830
According to the legend, Yangliuqing is the place where Emperor Qianlong passed by on his trip to the south.

167
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,970
So the name was given by Emperor Qianlong as well.

168
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,690
- That's it.
- That's it?

169
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,200
But the description says that there's something in the north and in the south.

170
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,990
How do you know?

171
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,930
Well, we'll skip that part.

172
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,660
This is the Blessing Pavilion where

173
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,630
your wishes will come true. Especially if you wish for love.

174
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,190
Look, here and there.

175
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,310
- All right. Next destination!
- Hey, hold on.

176
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,260
I'd like to make a wish.

177
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,930
Just a moment.

178
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,230
I told you it's a trick!

179
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,160
Sir, are you here to make wishes?

180
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,730
Yes, can I have two wish-making boards, please?

181
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,120
- Sure. Here you are.
- Thank you.

182
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,940
And here's your pen.

183
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,420
Don't peek.

184
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,230
Are you writing an essay?

185
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,030
Don't peek!

186
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,200
Do you want to make a wish, too?

187
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,770
My wish right now is for you to disappear before my eyes immediately!

188
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,590
Can that come true?

189
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,830
Can you please not let Xia Qian know?

190
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,170
I beg you.

191
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,410
Shuangshuang, you've got a tour again?

192
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,290
Yes, Uncle Wang.

193
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,390
Excuse me.

194
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,880
All right. That's all for this destination.

195
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,520
Wait. It ended so fast?

196
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,940
You're not cutting corners, right?

197
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,890
We could have finished touring this place in one hour

198
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,800
and you loitered around in there for half a day!

199
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,720
And you think I'm cutting corners?

200
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,140
No, I'm just joking. Don't get upset.

201
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,000
Then... What's next? Where do we go?

202
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,560
Eat lunch.

203
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,650
Move.

204
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,620
What... What's this?

205
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,790
That's all I get for lunch?

206
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,620
What else do you want?

207
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,320
Well, at least two dishes and one soup.

208
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
Look over there. There are so many restaurants.

209
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,660
Skewers, milk tea, and...

210
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,430
- Don't eat it then.
- No, no. I'll eat.

211
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,100
Why aren't you eating?

212
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,700
I'm not hungry.

213
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,080
Back to work. Next—

214
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,470
No need.

215
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,610
Since we are both tired, let's go back to rest.

216
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,050
Who's tired? Are you?

217
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,050
You said you wanted more fun.

218
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,050
Now you are saying you are tired. Such a handful.

219
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,570
I'm getting old. Old people get tired easily.

220
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,900
I was yawning while eating the noodles.

221
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,150
Let's get back.

222
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,770
Come on.

223
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,400
My mom didn't allow him to practice guitar at home.

224
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,020
So he brought me here to practice in the park.

225
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,560
- I wonder if he remembers.
- For sure, he does.

226
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,770
How come you are so sure?

227
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,920
The father-daughter bond. If you remember, he also remembers.

228
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,430
Did he bribe you?

229
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,780
Why are you defending him?

230
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,570
Cotton candy!

231
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,990
He used to buy me that a lot.

232
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,220
Should I buy some to try?

233
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,190
Okay. I'll pass.

234
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,850
I wasn't asking you, just wait here.

235
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,590
I want some.

236
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Hey! One more.

237
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,260
Your dad might want some.

238
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,870
Okay.

239
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,630
You can't keep faking it.

240
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,560
- Can I have one please? Actually two.
- You said she no longer hates me that much.

241
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,630
Maybe I should seek an opportunity and regain my consciousness?

242
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,290
In a few days, she'll take you to a concert.

243
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,820
When it ends, find an opportunity

244
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,460
- to pretend you regained your memory.
- Okay.

245
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,590
- These two.
- Which would you prefer?
- This one is cute.

246
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,340
Remember, when you regain your memory, make it look natural.

247
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,300
Should I practice a little?

248
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,520
You should.

249
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,530
How about this? First, I get confused.

250
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,160
Then, seeing Xia Qian, I get surprised.

251
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,090
Then joyful.

252
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,710
Then guilty, then joyful again.

253
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,540
Guilt... Just joy and guilt, all mixed up.

254
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,630
What do you think?

255
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,330
It's...

256
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,220
a little stiff.

257
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,960
Stiff?

258
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,970
Let me practice.

259
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,300
Confused.

260
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,590
Surprised. Joyful. Guilty. Confused.

261
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,530
Surprised.

262
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,300
Hello, Ma'am.

263
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,630
I would also like to have the guide for today.

264
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm sorry.

265
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,740
My daughter has been hired by someone else today.

266
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,200
Someone else?

267
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,550
[100 M2+N Bento]
[#Simple life gets simpler#]

268
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,440
We will get thirsty during the concert.

269
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,260
I'll go and buy some water.

270
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,630
You'll be all right here by yourself, right?

271
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,860
I'll be right back. Wait here.

272
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,280
Do you know how to drive?!

273
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,970
Dad!

274
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,960
Are you all right?

275
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,670
I'm fine.

276
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,200
Are you hurt?

277
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,000
You recovered?

278
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,860
I...

279
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,090
Suddenly, that motorcycle almost hit you.

280
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,950
So I rushed up right away.

281
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,160
As long as you are fine now.

282
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,290
How come you recovered so suddenly?

283
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,920
Probably... the power of paternal love.

284
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,050
It's incredible. Just like that, I...

285
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,510
Because you wanted to save me?

286
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,110
Yes.

287
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,570
Let's put this back on.

288
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,510
Where's the incision wound on your head?

289
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,170
W-W-What?

290
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,940
Didn't you just get out of a major head surgery?

291
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,680
Where is the incision?

292
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,320
Perhaps I'm healthy

293
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,390
so my body recovers quickly. I...

294
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,820
So you were faking it?

295
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,620
- I'm sorry.
- You can fake everything, how could you fake this?!

296
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,920
No, you...

297
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,940
No, Yueyue, you...

298
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,100
I...

299
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,180
Ouch, that hurts!

300
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,160
- That really hurts!
- It's okay.

301
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,730
No, the client today just kept walking. I even got blisters.

302
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,670
Don't go tomorrow, then.

303
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,310
I can't. I've already promised. How can I not go?

304
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,030
Mom, I'm a little hungry. I'll go and find something.

305
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,370
- You stay here, I'll go. Careful.
- I'll do it.

306
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,030
You kid. Careful!

307
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,200
How about I tell her myself?

308
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,740
No need.

309
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,180
I'm the one who has been lying to her.

310
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,090
The last few days with her, I'm already very grateful.

311
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,870
With you by her side, I can be at ease.

312
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,420
- You still won't forgive him?
- Why should I?

313
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,370
He's a liar.

314
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,020
Actually, I've known for quite some time that he was faking.

315
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,130
For quite some time?

316
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,240
Then, why did you play along?

317
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,520
I wanted to tell you, but...

318
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,960
Can you please not let Xia Qian know?

319
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,260
I beg you.

320
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,490
Take a look.

321
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,300
What is it?

322
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,500
Actually, he has always been by your side.

323
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,510
It's just that his music career hasn't improved,

324
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,650
so he was too ashamed to face you.

325
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,580
So... he was never absent.

326
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,140
He just chose to hide in a corner.

327
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,150
Here.

328
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,830
- Stand there. Stop running!
- Stand there!

329
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,630
See where you can run to!

330
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,500
See where you can run to!

331
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,400
Why are you picking on me? Get away from me!

332
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,360
- What if I don't?
- I'll pick on you!

333
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,610
Go away!

334
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,610
Where is your dad? Did he abandon you?

335
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,560
- Bang!
- Hit you!

336
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,820
Stop.

337
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,520
You two... don't ever bully that girl again!

338
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,900
Otherwise...

339
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,360
- Dad, someone is picking on me!
- Dad, someone is picking on me!

340
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,090
Please,

341
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,170
- I'm begging you.
- Let go of me.

342
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,490
No matter what, ask your sons to stay away from my daughter.

343
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,370
Are you crazy?

344
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,830
Please, I'm begging you.

345
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,660
You two, stay away from his daughter. Don't cause me any trouble. Understand?

346
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,270
Thank you! Thank you!

348
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,420
So he used all means,

349
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,560
eventually, kept those bad boys away from you.

350
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,190
It's totally his style.

351
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,000
So?

352
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,570
So what?

353
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,920
Hello? I'm at Evergreen.

354
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,770
Okay. I'll be there to pick you up.

355
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,040
Hello?

356
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,100
Hello?

357
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,140
Hello? Old Xia?

358
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,790
Hello?

359
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,730
Let's go.

360
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:19,270
Whatever it is, tell him in person.

361
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
Let's go!

362
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,590
But your foot is injured like that, maybe you should take a day off tomorrow?

363
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,790
It's none of your business.

364
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,790
How about I pay you for a whole week to be my guide?

365
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,330
Money is money, whoever is paying. Right?

366
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:10,270
I'd rather get paid by someone else. It's my right to choose my client.

367
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,640
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

368
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,250
You are in my way. I want to go back.

369
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,310
Me too.

370
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,490
No one is here.

371
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,720
We can't delay the surgery any further. If you faint again,

372
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,200
you might not wake up.

373
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,230
Go ahead, then.

374
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,840
Get prepared.

375
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,160
Dad!

376
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,580
Xia Qian?

377
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,160
Where is he?

378
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,480
Tell him that he doesn't have to avoid me anymore.

379
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,690
I forgive him. Where is he now?

380
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,310
I'm asking you, where is he?

381
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,550
He doesn't want me to tell you.

382
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,280
What happened to him?

383
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,120
He really has a brain tumor. And the surgery is quite risky.

384
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,610
He might not make it through.

385
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:23,000
That's why he planned all this, just so he could spend more time with you.

386
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,480
Yueyue.

387
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,150
Daddy is leaving.

388
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,860
I want you to grow up happily.

389
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,110
Daddy!

390
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,070
BP is dropping. Bradycardia has occurred.

391
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,610
- His is in cardiac arrest.
- Get the defibrillator.

392
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,680
I'll go first.

393
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,330
Xia Qian!

394
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,540
Daddy!

395
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,020
Daddy!

396
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,760
Daddy!

397
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,930
Daddy!

398
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,520
Daddy!

399
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,640
Daddy!

400
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,030
Daddy!

401
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,550
His pulse is back.

402
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,670
I won't leave. I won't leave.

403
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,130
I won't leave.

404
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,440
Don't cry my baby, you look very pretty when you smile.

405
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,440
I won't leave.

406
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,600
Dad! Dad!
