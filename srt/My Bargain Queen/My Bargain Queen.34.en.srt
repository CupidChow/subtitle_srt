00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,910
GM Sheng, Miss Xia returned the watch and the wedding gown.

5
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,040
Got it.

6
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,500
This is the recent schedule you've asked me to do.

7
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,850
Is it too hectic?

8
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,580
Then I'll leave now. Let me know if you need anything.

9
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,460
What? They broke up?

10
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,610
No, that's so sudden.

11
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,120
Xiaoai and I don't know how to comfort Sister Qian.

12
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,920
That's why we could only call you.

13
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,720
Got it. I'm on my way now.

14
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,680
Don't worry.

15
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,790
What's going on?

16
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,970
Xia Qian and Sheng Zhening broke up.

17
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,950
They broke up?

18
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,700
Sister Qian cares so much about Sheng Zhening

19
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,120
that she must be heartbroken right now. I must go over there.

20
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,170
I'll take you there.

21
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,350
Sister Qian, this is Shuangshuang. Can you open the door?

22
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,260
Sister Qian.

23
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,940
Sister Qian.

24
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,190
Shuangshuang, why are you here?

25
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,690
Are you okay?

26
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,230
Why wouldn't I be? Come in first.

27
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,860
I've brought you something to eat.

28
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,350
Mu Xiaoyan

29
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,760
made such a fuss

30
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,180
by calling you over late at night.

31
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,420
That's fine. I've brought your favorite food here.

32
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm not hungry. I'm fine.

33
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,470
It's still warm. Eat some while it's warm.

34
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm really not eating as I'm not hungry.

35
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,730
Don't pretend to be fine.

36
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,150
The more you say you're fine,

37
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,810
the more worried I am.

38
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,660
It's just a breakup. Is it that serious?

39
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,830
I'm not eating.

40
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,560
I don't want to eat.

41
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,310
Shuangshuang, I really don't want to eat.

42
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,730
I don't feel good.

43
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,720
It's a little clogged here.

44
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,140
How weak I am.

45
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Since we broke up already, I should forget about him.

46
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,640
But I can't.

47
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,690
Look at this home.

48
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,240
That room,

49
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,460
here, the kitchen,

50
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,260
and there.

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,940
He's everywhere in this home.

52
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,630
I still have vivid memories of us together.

53
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,350
How can I forget about him?

54
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,130
What if I go to Evergreen Hotel?

55
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,460
There's no way I can avoid him.

56
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,840
I thought about it just now.

57
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,940
Maybe I actually don't want to forget him.

58
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,620
How weak I am.

59
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,230
I'm really fine.

60
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,590
Who could've predicted it would be caused by this incident?

61
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,190
If it'd been something else, I would've fought for it and saved it.

62
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,100
I would've definitely told Zhening

63
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,020
I wouldn't break up with him and I never would in my life.

64
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,630
But it was because of this incident.

65
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,990
There's nothing I can do.

66
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,160
When he wanted to break up with me,

67
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,400
I was totally speechless.

68
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,920
I didn't know what to say. What should I have said?

69
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,260
Should I have said, "Zhening, can you forgive me?

70
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,860
Zhening, can we continue to be together?"

71
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,930
I have no idea what to do.

72
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,190
Sister Qian.

73
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,450
What are you doing?

74
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,600
Sister Qian,

75
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,950
eat something and sleep.

76
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,380
When you get up tomorrow,

77
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,830
everything will be a bit better.

78
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,700
I want to sleep well, too.

79
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,740
How I wish this was only a dream.

80
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,340
The sky lantern and the car accident,

81
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,120
I wish all this was fake.

82
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,500
I wish

83
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,020
when waking up,

84
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,610
I would still be me

85
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,150
and Sheng Zhening would still be Sheng Zhening.

86
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,870
I wish we both would still be together. But this is real.

87
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,100
There's nothing I can do.

88
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,450
Nothing.

89
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,900
Sister Qian.

90
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,440
How's Sister Qian?

91
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,630
She got so tired from crying that she fell asleep.

92
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,280
But she can't continue like that.

93
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,690
Exactly. She can't cry every day.

94
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,810
Don't worry too much.

95
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,410
Those going through a breakup usually vent their feelings in their own way.

96
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,720
Sometimes it's even worse to force her to be happy.

97
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,910
I'll go back and come up with a way.

98
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,860
Thank you for your hard work.

99
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,190
Did you notice

100
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,960
that GM Sheng hasn't picked up Team Leader Xia when she gets off work?

101
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,330
There have been many things to deal with at the hotel. Both of them are busy bees. How would they have time to meet?

102
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,970
You're right. I haven't seen my boyfriend for a while as well.

103
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,110
If I could see him right now, I would be ecstatic for sure.

105

You're here. What do you want to drink? I'll fix it for you.

106
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,970
I'm good. Go back to work now.

107
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,440
We'll go back to work then.

108
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,340
Team Leader Xia,

109
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,730
can I ask you a favor?

110
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,110
I have a meeting in a bit. Can you go instead?

111
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,740
I shouldn't trouble you,

112
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,100
but my head has been hurting all day.

113
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,590
I want to take some time off and go to the hospital.

114
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,900
Are you okay?

115
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,620
Migraine. I've had it for a while.

116
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,360
I want to ask you,

117
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,430
what's the meeting about?

118
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,670
Just a regular meeting within the department,

119
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,210
mainly to talk about the implementation of your bulk buying project.

120
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,390
All right. Take some rest. I'll go for you.

121
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,460
Good. In conference room eight.

122
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,380
Oh, remember to arrive early.

123

What are you doing here?

126

Isn't there a department meeting today?

127
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,220
Where's Manager Wang?

128
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,080
He...

129
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,370
He has a headache so I'm attending the meeting for him.

130
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,560
I didn't know you were also here.

131
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,830
Hello, Anan? Tell Manager Wang to meet me in my office.

132
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,630
Okay, GM Sheng.

133
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,100
Why did I get called all of a sudden?

134
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,510
What mess did you create?

135
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,500
What did I do?

136
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,350
Are you really sick? Why did you ask Miss Xia to attend the meeting for you?

137
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,740
About that... I saw that both she and GM Sheng were pretty busy lately.

138
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,380
So I gave them an opportunity to be alone.

139
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,370
They broke up.

140
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,180
Don't ask for trouble.

141
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,590
They broke up? When did it happen? Why didn't I know about this?

142
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,300
I did this out of good intentions. What do I do now?

143
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,960
What else can you do?

144
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,160
Just listen to what GM Sheng has to say to you and apologize.

145
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,870
Now you have a headache. Is it real or fake?

146
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,360
It was fake.

147
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,050
But now it's real.

148
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,840
Hurry and head in.

149
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,330
Why is GM Sheng still not—

150
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,120
Right. GM Sheng has never been late to meetings.

151
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,050
- Hello, Manager Chen.
- Hello, Manager Chen.

152
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,250
Hello, Manager Chen.

153
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,280
I apologize for being late.

154
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,350
GM Sheng asked me at the last minute to attend today's meeting for him.

155
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,350
Okay, let's begin.

this time we need to hold the most perfect and grand wedding.

158
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,150
I want the whole world to know that I'm marrying you.

159
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Last time, you said this mug looked nice.

160
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,530
I secretly bought it. Do you like it?

161
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,670
You're not even aware that your razor is broken.

162

There. I bought you a new one.

but love is eternal.

167
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,980
To have someone to miss, it is happiness.

168
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,310
This winter, I will definitely take Mengmeng to see the snow in Otaru.

169
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,570
Starting from the canal, walking along the river will get us to the Music Box Museum.

170
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,890
When we get there, I'll make her a token at the Glass Palace.

171
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,630
It's best if we set out at nightfall when the temperature drops and the evening lights are lit.

172
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,080
I can use a camera to record her smile.

173
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,010
It'll be even better with falling snow.

174
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,270
I can hold her hand to keep her warm. How nice.

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,470
The Tenguyama Ski Resort is where Hiroko Watanabe shouted "How are you? I'm fine"

176
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,360
to distant mountains in "Love Letter."

177
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,260
I actually never really liked winter.

178
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,410
I don't know if I'd start to like winter because of this trip.

179
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,150
I heard that you can closely watch the Gentoo penguins stroll at the Otaru Aquarium.

180
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,040
These little ones line up to walk around in the snowy designated area.

181
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,320
But they're totally disobedient.

182
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,670
They frequently walk backward, walk in the wrong direction, and fight during the walk.

183
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,200
When Mengmeng has the baby, I must take her and the baby to see them together.

184
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,640
Manager Wang.
[Application for resignation]

185
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,320
This is my application for resignation.

186
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,630
Team Leader Xia, it seems like I did something bad with my good intentions.

187
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,690
That's not it. My resignation has nothing to do with you.

188
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,670
I originally came to Evergreen to help out. Now that the app has officially launched,

189
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,480
my work here is done.

190
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,900
- But...
- I've already made my decision.

191
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,900
To be honest with you, putting aside your relationship with GM Sheng,

192
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,160
you are one of the most exceptional employees I've ever met.

193
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,020
The app wouldn't have been able to successfully launch without you.

194
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,940
Good work during this time.

195
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,490
It's nothing, I did what was required of me.

196
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,420
And thank you for your care during this time.

197
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,190
All right. Since you've already made your decision,

198
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,560
then I'll tell human resources to hurry up with your resignation process.

199
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,730
Okay, thank you.

200
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,110
GM Sheng, Miss Xia has resigned.

201
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,890
Human resources are processing her resignation right now and want to know if you have any instructions.

202
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,130
No.

203
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,090
- Oh.
- When does the meeting with the Marketing Department start?

204
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,070
In half an hour.

205
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,810
Prepare for it.

206
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,320
Do you not care even a little bit about Miss Xia's resignation?

207
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,910
Leave.

208
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,120
What's going on now?

209
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,010
I don't know, either.

210
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,200
This plot is too bewildering.

211
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,100
I agree.

212
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,520
He Min. Xiao Fan.

213
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,630
This is for you two.

214
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,570
I organized some thoughts and methods on product selection for the app. It might be useful later.

215
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,740
Thank you, Team Leader Xia.

216
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,290
You're welcome.

217
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,210
Team Leader Xia, let us walk you out.

218
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,480
Yes.

219
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,100
No need. Just focus on work, I don't have a lot of things so I can do it myself.

220
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,800
Good luck.

221
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,590
To be honest, I really don't want Team Leader Xia to leave.

222
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,290
She's a good person, has little drama, great abilities, and would never let her subordinates take the fall.

223
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,690
This kind of leader will be hard to come by in the future.

224
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,900
You're right. What do you think is wrong with GM Sheng?

225
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,780
He can't mess around just because he's rich.

226
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,130
Who knows what he's thinking?

227
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,930
What? Sister Qian resigned from Evergreen?

228
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,130
Then, how is she doing now? Is she really upset?

229
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,140
She looks like a normal person, but maybe because she doesn't want us to worry.

230
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,120
Then, should we ask her to have dinner together tonight? Otherwise being alone would feel so bad.

231
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,700
I already asked. She said she has to clean her room.

232
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,180
Maybe she's trying to stay busy so she won't think about Shen Zhening.

233
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,060
Is it okay? Too tight, too loose?

234
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,550
Just right.

235
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,150
- Director Lu.
- Xiao He.

236
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,880
A personalized self-guided travel plan to Japan.

237
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,980
My wife arranged everything for you. Just pick the date.

238
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,480
Thank you, I've troubled you.

239
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,220
My wife said that your travel plan to Japan is better than that of professionals.

240
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,020
The route is good and interesting. She even complained that I was boring

241
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,120
and knew nothing about romance.

242
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,570
When do you plan on going?

243
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,460
I've been pretty busy recently. I'm not sure yet.

244
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,610
Xiao He, you've been working hard recently. But you must also

245
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,300
balance your work and personal life.

246
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,420
I heard that you've been staying in the employee dorms?

247
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,290
Yes.

248
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,330
What happened? Did you two fight?

249
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,160
No, we are not fighting.

250
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,250
Xiao He, couples should never go to bed mad.

251
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:39,900
I know you have a lot on your mind. But it's not easy for two people to be together, right?

252
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:46,130
Even the most intimate couples have countless moments when they get so annoyed, they want to break up.

253
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,500
But those who stay together

254
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,320
don't just think about the pain in front of them, but also the romance and sweetness ahead of them.

255
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,660
So I'm saying, just coax the girl.

256
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,990
I got it. Thank you, Director Lu.

257
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,720
All right, I'm going now.

258
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,300
- Hello.
- Did you order takeout? Last digits 0073?

259
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
Yes. Thank you.

260
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,390
I thought I made a mistake. It's so close you could've just picked it up. I don't get it.

261
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,770
[ZXD Review: So happy to try today's special cake.]

262
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,130
[Review Received]

263
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,520
The cake is really delicious. Thank you.

264
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,790
Thank you for your support.

265
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,420
625339-321.

266
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,140
- Xiaoyan.
- Sister Qian.

267
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,590
Here. A new milk tea shop opened right outside. I bought this for you to try.

268
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,310
- Thank you, Sister Qian.
- Thank you.

269
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,130
All right, get to work. I'm heading upstairs. It's too hot.

270
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,160
Don't you think that Sister Qian recovered well? She's actively doing her work and is in a good condition.

271
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,990
It seems like she's completely come out of the trauma of the breakup.

272
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,170
I don't know. Perhaps.

273
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,150
I wonder how GM Sheng is doing.

274
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,260
- Why are you looking at me?
- Go and ask.

275
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,470
Who am I asking?

276
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,960
Aren't you quite close to GM Sheng's assistant? Ask him.

277
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,350
Who's close to him? Stop mentioning him. I get annoyed just hearing about him.

278
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,380
- Are you going or not?
- No.

279
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,350
Are you going or not?

280
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,290
No.

281
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,090
Aren't you afraid of me telling Sister Qian about you playing games at work?

282
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,560
Don't you just want to ask me about GM Sheng and Miss Xia?

283
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,140
Yes.

284
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,130
How has Sheng Zhening been recently?

285
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,880
GM Sheng itches to work 25 hours a day.

286
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,810
He works from morning to night. He's about to overwork himself.

287
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,700
I'm affected by it, too.

288
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,490
He just wants to numb himself with work.

289
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,480
Our Sister Qian is like that, too.

290
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:53,220
Breakup is too painful. Good thing I don't have a girlfriend.

291
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,600
Let me tell you. I used to be so jealous of those who had girlfriends.

292
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,920
But now, I'm glad that I'm single.

293
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,380
Actually, to tell you the truth, I really don't care about how Sheng Zhening is doing.

294
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,720
But I care about our Sister Qian. Although she usually looks fine, laughing and talking,

295
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,870
I just can't pinpoint what's wrong.

296
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,980
Commoners like us don't understand relationships.

297
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,620
So, for Sister Qian to be in a better mood,

298
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,940
should I hope for Sheng Zhening to suffer or for him to let go soon?

299
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,680
Breakup? That's impossible. I've been with GM Sheng for so many years.

300
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,020
This has never happened. This is the first time.

301
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,240
The first time I've seen him care about a girl so much.

302
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,930
What is this called? "Destiny makes fools of people."

303
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,160
"Destiny makes fools of people." Come.

304
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,620
Do you want some?

305
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,620
You put mayonnaise? Nice.

306
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,520
Brother, let me discuss something with you.

307
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,070
- What is it?
- We've known each other for a while now.

308
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,870
You should know what kind of person I am.

309
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,890
I don't. Cut to the chase.

310
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,420
Like I've said to you before, your spare bedroom can accommodate someone after it's tidied up.

311
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
I'm not renting.

312
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,310
I mean it.

313
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,580
It seems like your place is pretty close to Worth or Not. How about this?

314
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,340
We'll split the utility bills 40/60.

315
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,170
I'll pay 60% and you'll pay 40%. I'll be short-changed a bit.

316
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,650
I mean it too. Not renting.

317
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,490
30/70. Is that fine?

318
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:12,480
Can you not understand my words? I said not renting. Even if you pay all the utilities, I still won't rent it out.

319
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,780
You're so lame.

320
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,900
Do you still want Sheng Zhening and Sister Qian to get back together?

321
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,530
Of course.

322
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,040
Then we must become roommates. Think about it.

323
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,400
If we become roommates, we can exchange information at any time,

324
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,600
and come up with suggestions to get them back together. Otherwise, it would be inconvenient. If anything new happens,

325
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,910
and we can't communicate with each other,

326
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,430
they'd miss an opportunity. Don't you think that will be a pity?

327
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,180
You're still here.

328
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,540
Mom, I'm heading out. Why are you here?

329
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,180
I came to bring you some food.

330
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,140
I know to eat every day. You don't have to deliver every meal.

331
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,550
I didn't specifically come to deliver it to you.

332
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:03,410
Hu Dayuan cooks too much every time. You doesn't come back to eat and I can't eat it all myself, so I'm dropping it off on my way.

333
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,640
I'm really not eating. I'm in a hurry to a meeting.

334
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,000
How about this? Put it here and I'll heat it up to eat when I come home tonight. I'm leaving.

335
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,110
Just put it there.

336
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,400
You're playing games again? Don't you know that Sister Qian will be back soon?

337
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,200
Don't disturb me.

338
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
Hello, you are?

339
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
You do livestream promotions here, right?

341
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

342
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,000
Our amusement park wants your livestream to promote us.

343
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,600
Okay, okay. We can discuss this inside.

344
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,800
- This way, please.
- Okay.

345
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,470
This is the information about our amusement park.

346
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,700
Excuse me.

347
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
- Come here for a second.
- What?

348
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
This is Theme Park Adventure.

349
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,700
- What about it?
- GM Sheng proposed to Sister Qian here.

350
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,200
It's not good for us to take this.

351
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Then we can't take it.

352
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm sorry.

353
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,100
I'm afraid we can't take this project.

354
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,800
Why not?

355
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,600
We're not very good at this kind of business.

356
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Right. We've never taken on a project in this field.

357
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,600
So we might not be experienced enough.

358
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,900
That's fine. This is actually really easy.

359
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,600
Just tell everyone about our amusement park

360
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
on your livestream E-commerce platform. We have people

361
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,400
to do the copywriting. It won't take up too much of your time.

362
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,600
Also, we can offer you annual passes.

363
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,400
You can visit as many times as you'd like within a year.

364
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
Really?

365
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
We still can't take this.

366
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,600
We're taking it.

367
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
Sister Qian.

368
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,900
Our amusement park uses modern high-technology

369
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,500
to show the past and future of humanity.

370
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,000
It's a new concept theme park.

371
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,400
Next, I want to emphasize this romantic journey.

372
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,900
Look. This is a double-deck carousel.

373
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,400
This is a skydiving tower.

374
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,600
And this particularly long corridor is called the Confession Corridor.

375
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
After passing through the corridor, you reach

376
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,600
the castle we built with a lot of money.
 [Sea of Flowers Corridor]

377
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
This castle is very grand,

378
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,400
romantic, and beautiful. It's perfect for marriage proposals.

379
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
The general manager of Evergreen Hotel

380
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,600
booked this space twice.

381
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,800
I heard that it was to propose to his girlfriend.

382
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,400
Really?

383
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,300
I think you're right.

384
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
It's really appropriate.

385
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,000
I know the two of you didn't want to take on this project because of me.

386
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,600
I've already said I am fine. Don't worry about me.

387
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,200
We got it.

388
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,400
Then, after organizing the information, you guys can go home and take some rest.

389
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,600
Okay.

390
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm heading upstairs then.

391
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,000
I think Sister Qian has moved on entirely.

392
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,800
If I were to break up with my boyfriend and see the location he proposed to me at,

393
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,600
all of our good memories would flash before me.

394
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
I definitely wouldn't help but break into tears.

395
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,000
But look at Sister Qian today, as if nothing has happened.

396
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,000
She must have completely forgotten it to be like this.

397
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,700
You think so?

398
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm sure. Sister Qian has moved on entirely.

399
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Let me help you.

400
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
Why did you put it so high up?

401
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,400
So every time you can't reach, you'd think

402
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
about how great it would be if I were here.

403
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,900
Put it back.

404
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,600
That photo in your wallet. I want it back.

405
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
I hid it.

406
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
I know. Where did you hide it?

407
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm telling you,

408
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
you'll never find it.

409
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,400
So you hid it here.

410
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
My summer.

411
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,890
You wrote "my summer" during that time.

412
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,000
What's the point in finding it now?

413
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,200
♫ My dear you ♫

414
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,200
♫ Let's say goodbye ♫

415
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:55,400
♫ The cherry blossoms on the street are so pretty  ♫

416
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,500
♫ This heaven and earth  ♫

♫ If the wind blows  ♫

418
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:11,700
♫ This would be my silent poem to you  ♫

419
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:19,800
♫ Till the end of time, let the regret pass  ♫

420
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:28,600
♫ But accidentally stir up the ripple of longing  ♫

421
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:36,200
♫ I run toward you, but pass by you ♫

422
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:45,000
♫ The night engulfs your face,
from then I dare not look at the sunset  ♫

423
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,500
I don't want to see it!

424
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:01,200
♫ I finally understand loss has its meanings as well  ♫

425
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,000
♫ I run toward you ♫

426
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,500
Why did you let me find it?

427
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,900
♫ But pass by you ♫

428
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,600
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

429
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,800
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

430
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,200
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

431
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,300
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

432
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,600
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

433
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,800
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

434
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,400
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

435
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,200
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

436
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,200
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

437
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,800
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

438

♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

439
