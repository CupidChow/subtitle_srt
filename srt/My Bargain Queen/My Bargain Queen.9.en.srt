[Episode 9]

3
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,250
Hey! Don't be so loud.

4
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,350
Didn't you ask me who Sheng Zhening was?

5
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,320
That's him.

6
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,280
- Are you guys...
- Nothing has happened between us.

7
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,260
Actually, he has been pursuing me.

8
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,590
Haven't I been sleep talking? It is caused by his annoyance.

9
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,160
Really?

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,890
Of course! Why would I lie to you?

11
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,620
Help yourself!

12
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,570
Stop looking at him!

13
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,850
What does he do?

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,540
You know Evergreen Hotel?

15
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,080
- I know.
- His family owns it.

16
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,680
Do you know how he has been pursuing me?

17
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,510
Take a guess.

18
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,540
Gifts you flowers? Designer bags? Treats you to extravagant feasts?

19
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,400
Mom, where's your imagination?

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,370
What else could it be?

21
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,850
He wanted to take me to Iceland

22
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,740
to see the aurora, and rented a yacht.

23
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,220
But I was too busy and couldn't be bothered to go.

24
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,230
And this.

25
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,110
What is it?

26
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,210
A black card.

27
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,010
It is unlimited and you can spend as much money as you want.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,130
But I recall your instructions.

29
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,640
We don't waste a dollar of other people, so I never used it.

30
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,500
So look at those boys you introduced to me earlier.

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,520
They cannot compare with such a brilliant man!

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,100
Don't worry about my relationship. Okay?

33
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,540
Right, right. They can't compare.

34
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,820
My gosh.

35
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,620
Xiao Sheng.

36
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,460
I heard from Xia Qian that you've been pursuing her for two months.

37
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,790
Is that what she said?

38
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,320
Yes.

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,590
She lied.

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
- What? Well...
- In fact,

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,310
I've been pursuing her for about a year.

42
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,300
You've got such good qualities! What do you like about Xia Qian?

43
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,250
I don't know exactly what I like about her.

44
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,040
Just say something random.

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,230
She's bad-tempered, stubborn,

46
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,510
and she never thinks about the consequences when doing things.

47
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,430
She's like a firecracker and explodes easily.

48
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,580
She plays petty tricks sometimes.

49
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,180
Sheng Zhening! That's enough.

50
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,260
But, Auntie, you know, isn't love just like that?

51
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,790
Sometimes you can't tell what's wrong,

52
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,740
but nobody can replace her.

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,690
That's it! That's it! That is exactly right!

54
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,880
See?

55
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,220
It's time to eat!

56
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,050
What's wrong with you?

57
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,620
Did you throw up? Are you not feeling well?

58
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,570
Hello?

59
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,210
Hello, Shuangshuang. I think the cat's not feeling well.

60
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,400
Not feeling well? What are the symptoms?

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,900
I-I think it threw up.

62
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,690
You should take it to the vet. I'll meet you there.

63
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,960
Okay, I'll take it to the vet.

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,860
Thank you so much for doing that!

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,360
I really appreciate it.

66
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,620
You're very welcome. You've helped me a lot.

67
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,510
Were you not satisfied with my performance just now?

68
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,980
You performed too well. My mom

69
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,760
will urge me to accept you. Then what will happen?

70
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,910
Will you keep pretending to be my boyfriend?

71
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,540
Work with me. Don't mess this up.

72
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,420
This one has a lot of light and the sight is beautiful.

73
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,800
Honey,

74
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,470
I don't like other rooms. I just want this one.

75
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
Okay?

76
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,820
Well, in that case,

77
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,580
I think it will be fine.

78
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,790
What's fine?

79
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,100
Nothing. I just wanted to say thank you.

80
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,200
If you need anything,

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,750
just let me know. I can continue to pretend to be your boyfriend.

82
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,570
It's fine.

83
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,030
Okay. Thank you, GM Sheng.

84
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,010
If I do need your help, I'll definitely ask you.

85
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,500
How's the cat?

86
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,560
The vet says it might be indigestion. They did a thorough check-up on it.

87
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,340
I'm waiting for the report.

88
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,360
Indigestion?

89
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,390
Is it because you changed its food?

90
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,520
Changing its food?

91
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,080
The cat food I recommended last time, did you change to it all at once?

92
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,150
Shouldn't I just change to the new brand?

93
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,600
A cat's food needs to be changed gradually.

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,740
You have to mix the old and new food in proportion, to let it get used to the new food.

95
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,500
Because different brands of cat food have different levels of crude protein and smell differently.

96
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,200
The cat will naturally repel it and have an adverse physical reaction.

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,590
I see.

98
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,260
It's okay! I'll let you know what to keep in mind when keeping a cat,

99
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,390
so you'll know.

100
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,490
I think it's fine now.

101
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,030
The injection might still take a long time.

102
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,930
We can rest on the sofa.

103
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,350
This way.

104
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,210
Sorry for asking you to come out at night. You must be hungry.

105
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,010
I am a little bit hungry.

106
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,720
Get some rest there. I'll go buy some food.

107
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,260
Sheng Zhening!

108
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,260
You...

109
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,210
What are you doing? No!

110
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,780
Give me your hand

111
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,630
Put it on!

112
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,520
What are you doing?

113
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,880
You know me.

114
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,100
My mom urges me to get married every day. I'm going crazy.

115
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,600
You have to marry me today. But don't worry,

116
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
once you put the ring on, you're mine. I'll be responsible for you.

117
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,720
Let me go! No!

118
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,400
[Director Xue]

119
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,640
I've got something to deal with at the company. Please send the cat to my house when she's recovered.

120
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,150
Password to the door: 081399.

121
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,140
Director Yu has transferred the 2% shares he has to Lihe Capital.

122
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,240
If that's the case, we now have 5% of the share in our hands.

123
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
You've done a good job this time.

124
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,400
Hey, I heard that a hotel reviewer is going to stay at Building No.2.

125
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,180
If I remember it correctly, Building No.2 is an old building. Right?

126
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,800
It was built 20 years ago. The electricity and pumping systems are aged.

127
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,630
If it wasn't for the fact that we were tight on money, we would have renovated the place long ago.

128
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,760
In that case,

129
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,800
whether Evergreen can still be rated as a 5-star hotel depends on his assessment.

130
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,410
We can do something about it.

131
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,940
If Evergreen drops a star because of Building No.2,

132
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,060
maybe the shareholders will vote to sell it.

133
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,360
Sheng Zhening is very nostalgic.

134
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,520
It's hard to convince him to sell Building No.2.

135
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,870
Is it? I heard that the shareholders

136
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,170
are not willing to spend money on an old building like that.

137
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,180
Either sell it or lose the support of the shareholders.

138
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,560
It's all up to Sheng Zhening.

139
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,970
I know it will be hard.

140
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,600
But I'm very confident in Building No.2.

141
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,390
Are you sure we don't need to arrange something special?

142
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,830
If we can find the reviewer, we can...

143
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,750
Just do what we normally do. That'll be enough.

144
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,930
The yellow does not meet the green again.
(TN: idiom meaning 'unable to make ends meet')

145
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,610
Hello, Anan.

146
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,980
Hello, Miss Xia.

147
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,840
Are you available to come to Building No.2 of Evergreen Hotel now?

148
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,970
I have a job to discuss with you.

149
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,050
Great! No problem. I've got time. I'll be right there right away.

150
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,040
May I request something really small before you come?

151
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,470
Sure! What is it?

152
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,720
Hey!

153
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,390
I'm sorry.

154
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,310
Which floor?

155
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,950
Hello?

156
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,250
Hello?

157
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,070
Where are you?

158
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,190
At the company. What's up?

159
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,420
- Nothing. 
- Okay, then bye.

160
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

161
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,590
Come in.

162
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,040
Vice GM Qin, here's the information about Building No.2 that you requested.

163
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,950
Vice GM Qin, there's a new chef at the hotel that specializes in Japanese cooking.

164
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,660
You've been busy these days and haven't had much chance to eat,

165
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,060
would you like to try it later?

166
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,830
Your job is not to research the new chef at the catering department,

167
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,490
but to find the hotel reviewer as soon as possible.

168
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm sorry, Vice GM Qin.

169
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,250
It's okay.

170
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,350
That was so close!

171
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,710
Let me tell you. He almost found out who I was.

172
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,570
But don't worry.

173
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,650
Why do you look at me like that?

174
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,390
You're the one who asked me to dress up like this.

175
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,920
I didn't have a chance to ask you. Did you asked me to dress up like this

176
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,510
just so Sheng Zhening wouldn't know?

177
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,930
Actually, I came to ask for your help on my own. GM Sheng doesn't know.

178
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,350
Here are the previous rating documents of Evergreen. Please take a look.

179
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,860
This is your room card.

180
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,770
Miss Xia, please stay here for a while

181
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,580
until we find the reviewer.

182
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,830
I will try. But you are looking for someone,

183
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,480
why do you ask me? I'm not a private detective.

184
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,860
That's not true.

185
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,740
Based on my observation these days, I've found that

186
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,400
you're smart, quick-witted, and you have good analytical skills and capabilities.

187
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,010
Well, it's mostly because I can't afford a private detective.

188
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,220
Little kitten, I'll put you here for a while.

189
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,710
This place doesn't feel like home at all.

190
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,090
That's strange.

191
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,710
Do you like your new home?

192
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,650
Is this a big house for you?

193
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,540
It's got three floors.

194
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,290
Look at this. Do you like it? It's here.

195
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,190
Are you hungry?

196
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,130
I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.

197
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,910
You must go into the chairman's office.

198
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,180
- It's fine. I'll go soon.
- Okay, I'm going.

[Driver]

200
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,740
Wait. There are still some documents and data to look through.

201
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,740
- Hello?
- Hello, Shuangshuang.

202
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,460
You haven't eaten yet, right?

203
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,740
Can I treat you to dinner?

204
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,860
I know a Japanese restaurant that's really good.

205
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,400
I've been waiting for you to ask.

206
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,220
I'm hungry!

207
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,010
- I'll pick you up.
- Okay.

208
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,010
Xiao Sheng!

209
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,810
What brings you here?

210
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,190
Come in.

211
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,250
- You've been dreaming a lot about Xia Qian these days?
- Yeah.

212
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,020
- And she's always on your mind?
- Yes.

213
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,510
- And you always mistake other girls for her?
- Yeah.

214
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,970
- This is it, Xiao Sheng. You're lovesick.
- What?

215
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,470
- How can it be?
- Of course!

216
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,190
That's what's happening.

217
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,710
But it's not a good time today. Xia Qian's not home. She's on a business trip.

218
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,170
- A business trip?
- Yeah! She went on a business trip.

219
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,480
Didn't she tell you about it?

220
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,530
This child...

221
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,890
But since you're here, I'll help you out. I'll help you cheat.

222
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,410
Xia Qian's favorite fruit is cherries.

223
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,670
Right. She likes matcha ice cream.

224
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,120
She likes corn but not corn-flavored candy.

225
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,000
She likes cleaning up on her own when she's angry,

226
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,720
She likes horror films, but after she watches them, she is always scared to sleep alone.

227
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,190
And... I think that's enough. Stop writing.

228
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,090
I'll fill you in when I think of more.

229
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,650
Okay.

230
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,220
Since you're here, I'll just do all I can to help.

231
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,420
I'll show you something. Come with me.

232
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,110
Quick. I want to show you something interesting.

233
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,350
Look at this.

234
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,080
This is when she was six.

235
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,750
This is when she wore the red scarf in primary school.

236
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,490
This is when she was three months old.

237
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,860
This one... is her father. Let's skip it.

238
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,120
Middle school, high school and college. She was different every year.

239
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,950
This is when she learned to dance.

240
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,730
She was wearing this. Well, just choose whichever you like.

241
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,680
Why is she crying in this one?

242
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,990
This is... I don't remember which year, it was the children's day.

243
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,820
Xia Qian had a good friend who got injured.

244
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,620
And she asked Xia Qian to dance on her behalf. She said yes immediately.

245
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,990
But in the end, she got scared on stage.

246
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,800
She cried while dancing, danced while crying.

247
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,180
So I took this picture of her.

248
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,860
Actually, she's always been like that since she was a child.

249
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,990
She's stubborn. Whatever she promised to do,

250
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,990
she would do it even if she didn't like it,

251
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,360
and even if she's crying. She's just like that.

252
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,630
Hey, Auntie. I think I'll just take this one.

253
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,450
- No, you should choose a better one.
- Hey, it's cute.

254
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,250
I like it.

255
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,850
Okay.

256
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,350
Thanks, Auntie.

257
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,820
Last bite.

258
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,790
Good! You've finished it all!

259
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,920
You can eat a lot!

260
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,190
I rarely see any girl that looks so happy when she's eating.

261
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,890
It's because it's delicious!

262
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,600
- By the way, are you busy after dinner?
- No.

263
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,300
Since you're not, can you help me with something?

264
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,230
How about this one?

265
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,220
How old is she?

266
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,130
She's about the same age as you.

267
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,490
Then, what is she like?

268
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,540
Same as you. Energetic, positive, always smiling.

269
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,560
What about her skin?

270
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,220
Her skin?

271
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,230
Very fair, just like you.

272
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,370
You're not buying the gift for me, are you?

273
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,830
Why would I buy a gift for you?

274
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,820
No, I was just joking.

275
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,990
Then... who is it for?

276
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:56,050
A female friend? Or someone you adore?

277
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,310
Why do you care so much?

278
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,030
I'm just... I'm just curious,

279
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,920
so I can help you choose the right gift.

280
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,820
I’m choosing a gift for Ning Meng.

281
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,860
You said that she'll be happy if I can make her smile.

282
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,950
Then I'll do my best to help.

283
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,800
Ning Meng it is.

284
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,900
By the way, I almost forgot. This is for you.

285
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,860
What is it?

286
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,600
Guidelines for keeping a cat.

287
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,930
Is it so hard to keep a cat?

288
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,230
It's full of words!

289
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,620
It's not a lot.

290
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,030
The key thing to keep in mind is that cats need human company.

291
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,460
Because in the world of cats,

292
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,670
they don't know what we're up to when we leave them during the day.

293
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,960
When you go to work, the cat thinks you're out hunting for it.

294
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,230
And when you come home, it will run to you,

295
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,490
sniff you, and see if you've caught a can of chicken

296
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,950
or a can of fish.

297
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,220
But if you don't come home for a long time,

298
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,570
the cat might think that

299
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,730
you were eaten while you hunted.

300
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,720
- Eaten?
- Yes.

301
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,300
I didn't know you knew so much about cats!

302
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,190
I've kept a cat when I was a child.

303
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,090
But because...

304
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,790
the cat scratched me a lot, my mom gave it away.

305
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,590
Your mom gave the cat away,

306
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,660
were you sad?

307
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,330
I was at the beginning, I missed the cat a lot.

308
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,820
After all, I had kept it for so long.

309
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,770
But... now I'm keeping a cat again!

310
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,090
Exactly! You should often visit it when you have time.

311
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,230
Or it will believe that its owner has been eaten.

312
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,700
Right. We can't make it feel that both owners have been eaten.

313
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,790
Both... Yeah, both owners.

314
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,290
We're here. I'll go upstairs now.

315
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,330
Wait a moment.

316
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,230
This is your gift.

317
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,140
Thank you!

318
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,090
I can't believe I have a gift! I'll open it when I'm home.

319
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,710
Thank you. See you!

Brother Hebo, I'd like to ask a favor from you.

324
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,540
I want to have a wedding oath-taking ceremony at the hotel.

325
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,020
Oath-taking ceremony?

326
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:40,040
Anan said that the reviewer will rate every aspect of the hotel,

327
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,870
from the administration of the hotel to the toilet,

328
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,290
paying attention to every detail.

329
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,030
I don't think a regular guest would pay so much attention to the carpet of the hotel!

330
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,410
He might be the one!

331
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,090
He happens to be in the room opposite from mine!

332
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,570
Room Service.

333
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,570
Room service is a very important item for an assessment.

334
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:53,630
[11:45 - room service. Lunch: dessert, fruit platter, one dish and one soup.]

335
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,760
Housekeeping.

336
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,450
[15:10 - housekeeping. Room cleaning.]

337
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,610
This reviewer is working really hard!

338
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,270
[18:30 - room service. Dinner: alcohol and drinks, Japanese food, dessert.]

339
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,830
[21:00 - room service. Laundry.]

340
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,260
Anan, reporting my findings to you.

341
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,970
I might have found the reviewer.

342
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,040
Sir, your lunch is here.

343
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,200
Sir...

344
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,930
GM Sheng.

345
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,720
Why are you here?

346
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,920
I was just dropping by and Xiao Liu needed help. And delivering your food since I'm here.

347
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,680
- Really?
- Yeah...

348
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,240
I'm busy. I'll leave first.

349
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,550
- The reviewer you found...
- Come inside.

350
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,470
- How did it go?
- The reviewer you found...

351
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,360
is GM Sheng.

352
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,310
GM Sheng?

353
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,800
- In that room?
- Exactly.

354
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,260
Why is he living in the hotel?

355
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,860
I guess he's experiencing the quality of the service as a guest,

356
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,040
to make sure it's up to the reviewer's standards.

357
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,870
GM Sheng is working so hard on it.

358
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,920
- Why do you still need to find the reviewer?
- We have to.

359
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,430
Who knows what will happen. Just in case.

360
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,920
- Did you give yourself away?
- Give myself away?

361
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,180
How could I have given myself away?

362
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,630
Really? But I have a very bad feeling about this.

363
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,120
It's just your feeling.

364
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,370
By the way, the restaurant is launching a few new dishes today.

365
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,360
I guess the reviewer will go and try them tonight.

366
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,740
You mean that I should test my luck in the restaurant?

367
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,560
l'll appreciate it. Please go take a look.

368
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,910
My trolley's still outside.

369
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,180
I have to go.

370
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,250
Brother Hebo, please. Love without an oath-taking ceremony is not complete.

371
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,920
You don't want my love to be incomplete, right?

372
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,290
Then, why don't you talk to your brother instead?

373
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,190
My brother has this rule and then that rule. He has so many rules!

374
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,140
And every time I talk to him, he'll keep nagging me.

375
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,500
It's just a wedding oath-taking ceremony.

376
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,570
Just Zhijuan and I.

377
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,590
Okay. I will help you.

378
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,460
I knew it! You're the best, Brother Hebo.

379
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,420
Thank you, Brother Hebo.

380
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,990
But have you thought about how to do it?

381
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,470
Here's my plan.

382
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,020
You even have a plan!

383
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,920
Okay. I'll ask Emily
[Plan of action]

384
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,860
to schedule the date and book a place for you soon. All right?

385
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,710
Thank you, Brother Hebo.

386
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,820
I'll go home and prepare for it.

387
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,020
What's the rush? Have some tea with me.

388
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,000
By the way, I've got something for you.

389
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,510
I thought you already gave me a wedding gift.

390
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,970
Who says that I can only give you a gift for your wedding?

391
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,960
Getting a gift makes me the happiest. Thank you, Brother Hebo.

392
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
As long as you're happy.

393
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,920
Hold on.

394
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,330
