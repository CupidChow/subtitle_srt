Projection room, get the VCR ready.

Dear guests, please look at the screen.

7
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,320
This is the video from two years ago?

8
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,340
What is happening?

9
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,760
Why are they laughing at me?

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,070
Why is this happening at my wedding?

11
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,990
Have them exchange the rings.

12
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,440
The couple will now exchange the rings?

Xia Qian is your ex-girlfriend?

14
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,880
Yes.

15
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Then, why didn't you tell me before?

16
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,350
End the ceremony.

17
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,160
I officially announce that the ceremony of Ning Meng and He Zhijuan is officially finished.

Ning Meng.

19
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,730
When we first met Xia Qian together,

20
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,070
why didn't you explain things clearly to me?

21
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,710
We had already broken up a long time ago. It didn't matter.

22
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought you would overthink it, so I didn't tell you.

23
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,600
Mengmeng, don't let your imagination run wild.

24
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,510
It is all in the past! I have already decided to be with you.

25
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,950
So, I will love you with my whole heart. Please trust me.

26
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,360
Do you sincerely want to marry me?

27
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,860
Of course, I am being sincere. What are you talking about?

28
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,610
I called a driver to take you guys home.

29
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,650
Who played that video? Was it Xia Qian?

30
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,830
It shouldn't be her.

31
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,040
Why isn't it her?

32
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,610
Mengmeng, think about it.

33
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,070
She is also a victim. Who would try and hurt themselves?

34
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,970
I don't mean to suspect her,

35
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,210
but I really can't think of anyone else who would do such a thing.

36
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,740
I really just wanted to have a perfect, complete wedding with Zhijuan and receive everyone's blessing.

37
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,550
It is just a small, little wish.

38
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,120
Mengmeng,

39
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,620
I promise... to find out who did it.

40
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,710
Director Xue, why didn't you warn me beforehand?

41
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,640
I'm not interrogating you, it's just that...

42
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,140
This puts me in a very difficult position.

43
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,320
You were an important guest at GM Sheng's sister's wedding. I thought you'd be reluctant to do it.

44
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,700
Besides, you are not the only person I have at Evergreen.

45
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,300
You don't need to be included in all my plans.

46
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,780
What gossip is this?

47
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,700
I didn't want to know about the gossip but it is about someone I know.

48
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,840
Mu Xiaoyan, what's wrong?

49
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,210
N-Nothing.

50

Bring it to me, let me see.

51
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
No, I misread it.

52

Ow, my eyes hurt.

53
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Sister Qian, you didn't do it. Right?

54
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,320
Are you crazy? Do you think I would do this?

55
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,940
What do they mean by "ex ruins wedding"?

56
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,920
Why would I ruin it? Why don't they write that I was the one who helped arrange her wedding?

57
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,690
This... Does the media even have a heart?

58
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,560
They're crazy!

59
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,280

You are also a victim.

The video at the wedding reception was clearly planned.

I think they were targeting Evergreen.

Don't worry about it. I will investigate this matter.

No,

I don't care who did or why they did it, but they provoked me.

It seems like it isn't the woman who broadcasted the video.

86
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,650
That means the video must have been switched out beforehand.

87
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,510
I already sent out people to investigate.

88
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,300
Once they find something, they will report to me immediately

89
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,610
What if we change our way of thinking?

90
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,790
Like, where did this video of He Zhijuan and I come from?

91
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,830
Would you guys keep a video from two years ago?

92
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,970
We would have definitely deleted it.

93
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,880
I am just afraid that someone used some sort of trick to retrieve it.

94
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,490
I also deleted it a long time ago.

95
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,650
He Zhijuan also wouldn't do such a thing at his own wedding.

96
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,120
Then, what about people who had access to this video two years ago?

Sorry, I'm late.

Today is my last day at Evergreen.

104
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,010
So it took a bit of time to pack my things.

105
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,490
Right, then have you received your pay?

106

Yes. Thank you.

107
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,280
You asked me to come here. What is it?

108
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,850
I have a little sister. She's having a bad day.

109
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,290
I wanted to help her, but I had no idea what to do.

110
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,860
I thought that since you are both girls, maybe I can ask you for some advice.

111
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,090
What can I do to make her feel better?

112

- You're talking about Ning Meng, right?
- Yes.

113
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,210
Making a girl happy... Well, every girl has a different personality,

114
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,900
so the way you make her happy will be different as well. What works for me might not work for her.

115
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,960
I mean,

116
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,280
boys and girls have very different ways when it comes to thinking about problems.

117
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,460
Boys might just be trying to solve the problems.

118
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,830
When a girl encounters a problem and thinks about it,

119
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,890
she doesn't necessarily want to solve the problem.

120
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,590
But more, she wants to find consolation.

121
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,960
She wants someone to listen to her.

122
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,590
Just try to make her laugh.

123
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,950
Make her laugh?

124
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,400
Yes.

125
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,290
Any progress?

126
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,300

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm okay. I have hypoglycemia. I'll just need some rest.

Here, draw an animal first.

But I have to make it clear, you can't draw a dinosaur.

- Yeah! You both got single-fold eyelids,

don't cook dinner tonight.

You're here to collect debts from him, too?

We're here...

That's exactly right! You are correct.

But now I can't find him anywhere, and he's not picking up his phone.

No offense meant, Young Lady, but

how could you lend money to someone like Chen Kang?

227
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
But let me tell you the truth. To escape from his debt collectors,

228
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,420
Chen Kang doesn't really stay here.

He lives in the apartment that his father-in-law left him.

I'm Chen Kang's neighbor upstairs.

Someone was asking about Chen Kang's address.

A man and a woman. The woman was fair-skinned

Since Director Xue believes that not all of the plans need to go through me,

254

then we should give him a reminder and let him know

If she didn't want anything to do with Chen Kang,

why would she put the photo in such a prominent place?

If Chen Kang hasn't been back for a long time, she would have put them away.

Why would she put them on the shoe rack where people would change their shoes often?

00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,490
I thought you wouldn't eat street food.

327
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,070
Come on.

328
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,410
He's back?

329
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,280
- He saw me!
- Stay right here!

330
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,820
Stop!

331
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,790
Chen Kang! Stop!

332
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,310
Don't run!

333
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,580
Xia Qian!

334
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,900
Are you okay?

335
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,200
- He ran away!
- Hey!

336
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,620
I told you to stay right there! Why did you run over here?

337
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,710
Hey! I was helping you chase him.

338
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,270
Look! He's running away!

339
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,680
You're not helping at all! What if you got hit by a car?

340
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
Why are you yelling at me?

341
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,700
What's wrong with me trying to help?

342
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,190
And I'm not your subordinate.

343
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,660
Why do I have to listen to everything you say?

344
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,990
- I'll take you home.
- Leave me alone!

345
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,550
What's wrong?

346
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,740
Keep running!

347
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,010
I barely took a bite of the food I bought!

348
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
Now you can run anywhere!

349
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
Hello, Anan.

350
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,630
GM Sheng, I've got Chen Kang.

351
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,930
Nobody's paying me and nobody asked me to do it.

352
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,610
I'm just dissatisfied with Evergreen.

353
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,190
Last year, I almost got a promotion

354
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,270
and they canceled it just because I was late for work.

355
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,900
I've had enough. I just want to see you become a laughing stock.

356
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,740
Leave.

357
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,160
Do you believe in what he said?

358
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,660
He sounded so affirmative when he said

359
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,430
that nobody asked him to do so, it made me believe even more

360
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,610
that there must be someone who arranged it beforehand.

361
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,020
- Then...
- If that's the case, I'll have to go with it

362
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,530
and pretend to believe in him in order not to alert the enemy.

363
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,530
And we should make a management plan.

364
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,270
We must strengthen the cyber security management of the hotel.

365
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,880
- I'll do it right away.
- Okay.

366
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,700
I heard that Chen Kang was caught and Sheng Zhening is talking to the media.

367
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,930
Yeah, but don't worry about it. I've got it covered.

368
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,960
Chen Kang won't say a word about it.

369
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,150
But, Director Xue, I've been working at Evergreen for six years.

370
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,680
Sheng Zhening's business strategy and style,

371
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,650
I believe you can't find anyone who knows it better than me.

372
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,550
So, in the future, please leave anything related to Evergreen to me.

373
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,990
Okay. Thank you.

374
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,710
I should have been more careful when I dealt with it.

375
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,420
Thanks.

376
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,390
[Sheng Zhening: Have you gone to bed?]

377
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,230
Have you gone to bed?

378
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,830
[Sheng Zhening:]

379
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,340
[Sheng Zhening: I failed to retain myself today.]

380
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,100
[Sheng Zhening: I shouldn't have blamed you.]

381
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,080
I failed to retrain myself today. I shouldn't have blamed you. I'm sorry.

382
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,550
Mengmeng, what are you thinking about?

383
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,460
Hubby, I feel like everything is my fault.

384
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,710
If I didn't ask Xia Qian

385
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,100
to be my bargainer,

386
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,720
my brother and Evergreen wouldn't have gotten into trouble.

387
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,100
And the whole world wouldn't know

388
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,410
that Xia Qian is your ex-girlfriend.

389
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,420
I would never have known what happened

390
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,280
between you and her.

391
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,610
And our wedding would have gone well as well.

392
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,080
Mengmeng.

393
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,800
See, we've held our wedding.

394
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,340
And we're living a happy life.

395
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,660
How about going on a trip this weekend?

396
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,800
Relax yourself, stop thinking about all that useless stuff.

397
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,780
Hubby, do you think I'm useless?

398
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,810
Of course not!

399
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,220
Don't worry. Your brother has a plan

400
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,270
to deal with what happened to Evergreen.

401
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,970
There, there.

402
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,750
Why are you here at my place so early in the morning?

403
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,690
I thought you were signing the contract today.

404
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,100
Yes. Is there anything you need from me?

405
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,500
I'll drive you there.

406
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,460
You got hurt because you were trying to help Evergreen.

407
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,110
I should be responsible for that.

408
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,980
So I'll be your driver for the next couple of days.

409
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,140
Think of it as an apology.

410
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,030
What? You didn't say it loud enough, I didn't hear it.

411
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,420
I was very rude yesterday. I'm sorry.

412
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,560
Well, I wouldn't be angry over something so trivial.

413
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
And I was a bit too impulsive yesterday, too.

414
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,900
I know that it's been hard for you these last few days after what happened with Ning Meng.

415
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,220
In the future, if there's anything I can help with, just ask.

416
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,090
It hasn't been hard on me. It's my job.

417
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,820
Thank you so much for saying that. But having GM Sheng as my driver,

418
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,070
that's too much of a privilege for me.

419
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,670
You don't have to do this. I'll go inside.

420
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,820
He's so nice to you. Why did you refuse?

421
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,400
Now that we have finished business with Ning Meng,

422
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,620
I have nothing else to do with Sheng Zhening. There's no need to get too close.

423
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,160
I thought you two could have a little spark of love

424
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,740
after you've been working together all these days.

425
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,720
With Sheng Zhening?

426
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,990
Right? You do!

427
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,160
It's impossible.

428
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,750
How is that impossible?

429
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,250
The hero and heroine of romance dramas all have a love-hate relationship.

430
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,790
Just like you and GM Sheng.

431
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,120
Have you been watching too many dramas these days?

432
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,590
I actually ship you guys.

433
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,490
Ship us? You like it?

434
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,390
Can you stop mixing TV dramas with reality?

435
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,120
Sheng Zhening and I... I've never thought about it.

436
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,260
We're from two completely different worlds.

437
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,080
We have different personalities, work environments, and ideas. Everything's different.

438
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,090
Fate was off its track for a while, but now it's back on track.

439
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,160
We've got trouble! We've got trouble!

440
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,150
- What's wrong?
- Evergreen's gotten into trouble.

441
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,680
My wife and I were planning to get married at Evergreen Hotel on May 8th,

442
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,190
we paid the deposit, but then it was canceled.

443
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,590
That date was given to the sister of Evergreen's GM.

444
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,520
The wedding was very important to my wife.

445
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,760
They sacrificed their customer's rights in order to host a wedding event for their family.

446
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,860
So, we must get back at them.

447
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,920
Han Chao is lying.

448
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,930
Of course! He agreed to transfer the reservation himself.

449
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,330
What do we do now? It's got something to do with us, too.

450
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,460
The PR Department is dealing with it, but the video online is still going viral.

451
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,620
And there were a lot of negative comments about Evergreen.

452
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,390
Find Han Chao's reservation transfer agreement.

453
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,030
Okay.

454
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,460
Look for Han Chao's reservation transfer agreement contract.

455
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,850
The contract is missing.

456
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,410
We've dealt with the contract and left no evidence.

457
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,290
Sheng Zhening can't explain himself.

458
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,690
This incident won't have a huge impact on Evergreen judging from its nature.

459
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,890
But we still have to make the media make it sound much bigger than it is.

460
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,700
Don't let the topic cool down.

461
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,420
Director Yu has always been hesitant,

462
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,960
and if he sees all these negative comments about Evergreen, he'll definitely hesitate.

463
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,660
Ask Director Xue to talk to him soon

464
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,940
and see if there's any possibility of transferring the shares.

465
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,830
Okay.

466
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,800
Anything you need me to do on Evergreen's side?
