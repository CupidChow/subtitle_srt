[Episode 17]

3
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,470
Let me buy you dinner tonight.

4
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,200
I will bring your purse. Same old place. See you there.

5
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,330
Why don't you eat? They are all your favorites.

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Thank you.

7
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,150
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

8
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,270
My stomach hurts. I don't have an apatite.

9
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
Then, why don't we go to the hospital?

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,590
There's no need.

11
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,790
Don't assume it is a small issue. If it continues, it could become a big problem.

12
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,520
I know a gastroenterologist, they're pretty good. We can go right now.

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,390
There is no need.

14
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,570
Don't bother.

15
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,910
Please take the necklace back.

16
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,980
Since you said it is impossible for us to be together,

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,550
then I should return the things you gave me.

18
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,700
Otherwise, it is not appropriate.

19
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,810
I'll leave first. I have things to do.

20
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,050
Shuangshuang, it's raining. Let me give you a ride.

21
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,530
There's no need. I brought an umbrella.

22
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,270
Shuangshuang! Shuangshuang!

23
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,420
Wait, wait. Where is your umbrella?

24
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,460
- None of your business.
- Why? What's wrong?

25
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,830
Nothing's wrong!

26
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,940
Why are you angry?

27
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,420
I'm not angry! Just leave me alone, okay?

28
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,770
Qin Hebo,

29
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,070
when will you stop using me?

30
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,950
I heard your entire phone call. Every single word.

31
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,070
I was just in the kitchen.

32
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,020
So you first approached me and were nice to me

33
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,550
because you were using me.

34
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,010
Then, why were your acting so real?

35
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,630
I can't stand that you treated me so well!

36
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,290
Why did you treat me so well? Don't bother me anymore.

37
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,510
Shuangshuang! Shuangshuang!

38
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,740
♫ My dear you ♫

39
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,270
Yes, I did use you.

40
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,810
I lied to you.

41
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,910
But I truly do like you.

42
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,490
I also genuinely care about you!

43
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,950
Right now, I don't even know

44
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,200
if your words are sincere or not.

45
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,870
We are not the same type of people.

46
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,230
I do like you,

47
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,790
but...

48
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,190
let's not meet again.

49
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,580
Shuangshuang!

50
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,440
♫ I run toward you ♫

51
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,560
♫ but pass by you ♫

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,650
♫ The night engulfs your face, from then I dare not look at the sunset  ♫

53
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,700
♫ I run toward you ♫

54
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,730
♫ But cannot find you  ♫

55
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:49,940
♫ I finally understand loss has its meaning as well  ♫

56
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,140
According to my understanding from his phone call,

57
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,230
all the things happening at Evergreen

58
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,820
were planned by him and Director Xue.

59
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,600
What exactly did he and Director Xue say?

60
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,410
They have probably been collaborating for a while,

61
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,550
and my guess is that he came to Evergreen with the goal of

62
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,900
helping Lihe Capital's Director Xue acquire Evergreen.

63
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,250
Also, he probably edited the price comparison calculation that I worked on last time.

64
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,000
So that the option we chose was

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
the African wood that easily propagates termites.

66
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm so sorry.

67
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,680
You don't need to feel bad. You are also a victim.

68
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,180
Shuangshuang, you must be tired.

69
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,670
Go to my room and rest.

70
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,240
Let's go.

71
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,110
Director Xue, my relationship with Lihe Capital has probably been exposed.

72
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,890
Being exposed is not that big of a deal.

73
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,910
We have gotten everything we need.

74
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,890
And Sheng Zhening has no proof.

75
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,890
Besides, the 30th anniversary of the hotel is approaching.

76
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,580
I believe...

77
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,980
that during this time, he will not make a big fuss.

78
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,090
I understand.

79
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,240
Right now, the most urgent matter

80
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,410
is that we acquire the other shareholders' shares.

81
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,510
- She fell asleep?
- She did.

82
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,180
What are you planning on doing now with this situation?

83
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,340
The Evergreen's 30th anniversary is approaching.

84
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,430
We cannot take risks during this period.

85
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,160
It would not help Evergreen's odds of winning.

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,120
It is a good thing that we know now what type of person he is.

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,640
At least, now, we can take precautions against him.

88
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,740
Right now, what is important is to successfully execute the anniversary celebration.

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,440
Okay.

90
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,080
This is the seating chart for the anniversary celebration. GM Qin and the other department heads will sit with you.

91
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,620
This time I will not sit with GM Qin.

92
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,930
Arrange for me to sit with the other shareholders.

93
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,720
Okay, GM Sheng.

94
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,870
The food and beverage department was asking if they should prepare a new menu for the anniversary celebration.

95
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,200
So they sent me to ask.

96
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,030
I know you are very busy.

97
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,680
Later, I will arrange a meeting for all the departments.

98
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,060
I will not be notifying you about all future information regarding the anniversary celebration.

99
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,320
I understand.

100
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,460
Have the invitations been sent out?

101
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,440
The media has received them.

102
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
What about security?

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,530
We just hired over 60 security guards from the company.

104
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,040
Also, where should we arrange for Miss Xia to sit?

105
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,010
I understand. I should arrange for her to sit by your side.

106
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,830
Oh right! Please send me

107
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,330
the records of Qin Hebo's work from when I was gone.

108
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,840
Okay.

109
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,870
The anniversary celebration starts at 9:00 a.m.

110
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,850
I will come pick you up at 8:00 a.m.

111
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,520
Okay.

112
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,100
How did you suddenly get gastroenteritis?

113
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,510
The doctor said it was because I drank expired cold milk.

114
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,300
With your condition, can you still attend the 30th Anniversary Celebration?

115
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,260
Who is it?

116
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,310
Look!
 [Zhening]

117
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,020
- Who is it?
- Nothing.

118
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,090
Hello?

119
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,490
I came to your house but you are not home and there's no one at work.

120
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,220
Oh, I have a last-minute meeting with a client today.

121
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,970
- I am with Mu Xiaoyan right now.
- Where are you?

122
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,320
We are at the livestream company.

123
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,430
- Zhening.
- What did he say?

124
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,180
Just a moment.

125
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,720
- Help me!
- No!

126
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,350
I won't!
 [Zhening]

127
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,800
Mu Xiaoyan, the projector is broken! Come here and fix it.

128
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,250
Okay. I'm coming over.

129
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,140
Zhening, I'm sorry.

130
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,130
I promised you that I would go to the anniversary celebration but I can't come.

131
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,520
That's okay.

132
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,660
I thought something happened to you. You know I care about you.

133
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,360
What kind of meeting are you having today at the livestream company?

134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,530
Nothing special. I told you we are trying

135
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,200
live commerce. The streaming equipment has some issues today.

136
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,870
Don't worry, I can solve the problems myself.

137
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,390
- Okay! I'm coming over.
- Are you still having a fever?

138
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,610
Fever?

139
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,400
Who is having a fever?

140
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,980
Mu Xiaoyan! I asked him to fix the projector and now the machine is overheated.

141
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,970
Like having a fever! So dumb!

142
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,900
Don't worry. Don't worry, Zhening.

143
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,310
I'm heading to a meeting now. Wish you a smooth event. I'm hanging up now.

144
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,850
- Sorry about that just then.
- It's all right.

145
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:08,120
- I advise you that you have a liquid diet to avoid stomach irritation.
- Got it!

146
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,390
I want to compliment your performance just now.

147
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,800
Why didn't you want to tell him the truth?

148
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,770
For him, this 30th Anniversary Celebration is a very important event. I don't want to distract him.

149
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,920
I am considering having you and Shuangshuang join me during the livestream.

150
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,830
We should all give it a try and see who does better.

151
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,210
- Can I do it?
- Of course.

152
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,180
All right, I will give it a try.

153
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,020
I'm heading out first, take your time.

154
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,660
How did you know I was here?

155
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,720
The GPS on your watch.

156
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,460
- What did the doctor say?
- Nothing serious.

157
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,920
It's gastroenteritis. Nothing to be worried about, I'm fine already.

158
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,830
I didn’t intend to lie.

159
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,040
I didn't want you to be worried. I didn't think it would turn out like this.

160
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,580
If anything like this happens again in the future, you can't lie to me.

161
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,090
Also, you cannot make your own decisions behind my back.

162
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,040
Got it.

163
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,090
Hello?

164
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,380
Okay. I'm heading there now.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,670
I'll visit you after the anniversary celebration.

166
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,880
Go ahead. Everybody is waiting for you.

167
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,690
I'm leaving now.

168
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,610
Go, don't worry about me. I'm fine.

169
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,290
Okay. Rest up.

170
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,280
Can we have a conversation between two men?

171
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,210
Take it seriously.

172
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,960
- What do you want to say?
- What do you like about Sister Qian?

173
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,260
- What do you like about her?
- How do you know?

174
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,800
Since you know already, I'll speak bluntly since you know.

175
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,420
I like her. I have been liking her for a very long time.

176
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,560
I like her being diligent and hard working.

177
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,430
I like her being considerate, smart, and resourceful.

178
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,790
I just like her, I don't need any other reasons.

179
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,390
No particular reasons?

180
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,050
You can't even think of a reason. I don't think you like her that much.

181
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,100
I like her because she likes street food, that she sleepwalks.

182
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,200
I like her because she often lies,

183
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,230
- but people can always tell that she's lying.
- All right, that's enough.

184
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,120
Basically, I like everything about her. Are we done?

185
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,990
But I spend time with her every day.

186
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,190
I can assist her in her work

187
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,860
and take care of her in her life. Just like today.

188
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,220
Don't you feel threatened at all?

189
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,490
There's one more person who can take care of her when I'm not around. Isn't that nice?

190
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,390
Why should I feel threatened?

191
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,400
Anyways, thanks.

192
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,430
Thanks for watching out for her.

193
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,860
No need to thank me. I'm not doing it for you.

194
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,210
I'm telling you. If you ever hurt her, I won't forgive you.

195
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,440
You're always welcome to supervise me.

196
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,290
It's time that the conversation between two men ends.

197
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,390
I need to go back to the office for a meeting.

198
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,390
GM Qin, the person in charge of the anniversary is asking when you'll be there.

199
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,330
I'll be right there.

200
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,890
Emily.

201
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,790
Tell that person that I'm not well and I won't be there.

202
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,930
Are you all right, GM Qin?

203
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,310
I think Sheng Zhening knows my relationship with Director Xue.

204
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,090
There's no need to hide it anymore.

205
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,150
Okay. Got it.

206
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,750
Let's give a round of applause to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Evergreen Hotel!

207
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,760
Thank you all

208
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,960
for coming here today for the 30th anniversary of Evergreen.

209
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,560
I'm very honored that we can still have you, our long-time friends, here today.

210
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,220
Evergreen wouldn't be what it has today

211
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,790
without your help and support. Our theme today is gratitude.

212
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,260
We're grateful that you were with us along the way.

213
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,970
I watched it all. The anniversary was very successful. I'm so proud of you.

214
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,800
By the way, I’m discharged from the hospital. There's no need to pick me up tonight. Have a good rest.

215
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,390
Got it. By the way, when does your live streaming start?

216
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,670
GM Sheng.

217
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,360
The anniversary received a lot of praises from the press.

218
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,430
And they spoke highly of you, too.

219
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,540
Are you familiar with live streaming?

220
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,460
A little bit. I watch it once in a while.

221
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,160
Xia Qian is doing live commerce.

222
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,890
- Help me register an account.
- Yes, Sir.

223
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,430
I know that you repaired it already, but obviously, that didn't work. The pipes burst again.

224
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,600
I just gripped it with a wrench myself.

225
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,140
When can you come and fix it again?

226
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,830
Okay, we'll ask the repairman to fix it for you soon.

227
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,890
Soon? How soon will they be here?

228
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,520
Please let me know a specific time. Last time you said the same thing, but it took three days.

229
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,940
Tomorrow evening at the latest. A repairman will definitely go.

230
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,360
Okay. You said it. I'll wait for you tomorrow evening.

231
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,750
- You must come fix it for me.
- Okay, of course.

232
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,390
Okay.

233
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,760
[Mengmeng]

234
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,670
How long have you been like this?

235
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,030
I don't know.

236
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,050
But I've been having a stomach ache for quite some time.

237
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,870
You missed your last counseling appointment.

238
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,660
You know that the counseling schedule is decided upon careful evaluation.

239
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,330
Especially when you have a large number of clients.

240
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,000
This is likely to cause problems.

241
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,860
I know. I had to postpone it because of the wedding. I'll be careful in the future.

242
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,020
All right.

243
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,060
Now close your eyes.

244
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,870
Take a deep breath.

245
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,830
Think about your recent experiences carefully.

246
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,100
And you can say whatever you want.

247
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,310
Actually, there's nothing special.

248
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,120
It's just that I've always hoped to separate my work from my personal life.

249
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,270
Despite the daily hassles in my life,

250
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,420
I can forget about them when I come to work at the hospital.

251
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,520
But now, my personal life is completely mixed up with my work life.

252
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,140
I can't separate them.

253
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,550
You said you wanted me to get a job.

254
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,970
So I rented this bakery.

255
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,630
It's right next to your hospital.

256
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,460
This way I can go to work and get off work with you every day.

257
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,060
I don't know how I can change this situation.

258
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,470
So... it's still because of Ning Meng?

259
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,150
I know she's insecure and she loves me.

260
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:54,430
But the way she loves me... suffocates me.

261
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,360
I heard from Xiaotong that you are too busy to eat at the hospital.

262
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,430
Are you talking about Xiaotong from our hospital?

263
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,680
How do you know her? You don't have to cook for me every day.

264
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,250
The cafeteria at our hospital is quite good.

265
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,680
Do you not want to eat with me anymore?

266
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,670
I heard that Xiaotong is being transferred away

267
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,130
just because she was discussing work next to Dr. He, and his wife saw it.

268
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,780
Has it ever occurred to you that Ning Meng ended up like this

269
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,290
because you've been too protective of her feelings?

270
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,740
After the wedding, it all got worse.

271
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,940
I admit that I care too much about her feelings.

272
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,190
I thought that as long as she was happy,

273
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,930
none of the conflicts would occur, and we can live a happy life.

274
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,190
But I'm also aware

275
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,560
that this is an unhealthy lifestyle.

276
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,470
Actually, there's nothing wrong with your work.

277
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,110
The root cause of all your stress comes from your marriage.

278
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,600
But when it comes to marriage,

279
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,370
there are still a lot of things you haven't said.

280
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,790
I know that I need to confide.

281
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,740
But Mengmeng and I... It's too complicated.

282
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,560
This is your counseling material. Take it.

283
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,280
I have a copy, too.

284
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,650
Also, since your abdominal pain is because

285
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,320
you're too nervous and too anxious,

286
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,970
you should do something about it.

287
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,080
No matter how you and Ning Meng are getting along, she's still your wife.

288
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,900
And she should be your best confidant.

289
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,810
Understood. Thank you.

290
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,720
The temptation of face masks. 99% of women can't resist them.

291
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,930
I've tried this mask before.

292
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,210
Look at how soft my face looks!

293
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,430
Shuangshuang, what do you think?

294
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,630
I think... They're all good choices.

295
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,160
We've got toys and food here,

296
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,580
I think they all have a good selling point.

297
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,160
The face mask that Xiaoyan picked is a good choice.

298
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,920
And what about you, Xiao Ai?

299
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,150
I think the robotic vacuum cleaner is great.

300
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,420
It's got a big discount and will attract viewers to our channel.

301
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,850
Actually, my favorite is this one.

302
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,570
This storytelling toy.

303
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,790
Why? There's nothing special about it.

304
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,250
It's very special. It's not just a storytelling toy.

305
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,360
The most important feature is that it can simulate the parent's voice.

306
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,230
When parents are busy with work and have no time for their kids,

307
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,070
they can record their voices first.

308
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,990
And children will feel as if their parents are around with this toy.

309
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,550
It's a toy with a heart and a soul.

310
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,250
I think this is a touching story for me.

311
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,760
And what she said just now is very moving as well.

312
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,160
I think we can totally use it during our livestream.

313
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,560
But in terms of the sequence of the products, we need your professional input.

314
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I wouldn't say it's professional, but based on my experience,

315
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,220
I think you've put in too many subjective feelings when choosing the products.

316
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,490
When it comes to live commerce, the sequence of the products is crucial.

317
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,260
Usually, at the beginning, we'll start with products with a big discount, such as limited-time offers,

318
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,340
and all kinds of lucky draws, to attract viewers to warm up to it.

319
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,570
Our best time to sell the products is from 9:00 - 10:30 p.m.

320
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,870
That's when we get the most viewers online,

321
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,640
and a chance for us to promote the products with the biggest discounts

322
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,830
to increase sales.

323
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,180
So this will be the sequence for promoting the products today.

324
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,000
I think this works. Great.

325
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,850
- Mu Xiaoyan, don't eat dinner tomorrow.
- Why?

326
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,920
You'll be introducing all the snacks tomorrow.

327
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,890
The hungrier you are, the tastier the food will look.

328
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,150
Why am I eating them again? I'm not on a diet these days.

329
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,880
You gaining weight is better than me gaining weight.

330
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,100
That's very straightforward and cruel.

331
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,960
If I gain weight, it's a work injury. You have to be responsible.

332
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,320
Sure, I'll be responsible for that. I'll get a treadmill for you.

333
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,670
Okay, I think that's it for today's meeting.

334
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,290
We'll work together tomorrow.

335
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,320
- Let's do it!
- We can do it!

336
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,750
Lie'er, thank you so much for your professional training today.

337
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,930
Well, it was your tenacity and your ability to bargain that impressed me.

338
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,760
I made three visits to request your help.

339
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,370
But after hearing your ideas and professional input,

340
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,860
I'd be willing to visit you ten times!

341
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,060
- Let's work together!
- Let's do it!

342
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,220
Go for it!

343
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,560
[Username: My Summer]

344
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,270
- This is my username?
- Yes.

345
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,230
Is there a problem?

346
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,220
Isn't that a bit too... flamboyant?

347
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,200
Is it?

348
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,790
Isn't it?

349
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,190
If you think it's too flamboyant, I can always change it.

350
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,930
Never mind. Leave it.

351
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,790
Take down a few graphics from the wall. We don't want the background to be too messy.

352
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,960
But we can't just use a blank white wall either; otherwise, it will be overexposed and make us look sick.

353
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,230
Okay.

354
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,630
This is our main light source.

355
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,360
We have to fill in lighting on both sides.

356
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,590
- Let's turn them on.
- That's right.

357
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,130
The circular light will be here.

358
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,860
I think this works. We can make it brighter.

359
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,590
- I'm ready.
- Wow, you look nice.

360
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,670
- Good?
- Pretty good.

361
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,300
- Beautiful!
- Yes!

362
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,060
Hello, everyone!

363
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,570
Welcome to the Worth or Not livestream channel.

364
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,140
I'm Xia Qian.

365
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,670
This is my first time live streaming, and I'm a little nervous now.

366
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,730
If I say anything wrong, please forgive me.

367
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:57,090
But today, I have here with me an old friend, Lie'er!

368
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,560
She's here to livestream with me. Let's welcome her.

369
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,790
Hi, everyone, welcome to our channel.

370
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,670
Maybe we should all come out and say hi.

371
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,200
Hi!

372
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,860
No. Just leave me.

373
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,100
This is Mu Xiaoyan, and this is Xiao Ai.

374
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,060
Well today, Xia Qian and I have selected many good products

375
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,300
and we have very big discounts for you.

376
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,000
Let's look forward to it.

377
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,970
Hi, I'm Xia Qian.

378
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,810
Today, I want to introduce to you an adorable and fun item.

379
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,040
That is our most recommended product, this storytelling bear.

380
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,570
Especially for those of you who have kids at home.

381
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,670
Someone left a message. Raccoon12345 asked if we can get item No.3 back in stock.

382
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,900
Sorry, this one is completely out of stock.

383
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,280
It's okay if you didn't get a product today.

384
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,510
We'll have even bigger surprises for you tomorrow.

385
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,310
I'll give you a preview. Tomorrow, on our channel

386
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,780
we'll have 42% off for big brand cosmetics.

387
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,690
Well, that's pretty much it for today's livestream.

388
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,270
If you like our products or like our Worth or Not channel,

389
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,530
don't forget to hit the button

390
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,210
on the upper left corner and subscribe!

391
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,110
Well, see you at Worth or Not at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow!

392
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,330
Bye!

393
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,090
[See you tomorrow]

394
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,500
I'll unplug this as well...

395
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,330
That's fantastic! We've got a lot of new subscribers today!

396
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,920
We've won the first battle!

397
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,490
Actually, our channel got very popular today

398
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,490
mainly because Lie'er was here.

399
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,830
But if you look at the backend data,

400
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,180
at the lowest, there were 14,333 viewers.

401
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,930
At the highest, it reached 48,987 viewers.

402
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,050
That's very high.

403
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,660
Sister Qian, this is your first time live streaming. I think it's good enough already.

404
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,920
We have to accumulate the viewers day by day.

405
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,420
Today, we got the highest views when Sister Qian was introducing

406
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,060
how the toys can simulate people's voices to tell a story.

407
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,470
The best-selling product today is also this toy.

408
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,870
This means that a lot of our viewers might be moms.

409
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,630
So I think Xia Qian's idea to tell the warming family story works very well.

410
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,390
Shuangshuang, what happened today? We asked you to come out before the camera and you refused.

411
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,390
I can't. I don't know why, but I'm very nervous in front of the camera.

412
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,060
That's fine. We all feel nervous the first time we do it.

413
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,640
Just take it easy.

414
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,100
We can keep it up!

415
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,610
[Are you home yet?]

416
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,020
[Message from Sheng Zhening]

417
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,030
Are you home yet?

418
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,520
Just lied down on my bed.

419
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,570
Why are you calling me?

420
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,700
Are you always going to be this busy in the future?

421
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,190
Yeah.

422
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,120
We've just started, and there's a lot of room for improvement.

423
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,350
By the way,

424
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:55,860
we had a viewer named "My Summer." That was you, right?

425
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,930
How's that possible?

426
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,520
It was Anan's idea.

427
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,730
I don't know why he did it.

428
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:07,230
Hey, without your permission, how would he dare give you such a name?

429
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,500
I really had no idea.

430
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,330
I'm going to ask him about it tomorrow. Deduct two months' from his salary.

431
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,630
It should be fine.

432
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,760
It's too late. You should go to bed.

433
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,990
Okay. Good night.

434
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,630
Good night.

435
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,280
[Worth or Not]

436
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,600
We're promoting a new brand of wine. While making sure we can break even,

437
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,000
it's quite necessary to lower the price to an appropriate extent.

438
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,500
What we need to do is to build up a good reputation. After we've increased the market share,

439
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
then business will come naturally.

440
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,000
I understand, Miss Xia.

441
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,800
In terms of the discounted price, I have to go back to the company and discuss it with the team.

442
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,000
If we take a step back, then the customers will take a step forward.

443
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Miss Xia signed a contract with the sponsoring company

444
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,000
that she has to hit the sales revenue within a month,

445
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
or else she'll be fined.

446
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Check if there's any special day coming up for me.

447
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Special days? Why are you asking about that?

448
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Our hotel always gives away gifts to our staff during special days.

449
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
Find a special day, and buy some stuff from her channel

450
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,500
in my name, and give them away to our staff.

451
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,200
That way she will easily meet her goal.

452
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,400
But I can't remember any important holidays coming up.

453
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,300
Check it. Any special day is okay.

454
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
There really is one.

455
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,600
International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction.

456
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,000
Or IDDR for short.

457
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes.

458
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's it. This date has lots of meaning to it.

459
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,600
Remember. Careful not to let Xia Qian know about it.

460
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Hello!

461
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,600
Thank you to those in the live streaming room right now. It's very late.

462
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,900
Sorry, I'm taking up your dinner time.

463
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,700
But we have no way around it, we've got such big discounts for you today!

464
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,400
Today, the special product is red wine which you can see here.

465
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,800
The price is too good.

466
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Regardless if you want to drink it yourself, give it as a gift,

467
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,400
or drink it at a party,

468
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
it pairs well with any occasion.

469
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,400
I drank some before the show, and it tastes...

470
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,600
lightly fragrant and a little sweet.

471
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,600
There's a balanced fruity note, and it doesn't taste dry at all.

472
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,400
It's suitable for all occasions.

473
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,300
There are more than two thousand viewers today!

474
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
That's a breakthrough! And most of them spent money.

475
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,800
Then let's have a toast to celebrate!

476
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
Cheers!

477
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,800
I don't understand. Why did the views go up all of a sudden?

478
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
It means we're doing a good job.

479
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,800
Good quality products, big discounts. They will tell their friends.

480
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,400
So, of course, there will be more viewers.

481
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Really?

482
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I have an idea. I'll treat you to barbecue to celebrate hitting 2,000 viewers today!

483
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay!

484
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,300
I can't go.

485
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,600
I asked the building management people to fix the pipes for me. I have to go home.

486
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Go ahead.

487
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,100
This is a record of all the work done by Qin Hebo at the hotel after you left.

488
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Anything out of the ordinary?

489
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,600
Every job has been pretty orderly. Only one thing that is out of the ordinary.

490
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,000
What's the problem?

491
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
The construction on Building No. 2 is missing some items.

492
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,800
Qin Hebo paid for them himself.

493
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,000
Is there something wrong with this item?

494
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,700
That's why it's weird.

495
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,800
He hasn't messed with it.

496
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,800
I understand.

497
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,500
First step, open it. We all know that. Then put the sweet potato in.

498
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Turn it on.

499
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
And choose the mode.

500
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,600
This combo-steam oven has smart steam and bake mode.

501
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Hit "Confirm."

502
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
And then hit "Start."

503
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,900
GM Sheng,

504
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,400
I'll personally tell the Finance Department

505
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,300
that I won't need my salary for the next month.

506
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,230
International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction?

507
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,530
You're probably the first boss to give away gifts for your staff on such a day.

508
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,800
I seriously thought about it.

509
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I feel like what I did

510
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,900
doesn't really help with anything.

511
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,300
For a double win, I've decided to invest in your livestream.

512
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,400
Invest in my livestream?

513
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
What do you mean?

514
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Don't misunderstand.

515
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,400
It's not because you're my girlfriend.

516
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,800
I... just seriously think

517
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
that the live streaming industry has a lot of potential.

518
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,100
And also your amazing work abilities.

519
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
Really?

520
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What if you're unhappy with it?

521
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Rest assured. Anytime I invest,

522
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I've never lost.

523
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,700
Why don't you say you believe in me?

524
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,500
- Hello?
- Miss Fu?

525
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,400
- Your bathroom is leaking again. Can you come check?
- I'm sorry.

526
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,800
I'll be right there.

527
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
- Where are you going?
- My pipes are leaking again so I have to go home.

528
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
The livestream is about to start.

529
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,900
I'll definitely be back before it starts. Will you tell them?

530
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,600
Hurry up!

531
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,000
What are you doing upstairs? My ceiling is full of water.

532
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,300
I just fixed it a few days ago.

533
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,000
If you don't fix it, I won't let you off.

534
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm so sorry, I'm renting this unit. The owner is currently out of the country.

535
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,900
And also these pipes are quite old. It's not really all my fault.

536
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,600
I don't care. You're responsible.

537
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Let me answer my phone.

538
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,000
- Hello?
- Sister Shuang, what's going on over there?

539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm sorry, I have an issue. I'll be right back.

540
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,600
Very soon.

541
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,200
I have some issues at the office. Can we talk when I get back?

542
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
What if you run away?

543
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,400
How about this?

544
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,200
I'll leave my ID with you so, of course, I won't run.

545
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,700
Fine.

546
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,800
Hello?

547
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,500
I'll be there in 15 minutes!
