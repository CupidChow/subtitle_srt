2
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,050
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,830
I already said you don't have to hurry.

4
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,450
It's work. The sooner we finish the better.

5
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,640
You are still as competitive as before.

6
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,740
You still haven't changed even after growing up.

7
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,550
I still remember when you were 8,

8
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,580
you competed with a group of boys to climb a tree and you won.

9
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,290
But because you climbed too high, you were afraid to come down.

10
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,430
All the other boys had gone home for dinner.

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,990
You were stubborn and said you wanted to watch the sunset in the tree.

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,410
I did see the sunset, but I couldn't get down.

13
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,090
You found a ladder and carried me down.

14
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,050
Yes.

15
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,210
It feels like it happened yesterday.

16
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,260
I miss those times.

17
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,360
I miss my childhood.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,850
Rather than saying I miss my childhood,

19
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,990
it's better to say I miss the time I spent with you.

20
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,160
We've worked hard these past couple of days. Let's eat dinner together. I'll choose a place.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,330
Tonight?

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,520
Let's not go out.

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,490
Come to my place. I'll cook.

24
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,090
Okay.

25
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,710
What are you planning on making?

26
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,420
- I can make anything.
- Anything?

27
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,900
What?

28
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,830
Miss Xia invited Hao Siyuan to her home for dinner?

29
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,770
Not just to eat. It feels like a confession.

30
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,560
No way. Confessing this quickly?

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Let me tell you. I feel like Hao Siyuan had feelings for her a long time ago.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,340
He even put Sister Qian into a video game he designed.

33
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,550
The hero's childhood sweetheart and the most beautiful person in the world.

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,370
That's too childish.

35
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,420
What do you know? This is a game designer's way of being romantic.

36
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,390
Maybe Sister Qian likes someone childish like him.

37
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,240
Tell Sheng Zhening to pick it up. Even though we have an alliance,

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,500
I can't override Sister Qian's decision.

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,220
What can I do?

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,870
I can't pursue Miss Xia in place of GM Sheng.

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,850
You...

42
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,110
You don't even know this?

43
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,030
What else can you do? Just tell him directly.

44
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,610
Tell him that if he doesn't try now, Sister Qian is going to end up with someone else.

45
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,890
If I say that, I think I won't even have a job anymore.

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,070
What did you say? I can't hear.

47
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,900
Miss Xia wants to invite Hao Siyuan to her house for dinner?

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,980
Hao Siyuan also wants to confess to Miss Xia?

49
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,230
What should we do?

50
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,720
Why are you being so loud?

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
I nearly went deaf.

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,680
If there's nothing else, I'm going to hang up.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,980
But you haven't said how you will tell Sheng Zhening...

54
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,300
I already told him.

55
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,350
You told him?

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,460
It's almost done?

57
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,060
Yes, almost done.

58
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,920
Wait, wait.

59
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,040
Can we eat all of this food? It's so much.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,700
We can finish it.

61
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,050
Try it.

62
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,000
Eat. I'm starving.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,420
Right, I have a gift for you.

64
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,050
A gift? Is today a holiday?

65
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,900
Open it and see.

66
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,840
It's good.

67
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,810
It's a music box.

68
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,490
This song...

69
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,950
Is it familiar?

70
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,920
A little.

71
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,440
This is what you played me on my 11th birthday.

72
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,770
You sent it to me as a birthday gift.

73
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,330
I thought it sounded good, so I secretly recorded it.

74
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,330
I found someone to make it into a music box.

75
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,250
Does it sound good?

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,260
11 years old.

77
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,930
I had just started learning piano.

78
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,710
I was terrible. It was like making you watch a joke.

79
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,480
No way, I was moved every time I listened.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Qianqian,

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,120
there's something I've kept inside for a long time.

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,010
After meeting with you these past weeks,

83
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,670
this feeling has been getting stronger.

84
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,240
I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,010
Brother Siyuan,

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,830
I can't accept.

88
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,390
There's someone in my heart.

89
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,120
Do I not have even a little bit of a chance?

90
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,030
Maybe one day that person will leave your heart?

91
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,750
He won't.

92
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,670
He might not leave for a while.

93
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,550
You're that sure?

94
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,970
Sorry.

95
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,960
Qianqian,

96
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,700
you are still as direct as before. You say what's on your mind.

97
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,640
Of course. It's better to be direct for these sorts of things.

98
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,110
I don't want to waste your feelings.

99
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,870
Brother Siyuan, if our current situation

100
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,960
makes you uncomfortable, then

101
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,050
we can stop our collaboration at any time.

102
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,490
In your heart, am I such a petty person?

103
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,900
Of course not.

104
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,330
Don't worry. Work is work. Feelings are feelings.

105
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,590
I can keep them separate.

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,660
No matter what happens,

107
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,140
I genuinely want you to be happy.

108
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,600
Happy?

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,870
Whether I'm happy, we will have to see.

110
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,290
Let's eat. I'm starving to death.

111
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,470
Right, let's eat. The food is getting cold.

112
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,970
GM Sheng.

113
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,020
Leave.

114
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,930
GM Sheng went to find Miss Xia.

115
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,730
After coming back, he's been in a bad mood.

116
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,370
No... more like he's broken down.

117
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,810
Did Sister Qian really accept Siyuan's confession?

118
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,510
I don't know.

119
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,270
I just know GM Sheng told me to book a ticket to Yungang tomorrow.

120
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,390
What is he doing in Yungang?

121
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,510
Our company has been in a pricing war with Langyue recently.

122
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,010
GM Sheng wants to transfer out the vegetable base in Yungang

123
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,590
so that he can have some cash on hand.

124
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,570
GM Sheng recently has been too tired.

125
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,960
Looks like Sheng Zhening wants to use work as an excuse to leave.

126
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,300
Wouldn't matchmaking be harder for us then?

127
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,160
Matchmaking for what.

128
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,320
I feel like the more we try, the more GM Sheng gets hurt.

129
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,440
Originally, I wanted to give them an opportunity to cherish their relationship.

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,100
I've realized that it's all useless.

131
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,520
If they don't fix the problems between them, there's no point in talking about the future.

132
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,360
Sister Qian was also hurt. A Kongming Lantern event happened out of nowhere.

133
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,970
If it was me, I also wouldn't be able to bear it.

134
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,070
Think about how much courage it takes for Sister Qian to still be with Sheng Zhening.

135
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,780
Look. It just so happens Siyuan also comes into the picture.

136
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,550
It looks like the heavens don't want them together.

137
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,210
Don't speak nonsense.

138
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,000
You're even getting superstitious.

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,450
What can I do? I can only listen to Heaven's will.

140
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,120
You don't say. After drinking it for a while, this milk tastes pretty good.

141
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,560
What did I tell you?

142
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,820
How can I have bad taste?

143
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,590
I read all of it. There's no problem.

144
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,660
Luckily, you didn't also refuse my request for cooperation.

145
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,080
Otherwise, I would be so embarrassed.

146
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,450
How could I? Your company is so powerful. How could I refuse?

147
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,190
Here. I wish us smooth cooperation.

148
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,810
Smooth cooperation.

149
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,870
By the way, I'm going to Norway soon.

150
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,430
You're going to Norway?

151
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,620
How long are you going for?

152
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,090
I haven't decided. But I don't think I'd be back within the next two years.

153
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,200
You're going for that long?

154
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,250
Don't worry. It's not because of you.

155
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,040
There's a new project over there that needs my help.

156
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,240
Qianqian.

157
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,950
The person in your heart is Sheng Zhening, right?

158
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,310
Yes.

159
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,990
How did you know?

160
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,930
Because I was curious about what kind of person I lost to.

161
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,280
So... I did some research.

162
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,580
By the way, there's something else I need to tell you.

163
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,240
That day when we were doing offline research,

164
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,030
there was a mascot around. Right?

165
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,240
He was the one who dressed up as that mascot.

166
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,390
I saw him when I was buying water.

167
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,000
But I didn't really pay attention then.

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,380
Later, I found out he was Sheng Zhening, and he was the person you like.

169
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,780
You're saying that Sheng Zhening was the one who dressed up as the mascot that day?

170
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,300
Yes.

171
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,060
I actually wasn't planning on telling you.

172
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,920
But then I gave it some thought and said, forget it. You're not the only one who cares about him.

173
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
He also cares about you.

174
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,070
Throw them all out. Don't leave her a single one. You don't know how much she drank last time.

175
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,420
Fortunately, Xiao Sheng brought her home. Otherwise, who knows what would've happened.

176
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,930
Take them all out.

177
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,440
Mom.

178
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,060
You said I encountered Sheng Zhening in Evergreen Hotel after I got drunk?

179
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,860
Is that true? Did I encounter him?

180
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,190
Did Zhening bring me home?

181
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,470
No. This...

182
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,350
You don't need to say anymore.

183
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,120
Miss Xia.

184
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,160
Anan, do me a favor.

185
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,630
I want to see the security tapes outside of Zhening's room

186
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,000
for around 10:00 pm on the 8th.

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,850
What happened?

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,330
Please help me with this favor.

189
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,650
- Okay, I'll send them to you after I get them.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,940
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

191
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,540
You're lying to me.

192
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,990
You have me in your heart!

193
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,240
You do have me in your heart.

194
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
[Anan]

195
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,000
- Hello?
- Miss Xia.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,500
- That day, you and GM Sheng...
-  Anan.

197
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,400
I'll come to Evergreen Hotel now to look for Zhening.

198
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,560
GM Sheng left on a business trip to Yungang this morning.

199
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,850
He went to Yungang?

200
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,120
Where is he staying?

201
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,650
He's staying in Room 607 of Huating Hotel.

202
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,240
- Okay, I got it.
- Miss Xia.

203
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,900
Don't ever give up.

204
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,910
Xia Qian!

205
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,910
Mom.

206
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,670
Didn't you tell me

207
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,300
that you won't ever interfere with my relationships again?

208
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,550
Hello, Qianqian?

209
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,700
Hello, Shuangshuang? I remember your hometown is in Yungang, right?

210
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,410
That's right.

211
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,840
- I'm going there.
- Oh, right. I was just going to tell you.

212
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,870
I can take you to my hometown to help clear your mind.

213
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,960
When do you want to go? I'll book the tickets.

214
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,330
- I'm going now.
- Now?

215
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,100
- I'm going to find Sheng Zhening.
- What?

216
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,780
No...

217
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,460
What did you say?

218
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,140
You told her where I was staying?

219
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,210
And Miss Xia is on her way to Yungang. She should arrive at the hotel soon.

220
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,780
Didn't I tell you

221
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,890
that you can't tell her anything about me?

222
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,760
You obviously still like Miss Xia. Why must you push her away?

223
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,880
Anyways, I already told her.

224
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,750
Do you think you're all that?

225
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,110
Do you want to keep your job?

226
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,820
I'm prepared for however you want to punish me when you get back.

227
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,390
So stubborn.

228
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,950
Hello, check out, please.

229
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,140
Okay, please wait.

230
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,630
Anan, I've arrived in Yungang.

231
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,960
Miss Xia, I'm sorry. I just saw that GM Sheng has already left Huating Hotel.

232
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,740
But don't worry. I'll find out about his new hotel as soon as possible.

233
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,700
Even if I can't find it, he'll meet with the contractor to discuss the transferring of the vegetable base the day after tomorrow.

234
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,020
I can send over his meeting time and place to you.

235
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,500
Miss Xia, don't worry. GM Sheng can't run away this time.

236
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,850
I got it. Thank you for the trouble, Anan.

237
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,220
In any case, if I can't meet him in Yungang, I won't come home.

238
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,880
Hello, the number you dialed is busy.
[GM Sheng]

239
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,140
Brother, isn't it your day off? Why are you still working?

240
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,080
Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

241
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,360
- What's wrong?
 - Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

242
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,150
Hey.

243
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,010
I told Miss Xia where GM Sheng was staying in Yungang.

244
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,930
Didn't you say yesterday that you weren't going to try to bring them together anymore?

245
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,040
That's because I realized the two of them don't even—

246
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,640
Forget it. You wouldn't understand.

247
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,000
Anyway, I put in a lot of effort to get them back together.

248
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,690
Then, what‘s troubling you?

249
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,520
GM Sheng has completely stopped answering my phone calls.

250
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,140
I might lose my job when he gets back.

251
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,780
Don't worry.

252
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,510
If Sister Qian gets back with Sheng Zhening, she'll definitely save you.

253
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,540
You have been really busy lately. Take the opportunity to take a break.

254
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,620
What? Are you still worried?

255
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,300
It's fine. If you lose your job,

256
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,080
you can work at Worth or Not. Sister Qian and I will take care of you.

257
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,820
You can be my assistant if you can't be Sheng Zhening's.

258
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,860
Leave me alone.

259
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,620
Make some breakfast for me. I'm hungry.

260
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,140
This looks so nice, Auntie.

261
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,100
- Come. Come, come. You got it?
- I got it.

262
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,810
Come.

263
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,380
I've really troubled you.

264
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,790
What's the trouble? I'm telling you! Shuangshuang made the request earlier.

265
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,170
She said I must take good care of you.

266
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,640
Make yourself at home.

267
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,780
Just let me know if you want to eat something, go anywhere,

268
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,120
or do anything. Don't be a stranger.

269
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,520
Auntie, there's no need for all the trouble.

270
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,180
You can go back to your business. I can be here by myself.

271
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,630
What trouble?

272
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,780
You're Shuangshuang's friend.

273
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,770
Thank you for taking care of Shuangshuang all these years.

274
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,130
I'll cook you a couple of my specialty dishes tonight. You can have a taste of my cooking.

275
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,660
- Then... Okay, I'll be your assistant.
- Okay.

276
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,680
All right then, get some rest for now.

277
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,530
I'm heading out in a bit. I'll be back soon.

278
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,060
Okay. Where are you going? Do you need my help?

279
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,830
No, no. I'm just going to the bus station to see if there are any travelers.

280
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,370
- All right, get some rest.
- Okay.

281
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,130
- The keys.
- Oh, right. The keys.

282
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,780
- All right, have a rest. All right.
- Go ahead.

283
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,190
- Take care, Auntie.
- Okay.

284
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,940
Tell the Finance Department to create a budget spreadsheet and send it to me as soon as possible.

285
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,730
Okay.

Also, it includes breakfast and tour guide service.

293

Since you are already here,

what's the point in staying at the large hotels. Right?

And our inn is very quiet. Most people can't find it.

Let's start.

Shuangshuang told me about your situation in general.

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,230
Did you break up with your boyfriend and come here to heal?

361

Is that it?

362

Let me tell you something.

363
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,300
After breaking up, the best way to get over it

364
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,570
is to start a new relationship.

365
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,630
Auntie, is so light-hearted. That's right.

366

The guest in 104 is a young man.

He's tall and has fair skin.

368

Everything about him seems pretty good.

369

He told me he came here for work.

I've had this shop for so many years. I've seen so many people.

371
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,690
I knew it just by looking at him.

372
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,430
He must have had some problems in his relationship.

373
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,200
I think he might have broken up with his girlfriend.

374
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,930
That might be.

375

Qianqian!

481
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,300
What's wrong?

482
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,480
What's is it, child?

483
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,290
Auntie,

484
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,460
I'm okay. The wind blew something in my eyes.

485
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,620
My child,

486
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,700
I could see that you've been forcing yourself to be strong.

487
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,530
Didn't I tell you?

488
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,710
This is your home. I am like your mother.

489
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,240
Whatever it is, just let it out. Don't hold it in.

490
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,690
It's just a breakup.

491
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,200
Cry out loud.

492
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,690
Cry out then move on.

493
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,030
I can't, Auntie.

494
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,350
I feel like I'm going mad.

495
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,160
I see him everywhere, day and night.

496
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,260
I feel he's been near me ever since I got here.

497
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,250
But I couldn't find him.

498
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,770
He doesn't answer my calls.

499
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,250
I can't reach him. He's been avoiding me.

500
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,880
I'm not the can't-let-go type.

501
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,120
I just want some answers.

502
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,260
I understand. There, there.

503
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,330
You shall meet again if it's meant to be.

504
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,560
Auntie.

505
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,130
Mr. Sheng, why are you here in the kitchen?

506
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,870
It's just I bought something.

507
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,860
Tonight, I have a sudden craving

508
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,950
for fried shrimps and stir-fried razor clams.

509
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,140
Could I trouble you to cook them?

510
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,300
Sure, no problem.

511
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,950
I bought a lot. Maybe we could all have some?

512
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,910
Very well. I'll do it.

513
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,810
Just leave it to me. You better get out, the smell is too strong.

514
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,810
Go, go.

515
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,000
8:10 now. It's been almost an hour. When can you finish?

516
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,730
- Almost done.
- Almost?

517
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,760
Don't you have a car? Why should I pick you up?

518
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,160
We go in the same direction.

519
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,800
Besides, driving less is good for the environment.

520
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,300
You are saving gas money, aren't you?

521
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,230
- That, too.
- You're so cheap.

522
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,150
What do you mean cheap? I'm protecting the environment.

523
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,530
Besides, I need to save money to buy a house.

524
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,580
We can't share rent forever, can we?

525
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,140
By the way, how is Sheng Zhening doing?

526
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,040
I can't reach him on the phone.

527
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,850
Neither do I know where he is.

528
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,040
But later tonight, colleagues from the sales department

529
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,470
will let me know the time and venue for his meeting tomorrow.

530
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,500
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

531
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,880
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,260
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

551
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,540
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,690
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

553
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,830
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

554
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,230
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

555
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,740
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

556
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:13,560
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

557
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,560
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫
