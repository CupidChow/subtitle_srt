[Episode 39]

3
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,600
Mengmeng, look at this.

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,100
This should be dad's college yearbook.

5
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,800
Take a look.

6
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,600
See if you can find that person.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Greenland Foundation is willing to lend us the money at a very low-interest rate.

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
What are their intentions?

9
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Director Ni of the foundation is good friends with Old GM Sheng.

10
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,300
He said he just wants to help Evergreen Hotel.

11
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,600
So?

12
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,200
The memory of that person is too vague. I can't remember.

13
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,800
All right. These photos are all over 30 years old.

14
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
It's normal for you not to remember.

15
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Moreover, their appearances have changed.

16
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Forget it. It's okay. You must be tired. Let's go home.

17
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll take the yearbook with me to look at it again later.

18
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's go.

20
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,600
We should turn off this light.

21
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This article exposed what Qin Hebo secretly did during his time in Evergreen.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,400
He ruined Miss Ning Meng's wedding, trapped the reviewer in the elevator, and more.

24
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,800
They say he will do whatever it takes for money.

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Who do you think suddenly exposed him?

26
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
I heard from Langyue

27
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,700
that when we were in a price war with them,

28
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,800
Qin Hebo resigned for an unknown reason.

29
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,500
Director Xue.

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,600
You asked someone to post that article online, right?

31
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
What do you think?

32
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,700
Hebo,

33
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,200
why did you lend money to Evergreen Hotel through Greenland Foundation?

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a personal matter of mine.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't have to work for me.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,300
But I don't hope you become my enemy.

37
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,800
Are you threatening me?

38
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,900
I'm just warning you.

39
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Then I'll also warn you. I've investigated.

40
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Lihe Capital doesn't have ample funds.

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,600
How many people in Lihe Capital support you now?

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
How long can you last? You should think about that.

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
Before this was exposed,

44
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,800
I was constantly worried about others finding out.

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,200
It's like the sword hanging over my heart would fall at any moment.

46
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,700
Now that everyone knows about it,

47
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
I feel at ease.

48
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Indeed, I did some wrong things.

49
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,800
So now I must face the consequences for my actions.

50
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm willing to take on any punishment.

51
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,620
Then, what's going to happen now?

52
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,600
With the situation now,

53
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,800
it'll probably be difficult to find a job related to the hotel industry.

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,200
But hotel management is what you like.

55
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,300
Worse comes to worst, I can manage your homestay.

56
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,100
Does it need managing?

57
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay. At least you can spend money wisely. If all else fails,

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
I can support your living expenses.

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,400
I spent my money wisely, right?

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
This is my most wise investment.

61
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,500
I've been busy lately and couldn't come pay you a visit.

62
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm very thankful for Greenland Foundation's support of Evergreen Hotel.

63
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
You're welcome, GM Sheng.

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Your dad and I are good friends. Now that Evergreen is in trouble,

65
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,400
I would definitely help however I can.

66
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,500
By the way, do you know Qin Hebo?

67
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Qin Hebo?

68
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,800
He sounds a bit familiar, but I can't remember.

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
What's wrong?

70
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
It's nothing.

71
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Have some tea. Please.

72
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,200
I think Director Ni is lying.

73
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,100
When Greenland Foundation cooperated with Evergreen the year before last,

74
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,100
the person in charge was Qin Hebo. This project also lasted half a year.

75
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,800
How could they not know each other?

76
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
Here.

77
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I haven't ordered yet.

78
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,500
This isn't from me. It's from GM Sheng.

79
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
How did you know I was here?

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,700
You didn't answer your phone and your house was empty. Where else could you be

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
if not here?

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,700
This drink is to thank you for lending money to Evergreen.

83
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,400
The money Greenland Foundation lent to Evergreen was actually yours.

84
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Right?

85
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
I don't have the means

86
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,100
to return the money to you now. But I'll convert them into Evergreen shares for you.

87
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,800
Is that okay?

88
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,220
If you'd feel more comfortable doing so, go ahead.

89
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,900
The news about you online

90
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,700
was exposed by Lihe Capital, right?

91
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,220
Was it because you lent money to Evergreen?

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't worry about it.

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I still have something to do. I'll get going now.

94
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Good luck.

95
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,080
Zhening.

96
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,340
What are you doing?

97
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,000
My mom asked me to come over. She said that you seemed tired recently,

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,500
and it makes her feel bad. So she made some ginseng chicken soup for you.

99
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,840
Hello?

100
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,420
Okay. I got it.

101
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,400
I have a meeting to attend. I'll be back soon.

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
I'll wait for you.

103
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,700
Another meeting.

104
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Miss Xia, you're here. I'm here to grab a document for GM Sheng.

105
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,450
Anan, let me ask you something.

106
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,400
Has Zhening been paying close attention to Qin Hebo?

107
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,000
The money the foundation lent to Evergreen some time ago was actually lent by Qin Hebo.

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,800
After GM Sheng found out, his mood varied a little.

109
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,900
Qin Hebo is really unpredictable.

110
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,000
Then... I'll get going. This is pretty urgent.

111
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,710
What are you looking at?

112
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,100
It's nothing much.

113
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,400
It seems serious.

114
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,420
I'm done eating. Keep eating.

[Changsheng Hotel in a crisis, seeking new opportunities]

116
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
Shuangshuang, let me ask you something.

117
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,500
Did you know that Qin Hebo lent a large sum of money to Evergreen?

118
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I heard Hebo mention it.

119
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,700
He thinks that he made too many mistakes in the past.

120
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,400
So he wanted to secretly make it up to Evergreen.

121
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,200
He also told me not to tell you about it.

122
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,000
He's actually a really nice person. He's always had Evergreen in his heart.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Zhening is like that, too.

124
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Actually, he can't stop caring about Brother Hebo.

125
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Those two are really...

126
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
What can we do?

127
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
This is too difficult. It's impossible for them to want to meet.

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
They probably won't even get a few words in.

129
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Can we create an opportunity

130
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,000
for them to meet by chance?

131
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,850
Sorry to ask you out so suddenly.

132
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,040
It's fine. I am not very busy at the hospital these days. Is there something urgent?

133
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,130
I want to ask you for a favor.

134
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,810
What's wrong?

135
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,390
I know you can hypnotize. I want you to hypnotize me

136
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,740
so I can recall the truth of my dad's death.

137
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,380
Why?

138
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,590
There is a possibility that someone plotted my dad's car accident that year.

139
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,290
But I completely lost the memory of that day.

140
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,430
I heard using hypnosis can help recall memories.

141
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,420
So I want to give it a try.

142
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,790
I don't recommend hypnosis.

143
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,460
The reason you forgot about that night is because you don't want to remember it yourself.

144
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,920
So your brain automatically shut this memory out.

145
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,260
Even if you recall it,

146
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,640
I will only aggravate your pain.

147
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,620
I know, but it's the truth of my dad's death.

148
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,400
Hypnosis can't make sure you recall it.

149
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,880
I really want to try. I beg you.

150
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,790
Pay attention to your breathing. Relax your body.

151
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,730
Now imagine yourself in an elevator.

152
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,300
The numbers on the elevator,

153
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,450
represents the year.

154
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,030
Okay.

155
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,290
The elevator is now running.

156
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,190
It will take you back to 2014.

157
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,300
I see a very empty space.

158
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,580
Keep going forward, what do you see?

159
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,440
There is a white door.

160
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,260
Okay.

161
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,890
Try to push open the door.

162
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,240
Never mind. Don't worry.

163
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,280
Let's try again.

164
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,320
Mengmeng.

165
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,260
Don't worry, I'm here with you. Let's face it together.

166
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,260
I remembered it.

167
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,970
What did you remember?

168
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,020
I remembered the face of the person who quarreled with my dad back then.

169
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,270
Brother, I've checked carefully. This person is the most likely.

170
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,490
Is Director Xue from Lihe capital called Xue Qingyun?

171
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,100
Yes.

172
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,710
Could it be him?

173
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,960
At the moment, these are all speculations.

174
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,980
We need to take a long look at this.

175
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,950
- Zhijuan, take Mengmeng back to rest.
- Okay.

176
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,500
Brother, if there is any progress, let me know as soon as possible.

177
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,380
Don't worry.

178
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,970
Let's go.

179
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,450
[Xue Qingyun]

180
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,880
Thank you for today.

181
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,190
It's fine. You haven't been sleeping well these days.

182
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,600
Remember to relax your mind and go to sleep early.

183
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,830
Can hypnosis make people forget things?

184
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,360
Do you want to forget about the night of the car accident?

185
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,840
I want to forget all the memories with you.

186
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,800
Because some memories are too beautiful.

187
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,760
But I feel bad when I think about them.

188
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,770
Sorry, hypnosis cannot make people forget the past.

189
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,980
Is that so?

190
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,330
It's already very late, get some rest.

191
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,260
I am going back.

192
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,630
Zhening, you are back.

193
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,820
Yes.

194
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,330
What's wrong? What happed?

195
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,070
Before my dad had a car accident,

196
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,430
Director Xue from Lihe Capital had a quarrel with him.

197
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,280
And they were university classmates and started a business together.

198
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,700
Lihe Capital has frequently targeted Evergreen before.

199
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,440
This time they supported Langyue to fight a price war with Evergreen.

200
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,820
I don't think... it's a coincidence.

201
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,240
There is something wrong here.

202
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,940
I thought of someone who knows Lihe Capital very well.

203
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,180
Qin Hebo.

204
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,100
This restaurant is Hebo's favorite.

205
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,290
Because their dishes are exquisite and delicious.

206
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,770
You see how exquisite they are.

207
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,330
Yes, actually Zhening and I also like this restaurant. And we frequently come here, too.

208
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,730
What a coincidence. We all like the food here. It can be a gathering place for us.

209
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,960
Sure, I have no problem with it.

210
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,940
Zhening, what do you think?

211
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,800
Right?

212
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

213
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,460
This is a new dish: Fruit Shrimp Balls. Please try.

214
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,080
Thank you.

215
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,700
Hebo, try one too.

216
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,800
There is mango in there.

217
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,550
What's wrong?

218
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,550
I'm allergic to mango.

219
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,320
Why didn't you tell me before?

220
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,550
Because it's not a big deal. So I didn't say it.

221
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,900
Shuangshuang, I'm going to wash my hands.

222
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,770
I am going, too.

223
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,460
Let's go.

224
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,910
What can we do? It's not started yet but feels like it's going to end.

225
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,400
But did you see how Zhening reacted when he said mango just now?

226
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,110
He still cares about Qin Hebo.

227
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,300
Right. I didn't even know he was allergic to mango.

228
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,020
They have a tacit understanding.

229
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,600
No way. What do we do next? Someone has to make it clear.

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
You go? No, no, no...

231
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,530
Listen, I don't think either of us can do it.

232
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,810
Let's do this. Let's delay some time as much as possible. The longer the better.

233
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,220
The purpose for this meal today

234
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,790
is to ask you something

235
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,180
about Lihe Capital.

236
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,400
Indeed, I also think that there is something strange

237
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,260
with Lihe Capital.

238
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
I'm asking someone to investigate.

239
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,210
I'll let you know of any new information.

240
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,240
There's another cup of oolong tea coming up.

241
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,460
Who'll take this one for now?

242
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,090
- Just place it here for now.
- Okay.

243
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,960
Thank you.

244
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's go.

245
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,480
Oh.

246
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,310
Isn't that funny?

247
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,470
No wonder he used to...

248
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,890
Hello?

249
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,810
Okay. I got it.

250
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,730
Something's come up at the office.

251
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,250
I'll be going now. Take your time eating.

252
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,020
I may come home late tonight. Have a good night.

253
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,820
I'll wait for you.

254
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm sorry.

255
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,910
[Emily]

256
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,090
Hello?

257
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay. I'll be there soon.

258
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,780
I'm sorry. Something's come up so I'll get going now.

259
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,030
I'll pick you up later tonight.

260
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,080
- Look at that. Aren't they similar?
- Too similar.

261
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,130
Let's eat.

262
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,500
Otherwise, it'll be wasted.

263
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,230
There's a lot of information, so it might be difficult to go through.

264
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,310
GM Qin, let me help you.

265
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,890
There's no need. I'll do it myself.

266
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,170
After all, there is still some danger.

267
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,860
You've helped me enough.

268
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,230
Director Xue deliberately posted the article online

269
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,450
about your resignation from Evergreen.

270
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,790
I know that.

271
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,370
GM Qin, Director Xue was the one who ruined Miss Ning Meng's wedding.

272
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,270
Why haven't you explained yourself to GM Sheng?

273
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,690
It's nothing important. There's no need to explain.

274
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,350
By the way, thank you so much for your help this time.

275
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,090
I'll try my best to help with whatever favor you ask in the future.

276
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,160
Lihe Capital has been throwing their money at Langyue recently.

277
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,460
But Evergreen still remains firm.

278
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,030
We should really rethink this.

279
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,960
Is this really worth doing?

280
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,610
GM Sheng, you understand Evergreen's situation

281
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,720
better than any of us.

282
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,330
They hold the power.

283
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,270
We're at a critical point and can't hold on for much longer.

284
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,300
If this continues, both sides will crash and burn.

285
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,670
I agree to the M&A.

286
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,630
Evergreen is not yours alone.

287
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,240
If you insist on resisting,

288
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,490
don't blame us shareholders for selling our shares.

289
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,760
I heard that Evergreen has established ties

290
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,740
with Europe's oldest high-end travel company. From now on, their occupancy rate is basically guaranteed.

291
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,930
So I recommend that we pull out.

292
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:42,000
With that all said, I'll cut to the chase.

293
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,830
Lihe Capital is making us a great offer now.

294
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,990
They're willing to buy our shares at a high price.

295
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,270
With the current state of Evergreen, it's definitely safer for us to sell our shares.

296
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,770
Our shares will be even less valuable if we lose the price war.

297
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,370
If we sell our shares,

298
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,370
Lihe Capital will become the largest shareholder.

299
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,300
Then, they'll be the ones in charge.

300
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,370
You'll be a mere puppet for them, and it'll be even more embarrassing.

301
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,460
Please trust me. Evergreen is an attractive piece of meat.

302
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,480
As long as we take them down,

303
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,490
Lihe Capital will elevate a large step.

304
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,030
We can still keep ourselves afloat, but Evergreen definitely won't last long.

305
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,980
We have feelings for Evergreen,

306
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,740
and have a deep friendship with Old GM Sheng.

307
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,420
We can't just helplessly watch Evergreen collapse.

308
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm clear of how you feel.

309
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,830
I also understand your concerns.

310
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,150
But I wish to ask for everyone to give me two days.

311
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,250
In two days,

312
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,800
I'll give you an answer.

313
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,670
I expect it to be at most one week.

314
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,540
Since Director Xue has made this decision,

315
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,940
we will give you one final week. But throughout this week,

316
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,800
we'll be paying close attention to trends

317
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,920
of Evergreen and Langyue.

318
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,570
I also hope that you can take responsibility for your decision.

319
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,270
Of course.

320
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,660
I will definitely take responsibility.

321
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,200
I plan on making a trip to Jiangcheng today

322
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,790
to discuss financing with Huayu Capital.

323
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,670
If it's successful,

324
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,490
Evergreen won't have to be suppressed by Lihe Capital for much longer.

325
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,990
And Huayu would only receive share dividends.

326
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,440
They will not be participating in the hotel management work.

327
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,020
We can't give you two days. Only one day.

328
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,510
Tomorrow, we'll continue the shareholders' meeting.

329
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,910
All right.

330
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,100
I'll be on time for tomorrow's meeting,

331
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,000
and give everyone a satisfactory answer.

332
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,530
Director Xue, Sheng Zhening said he's going to Jiangcheng

333
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,090
to speak to Huayu Capital about financing.

334
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,410
It seems that Sheng Zhening is really anxious.

335
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,350
Director Xue, why aren't you at all worried?

336
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,220
If he gets the financing,

337
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,720
Lihe Capital will have a hard time

338
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,640
trying to acquire Evergreen.

339
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,120
Don't worry. I've already talked to Huayu Capital.

340
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,930
It's impossible for Sheng Zhening to get the money.

341
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,370
Zhening.

342
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,680
You're back.

343
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,800
Did I wake you?

344
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,370
No. I was waiting for you.

345
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,750
- You drank alcohol?
- A bit.

346
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,540
I'll make you a cup of honey water.

347
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,100
Okay.

348
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,430
Drink some.

349
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,590
Did you drink because of GM Qin?

350
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,390
Somewhat.

351
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,580
You actually still care about him.

352
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,730
I talked to Shuangshuang for a long time today.

353
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,340
I think he changed a lot after coming back this time.

354
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,540
Including when he refused to cooperate with Lihe Capital

355
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,700
and resigning from Langyue.

356
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,300
He actually can't let go of your past either.

357
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,100
I don't have the energy to deal with this right now.

358
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,470
We'll talk about it after Evergreen's crisis has passed.

359
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,160
Okay.

360
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,460
Is the board worried as well?

361
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,600
You don't have to worry about the company. I'll deal with it.

362
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay.

363
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,830
These are your clothes. These are toiletries. And also

364
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,780
your...

365
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,410
SpongeBob.

366
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,460
These two

367
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,900
are greeting gifts I prepared according to the interests

368
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,840
of Huayu Capital. I'll put them in here.

369
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,490
- Thanks for the trouble.
- I can't help with the major issues.

370
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,100
I can only try and help you with trivial matters.

371
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,650
Will you be drinking when you get there?

372
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,620
There's that chance.

373
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,450
Don't drink too much.

374
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,150
I got it.

375
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:43,400
Zhening, why don't I sell Worth or Not?

376
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,890
Even though it's not worth too much money, it's still something.

377
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,160
Evergreen hasn't reached that point yet.

378
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,070
I've asked Anan. Your account is empty.

379
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,140
If the hotel wants to keep operating, the first option is to lay off staff. Second,

380
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,890
to mortgage Evergreen's other industries.

381
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,760
Third, to inject new funds.

382
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,520
Whatever happens, it's not what you want.

383
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,910
Stop worrying about it. Evergreen will get past this.

384
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,900
My meeting with Huayu Capital in Jiangcheng this time

385
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,690
will definitely resolve Evergreen's problems.

386
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,570
Trust me.

387
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,730
Pack it up.

388
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,460
When my dad was still alive, I heard

389
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,590
that you were especially interested in investing in the hotel industry.

390
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,020
As Evergreen is the best hotel in Jinhai City,

391
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,670
I believe that this is a wise choice for you.

392
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,870
I know that investing in Evergreen is a sure deal.

393
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,030
But our previous investment failed,

394
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,760
so our business strategies have changed.

395
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,800
We want to switch over to the internet industry.

396
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,160
Evergreen happens to have industries related to the internet industry.

397
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,990
I don't know if you heard of Evergreen's app.

398
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,830
It's a new project we're working on.

399
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,180
I don't know if Huayu Capital

400
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,200
has any thoughts on this?

401
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,360
Of course, I know about Evergreen's app.

402
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,070
It's just that our internet business is still in its pioneering stage.

403
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,110
We haven't confirmed a specific path to take.

404
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,390
So...

405
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,740
Unless Evergreen can wait for us for some time.

406
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,600
It's no big deal.

407
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,200
If we can't collaborate this time, we have next time.

408
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,400
- Here.
- All right.

409
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,290
Thank you.

410
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,600
Are you okay?

411
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,100
You should be more careful.

412
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm fine.

413
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
Thanks.

414
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,400
What? Are you still thinking about Sheng Zhening?

415
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,500
Yeah.

416
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,400
I don't know why... I have a bad feeling about this.

417
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
Then, why don't you call him?

418
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Why should I do that? He's already so stressed.

419
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,400
True. We can only wait then.

420
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,000
Thank you, Director Yuan, for taking the time to meet me.

421
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,600
However, I have an important meeting tomorrow. And I have a morning flight to catch.

422
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,400
There is no hurry. We've got time. I just got in the mood.

423
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,600
Although Huayu can't give you any money,

424
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,000
I have business partners who want to invest in the hotel business.

425
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,800
We will talk later.

426
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,700
Bottoms up!

427
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,900
Good. Let me tell you something.

428
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,400
Have you heard of Azure Technology?

429
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,400
Their CEO is my friend.

430
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,900
I've heard of them.

431
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,600
[Old Yuan of Huayu Capital]

432
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Hello, Old Yuan! How's it going?

433
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,200
Sheng Zhening is drunk for sure. He's been carried back to the hotel.

434
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,800
Looks like he won't make it to the shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

435
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
That's good.

436
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I've done what you asked.

437
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Don't forget my share when you take Evergreen.

438
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Rest assured.

439
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,600
You and I go back for years. I won't forget your share.

440
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Good.

441
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Bye.

442
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,100
The subscriber you are calling is busy now. Please try again later.

443
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,600
Anan.

444
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Well, have you reached him?

445
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
Not yet.

446
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,400
The shareholders' meeting is about to start.

447
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,200
If GM Sheng doesn't show up, he will voluntarily forfeit his vote.

448
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,800
Then Evergreen will fall into the hands of Lihe Capital.

449
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,400
Zhening knows what he's doing.

450
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,200
If you can't reach him, something must be wrong.

451
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,800
Something's wrong. What should we do now?

452
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Anan. Let's try to buy him some time.

453
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,100
That's the problem. We are not eligible to attend the meeting.

454
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Everyone should express their opinion on the mergers and acquisitions issue. Considering our long-term interest,

455
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,800
I believe in our cooperation with Lihe, the advantages outweigh the risks.

456
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
So I vote in favor.

457
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,100
Me too.

458
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,100
Me too.

459
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,800
I vote yes.

460
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,400
Here is the agreement. Please take a look.

461
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,200
If there's no objection, please sign.

462
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,500
I object.

463
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,800
I have 5% of the shares,

464
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
which makes me one of Evergreen's shareholders. I object.

465
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,800
We go by majority.

466
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,400
5% is not enough to call the shots.

467
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
We must abide by the principle.

468
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
Speaking of the principle,

469
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
my brother is Evergreen's general manager, also its biggest shareholder.

470
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,700
He should be present for this M&A discussion.

471
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,600
The meeting should have been held a few days ago.

472
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
We've given GM Sheng enough time.

473
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Besides, we also contacted him before today's session.

474
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,800
That's more than enough respect.

475
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,600
And we‘ve followed all the necessary procedures.

476
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,700
Now it's he who is not showing up on time.

477
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,000
I will have to deem his action as a voluntary abstention.

478
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,400
I agree. He shows no sense of punctuality.

479
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Exactly.

480
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,800
He's the one not showing up. Why should we pay the price?

481
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
That makes sense.

482
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Ning Meng,

483
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,200
don't panic. Your father was a generous man.

484
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I have also heard from Zhening that a lot of the shareholders were beneficiaries of his generosity.

485
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,600
Try to buy some time with that.

486
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Uncle Xiao, I still remember

487
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,800
your overseas investment almost went bankrupt.

488
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,300
And it was my father's loan that helped you to bounce back, right?

489
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,300
Uncle Qiao,

490
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,000
I still recall when your wife got sick,

491
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,200
my dad pulled all the strings he could

492
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,400
to find the best doctors in the country.

493
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
How is Auntie doing now?

494
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
She is doing fine.

495
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
That's great.

496
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,000
Uncle Chen,

497
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,400
I heard you started as a doorman, didn't you?

498
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,800
Knowing your loyalty to Evergreen,

499
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,200
my father promoted you all the way up

500
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,800
and gave you shares. Correct?

501
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,200
That's it!

502
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,600
Good job! Now tell them what you want.

503
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,700
Try not to be harsh.

504
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,400
Uncles, I'm not trying to morally blackmail anyone.

505
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,800
And I won't stand in anyone's way to profit.

506
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,600
However, my father dedicated his life to Evergreen.

507
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,000
Even if you want this M&A, you should wait for my brother to decide together.

508
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,700
- It makes sense.
- What do you say?

509
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,700
How moving! I shall leave it to you.

510
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,200
I would like to remind you, though.

511
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Each day we waste not making a decision

512
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,700
is devaluing the stocks in our hands.

513
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,170
I believe nobody wants your life savings to come to nothing, right?

514
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Brother!

515
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,500
Sorry, everyone, for being late.

516
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,200
It's Zhening.

517
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
He's back.

518
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,100
Director Xiao, you don't expect me to still be in Jiangcheng, right?

519
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
Showing up won't make any difference.

520
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,900
And if I'm right,

521
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,100
you didn't manage to get the funding, correct?

522
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,800
Indeed.

523
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,600
I didn't get the funding.

524
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,500
Although I would like to ask everyone here,

525
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,000
do you really want to hand Evergreen to a murderer?

526
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
A murderer?

527
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
A murderer?

528
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,200
Are you slandering me to avoid this M&A?

529
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,600
It's not exactly decent, is it?

530
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,400
Don't you remember my father's car accident?

531
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,800
I have no idea what you are talking about. Not a clue.

532
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,300
Really?

533
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,290
Okay.

534
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,700
Let me refresh your memory.

535
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Back then, you illegally raised funds.

536
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,500
My father got hold of all the proof.

537
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,600
But he didn't report you immediately,

538
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,700
trying to convince you to turn yourself in.

539
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,200
You asked your driver to tamper with his car,

540
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,800
causing his accident.

541
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,800
That's a well-made story, GM Sheng.

542
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,200
Everyone,

543
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,600
allow me to introduce Yang Da, Director Xue's driver.

544
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,400
He knows best of Director Xue's deeds.

545
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Qin Hebo,

546
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,100
it's the shareholders' meeting today.

547
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,000
It's not everyone's place to be here.

548
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,210
Yang Da, please tell us exactly what he did.

549
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,190
Back then, the Old GM Sheng

550
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,200
got hold of some evidence of Xue Qingyun doing illegal fundraising.

551
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,870
Xue Qingyun wanted to talk to Old GM Sheng.

552
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,100
It's illegal fundraising. You'll go to jail!

553
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,800
Shaoxuan, it was stupid of me.

554
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
We were college buddies, we started a business together. For old times' sake,

555
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,400
- just let me off this time.
- What do you mean let you off?

556
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,700
You better turn yourself in.

557
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,400
Try to win for leniency. I don't want to turn you in myself.

558
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,600
Shaoxuan.

559
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,400
It's all my fault!

560
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,800
As long as you hand me the material.

561
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,600
I will make arrangements, then turn myself in.

562
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,700
You don't want to see me losing everything, do you?

563
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,200
I have hidden all the evidence.

564
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,800
If you turn yourself in, I won't mention it to anyone.

565
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,400
If you don't,

566
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
then I have to give them to the police.

567
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,860
I understand.

568
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,200
You've made up your mind

569
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,700
not to give me a second chance.

570
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
This is the chance I'm giving you.

571
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't want you to keep making more mistakes. Do you understand?

572
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,300
Shaoxuan,

573
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,000
I came to find you today

574
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,800
to fight for one last chance.

575
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
But I was wrong.

576
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I took you as my real friend!

577
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,800
Shaoxuan,

578
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
why do you have to make our relationship into one where only one can survive?

579
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,000
You know me well enough. Think about it.
