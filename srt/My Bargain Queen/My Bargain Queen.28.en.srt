[Episode 28]

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,750
Team Leader Xia is dating in the office?

4
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,640
I saw it clear as day.

5
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,600
A man was with Team Leader Xia for the evening shift

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,940
and were sharing a midnight snack.

7
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,960
Did you know that man?

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,930
I didn't see his face. But Miss Xia said that he's from the Marketing Department.

9
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,450
Brother Zhening, I wasn't well prepared for the meeting last time.

10
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,610
This is a report I wrote on the E-commerce business of the budget hotels.

11
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,420
- Has Manager Wang read it?
- Not yet.

12
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,300
You can show him first, and I'll review it after he has read it.

13
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,870
Brother, Manhui worked so hard. Just review it for her.

14
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,610
Review it.

15
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,070
Let's eat.

16
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Manhui, has anything interesting happened in your department recently?

17
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Nothing interesting.

18
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,430
But they're discussing a lot about one thing.

19
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,610
What is it?

20
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,640
I don't think I should say it. It's about Team Leader Xia.

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,320
Why not? Just tell us about it.

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,570
Team Leader Xia seems to be dating a staff member of our hotel.

23
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,350
Really?

24
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,370
I heard it from someone else.

25
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,000
I think someone saw her working late with a male staff member.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
And they had midnight snacks together.

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,900
That's good. Everyone has their own happiness to pursue.

28
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,710
Isn't that nice? What do you think, Brother?

29
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,060
Let's eat.

30
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,750
GM Sheng, we have a problem.

[Shocking News! App Design Data of Evergreen Hotel Leaked]

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,110
I've asked everyone to stop all their work on the app design.

33
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,050
We'll discuss whether we'll redesign or revise the design afterward.

34
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,000
The data was indeed stored in my computer.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,090
It was my negligence.

36
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,000
If I had encrypted the file, this wouldn't have happened.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,490
You shouldn't blame yourself so hard.

38
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,650
If they really want to steal it, they won't be stopped by a simple password.

39
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,490
However, not that many people knew that the data was in my computer.

40
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,420
I think it's very likely that it was the internal staff of the hotel.

41
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,340
I think so, too.

42
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,450
Who on earth would leak such data?

43
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,960
Who would benefit the most

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,750
if we stop all the app design?

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,550
Langyue Hotel.

46
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,450
In order to gain a market share,

47
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,240
they'd be willing to do anything.

48
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,590
GM Qin.

49
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,800
How's it going with searching for the app designer?

50
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,580
I've found the app designer.

51
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,390
We've started designing it.

52
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,260
That's great.

53
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,220
All of Evergreen's app design data has been leaked.

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm sure they will stop all the current design work.

55
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,500
This is good news for Langyue.

56
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,240
At least, we have caught up with Evergreen

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,210
in terms of app design.

58
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,520
It can be viewed as the heavens helping us.

59
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,320
I think this spy is among us.

60
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,370
Among us?

61
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,150
- Is it you?
- No! How is that possible? I have no motives to do it.

62
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,770
- Are you sure?
- Speaking of motives.

63
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,860
I think there's something wrong with Team Leader Xia.

64
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,800
Right, I remember something.

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,630
Didn't Team Leader Xia say that she was working late with someone from the Marketing Department?

66
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,230
I've made some inquiries. There's no such man.

67
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,880
So, could it be that Team Leader Xia has turned love to hate,

68
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,440
and wanted to take revenge on GM Sheng?

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,880
The man I saw the other day, could he be an accomplice?

70
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,340
It can't be.

71
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,330
Let's go.

72
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,680
I want to ask you about something.

73
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,450
What is it?

74
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,050
Nothing.

75
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,520
You want to ask if I'm behind what happened to Evergreen.

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,420
How do you know?

77
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,330
Seems like my identity as a bad guy is deeply rooted.

78
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,830
But listen. What happened to Evergreen has nothing to do with me.

79
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,970
What? You don't believe me?

80
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,110
I've been trying so hard to find an app designer these days, you saw it yourself.

81
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,460
You did work hard, but that doesn't stop you from obstructing other people's paths.

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,580
That's true. It's a competition.

83
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,900
Running ahead of the enemy as much as I can, is what I should do.

84
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,090
But if I were really behind all this,

85
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,940
do you know what I'd do?

86
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,860
What would you do?

87
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,670
At least I wouldn't let people doubt me.

88
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,740
You would do it but not admit it?

89
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
It's because I care about you.

90
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,230
I promised you

91
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,480
that I wouldn't be a bad guy again.

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,510
I want to keep that promise.

[Agent 007]

97
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,520
It's because you brought late-night snacks for Miss Xia that night and people saw it.

98
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Miss Xia couldn't explain it. So the rumors ran wild.

99
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,590
And eventually, the whole E-commerce Department now believes

100
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,510
that Miss Xia was the one who stole the data.

101
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,800
Notify Manager Wang in the E-commerce Department to hold a meeting with me.

102
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,380
Team Leader Xia, please come over here.

103
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,520
Okay.

104
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,460
What's happening?

105
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,430
I'm afraid Team Leader Xia won't be staying at Evergreen for long.

106

Today,

107
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,540
I'd like to discuss the topic of office bullying.

108
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,750
After the app design data was leaked,

109
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,650
many of you blamed Team Leader Xia for it.

110
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,970
Because someone saw that one night,

111
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,030
another employee of the hotel

112
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,720
was working late with Team Leader Xia.

113
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
It's absolutely ridiculous.

114
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,390
Here, I'd like to clarify

115
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,370
that the man who worked late with Team Leader Xia

116
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,370
was me.

117
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,360
We used to be a couple.

118
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,630
Although we've now separated,

119
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm still in love with her.

120
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,640
I'm the one pestering her.

121
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,270
So if she's the spy,

122
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,080
I can only be her accomplice.

123
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,610
All right. Get back to work.

124
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,030
What happened today?

125
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,550
Why did you say silly things like that?

126
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,160
I didn't like the idea of our fake breakup in the first place.

127
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,950
Now they're bullying you. How could I feel good about that?

128
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,500
But don't you think we should focus on catching the real thief,

129
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,050
instead of protecting me, the fake thief?

130
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,620
Actually, I have an idea.

131
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,750
Maybe we can find the thief.

132
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,110
How?

133
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,230
I need your support.

134
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,960
Listen, everyone.

135
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,710
On Team Leader Xia's laptop, the police found

136
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,350
fingerprints of the thief.

137
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,840
Later on, please all come to the meeting room.

138
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,280
The police need to collect your fingerprints to identify the thief.

139
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,890
Rest assured. I've got it all covered.

140
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,520
They won't have anything on us.

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,240
Good.

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,300
The most important thing now is to have the app released soon.

143
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,380
And seize the market before Evergreen does.

144
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,600
Based on our progress now,

145
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,160
the release date of our app

146
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
should be able to catch up with Evergreen.

148
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,680
Why don't you take the elevator? Where are you going in such a rush?

149
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,390
I... I have a stomachache. I'm going to the hospital.

150
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,280
Who did you sell the data to?

151
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,760
I... I don't know who he was.

152
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,060
We contacted each other over the phone.

153
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,560
I sent the data to him, and he gave me some money.

154
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,810
And... I couldn't contact him ever again.

155
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,330
Zhijuan! You're back early!

156
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,290
Be careful. Don't forget that you're still pregnant.

157
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,720
I thought you were studying for a month.

158
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,900
It ended early. So I came back immediately.

159
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,620
By the way, Mengmeng. Have you prepared the daily supplies for our baby?

160
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,730
Isn't it too early to prepare now?

161
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,360
No, it's not.

162
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,410
Since you're not too busy at the shop,

163
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,190
let's go to the infant store now and check it out.

164
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,370
You just came back. Don't you need to take a rest?

165
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,210
I'm not tired at all.

166
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,900
- All right.
- Let's go.

167
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,600
Let's go.

168
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,980
You're so clever. You tricked him into a confession.

169
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,450
It's not that I'm clever.

170
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,350
He's not a recidivist. He got flurried when we scared him.
(A convicted criminal who reoffends, especially repeatedly.)

171
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,180
To tell you the truth,

172
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,560
I think Lihe Capital is the most suspicious.

173
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,280
But it's also possible that Lihe Capital colluded with Langyue.

174
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,620
Because Langyue will benefit the most. What do you think?

175
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,480
I agree.

176
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,000
But it's a pity

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,610
that we didn't get any evidence from him.

178
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,840
You've done a good job already.

179
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,870
What is it?

180
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,030
Nothing. I won't disturb you.

181
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,270
He...

182
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,420
Did we give ourselves away?

183
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,950
- Are they heavy, Hubby?
- Not at all.

184
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,830
- Let me carry one.
- No, you don't need to.

185
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,450
- Let me carry one. It's not like I can't do anything.
- It's okay.

186
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,560
By the way, we need to go to the supermarket. We've bought everything for the baby, but not for you yet.

187
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,470
It's okay. We can go home.

188
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,870
No. You suffer the most being pregnant. We should buy some nutrition supplements for you.

189
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,310
Let's go.

190
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,680
Any other ideas regarding further work arrangements?

191
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,950
Miss Xia, what do you think?

192
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,240
Since the data has been leaked, I think the design of our app should start over.

193
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
I don't agree.

194
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,230
First of all, redesigning the app costs a lot of money.

195
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,280
And this is not the key issue. The key issue is time.

196
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,480
Langyue is releasing their app, too. We've got very limited time.

197
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,710
Manager Wang, please take a look at this.

198
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,410
Please pass this around and, everyone, take a look too.

199
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,300
Here's some feedback I've collected from internet users.

200
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,420
I think there are many useful suggestions.

201
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,500
For example, adding social features in our app.

202
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,350
So that the users can discuss our app and our products.

203
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,050
They can post pictures, add comments and even share their daily lives.

204
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,300
Although the app design data was leaked ahead of time,

205
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,530
I think this is a good thing for us.

206
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,440
It's a blessing in disguise. We got to know the real feedback of our users in advance.

207
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,270
So I think we should just make some improvements based on our previous version.

208
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,050
I think Team Leader Xia's idea is brilliant.

209
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,700
I think we should do as she said.

210
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,560
I don't think this bib is made from pure cotton.

211
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,360
Let's not use it.

212
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,980
What's the material of this spoon?

213
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,400
Silicone. I heard from other moms that silicone is soft

214
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,910
and won't hurt the baby's mouth.

215
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,730
But we don't know if the silicone is toxin-free.

216
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,030
Even if it is, what if it's contaminated during transportation?

217
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,880
I don't think we should use this spoon.

218
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Hubby, you're too nervous.

219
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,610
It's my first time being a dad.

220
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,120
I'm afraid that I can't take good care of the baby because I have no experience.

221
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm a bit nervous indeed.

222
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,400
You're so cute, Hubby!

223
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,430
Oh, by the way! Let me tell you.

224
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,170
I dreamed of our baby last night.

225
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,610
The baby was toddling towards me,

226
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,550
and then fell on the floor all of a sudden.

227
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,170
My heart ached for so long.

228
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,520
Hubby.

229
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,160
What's up?

230
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,120
Nothing.

231
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
Why are you here again?

232
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,990
Don't be nervous. Nobody knows.

233
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,540
Even if people see us, I don't think it's a problem.

234
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,280
I've already told them

235
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,740
that although we are separated,

236
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,730
I still miss you a lot

237
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,130
and now I'm the one

238
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,970
pestering you.

239
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,520
Pestering me. What did you buy for me?

240
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,900
Have some food. I'll finish the rest of the work.

241
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,800
You don't need to review the beginning section.

242
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,060
I've reviewed it. Just check the last part.

243
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,680
The products to be sold on our app this time, are mostly Evergreen's own products.

244
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,270
We only have a small portion of products from partner vendors.

245
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,260
To make sure of the quality of the products,

246
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,770
I will try it myself before each product is launched.

247
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,530
You will try all of the products?

248
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,370
It is necessary.

249
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,940
What about this one?

250
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,050
It wasn't me. Jiajia recommended this one.

251
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,580
We still have to discuss whether we should sell it or not.

252
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,560
I think it's okay to sell it.

253
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,570
Because we're selling the products online,

254
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,490
so the customers won't feel so awkward when buying it.

255
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,320
Do you have any suggestions?

256
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,960
Basically, I have zero experience regarding this type of product.

257
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,090
Me too.

258
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,060
Maybe we should find a chance... and try it?

259
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,800
Just eat your food.

260
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,490
Manager Chen.

261
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,330
Team Leader Xia.

262
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,140
What are you looking for at my desk?

263
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,220
Well, it's Manager Wang.

264
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,120
He wants the product page layout of our app.

265
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,340
He wants it immediately, and you weren't here. So I searched for the document myself.

266
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,810
I'll get it for you.

267
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,460
Okay.

268
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,590
Well, this is it.

269
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,410
- Okay. I'll go over now.
- Okay. Then I won't bother you.

270
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,210
I think I should drive you there.

271
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,610
There's no need, Hubby. The hospital is so far away from your clinic.

272
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,740
You can take care of me when my belly gets big in the future.

273
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Be careful when you walk up and down the stairs.

274
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,860
And be careful when you take the elevator. Don't let others bump into you.

275
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,140
Got it.

276
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,500
You're almost late for work. You should go.

277
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,970
Okay. I'm leaving then.

278
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,680
Call me when you're done with the check-up. I'll pick you up.

279
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,840
And leave the dishes here. I'll clean them after I get off work, okay?

280
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,180
Okay.

281
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,030
- I'm leaving then.
- Okay.

282
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,130
- Be back early.
- Okay.

283
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,560
Bye.

284
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,790
[New City Center, Block B]

285
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,800
It's because I care about you. I don't want you to hate me.

286
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,000
I promised you that I wouldn't be a bad guy again.

287
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,050
I want to keep that promise.

288
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,100
Sister Shuangshuang, do you want to have dinner together?

289
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,500
Sister Shuangshuang!

290
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,400
What's on your mind? I've been talking to you for quite some time.

291
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
What did you say?

292
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,400
I was asking if you'd like to have dinner together.

293
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,390
I have a friend who's got some trouble.

294
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,000
She doesn't know what she should do.

295
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,400
She wants me to give her some suggestions.

296
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay.

297
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,800
What's happening to your friend?

298
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Let's chat over there. Come.

299
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,500
That's the story.

300
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,400
In conclusion, my friend still has feelings for that guy.

301
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,800
But she's not sure if he can correct his mistakes and start anew.

302
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,600
What do you think she should do?

303
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Sister Shuangshuang.

304
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,900
The friend in your story, is it yourself?

305
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,900
And the guy in the story, is it GM Qin?

306
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
How do you know?

307
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
A friend out of nowhere. That's an old trick.

308
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
There's no way I can be deceived.

309
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,600
What's more, the chemistry between you and GM Qin,

310
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm sure anyone can tell!

311
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Don't speak so loud!

312
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Don't tell anyone else.

313
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,600
I won't.

314
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Never mind, since you already know about it,

315
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
what do you think I should do?

316
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I think there's no need to think that much.

317
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,600
I remember that a psychologist once said

318
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,300
that humans have the instinct of telling if a person is good or bad right away.

319
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,200
This is an ability that has developed over the years.

320
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,400
If you want to know if GM Qin is good or bad,

321
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
you can recall your first impression of him.

322
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
First impression?

323
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Especially girls.

324
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,200
I think we girls

325
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,200
are more accurate when we judge with our intuition than rational thinking.

326
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,400
This should be a tabby cat, right?

327
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,000
When I found it, it was really sick.

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Then it must have cost quite a bit to take it to the vet.

329
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,800
Money isn't important. After all, it's a life.

330
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,000
You are quite kind.

331
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,800
This is the first time someone has called me kind.

332
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Why?

333
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,800
That means they don't understand you. I think you are a good person.

334
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,600
You haven't known me for very long, how can you say that I am a good person?

335
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,800
What does a person being good or bad have to do with how long you've known them?

336
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,200
Instead, you should base it upon intuition. My intuition is very accurate.

337
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,600
[Shuangshuang, I'm sorry.]

338
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,200
I think what you said makes sense.

339
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,800
But... there's something that I can't get over.

340
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,600
I don't trust my own judgment.

341
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
I used to believe in my intuition.

342
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,200
But I...

343
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,400
I'm afraid I'll get it wrong again.

344
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
I think...

345
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,400
the question now is not whether you believe in your own judgment,

346
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,700
but whether you're willing to trust him.

347
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Okay. Team Leader Xia, it's your turn now.

348
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
- This time I—
- I'm sorry.

349
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,600
Can I cut in? Can I present first?

350
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm okay with it. Manager Chen can present first.

351
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,600
I went with the direction of beauty products.

352
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,000
The most recommended product is this face mask.

353
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
A lot of effort was put into the ingredients and formula of this face mask.

354
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,200
Not only does it contain

355
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,500
the brightening and antioxidant ingredients that are used by many international brands,

356
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,300
namely Nicotinamide and 1, 2-Pentanediol,

357
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,400
it also contains many natural plant extracts.

358
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
It can inhibit the melanin production of our skin,

359
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,800
and strengthen the immunity and transparency of our skin.

360
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
Manager Chen.

361
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,800
Last week, this face mask

362
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,400
hit the headlines because of the excessive use of preservatives and fluorescein.

363
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,200
Don't you read the news?

364
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,600
Manager Chen, are you the shareholder of this brand?

365
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
You're trying so hard to sell their products on our Evergreen app!

366
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
I don't think she's a shareholder.

367
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,600
But she might be receiving a commission.

368
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,600
- I think Manager Chen must be really embarrassed this time.
- That's right, let's see what will happen.

369
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Manager Chen.

370
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
What's up?

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
I want to ask you something.

372
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Did you find the face mask plan in my file?

373
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm so sorry. It was my negligence at work that made you embarrassed.

374
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You did it on purpose!

375
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
- You...
- I just want to let you know

376
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,800
that the company is not the place for you to play your tricks.

377
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,100
Now that you've decided to work for Evergreen, you should at least stick to professional ethics.

378
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,300
You can't earn your place by stealing other people's work.

379
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,900
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- You...

380
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,520
Did anything happen? Is there something on your mind?

381
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,700
There's one thing indeed.

382
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
It's always been on my mind and I can't get over it.

383
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
What is it?

384
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,300
Didn't you promise me

385
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,600
that you wouldn't do anything bad again

386
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,800
and would become a good guy?

387
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Then why...

388
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,400
did you steal the VIP client information from Evergreen?

389
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,400
If I tell you now, would you believe me?

390
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,000
You can say it first.

391
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,600
I meant everything I said on the rooftop that day.

392
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,900
I really tried to cut my ties with Director Xue.

393
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,220
I really wanted to get rid of my past identity.

394
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,860
So I went to Director Xue and wanted to cut my ties with him.

395
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
He agreed that I could leave,

396
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,800
under the condition that I would do one last thing for him,

397
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,000
which was to steal the VIP client information from Evergreen.

398
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,790
To keep my promise to you

399
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,000
and hoping that I could be with you in the future,

400
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
I agreed to the deal.

401
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,050
It just turned out different from what I thought.

402
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,300
It could be my punishment from the heavens.

403
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,000
It's kind of funny when I come to think of it now. What was I thinking?

404
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,600
Why would I do a bad thing

405
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,400
in order to become a better person?

406
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
I see.

407
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,800
Have some soup.

408
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,020
Do you believe me now?

409
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Is it delicious?

410
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,400
You can enjoy your meal now?

411
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,100
- Are our online and offline promotions all ready?
- All ready.

412
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,970
Make sure to do a final round of online testing.

413
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,330
- Okay, no problem.
- I'll leave it to you, then.

414
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,300
Team Leader Xia, GM Sheng asked you to stop by his office.

415
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,210
Okay, I got it.

416
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,140
Manager Wang!

417
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,230
What is going on?

418
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,130
Can't you see it?

419
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,770
You two aren't observant at all! Can you be more sensitive?

420
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,060
Are they really together?

421
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:43,090
A few days ago, I saw GM Sheng touching Team Leader Xia's hair.

422
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,340
Such a man of action. GM Sheng is impressive!

423
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,400
Get back to your work.

424
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,320
- Ziqing, show me the project from yesterday.
- How come I left mine here?
- I'm giving it back to you.

425
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,120
- I still have a need for it.
- Is it right?

426
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,880
GM Sheng, why are you summoning me during work? What if others find out?

427
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,540
Everyone knows that I'm wooing you, anyway.

428
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,300
It's only natural to abuse my power to see you.

429
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,270
What is it?

430
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,910
Our app will go online tomorrow.

431
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,290
Here is the logo design for it. Take a look.

432
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,470
A little cow? Being cute doesn't seem to be your style.

433
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,780
What's with the "8910" tag?

434
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,900
"8, 9 are always close to 10," don't you remember?

435
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,420
- Personal slip-in?
- Got a problem with that?

436
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,590
Isn't it inappropriate at work?

437
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:06,990
Word just came in. The Evergreen app will also go online at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

438
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,410
GM Qin, should we move up the schedule and release our app earlier?

439
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,430
By now, I don't think it's necessary.

440
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,550
An hour or two ahead doesn't necessarily mean we can dominate the market.

441
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,610
After all, consumers care more about services and products.

442
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,300
Very well, then.

443
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,140
Hey, kitty. You sleep after you have a full stomach.

444
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,490
Thank goodness that he rescued you. Otherwise, we would have never met.

445
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,360
Do you think I should trust him?

446
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,810
Should I trust my intuition?

447
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,520
Okay, got it.

448
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,630
- I'm back.
- You're back.

449
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,350
We don't need to cook today.

450
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,130
I've got some Japanese takeout. A simple dinner.

451
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,010
Sure.

452
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,300
You...

453
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,280
- Wow!
- Yours.

454
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,000
Here.

455
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,990
It's too late for coffee, otherwise you won't sleep.

456
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,460
Are you caring for me?

457
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,050
Do you have something to tell me?

458
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,590
- I want to say—
- Hang on.

459
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,470
Hello?

460
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,790
Okay. I'll see to it. All right.

461
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,330
Langyue plans to get a piece of land in the development zone for the new hotel.

462
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:40,210
So, President Wu wants me to go on a field trip. It might take three to four days.

463
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,470
The dinners for the next few days, I can't eat them with you.

464
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,060
Got it.

465
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,190
By the way, what were you trying to tell me?

466
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,080
Nothing, it can wait until you come back.

467
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,680
Also, drink the milk while it's still warm. It will help you sleep.

468
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,440
Team Leader Xia, how come you are not anxious at all?

469
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,830
We built this app together.

470
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,080
I have faith in our team. It's going to be great.

471
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,670
A moment please, everyone. GM Sheng would like to say a few words.

472
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,660
As we all know, ever since the launch of our app,

473
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,670
the overall downloads and orders have exceeded our expectations.

474
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,310
The back-end has also shown good ratings and positive user feedbacks.

475
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,310
Here, on behalf of Evergreen,

476
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,270
I thank you all.

477
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,270
GM Sheng also prepared some gifts, a gift for everyone.

478
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,680
- Pick one, Manager Wang.
- Thank you.

479
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,180
Here.

480
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,670
You just wait.

481
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,120
Here, ties for guys. Pick one yourself.

482
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,730
Each pick one. Come.

483
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,190
Team Leader Xia, you've done the most work these days,

484
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,010
so we should thank you the most. Thank you.

485
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,390
You are too kind, Manager Wang. These flowers...

486
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,480
Mr. Wang,

487
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,690
the flowers are for you. You shouldn't give them away.

488
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,770
Indeed.

489
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,810
Thank you for your hard work these days.

490
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,930
Thank you, GM Sheng.

491
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,250
How romantic!

492
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,950
- I'll go back to work.
- So envious.

493
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,210
We all worked so hard. Why should she take the most credit?

494
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,900
These baby clothes are so cute!

495
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,680
Look. Which looks better? The pink one

496
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,400
- or the blue one?
- Either will do.

497
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,310
- Gosh! These parent-child outfits are so nice! Look!
- Mengmeng!

498
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,590
You don't actually believe that you are pregnant, do you?

499
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,040
It's just a matter of time.

500
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,210
Don't take it too far. In a few days, you won't be able to fake it.

501
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,000
How nice would it be if the baby were real?

502
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,720
You won't keep this baby anyway. Why not let Xia Qian take the blame?

503
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,590
That way, Brother Zhening will never go to her.

504
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,310
But isn't that going too far?

505
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,590
It is all in your best interest.

506
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,910
Think about it. If it happens, He Zhijuan will be heartbroken.

507
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,210
And he'll be even more devoted to you.

508
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,520
But right now Zhijuan is treating me very well. I don't want him to feel guilty.

509
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,940
- I just want Xia Qian out of my sight quickly.
- Enough!

510
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,280
I've already said what I need to say.

511
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,590
You are both still young. Sooner or later, you will have kids.

512
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,050
Do you still want to be bothered by Xia Qian by then?

513
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,040
Also, the mother's emotions will affect the baby's health.

514
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,930
Okay, I'll listen to you.

515
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,550
Let's eat.

516
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,290
Make a list of the products for sale from the Catering Department, so we can make the selection.

517
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,990
- Noted.
- That'll be all.

518
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,690
- You can go back to work.
- Do you like prawns?

519
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,190
I've had my eyes on these prawns for quite some time.

520
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,580
- You have?
- Super delicious!

521
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,500
How come I set the table for two?

522
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,690
I forgot that he's on a business trip.

523
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,740
Sister Shuangshuang, have you made it clear with GM Qin?

524
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,780
Not yet. He is on a business trip.

525
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,910
You need to hurry up.

526
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,350
Hesitation in romance leads to loss.

527
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,720
Romantic novels over the years tell me,

528
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,640
if the girl hesitates, something will go wrong.

529
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,320
No, no.

530
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,700
When will you be back?

531
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,910
Recall.

532
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,180
Huh? Why did she recall it?

533
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,670
[Old Driver]

534
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,230
- Hello?
- Hello?

535
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,630
Why did you recall the message?

536
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,570
Asking when I will return all of a sudden. Do you miss me?

537
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,900
It's nothing.

538
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,950
I just want to know when you'll come back, so I can buy the groceries.

539
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,300
If everything goes well, I'll be back by the morning in two days.

540
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,500
In two days?

541
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,170
Didn't you say it would be three to four days?

542
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,260
I don't want you to have dinner alone for too long.

543
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,010
Then, I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

544
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,660
Okay!

545
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,190
- Hello?
- Is it the family of Qin Hebo? Mr. Qin has been injured and is at the hospital.

546
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,050
What? Is it serious?
