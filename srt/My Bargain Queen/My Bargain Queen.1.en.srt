This doesn't need to be that complicated, does it?

It's just a reservation.

Sir, I know that most of your banquet halls are fully booked for May.

131
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,040
But I've done some research,

132
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,770
Banquet Hall No.8 has not been reserved for May 15.

133
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,460
We've arranged for re-decoration in Banquet Hall 8 that day.

134
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,350
That's why it's not reserved.

135
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,580
Can we discuss this?

136
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,560
If you postpone the redecoration of Banquet Hall 8 until next month,

137
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,570
I'd be willing to pay double the price to reserve it for May 15.

138

I'm so sorry.

139

I can't make that decision.

140
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,440
This requires GM Sheng's approval

141

The blue Morning Glory flower can't be kept in the sun.

145
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,630
It's wilted because it's been in the sun all morning.

146
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,730
There's no need to water it!

147
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,580
It's withered because of the sun, not because it's too dry.

148
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,690
Is it? How come I can't tell.

149
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,030
Did you not add any base fertilizers at all?

150
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,700
The base fertilizer is really important to the blue Morning Glory.

151
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,920
Didn't expect she would know so much.

152

Can I ask you something? Do you happen to have any idea where GM Sheng is?

Why is she looking for me?

I'll have to ask Anan to check on her.

I'd like to see the head of the departments to discuss

162
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,860
the hotel's purchasing budget for next season.

163
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,800
Director, you just came back from a business trip. Don't you need to take a rest?

164
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm good. Just send the meeting invite.

165
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,690
Brother Hebo!

166
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,490
Zhening.

167
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,550
You must be tired after the business trip.

168
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,380
That's my job.

169
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,030
I've brought a bottle of wine for you. Why don't you come over to my office and have a chat?

170
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,250
Sure. Wait!

171
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,480
That's not the right direction. Your office isn't that way. Come.

172
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,940
Where are we going?

173
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,500
The board of directors decided to have a meeting the other day

174
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,730
to appoint you as the Vice General Manager of Evergreen.

175
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,520
I wanted to give you a surprise.

176
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,320
So I asked the HR Department not to say anything.

177
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,020
How's this?

178
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,850
Is Vice General Manager Qin happy with his new office?

179
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,750
Thank you so much for doing this.

180
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,870
Hey, Brother Hebo. You should join us

181
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,960
in the next board meeting.

182
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,720
We must fight together

183
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,630
in board meetings.

184
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,640
The board of directors is having a lot of meetings these days. Is something wrong?

185
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,720
There's nothing big.

186
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,930
I'm leaving.

187
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,270
Take some food with you.

188
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,830
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.

189
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,910
Are you really planning on waiting for Sheng Zhening at Evergreen?

190
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,770
What else can I do if I want to negotiate with him?

191
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,980
I thought you would be using your “radar” to search for him.

192
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,620
I didn't expect you would just take the easy approach of waiting for him in the lobby.

193
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,990
The easiest way is the most effective.

194
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,520
Do you understand?

195
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,070
Superb.

196
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,150
She's here again.

197
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,060
Ask the security guards in the lobby to keep an eye on her. Do not let her interfere with other guests.

198
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,360
GM Sheng.

199
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,750
I've asked the front desk. This stalker girl has been asking around about you everywhere.

200
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,870
I think that since the last kiss...

201
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,910
Since what happened last time. this stalker girl has been obsessively in love with you.

202
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,560
Now she's been nosing around in the hotel,

203
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,470
I think she‘s going to be pestering you a lot.

204
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,860
But that's not her fault. You are so attractive.

205
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,060
We'll use the basement tunnel. I don't want to see her again.

206
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,760
Got it.

207
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,180
Hello? Is this Manager Wang in charge of the lobby?

208
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,020
Hi, Young Lady.

209
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,760
Young Lady.

210
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,180
Hello. What's the matter?

211
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,820
Here's the thing. GM Sheng usually stays in the hotel.

212
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,910
It's getting late, and he must have gone to sleep.

213
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,310
He won't be coming down to the lobby.

214
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,640
I think maybe you should stop waiting for him at night.

215
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,180
I've been waiting for such a long time. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

216
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,410
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,860
I understand. Thank you.

218
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,500
No worries.

219
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,160
Financial news of the day. Finance Giant Lihe Capital is tapping the market of the hotel industry.

220
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,580
It is expected that the hotels in Jinhai City will undergo a financial storm.

221
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,640
Evergreen Hotel, as the biggest high-end hotel brand in Jinhai City, will be at the center of the storm.

222
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,660
I've heard some news that

223
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,080
Lihe Capital is planning to acquire Evergreen.

224
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,930
What do you think?

225
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,890
As far as I know, Lihe Capital is quite dominating.

226
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,770
No matter who they acquire, they'll always have two requirements.

227
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,560
For those companies that agree to be acquired, they'll offer a good price.

228
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,690
But for those who believe that they are doing a hostile takeover

229
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,010
and who would fight with their back against the wall, it's a different price.

230
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,900
These two prices are very different.

231
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,760
So I think we should officially meet with them.

232
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,290
Know our enemies and have two sets of plans.

233
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,320
If the day comes that they have to acquire us, then at least

234
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,290
we can fight for a good price for Evergreen.

235
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,510
Shareholders,

236
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,410
there's a document in front of you.

237
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,050
You all have a copy.

238
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,260
It includes Evergreen's quarterly revenue

239
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,460
and pre-IPO assessment report.

240
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,370
In the past few years, Evergreen has always performed well.

241
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,300
GM Sheng has been busy preparing for the IPO.

242
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,480
Honestly, I think Evergreen's got a really good prospect.

243
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,690
- At this point in time, why should we be discussing being acquired?
- I agree.

244
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,420
We should look at the long-term goal.

245
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,300
I don't agree either. If new investors come in,

246
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,940
the quality of Evergreen's service cannot be guaranteed.

247
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,500
It will harm Evergreen's good reputation that we've built over the years.

248
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,320
Since everyone is so confident,

249
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,400
there's more reason for me to bring Evergreen to a better future.

250
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,300
Then we'll leave the discussion about being acquired. Meeting adjourned.

251
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
- Okay.
- We'll leave it there then.

252
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,610
I've mentioned being acquired to the board as you suggested. But that didn't work out well.

253
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,990
That's fine. We were just trying to see how they would react.

254
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,970
I'll follow up with some other arrangements.

255
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,080
I've still got 3% of the shares.

256
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,900
When do you plan to transfer them, Vice GM Qin?

257
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,490
Don't worry about it. I'll entrust someone to hold the shares.

258
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,590
The price will remain the same as we negotiated earlier.

259
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,380
I'll ask them to deal with it as soon as possible.

260
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,070
Okay, Vice GM Qin.

261
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,020
Thanks, Director Lin.

262
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,390
[Qin Hebo, Vice General Manager]

263
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,420
Ms. Xia, I've reported to GM Sheng. It's not that we don't want to accept the reservation,

264
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,400
but because Banquet Hall 8 is indeed not available for now.

265
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,790
We're upgrading the multimedia equipment, but we haven't agreed to a price with the vendors yet.

266
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,370
That's why re-decoration has been delayed so much.

267
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,910
You've been asking about it every day. But there's really nothing I can do about it.

268
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,170
[The Banquet's Concept]

269
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,530
Sister Qian!

270
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,980
You're here so early!

271
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,770
You're here!

272
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,860
Hey, get some coffee for me, please.

273
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,250
You're doing research on Evergreen again?

274
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,960
You've almost become an expert on Evergreen's history just for the sake of the reservation, haven't you?

275
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
What else can I do? I'm almost done.

276
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,150
Clean up for me. I'll go upstairs.

277
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,690
Thank you.

278
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,470
- Oh.
- Hey.

279
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,650
You're the love-struck stalker girl!

280
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,090
It's you. The footman!

281
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,620
How could you call me a footman?

282
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,010
- Why do you call me a love-struck girl?
- You’ve got some suspicious thoughts on GM Sheng.

283
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,650
What else should I call you other than a stalker?

284
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,920
I have suspicious thoughts on GM Sheng? What do you mean?

285
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,730
You were clinging on to him in the bus station that day,

286
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,200
and you've been blocking the front gate of Evergreen,

287
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,230
asking around about GM Sheng.

288
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,100
What do you want? To be honest,

289
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,500
GM Sheng has a lot of admirers.

290
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,530
But there's no one as obsessive as you

291
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,960
and acting like a stalker.

292
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,270
Well, there's no reason for me to be obsessive and stalking GM Sheng.

293
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,380
But it's true that I've been waiting for GM Sheng.

294
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,340
Hello?

295
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,090
Security?

296
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,040
Young Lady, we asked you to leave.

297
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,090
- Why?
- Leave right now.

298
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,740
What did I do? Why do I have to leave?

299
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,260
GM Sheng.

300
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,230
It's a misunderstanding. It's all a misunderstanding

301
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,130
I've invited Miss Xia to come over. She's not a love-struck stalker. It's a misunderstanding.

302
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,100
A misunderstanding?

303
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,830
Do you remember the girl who had a wedding in our hotel two years ago?

304
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,950
Whose fiancé ran away?

305
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,130
And you falsely blamed her for ringing the alarm in our hotel.

306
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,490
GM Sheng,

307
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,650
someone rang the alarm.

308
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,690
He Zhijuan! Stop!

309
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,660
Oops. Sorry! Sorry!

310
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,320
He Zhijuan!

311
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,760
Thank you.

312
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,570
He Zhijuan!

313
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,790
What are you doing?

314
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,560
What are you doing!

315
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,650
You pressed the button for the alarm just now.

316
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,680
All the hotel guests panicked. Please come to the security room with me.

317
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,800
I've got something urgent to deal with!

318
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,240
I saw what happened, the "something urgent."

319
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,350
But who will bear the loss of the hotel?

320
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,250
Who will bear my loss if you stop me right now?

321
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,620
- I'll deal with it when I come back.
- Please be cooperative.

322
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,550
Go away!

323
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,110
GM Sheng, the security department got the result.

324
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,910
Nobody pressed the alarm. The alarm rang because of circuit problems.

325
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,540
We blamed the wrong person.

326
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,420
Is she still in the hotel?

327
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,310
She has left already.

328
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,150
It's her?

329
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,700
Yeah. We should ask the security to let her go.

330
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,770
Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

331
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,750
Brothers, will you kindly let me in, please?

332
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,790
I really do have an appointment with GM Sheng.

333
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,990
I've brought all my materials. It's a very important matter.

334
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,920
- Can you just help?
- What are you guys doing?

335
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,420
Show some respect!

336
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,180
Miss Xia, I'm sorry. They should have been more thoughtful.

337
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,810
GM Sheng has invited you to come upstairs for a conversation. Shall we go?

338
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,450
Sure.

339
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,580
What happened to your feet?

340
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you okay?

341
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.

342
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,490
It's okay.

343
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,560
Would you like anything to drink?

344
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,160
No, I'm good. Thank you, GM Sheng.

345
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,000
I heard from Anan that you were asking to see me

346
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,070
because you want to make a wedding reservation in May?

347
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,880
Yes.

348
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
This is my business card.

349
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,270
Here's the thing.

350
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,720
One of my clients wants to get married in your hotel in May.

351
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,640
I know that all the banquet halls are fully booked in May.

352
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,150
But I've also found out that Banquet Hall 8 is not reserved for May 15.

353
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,850
But here's the problem.

354
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,510
Banquet Hall 8 actually

355
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,640
needs renovation. That's why it's not open to the public.

356
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,260
The reason why the renovation has not been finished in Banquet Hall 8,

357
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,230
as I understand, is because you haven't reached an agreement on the price of purchasing equipment with the vendor.

358
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,410
I can provide bargaining service for you for free,

359
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,630
so that you can purchase the equipment as soon as possible,

360
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,260
and that the renovation can be finished as soon as possible.

361
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,630
Here.

362
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,820
This is a price comparison report based on what you need.

363
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,760
Okay. I'll take a look at it later on.

364
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,830
I'll let you know in a few days.

365
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,390
Great.

366
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,680
I'll be on my way then.

367
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,520
Are you okay?

368
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,260
I'm fine. I sprained my ankle downstairs.

369
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,220
Just a moment. Anan!

370
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,150
Give her a lift.

371
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,250
Please come with me, Miss Xia.

372
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,690
Thank you, GM Sheng

373
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,840
[Equipment Price Comparison Report for Banquet Hall 8 at Evergreen Hotel]

374
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,230
This is a very interesting report.

375
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,700
It's logical and well-organized.

376
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,260
She compared the hotel's must-haves with

377
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,490
the functions of the products,

378
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,220
picked out some expensive but not useful products.

379
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,770
She is indeed taking a more flexible approach than our Procurement Department.

380
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,800
I think it's pretty good, too.

381
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,470
Maybe we should hire her. We need someone like her in the Procurement Department.

382
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,050
She's got her own business to run.

383
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,780
You didn't show this to me just for me to give some comments, right?

384
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,670
Makes sense.

385
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,110
I'd like her to take on the equipment orders for Banquet Hall 8.

386
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,980
Let's see if the price comparison report is military tactics on paper. (TN: idiom meaning "knowing what to do but not being able to do it well in real life")

387
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,790
Mom, you should go to bed early after you finish.

388
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,480
- I'm leaving.
- Sure.

389
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,320
Hey, wait a moment!

390
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,840
Take this.

391
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,740
Take it back. Why do you give it to me? I've got money.

392
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,000
What money?

393
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,140
You think I have no idea how much money you have?

394
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,420
Last month you even sold your car! Tell me.

395
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,400
What are you planning on selling this month?

396
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,770
I sold my car and I can take a walk every day. Isn't that nice?

397
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,220
Exercise keeps me healthy.

398
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,410
Forget about it! Don't pretend to be rich. Just take it.

399
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,640
Right! I don't mean to blame you,

400
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,220
but there's a lot of jobs that a girl can do.

401
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,870
And you chose to open a "bargaining company"

402
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,050
and become a bargainer. Do you know what the relatives and neighbors are saying?

403
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,400
They asked what your job is exactly,

404
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,310
and I fail to explain it every time!

405
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,810
Well, go ahead.

406
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,970
You have to make it clear to me exactly about what you are doing.

407
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,780
Tell me.

408
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,040
I'll explain it to you.

409
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
Look at the meat skewer.

410
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,750
You sell it at 5 yuan to everybody else. But if I'm here, you have to sell it to me at 3 yuan.

411
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,230
And you have to give me a potato skewer for free.

412
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,870
Sell it to you for 3 yuan with a free potato skewer?

413
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,290
Why? You're not their relative.

414
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,100
I earn it with my ability.

415
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,300
A bargainer does the most difficult thing with the least amount of money.

416
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
It's okay. If I can't survive one day,

417
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
I'll take over our family business,

418
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,660
and expand the business of the Liping Barbecue House!

419
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,000
Put down your hand!

420
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,040
When can you start a serious career?

421
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,030
When can you get yourself married?

422
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,910
Qianqian!

423
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,420
Uncle Hu!

424
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,090
This is for you to take home. A late-night snack.

425
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm so hungry!

426
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,610
I'll take it home!

427
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,350
I'll be going. Thank you, Uncle Hu!

428
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,180
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom!

429
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,170
Oh my god.

430
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,360
You really treat her well.

431
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Let's clean up.

432
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,920
That child...

433
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,080
GM Sheng, Miss Xia is here.

434
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,050
GM Sheng.

435
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,490
I'm here to watch

436
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,910
how you bargain.

437
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,830
I won't hinder your performance, right?

438
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,950
Of course not. GM Sheng, you don't need to worry about it.

439
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,910
Miss Xia, I really can't offer you a price like that.

440
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,900
This multimedia projection equipment has a new Bluetooth function.

441
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,410
It is very convenient.

442
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,420
Please think it over.

443
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,860
Manager Ma, I'll cut to the chase.

444
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,050
The Bluetooth function on your equipment is useless.

445
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,870
What's the point of having Bluetooth?

446
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,210
To make it easy to connect to external speakers.

447
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,930
But the Bluetooth function of your equipment is so unreliable.

448
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,480
It often disconnects automatically. A lot of consumers

449
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,890
have commented on this on your product page.

450
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,470
I don't know if Manager Ma has read that.

451
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,000
As far as I know, in three month's time,

452
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,980
you'll be releasing a new projection product.

453
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,140
The new product has an increased luminous flux of 15,000 lm.

454
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,590
But the price is not going to increase a lot.

455
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,170
Customers would always want to buy newer products instead of older ones.

456
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,220
You will definitely lower the price for this equipment by then.

457
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,690
The price I'm offering right now,

458
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,820
must be higher than what you sell for after the new product is released.

459
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,200
GM Sheng, please don't make it difficult for me.

460
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,070
Evergreen is a big company. There's no need to bargain over such a small amount with me.

461
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,680
Manager Ma,

462
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,330
that's a little out of line now. What do you mean?

463
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,760
Is Evergreen's money not money either? Did it get blown here along with the wind?

464
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
Evergreen is your customer.

465
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,470
Customers have the right to buy what they want at a reasonable price.

466
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,100
Isn't that true?

467
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,290
Nevermind.

468
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,530
GM Sheng, since Manager Ma is already in a difficult position,

469
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,780
we'll think it over again.

470
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,310
I think we can wait for three months.

471
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,320
We can buy it then as well.

472
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,640
True. I think we can wait for now.

473
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay, okay. I'll just make a deal with Evergreen

474
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,690
at the price that Miss Xia offered.

475
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,700
This is the cheapest price I've ever agreed to.

476
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,670
Please don't tell anyone else.

477
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,620
Rest assured, Manager Ma. We'll keep it confidential.

478
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,210
Then I'll be going, GM Sheng.

479
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,730
GM Sheng.

480
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,460
I closed the deal.

481
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,920
Not bad, Miss Xia.

482
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,090
Our Procurement Department has been trying for months but failed

483
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,130
and you nailed it in half an hour.

484
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,110
Well, it's nothing complicated.

485
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,310
Bargaining is a game of mind and information.

486
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,820
It'll be easy as long as you know all their cards.

487
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,750
GM Sheng, I've noted it all down.

488
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,730
GM Sheng, you still have two orders to make.

489
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,730
If I can get a reasonable price for you,

490
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,840
you'll reserve the banquet hall for me in May?

491
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
Yes.

492
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,620
Get the contracts ready and wait for the good news!

493
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,480
It's here.

494
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,540
- What do you think?
- I think it's great.

495
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,320
Great. Shall we sign our names?

496
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,860
Check and confirm it.

497
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
Done!

498
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,420
Miss Xia has successfully gotten us the contracts

499
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,260
for the telecommunication equipment and fresh air system.

500
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,100
The price is much lower than we expected.

501
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,550
She saved a lot of money for us.

502
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,080
Why doesn't she eat in the cafeteria?

503
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,100
Maybe she wants to save money.

504
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,800
And she has a meeting with the sales agent of Xinyuan Technology

505
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,750
at 2:00 p.m., on behalf of our company.

506
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,690
I think she wants to save time, too.

507
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,860
Make some arrangements.

508
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,060
Miss Xia, this is your employee meal.

509
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,560
Employee mean? What's that?

510
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,400
GM Sheng said that you are now an employee of Evergreen.

511
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,480
So, of course, there's an employee meal for you.

512
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,450
Why don't you have a try?

513
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,660
Sure. Thank you?

514
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,800
Such a fancy meal for Evergreen employees.

515
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,190
Of course not.

516
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,610
GM Sheng asked for it.

517
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Say thank you to GM Sheng for me.

518
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,580
Enjoy your meal.

519
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Yeah, it went well today.

520
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,900
I'll be visiting Xinyuan Technology tomorrow

521
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,690
to meet with their director.

522
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,570
I think we can get the contract signed after that.

523
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,110
If that goes well, I think we can get Ning Meng's contract done the day after tomorrow.

524
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,860
You offered two bargain services to Evergreen for free

525
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,570
just to close this one contract.

526
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,570
Losing two, winning one.

527
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,710
Isn't that too much of a sacrifice?

528
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,210
It's okay.

529
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,170
It would be a nice thing to help Ning Meng get the wedding reservation.

530
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,790
Miss Xia, you're amazing!

531
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,170
Well, it's not just my own effort.

532
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,050
I think it's because I'm lucky.

533
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,240
Evergreen just happened to have a need for bargaining services; otherwise, it wouldn't have gone so well.

534
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,510
But that's also because you're such a great bargainer!

535
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,200
I am really grateful to you, Miss Xia.

536
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,540
In fact, none of my family members support me in getting married.

537
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,530
You're the only one who's always helping me,

538
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,380
and I can feel

539
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,460
that you're not just doing this because it's your job.

540
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,400
You really want to help me achieve my dream wedding in Evergreen.

541
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,890
I'll be honest with you,

542
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,100
you remind me of myself back when I got engaged.

543
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,670
Of course, I'd wish you happy.

544
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,880
Engaged?

545
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,130
You got engaged at Evergreen, too?

546
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,880
Yes.

547
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,000
Then, what happened afterward?

548
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,690
Well,

549
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,170
of course it didn't work out.

550
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,620
That bastard...

551
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,140
just disappeared, and I was never able to find him again.

552
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,990
That's crazy!

553
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,250
- What a bastard!
- For sure!

554
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,150
Miss Xia, he's so unfortunate to have lost you.

555
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,390
- Excuse me, I have to answer a call.
- Sure.

556
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,910
Hello, darling.

557
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,130
You're here!

558
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm upstairs.

559
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,720
Okay. I'll be there right away.

560
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,590
Darling! I'm here!
