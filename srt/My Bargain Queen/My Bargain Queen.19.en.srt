[Episode 19]

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,950
You already have 10% of Evergreen's shares.

4
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,220
According to the agreement from before, I have completed my task.

5
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,120
Now I want to quit.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,090
Quit?

7
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,400
Will Director Xue really make Qin Hebo

8
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,380
go to Director Gao's office to steal the information?

9
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,900
If he intends to destroy Evergreen's reputation,

10
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,530
leaking VIP information is the best method.

11
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,210
Are you planning on having

12
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,300
Anan wait there to catch Qin Hebo in the act?

13
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,200
I plan to go myself.

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,740
Zhening, I will go with you.

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,010
Zhening, you really don't want it to be Qin Hebo, do you?

16
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,120
Of course not.

17
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,490
If it's him, all of the good impressions I had of him

18
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,960
will all be shattered.

19
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,020
Sisters, today I will be recommending

20
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,670
a very useful facial mask.

21
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,510
Facial mask.

22
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,700
Yes, it's this one. A moisturizing facial mask.

23
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,070
Not only is it good, but it is also affordable.

24
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,890
Everyone...

25
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,610
It seems like he won't be coming.

26
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, the precious product you have been waiting for is about to be available for sale.

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,530
Let's count down together. Three...

28
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,430
Two...

29
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,910
It's available!

30
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,490
Thank you.

31
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,390
I asked a friend once

32
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,820
if someone who did a bad thing

33
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,320
can still become a good person?

34
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,530
Today, you answered that question.

35
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,400
Because you gave me the Evergreen's May wedding list,

36
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,860
I owed you a favor.

37
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,960
Today, I have paid you back.

38
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,630
- Shuangshuang—
- Don't explain anything else.

39
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't care about your explanation.

40
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,620
We met here.

41
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,090
Ending it here is pretty nice.

42
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,530
We had a beginning and an end.

43
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,230
- Shuangshuang—
- Let go

44
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,840
- Let go of me!
- Shuangshuang!

45
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,360
Let go of me!

46
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,550
Haven't you asked me before

47
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,660
if you hadn't done bad things, would we be together?

48
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,130
I really want to believe you.

49
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,050
I really want to believe that everything you said was true.

50
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,700
But ask yourself, can you do it?

51
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,600
Can you let go of everything you have now?

52
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,230
Can you let go of who you once were?

53
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,000
If you can't,

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,320
how can you say it will get better?

55
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,600
Things like this would have never happened.

56
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,660
This situation, I don't know how to explain.

57
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,880
- But can you give me another chance?
- What other chance can I still give you?

58
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,500
Qin Hebo, because I like you,

59
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,730
I hurt my most important friend.

60
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,780
Because I like you, I have become bad.

61
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,830
I am now a bad person.

62
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,050
The price for liking you is too high.

63
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,670
I don't want this to continue.

64
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
I do like you,

65
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,160
but I hate myself! I hate myself for being like this.

66
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,310
You're back?

67
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,290
What's wrong?

68
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,270
My stomach was a bit upset, so I went to get some medicine.

69
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,770
Okay, go to bed early.

70
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,080
Go home early.

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,900
You worked hard.

72
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,450
[Director Xue]

73
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,680
I am sorry.

74
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,400
Last night, it was me who told Qin Hebo.

75
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,590
In fact, I am a spy.

76
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,690
I don't even know Qin Hebo.

77
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,770
I made it all up.

78
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,840
My goal is to actually

79
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,810
- steal something from him.
- I am also a spy.

80
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,460
What are you spying?

81
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,800
My goal is to take over the entire Evergreen Hotel.

82
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,300
Forget it. Just take it as if I never said anything.

83
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,730
I just wanted to give him a chance,

84
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,710
and believe he could be good. But...

85
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,570
I am sorry, it is all my fault.

86
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,460
I wronged you.

87
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,960
I wronged you.

88
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,590
It already happened.

89
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,420
I was worried that you would get hurt.

90
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,120
Shuangshuang, I heard a saying that I think is really good.

91
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
It says, "Why do people make mistakes?"

92
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,510
Everyone makes mistakes.

93
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,930
That is why pencils have erasers.

94
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,340
It has already happened, what else can you do? Just bravely face it.

95
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,780
Don't be so sad. Give yourself a choice and opportunity to change.

96
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,720
Think it over.

97
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,390
I understand if you want some time to yourself.

98
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,120
But you need to think about when you will return.

99
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,480
Worth or Not needs you.

100
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,110
Thank you, Qianqian

101
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
Between us, we don't need to say thanks.

102
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,220
You don't need to knock. The girl who lives there returned to her hometown.

103
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,390
GM Sheng, Qin Hebo has turned in a resignation letter to the board of directors.

104
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,880
This is the resignation document that HR needs you to sign.

105
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,000
[Qin Hebo]

106
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,440
Emily,

107
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,480
after I leave, you cannot stay at Evergreen.

108
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,610
I have found a job for you that is at the same level as your job here.

109
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,110
Can I continue to follow you?

110
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,430
I want to take a break. You should continue to work hard.

111
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,240
Let me help you pack up your things.

112
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,680
I don't have anything to pack up.

113
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,480
You can go.

114
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,710
Okay.

115
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,140
How's this? Are you satisfied, Vice GM Qin?

116
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,600
Thank you so much for doing this.

117
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,940
You should join us in the next board meeting, Brother Hebo

118
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,190
As brothers we must stand and fight together

119
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,500
in board meetings.

120
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,360
I handmade this.

121
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,990
Congratulations on your promotion, Brother Hebo!

122
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,430
Why?

123
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,950
You wanted money? Or the position of general manager at Evergreen?

124
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,340
The shares of Evergreen?

125
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,210
I don't understand. How much money did Director Xue give you

126
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,070
that you even ruined Mengmeng's wedding?

127
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,770
Haven't you always thought of her as a biological sister?

128
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,990
Was that also all an act?

129
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,820
I let down you and Mengmeng.

130
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,020
I am sorry.

131
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,970
I just want an explanation.

132
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,110
I can forget about everything else.

133
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,710
I don't have anything to explain.

134
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,670
I also don't need your forgiveness.

135
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,260
Tell Mengmeng goodbye for me.

136
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,370
I did not tell her about what you did.

137
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,280
I don't want her to know that you are this type of person.

138
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,390
But starting today,

139
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,240
we have no connections.

140
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,750
That's fair.

141
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,970
Sister Qian, I brought you a juice.

142
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,590
Thanks.

143
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,970
Are you still thinking about Sister Shuangshuang?

144
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,200
- How do you know?
- The entire day you have not been in work mode.

145
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,010
You even called Xiao Ai, Shuangshuang earlier today.

146
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,420
Yeah, it's just...

147
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,960
weird without her. I am not used to it. I miss her.

148
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,140
I know you are used to always having her by your side.

149
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,030
Since she left so suddenly, you must feel uneasy.

150
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,030
But don't worry,

151
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,290
she is just figuring out her own emotions. It might take some time.

152
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,360
She'll be back soon.

153
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,510
Mu Xiaoyan, what's wrong?

154
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,670
When did you become so considerate?

155
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,010
I've always been considerate,

156
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,430
but you never noticed before.

157
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,330
You are usually like this.

158
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,260
Really?

159
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,220
Yeah, we should trust Shuangshuang.

160
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,280
She will come back.

161
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,910
Hebo.

162
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,380
Let's get in my car.

163
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:09,290
There's no need. We can talk right here, no need to hide.

164
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,050
Honestly, I have always admired you.

165
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,140
I believe as long as we are allies,

166
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,180
Evergreen will soon be ours.

167
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,670
But I did not expect that you would let go of such a big opportunity.

168
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,620
You disappointed me a little.

169
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,470
At the time, I did agree to help you acquire Evergreen

170
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,920
as a favor. Everything else didn't matter.

171
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,680
But maybe you have forgotten.

172
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,860
When my startup failed and I went to Lihe Capital for an investment,

173
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,860
I was turned away many times until...

175
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,110
I am so sorry.

176
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,090
It's okay.

177
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,600
Young man,

178
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,160
are you sure you want to wear that going in?

179
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,780
I have some clothes. If you don't mind, you can borrow them.

180
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,620
Thank you.

181
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,670
Thank you.

182
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,380
Thank you so much. I am sorry for bothering you.

183
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,770
How was it?

184
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,470
They agreed to consider my proposal. Thank you for lending me these clothes.

185
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,030
Honestly, I have been observing you for a while. You have been coming here continuously for a month.

186
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,010
Many people after being turned away one or two times will give up.

187
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,810
But I noticed that you have a lot of perseverance.

188
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,460
This is my first time seeing this type of spirit.

189
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,780
It's because I believe they will like my proposal.

190
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,470
Then, why do you think they always refuse you?

191
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,450
People sometimes just need to dress up a bit more.

192
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,830
Young man, would you consider working at Lihe Capital?

193
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,420
Are you being serious?

194
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,020
Yes.

195
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,060
Later you lent me some clothes and a job opportunity.

196
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,960
I am incredibly thankful. But compared to what you have given me,

197
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,440
now, I may be losing more.

198
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,620
If there is nothing else, I will take my leave.

199
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,420
Shuangshuang has always liked Qin Hebo.

200
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,660
That is why she gave him a heads up.

201
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,090
That's not important. Qin Hebo has now left Evergreen.

202
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,230
Then, do you want me to stay with you?

203
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,230
It's okay. You don't have to worry about me.

204
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,280
Well, when you have different values,

205
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,340
it's hard to be friends with someone.

206
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,420
Maybe him leaving is a beneficial thing for both of you.

207
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,700
Yes, I understand.

208
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,360
Even though Qin Hebo has left Evegreen,

209
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,830
Lihe Capital has already infiltrated Evergreen's inner circle.

210
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,500
Soon they will send a shareholder representative to Evergreen.

211
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,380
The next opponent will soon arrive.

212
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,240
Just use the most appropriate strategy.

213
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,570
Together, husband and wife are unstoppable.

214

Hey, who is your wife?

Sister Qian, here is this week's customer data analysis.

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
Okay, I'll have a look.

217
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,950
There is an interesting consumer called Lele's Dad.

218
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,120
The name is pronounced Yueyue, their profile is a guitar.
(T/N: the character "le" can also be pronounced "yue" meaning music)

219
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,390
Looking at this Lele's Dad's ID, they should be male.

220
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,120
He bought all of the shampoo,

221
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
facial masks, baby toys that we recommended in our stream.

222
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,160
Everyone thinks they are an amazing dad

223
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,730

What's wrong? What's on your mind?

227
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,320
I'm thinking of my dad.

228
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,860
I don't think you've ever mentioned your dad to me.

229
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,790
Because there's really nothing much to talk about.

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,710
If you don't mind, you can talk to me about him.

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,850
He was a member of a band.

232
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,670
Although he knew he was just the backup player,

233
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,090
he cherished every opportunity to be on the stage.

234
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,710
When he didn't have to perform, he was also in charge of running errands.

235
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,520
Hey!

Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll go buy it now.

No problem!

see me perform on a stage like this!

or Lele.

My dad liked to call me Yueyue,

258
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
hoping that I would love music as much as he does

259
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,370
and become a musician.

Well, my guitar was broken.

You have to make it clear today.

And he left us.

I really tried my best to avoid this.

I never thought we'd still have to face each other.

298

Lihe Capital is well aware of your capabilities.

And she's very capable too.

It's getting very tricky.

Why do you sound like you're more worried than I am?

307

It's okay, I can handle it.

Hello. Are you looking for me?

Your dad is looking for you.

Miss Qi booked the presidential suite of our hotel.

317
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,340
Seems like she's going to stay here for the long term.

318
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,470
From today on, you should pay close attention to everything she does

319
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,070
and let me know in time.

320
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,570
Got it.

321
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,990

The old apartment contract expired.

323

He didn't have money to renew it,

324
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,420
so he had to get by here.

325
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,590
He...

326
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,110
What happened to him?

327
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,090
Your dad had a brain tumor.

328
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,360
The surgery was very dangerous, but he insisted on doing it.

329
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,740
