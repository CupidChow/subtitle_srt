Hubby, do you remember what Xia Qian likes to eat?

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,220
No, not really. I'm not sure.

5
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,800
Then, I will prepare a few extra dishes.

Sure. I will help you, too.

Hey, Zhijuan. I used to see you carry this book around a lot.

20

You haven't really read it recently.

Oh, this book is too basic. We don't need to bring it.

Thank you for your hard work.

This face mask is very soft.

It is 100 times softer than the normal face masks.

It's like jello, super bouncy and smooth.

No worries. If you don't have any idea what I said,

31
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,060
then buy it and put it on at home to really experience it.

Originally, I was pretty worried. I didn't expect that you would livestream so soon on your own.

35
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm not a child. People have to grow up.

I think it looks good.

- It's okay.

- Mengmeng.
- What? I'm just curious.

This... It has been a while, I don't really remember.

Were there any you knew, Sister Xia?

This is his business. How would I know?

I feel uneasy.

You still can't forget her, can you?

67
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,730
Mengmeng, you are overthinking.

Then tell me what this is.

Haven't you told me you would completely erase her from your life?

What is this picture? And the grape juice?

73

What else can you not forget about her?

- Mengmeng.
- Let go of me!

You shouldn't remember what she likes to eat.

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,930
You shouldn't have kept her photo. Why?

77
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,430
Hubby, haven't you promised me that you would only love me?

78
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,630
You shouldn't remember anything about her.

79
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,450
Zhijuan, you tell me the truth.

80
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,820
If you can't forget her, why would you agree to marry me?

81
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,970
Ning Meng,

82
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,090
Are you not clear about the reason we got married?

83
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Zhijuan.

84
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,490
If you don't come right now, you will never see me again.

85
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,550
Ning Meng, don't do anything stupid.

86
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,200
I won't get engaged, I will go there right now.

87
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,950
Don't go. He Zhijuan.

88
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,750
For this long, I tried my best to take care of my emotions and be a good husband.

89
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,860
But I am also a human. I need my own career and work.

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,480
I am not a love robot that only revolves around you every day.

91

Why is Xia Qian always in between us?

92
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,190
Is it that I can't forget or is it that you can't forget?

93
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,550
I think Ning Meng is upset.

94
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,620
She seems like she is suppressing her emotions.

95
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,670
It's better to avoid contact in the future.

Are you free tomorrow? Let's grab a coffee together.

100
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,590
Okay.

101
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,210
When you started dating He Zhijuan, we were worried about it.

102
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,850
We don't really know him.

103
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,300
But He Zhijuan is a good husband indeed. We've all seen that.

104
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,490
But that Xia Qian, how long has she known Brother Zhening?

105
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,830
How is it possible that Brother Zhening knows her completely?

106
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,480
I don't know either.

107
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
I think Brother Zhening was quite cautious before. Why is he so perfunctory this time?

108
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,930
Don't be so upset. We can go take a stroll and relax.

109
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,060
How can I still have the mood for a stroll?

110
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,320
All I'm thinking about is, how I should face my brother in the future.

111
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,340
If he brings Xia Qian along when we get together, I'll collapse.

112
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,090
Then... what do you plan to do?

113
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,140
I don't know.

114
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,320
Anyway, Xia Qian is like a time bomb. I can't let her stay with my brother.

115
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,190
If you want her to leave, I have an idea.

116
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,730
Song Yu is a ladies' man. There's no girl that he can't get.

117
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,720
We can have him approach Xia Qian,

118
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,390
so that Xia Qian will leave Brother Zhening.

119
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:43,170
With a boyfriend like my brother, how could she easily fall in love with other guys?

120
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,170
There're always problems between every couple. If we hit it spot-on,

121
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,920
the most loving couples can be split apart.

122
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,340
Is that really possible?

I've been quite busy, too. Can you ask your assistant to do it?

He's busy, too. He's working outside now.

Well,

139
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,390
what kind of clothes do you need?

140
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,220
You can decide, just get the suits I usually wear.

141
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,150
No...

142
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,440
Seriously?

143
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,790
Let me introduce my company to you, Miss Xia.

144
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,490
Our company focuses on high-tech toys for children.

145
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,630
The reason why we've decided to promote the products on your livestream channel

146
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,410
is because we've seen Miss Xia promote children's products on your channel.

147
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,700
And we think you have a loving heart and understand children's products very well.

148
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,020
Well, thank you, GM Song. I am flattered.

149
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,660
Why do we have to do children's toys?

150
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,250
The reason that we sell children's toys

151
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,810
is because of my child.

152
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,020
You have a child already?

153
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,580
Your child must be very happy to have a father like you.

154
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,920
Well, I'm not really a good father.

155
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm divorced.

156
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't know that you have a story like that, GM Song.

157
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,260
It's in the past.

158
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,930
GM Song, I'd like to know the price of your products.

159
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:44,300
Miss Xia, don't worry about the price. I'll provide the products to you at cost.

160
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,140
Then, how does your company make profit?

161
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,800
Apart from this company, I run other businesses too.

162
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,320
And they've all been very profitable over these years.

163
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,620
We created this product not because we want to make money.

164
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,210
To put it in an idealistic way, our goal is to create happy childhood memories for children.

165
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,110
Yes, you are absolutely right.

166
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,080
What do you think?

167
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,000
I think it sounds like a good plan. What about you?

168
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm not sure.

169
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,590
Maybe we can just stick to the plan for now.

170
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,030
Great.

171
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,560
Thank you so much, GM Song.

172
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,630
But we have to try your product before we can respond to your request.

173
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,170
No problem. We hope to work with you soon, Miss Xia.

174
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,050
I look forward to working with you, too. This way.

175
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,800
- See you!
- See you.

176
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,190
How was it?

177
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,700
Don't worry about it. She must be pretty impressed with me.

178
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,820
Sister Qian, what do you think of Song Yu just now?

179
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,010
In what aspect? He's just a client.

180
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,090
But I think he's very attractive. He's handsome and rich.

181
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,620
And he's got a loving heart. He's the ideal boyfriend for me.

182
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,000
You're exaggerating.

183
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,270
I don't care that you've fallen off. I won't sew it for him.

184
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,340
You just lie down there.

185
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,500
Hey, you're here.

186
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,150
I just picked out two random suits that you often wear. Do they work?

187
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,860
Why did you choose this one? The button for this one is... Oh.

188
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,200
I thought the button was loose.

189
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,580
What? The button was very tight on the jacket when I took it.

190
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,110
No. It must be a different one.

191
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,210
Okay.

192
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,420
Nice needlework.

193
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,040
I'll give you this one, too.

194
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,790
If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way.

195
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,560
Hey, wait a moment.

196
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,010
Take a seat first.

197
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,170
Well, do you need me for anything?

198
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,820
Look at the food over there.

199
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,580
My assistant prepared it.

200
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,630
Your assistant?

201
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,570
Yeah.

202
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,140
I thought your assistant was very busy.

203
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,030
How did he have time for this?

204
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,660
He was busy picking up cakes from different shops.

205
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,460
He was picking up food.

206
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,070
Have a seat.

207
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,400
Have some food first. I'll send you back when you're done.

208
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,530
I canceled the live streaming today in order to bring your clothes.

209
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,910
I know you've been tired recently.

210
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,390
In fact, you can relax once in a while.

211
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,790
- Okay.
- Have some cake.

212
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,330
Here.

213
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,550
Taste it.

214
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,090
Okay.

215
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,480
Would you like to have some?

216
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,290
They are all yours.

217
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm still losing weight.

218
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,260
Hubby, you're back. Wash your hands. Dinner's ready.

219
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,920
Hubby, I know that there have been problems between us these days.

220
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,530
But don't worry about it. I believe we can fix it soon.

221
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,430
Go wash your hands.

222
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,930
Okay.

223
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,220
In the first few days, the number of viewers and readers increased.

224
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,190
But then it became stable.

225
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,790
It's mainly because we set very low prices at the beginning,

226
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,570
But then, after I discussed it with Jiayu, and looking at the data,

227
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,820
many viewers had doubts that we were selling fake products because the prices were too low.

228
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,600
So Jiayu and I decided

229
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,870
that we should raise the prices back up to the market price.

230
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,930
But then we've lost our only competitive edge.

231
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,280
If we continue to be like this,

232
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,340
it's already not bad if we can break even, it'll be very difficult for us to make money.

233
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,970
It's okay. I'll arrange something later on.

234
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,730
Here. Put it on.

235
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,880
What are you doing?

236
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,520
You can't get sick now.

237
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,010
Thank you.

238
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,600
This is the soup Uncle Hu taught me, very nutritious.

239
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,300
Have some.

240
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
I couldn't even eat a meal with you these days.

241
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm all right.

242
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,400
I am worried about you. Take care of your body.

243
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
Do you want to take a trip somewhere?

244
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Why do you ask this suddenly?

245
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,300
After this busy time, I might take a couple of days off.

246
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,800
We've been together for a while, but haven't gone on an official date.

247
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,660
Then, there are so many places I want to go to.

248
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,400
You should drink the soup first. I served you a bowl.

249
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,700
Here. I'll tell you about it later.

250
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
- I want to go to Jinhai and the surrounding—
- GM Sheng.

251
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,200
The company just lost a group of VIP customers,

252
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,100
causing the Sales Department to be super busy.

253
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,600
Notify the Sales Department of a meeting,

254
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,500
to find the main reason for losing the customers.

255
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
Also,

256
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,600
give me the VIP list, I will personally contact them.

257
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,500
Understood, GM Sheng.

258
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm sorry.

259
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I can't eat with you again.

260
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
I am really fine. Don't worry about me.

261
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
Go to work.

262
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,750
Xia Qian still has not contacted you?

263
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,700
This is my first time running into this situation.

264
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,200
I told you it wouldn't work.

265
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,200
GM Song, do you have time right now?

266
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I got it.

267
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,690
GM Song, take a look.

268
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Miss Xia invited me here,

269
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,600
is it to get more customers for your boyfriend's hotel?

270
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh, of course not.

271
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,600
I am mainly here to talk to GM Song about the product collaboration,

272
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
and also recommend Evergreen to you at the same time.

273
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,200
I really did not know Miss Xia's boyfriend is GM Sheng.

274
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,000
I am a bit envious that GM Sheng has such a good girlfriend like you.

275
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,000
Evergreen's VIP program has a sign-up discount right now.

276
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,600
If GM Song's company has any business event or

277
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,800
annual event, you can consider Evergreen.

278
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,700
I will consider it.

279
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,400
- GM Qin.
- President Wu.

280
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
You have worked hard these days. Under your leadership,

281
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,100
the proportion of outstanding customers in our company has increased quite a bit.

282
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,600
Let's have dinner together and take a break.

283
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,600
President Wu, sorry, I have plans this evening.

284
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,700
Is it someone important? Can it be canceled?

285
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,400
Someone really important.

286
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,200
And she has been waiting for a long time.

287
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,000
How about this? Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will treat you.

288
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,600
How's that?

289
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,900
I am in a rush, I'll get going.

290
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,600
What does this mean?

291
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,500
I brought groceries back.

292
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,600
From now on, I will come back for dinner every night.

293
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,300
Wait.

294
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,600
Why did you come back for dinner?

295
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,500
You... Did you really not read the contract?

296
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,100
It clearly states,

297
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,800
Clause 7 on page 3,

298
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
when the employer is in need,

299
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,200
the employee must unconditionally provide catering service.

300
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
- I...
- Let me add more.

301
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Clause 8 on page 3,

302
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
when the employee provides catering service for the employer,

303
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,400
if the employer requires the employee

304
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,000
to eat together, the employee cannot reject.

305
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,200
So you can't just cook and hide in the kitchen to eat.

306
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
That is also a no.

307
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,800
What kind of overlord clauses are these?

308
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,140
I told you to read the contract.

309
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,800
I...

310
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,400
Where's the contract?

311
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,500
Y-You don't need to read anymore.

312
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
T-There isn't anything else.

313
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,200
The special clauses are just those two, really nothing else.

314
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,400
I can never trust anything you say again.

315
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,700
The food is ready, it will get cold if we don't start eating.

316
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,180
Are there any more special clauses?

317
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,600
Xiaoai.

318
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,800
All potential customers from our company that could be Evergreen VIPs,

319
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
have you contacted them all?

320
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,400
I contacted them all, there was not even one response back.

321
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,500
GM Song.

322
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,700
Pick it up.

323
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,700
Yes, GM Song.

324
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,200
Miss Xia, are you available to meet?

325
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,400
I want to discuss Evergreen VIP with you.

326
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
- So early?
- Miss Xia.

327
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,100
- Sit.
- Please sit.

328
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,590
I know you don't drink, so I ordered juice for you.

329
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,700
So thoughtful, thank you.

330
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,600
Last time after listening to your recommendation, I came here especially to experience the hotel service.

331
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,800
It is indeed quite good. I want to book our company's annual meeting here.

332
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
That is great.

333
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,000
Then, GM Song, is there anything else you want to know?

334
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,300
Let's drink and chat.

335
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Sure.

336
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,400
Please excuse me, I need to take this call.

337
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
- What's up?
- Hello? Sister Qian.

338
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Song Yu is a con artist.

339
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
What happened?

340
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
I researched information about him online.

341
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,400
It states his toy company is just a shell company.

342
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Someone also exposed him online.

343
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,600
It says he's a professional pickup artist. Many girls fell prey,

344
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,400
he is simply an evil person.

345
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,800
Sister Qian, you must be careful.

346
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay, I got it.

347
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And one more thing, can you keep him at Evergreen for now?

348
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Why?

349
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Is this a little overboard?

350
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Mengmeng, it is not the time for you to be hesitant.

351
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,100
Don't you want Xia Qian to disappear from your life?

352
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,080
Relax, Song Yu has boundaries.

353
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,990
Okay then.

354
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,800
Miss Xia, is GM Sheng very busy and has no time for you?

355
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,600
Not really, it is all right.

356
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,000
My ex-wife and I separated because we didn't spend enough time with each other.

357
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,200
If Miss Xia has any relationship problems, you can talk with me, someone with experience.

358
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
My relationship with my boyfriend is really well.

359
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,100
There isn't anything to talk about.

360
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Over there.

361
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
- Miss Xia, I am busy. I must go now.
- He wants to run away!

362
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Don't run! Jerk! Bastard! Liar!

363
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,800
I was so angry just now.

364
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,200
They all are...?

365
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,400
- You liar!
- Help me call the police!

366
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,600
I'll tell you who sent me!

367
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,000
You want to run? You still want to run?

368
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
You jerk! Bastard!

369
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
You liar!

370
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,260
Ning Meng.

371
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,660
What are you doing here?

372
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,220
See for yourself.

373
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,600
Did you send him?

374
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,400
So what if I did?

375
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,200
Why?

376
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,000
I just wanted to test how loyal you were to my brother.

377
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Who knows, maybe it's our money you are after.

378
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,600
Your brother and I,

379
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,900
we don't need your dirty tricks to test our relationship.

380
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,460
Ning Meng,

381
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
I do want to make peace with you.

382
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,300
But since you are playing dirty now,

383
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,100
I might as well cut to the chase.

384
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I've been putting up with you, simply because your brother loves you.

385
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,300
No matter how much you hate me, enough is enough.

386
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,400
Are we clear?

387
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,000
[Zhening]

388
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,000
Hello?

389
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I heard what happened at the restaurant.

390
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,800
What's with this client?

391
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,600
Zhening, that guy was...

392
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,370
It's nothing.

393
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't worry. They've got him.

394
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,700
They sent him to the police.

395
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,600
Dr. He, we are going for dinner tonight. Are you joining?

396
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Sorry, I've got something tonight, I have to get back early.

397
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,300
Okay, then we'll get going.

398
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,460
Sister Qian, why didn't you tell GM Sheng the truth?

399
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,330
She didn't want to put him in a difficult situation.

400
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,630
She's his sister, after all.

401
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,080
I don't want to make things worse.

402
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,790
Also, it ends here.

403
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,420
Don't mention it again.

404
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,860
Manhui, think of something else.

405
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,980
Can you find someone else to approach Xia Qian?

406
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,220
Whatever they do, just drive her away.

407
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,900
[Happy Two-Year Anniversary]

408
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,190
Hubby, I can explain.

409
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,420
Ning Meng, let's get a divorce.

410
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,720
Hubby, what are you talking about?

411
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,860
You'll just get more and more paranoid if you stay like this.

412
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,880
Hubby, it's not what you think. I—

413
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,730
It's all my fault.

414
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,960
Maybe our marriage was a mistake, to begin with.

415
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,320
I'll stay at the hospital for a few days.

416
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,590
Think about it.

417
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,780
[Happy Two-Year Anniversary]

418
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,740
From now on, before making appointments with a client,

419
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,280
ask Anan to do background checks first.

420
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,270
In that way, what happened today can be avoided.

421
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,420
Understood.

422
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,090
Also, last time I asked you where you wanted to go. Any thoughts?

423
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,570
You are not busy?

424
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,520
The VIP client issue has been taken care of.

425
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,700
Great!

426
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,860
How about you go to Shaxi with me on a business trip?

427
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,560
Shaxi?

428
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,110
We took a project, promoting welfare for farmers.

429
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,290
I need to go there to do some research. Coming with me?

430
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,500
Okay, Shaxi it is!

431
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,990
First, the coupon promoted today is not working well.

432
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,390
It takes multiple purchases to use it up, making it more complicated for customers.

433
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,090
It might stop them from buying more.

434
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,320
Second, I think the free gifts we offer are not ideal.

435
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,960
They look a bit cheap.

436
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,560
I suggest we use samples of major brands.

437
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:41,530
Also, fans mentioned today that they never received the gift with the vacuum cleaner. What is the problem?

438
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,030
About that problem, I've told the merchant many times.

439
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,300
But they said we sold too few during the livestream.

440
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,920
They won't offer free gifts.

441
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,120
Then let's buy them and send them to the fans.

442
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,390
- A promise must be kept.
- Okay.

443
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,600
Is there... a problem?

444
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
You did right.

445
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:15,160
Putting ourselves in their shoes, I think this is how the business will thrive in the long term.

446
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,290
I'm not doing it for the long term.

447
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,390
It's basic integrity.

448
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,950
Practically, they are the same.

449
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,020
Actually, Sister Shuangshuang did the right thing.

450
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,560
But we have a lot of competition in e-commerce.

451
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,790
Our merits won't be that visible.

452
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,870
That's okay. We'll just keep doing it.

453
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,080
Eventually, we will shine.

454
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,460
Zhijuan!

455
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,320
Are you okay, Miss Ning Meng?

456
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,420
GM Sheng said yesterday was your second anniversary with Mr. He.

457
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,550
Here is a gift for you.

458
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,790
Is my brother busy lately?

459
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,090
Can he visit me next week?

460
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,590
I'm afraid it will be difficult.

461
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:34,320
He's already made arrangements to travel with Miss Xia.

462
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
But for sure I will tell him.

463
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,190
I will get going, then.

464
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,120
Sister Qian, I suddenly thought of something you might need.

465
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,920
"A moment of joy on spring night is priceless."
(T/N: spring night implies sex on the wedding night)

466
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,300
I can only help you up to here.

467
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,890
The room layout is terrible.

468
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,390
Let me see! The curtain is not shading well.

469
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,450
Also, the bathroom facilities are too old.

470
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:48,520
GM Sheng, you cannot apply the Evergreen standard to other hotels.

471
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,380
Besides, Shaxi Boutique Hotel is already the best in town.

472
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,200
Okay, this one then.

473
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,720
Standard room or double room?

474
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,200
It's off-season now. Loads of available rooms.

475
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,090
What do you think?

476
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,060
Given your relationship status with Miss Xia,

477
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,360
better to choose a standard room.

478
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,460
You can go either way.

479
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,140
Hello, is this Shaxi Boutique Hotel? I would like to make a reservation.

480
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,290
Yes, ma'am. Would you prefer a standard room or a double room?

481
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,930
I'll see to it.

482
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,890
- Hello?
- Hi, Zhening.

483
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,940
Did you see the order form I sent?

484
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,560
I did.

485
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,290
About that...

486
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,060
I don't know why. All their standard rooms are taken.

487
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,690
So I reserved a double room.

488
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,130
- Really?
- Yeah.

489
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,120
Maybe because it's the peak season.

490
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,400
A lot of tourists. Less available rooms.

491
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,060
What is it?

492
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,970
If you don't like it,

493
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,070
I'll just book an extra room.

494
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,700
You don't need to force yourself.

495
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,610
Force what? It's totally fine for me.

496
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,360
Well...

497
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,690
The luggage... have you packed it?

498
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,290
I have.

499
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,500
No need to bring pajamas. I already bought couple pajamas.

500
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,800
Hi, Mengmeng. What is it?

501
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,460
Brother, can you come over?

502
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,360
♫ You said don’t understand, then don’t understand ♫

503
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,600
♫ No need to research, just be happy ♫

504
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,150
♫ Unintentionally run into a beautiful ocean ♫

505
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:19,230
♫ Want to make a trip to bring you here immediately ♫

506
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,560
♫ Humans are weird, nothing unusual ♫

507
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,800
♫ No matter good or bad, just expecting ♫

508
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,360
♫ Just giving the heart, it is not generous ♫

509
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,150
♫ I will be a loan shark for life  ♫

510
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,150
♫ Love is so fun, love is so complicated ♫

511
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:44,700
♫ Love is so speechless, love, love ♫

512
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,670
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

513
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,820
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

514
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,550
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

515
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,920
♫ I am here anyway ♫

516
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,800
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

517
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,950
♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

518
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,670
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

519
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,520
♫ I am always here anyway ♫

520
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:26,230
♫ The spoiled one is forever a kid ♫

521
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,720
♫ Don’t let waiting, let down waiting ♫

522
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,990
♫ People’s patience is a talent ♫

523
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,450
♫ Where there will be flowers, just plant them and bloom ♫

524
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,550
♫ Shouldn’t walk too quickly for a long journey ♫

525
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,850
♫ No deserving, only ought to be ♫

526
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:02,160
♫ We together love the present time more  ♫

527
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,620
♫ I bought candy, a whole bag ♫

528
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,430
♫ It is the piece you wanted yesterday ♫

529
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,440
♫ Love is so laborious, love is so simple  ♫

530
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,060
♫ Love is so terrible, love, love ♫

531
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,990
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

532
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,130
♫ You don’t need to be good, don’t worry about the future ♫

533
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,790
♫ You can be exasperated, you can be stubborn ♫

534
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:36,160
♫ I am here anyway ♫

535
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,050
♫ You can cheat, you can guess wildly ♫

♫ No one can replace Heaven’s arrangement ♫

537
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,020
♫ You can play dirty, overthrow, and restart ♫

538
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,800
