[Roommates of Poongduck 304]

2
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,606
Have I lost my mind?

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,850
Where have you been?

4
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,280
What?

5
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:02,018
- I'm back from a workout.
- Oh, okay.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,240
I guess you don't remember it.

7
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,520
What?

8
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:18,896
What's wrong?

9
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:21,039
Nothing.

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,574
You are living life very comfortably.

11
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,990
Did I make a mistake last night?

12
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,486
No.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,450
Nothing really happened.

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,080
- Why don't you have breakfast?
- What?

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,575
Okay.

16
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,600
And also,

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,400
it won't happen again.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,232
What?

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,975
What was that?

20
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:00,105
Does he remember it or not?

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,013
- Did I lose my mind?
- Did I lose my mind?

22
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.

23
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,990
Wait, my phone.

24
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,233
I should bring this to him, right?

25
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,893
Sure.

26
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,046
Huh?

27
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,436
What's that?

28
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:35,378
What are you looking at, you pervert?

29
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,368
Hey, Seo Jae Yun...

30
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,428
Please don't go.

31
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,958
Wait! Just wait a second.

32
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,640
Wait a second.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,410
- Hey, Seo Jae─
- No!

34
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,550
Please don't say anything.

35
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,923
My goodness!

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,824
Please stop following me.

37
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,659
Where are you going?

38
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,560
You don't need to know. Aren't you going to the office, Team Leader?

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm following my employee who's not coming to work without notice.

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,299
I'll take the day off.

41
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,265
What's your reason?

42
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,100
- It's a sick leave.
- Hey, please!

43
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,958
It's because I'm embarrassed!

44
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,978
I'm mortified.

45
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,190
What are you embarrassed about?

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,370
Are you that embarrassed about hitting the back of my head when you were drunk?

47
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,060
Or that you were about to throw up?

48
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,241
You didn't throw up, so don't worry about it.

49
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,481
Are you genuinely asking me?

50
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,280
Why do you keep asking tricky questions?

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,250
You were sober that night.

52
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,960
I shouldn't have done that to you.

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,990
Why not?

54
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,840
What is it? Why shouldn't you have done it?

55
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,125
Team Leader,

56
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,223
you are my boss, and...

57
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,280
Yes, so I'm asking you, what's wrong with it?

58
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,483
And...

59
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,356
You are a man.

60
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,670
So?

61
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,972
Me having feelings for you...

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,485
I shouldn't be like that.

63
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,858
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,610
A man having feelings for a man,

65
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,310
isn't it funny?

66
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,570
You just encouraged your subordinate to do a good job,

67
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,930
and now he doesn't know his place and developed feelings for you.

68
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,400
So you should have been nice to me moderately.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,341
You should have moderately complimented me, moderately patted me. Everything in moderation!

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,380
Then you would also have

71
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,710
used me moderately.

72
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,580
Right?

73
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,520
So are you going to leave like that again?

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,370
Will you keep running away?

75
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes.

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,275
Why?

77
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,877
Are you really asking me because you don't know?

78
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,005
Seriously...

79
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,966
Seriously, it's all a mess.

80
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,950
Did I reject you?

81
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Do I have to hear it to know it?

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,748
Do I have to experience it to know it?

83
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:32,459
Why don't you experience it?

84
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,891
Does that make a difference?

85
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,150
You didn't hear my answer yet!

86
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,458
You think about it alone and come to a conclusion all by yourself!

87
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,529
And you run away alone.

88
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,640
For how long will you do that?

89
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,456
There's nothing more stupid

90
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,790
than watching the losing game.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,100
The result is already determined.

92
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,200
No, if I were you...

93
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,270
I'd watch it until the very end.

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,515
Doesn't everyone become a fool when they are in love?

95
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,114
I...

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,100
finally realized it.

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,086
Everything that I have experienced until now...

98
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:19,080
and everything that I thought I knew...

99
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,630
was all meaningless.

100
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,470
♫ If my existence gives you strength and comfort, ♫

101
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,950
♫ That is enough ♫

102
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,203
Since some time ago, whenever I see you...

103
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,170
So I'm going to tell you this just once.

104
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,970
Listen carefully.

105
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,167
I don't care if you are a man.

106
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,660
I like you...

107
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,396
Seo Jae Yun.

108
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:54,876
Please don't go.

109
00:07:56,752 --> 00:08:00,170
I really mean it. Please don't go.

110
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,660
♫ I want to go inside your heart ♫

111
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:16,510
♫ If my existence gives you a smile and makes you lean on me ♫

112
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,332
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,572
I wondered if this was a dream.

114
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,966
This is not a dream.

115
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,049
Let's do everything that you want to do.

116
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,630
Yes.

117
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,620
♫ I'm crying just by seeing ♫

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,080
♫ I want to be a warm person like that ♫

119
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,520
Team Leader.

120
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,857
Yes?

121
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,751
Did you sleep well?

122
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,990
Yes.

123
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,761
Is that so?

124
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,368
Team Leader.

125
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:12,799
Yes?

126
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,300
Shall we go to work together today?

127
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,190
Yes.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,084
Why don't you get ready to go out? I'll make toast.

129
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,002
What was that, Seo Jae Yun?

130
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,166
Is he a playboy?

131
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,312
The doors are opening.

132
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,452
Going down.

133
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,982
- Good morning, everyone!
- Hello.

134
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,992
- Hello!
- Good morning!

135
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,390
Team Leader.

136
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,670
Do you have something good going on today?

137
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,630
Why do you ask that?

138
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,726
It's because your face is extra glowing today.

139
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,490
Is that so?

140
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,470
Maybe it's because the weather is nice.

141
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,740
There's a high wind warning today.

142
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,801
I heard that banners are falling off buildings.

143
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,260
I...

144
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,075
really love this kind of weather.

145
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,160
It has its own taste.

146
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:05,310
Oh, that's right. Jae Yun.

147
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,578
Is it today that the employees go out and support the PR team's event?

148
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,370
Yes, that's right.

149
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,485
Then you won't be in the office the entire day.

150
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,471
Let's review the report tomorrow. All right?

151
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,499
Where is Jae Yun going today?

152
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,808
It's the work request we received a week ago,

153
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,220
and you've already approved it.

154
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,660
Oh, you are talking about the meeting with the client, right?

155
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,140
Yes.

156
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,300
Jae Yun.

157
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,750
Good luck with the work.

158
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,210
Thank you.

159
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,630
The doors are closing.

160
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,992
Oh, that's right.

161
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,660
So the chairman's son is working in the office?

162
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,868
I heard he's learning to take over the business.

163
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,704
But I don't know if the son is in this building or in one of the affiliates.

164
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:05,010
The chairman is not that young anymore, so he must prepare for the succession.

165
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,230
But those team members will think of him as a regular employee.

166
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,496
I know.

167
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,632
He will become a director in a few years.

168
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,488
Don't you think he will be hated by people for no reason?

169
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:16,052
That's one thing,

170
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:19,820

Okay, then I'll take this one.

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,840
Do you want it to be gift-wrapped?

Yes, please.

Hello! You are...

339
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:21,175
It's so good to see you again!

340
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,810
You are the youngest team member of Ho Jun's team!

341
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,866
Yes, I'm Seo Jae Yun. You remember me.

342
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,977
I don't have a good memory,

343
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:32,550
but Ho Jun complimented you so much that day.

344
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,610
He's not someone who praises others that well.

345
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,680
Is that so?

346
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,703
How is working with Team Leader Ji?

347
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:43,247
It's pretty good.

348
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,932
Any regular team leader is already difficult,

349
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,309
but on top of that he's the chairman's son.

350
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,097
But at least Ho Jun doesn't take after Chairman Ji's

351
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:53,592

No, I'm outside. I'm on my way home now.

I think I'll be late tonight.

Actually, you've been quiet in the car lately,

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,158
and you don't seem to be in a good mood recently.

395
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,083
if it gets known to the world whenever you date someone.

It's not like they committed a crime.

Jae Yun, you know those two are dating, right?

398

Yes, I've heard of it.

399
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,966
There were so many hate comments.

400
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:39,774
The comments said he was getting sponsored, or she seduced him with money.

Being an idol must be tiring too,

402

but being a chaebol must be exhausting.

403

Celebrities have chosen that life on their own will.

404
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,170
But what did a chaebol do to be treated like that?

405
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,010
They were just born that way.

It's because Poongduck Villa is special.

It's special?

428
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,140
At first, it was because of my darn habit.
