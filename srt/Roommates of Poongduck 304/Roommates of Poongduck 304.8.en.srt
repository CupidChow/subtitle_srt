I wondered where you had gone, and you came to see your mother.

166
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:55,827
The house was so quiet while you were gone for a few days.

167
00:17:55,827 --> 00:18:01,037
Comic books weren't fun, and the beer wasn't tasty.

168
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,177
Not even the good German one.

169
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,778
I have lived apart from my family

170
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:11,267
since I was in middle school.

171
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:14,178
So I thought I was very used to being alone.

172
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,536
But...

173
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,527
This time was hard for me.

174
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:23,577
I think I'll never get used to my people leaving me.

175
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:29,657
When I was studying abroad in America,

176
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,847
I started a business with my friends.

177
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,514
Now that I think about it,

178
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,867
it might have been the ambition of a young college student.

179
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:43,507
Confidence that it will go well no matter what, and passion...

180
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:47,497
I was filled with all that.

181
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,207
I had never experienced any failure before,

182
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,467
so there was nothing to be afraid of.

183
00:18:55,457 --> 00:19:00,061
I was pulling all-nighters almost every day, but it was just fun.

184
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,120
I dreamt of becoming the next Zuckerberg.

185
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:08,176
And then, somehow, it went well and got investments.

186
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:16,787
I lived with the feeling of walking on the clouds every day.

Take care, okay?

191
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:52,200
I think that's when I started acting up.

192
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,203
I hated the world,

193
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:58,873
people, and business.

194
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:02,619
My mom, my family, and my friends...

195
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:05,657
They always left me first.

196
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:10,070
So I decided not to care about anything from now on.

I just met and parted, and met and parted.

201
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:31,287
I didn't get attached to any relationship.

202
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,715
But...

203
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:36,020
It didn't make me feel exhilarated, it just made me feel emptier.

They say the son of a wealthy family grew up sheltered,

207

so I'm still immature and out of my senses.

208

209

You knew who my father is.

I dodged the ashtray, but I couldn't avoid the china.

318

But why did you hand in the resignation letter?

319

It's because I don't want to be a chaebol anymore.
