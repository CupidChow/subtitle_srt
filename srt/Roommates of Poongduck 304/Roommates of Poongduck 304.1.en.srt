159
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,830
It's just lint, not a bug.

160
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,260
Also, the one I caught earlier probably came from outside.

161
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,510
Usually, the big ones come from outside.

162
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,220
- Can I trust that?
- What's the reason not to trust me?

163
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,960
I mean, it's hard to trust you.

164
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,950
The guy earlier said there are no bugs, it's a great place, and you manage great.

165
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,310
So I paid the maintenance fee as well.

166
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,440
But it has not even been a month or a week. Look at what happened on the first day.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,680
How am I supposed to live here when it's this nerve-wracking?

168
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,960
It still feels like something is crawling.

169
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,690
You are overreacting because of one single bug.

170
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,830
But wait. Did you say you paid a maintenance fee?

171
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,540
- I also paid the first rent.
- To whom?

172
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,460
48, 49, 50.

173
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,570
It's the exact amount.

174
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,720
Then, can I unpack now?

175
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,620
Why would you even ask that?

176
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,220
Now it's your place. Feel at home.

177
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,560
The person you are trying to reach is not available─

178
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,310
Why is he not picking up the phone? Seriously!

179
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,890
What a mess.

180
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,910
There's a bug in the house, and I got scammed for the rent.

181
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,550
Don't touch that!

182
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,200
What was that?

183
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,280
How dare you shout at me when you are a total scammer?

184
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,860
- A scammer?
- Then what is this if it is not a scam?

185
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,110
By the way, you are talking very harshly.

186
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,750
Are you taking it out on me right now?

187
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,560
I'm the victim here.

188
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,580
Forget about it. Just give me a refund.

189
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,560
How am I supposed to trust this place and sleep here comfortably?

190
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,470
Okay, I got it.

191
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,800
Can you show me the transfer transaction? I'll check and send you the money.

192
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,370
- I paid in cash.
- Excuse me?

193
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,350
I gave 500,000 won in cash on the spot to your friend.

194
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,540
500,000 won?

195
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,400
The monthly rent is 300,000 won, including the maintenance fee.

196
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,130
Wow, this is a total group of crooks.

197
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,060
Also, how do I know if you gave him 300,000 or 500,000 won?

198
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,550
You have to ask your friend about it.

199
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,730
You just saw I can't reach him right now.

200
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,580
Of course, he will not pick up his phone since you guys are scamming me.

201
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,500
You don't know about that yet.

202
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:03,330
Wow, I'm getting treated like this just because of stupid 500,000 won.

203
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,240
Ji Ho Jun, you've lived long enough to see this!

204
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,820
- Stupid 500,000 won?
- Yes, that's what I said.

205
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,440
What do you do with 500,000 won anyway?

206
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,710
Wow, if anyone hears this, they'll think you are a chaebol.

207
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,360
What?

208
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,920
What a bluff. If you need to get a room as a roommate without a deposit in the outskirt of Seoul, you know the level.

209
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,940
Did you say I'm bluffing?

210
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,070
I can't refund you until I check the exact amount you paid.

211
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Then are you saying I should stay in this house that might be infested with roaches?

212
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,670
You have to wait until my friend calls me.

213
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,590
- Hey, you.
- "Hey, you?"

214
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,090
How old are you?

215
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,670
That's not important.

216
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:08,560
You have to be grateful that I'm not taking you to the police.

217
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,380
Just know that I've been very generous.

218
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,080
Why would I make a fuss over a mere 500,000 won?

219
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,860
It's a waste of my time.

220
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,380
What is the deal with him?

221
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,220
It's so annoying.

222
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,170
There's no room?

223
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm very sorry, Sir.

224
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,060
How can there be no room whatsoever in every hotel I go to?

225
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm really sorry, Sir. But as you know, this is the busy season.

226
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,890
Our rooms were all booked a month ago. We are sincerely sorry, Sir.

227
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,970
It's driving me crazy.

228
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,650
Seriously, no way.

229
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,010
Ho Cheol gave me a present. My baby, I will love you forever!

230
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,600
I guess it's the delivery man. Coming!

231
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,850
You came really fast─

232
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,630
Did you see a ghost or something?

233
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,030
It's similar to that.

234
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,320
Wait, wait! What are you doing right now?

235
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
Excuse me!

236
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,620
I'm asking you. What are you doing?

237
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,700
I guess you were enjoying a relaxing evening time.

238
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,100
You look like you are wondering why I showed up again.

239
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,000
Something like that.

240
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,930
Do you want to know why I came back?

241
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,750
No, not at all.

242
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,480
- I changed my mind.
- I said I don't want to know.

243
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,610
I decided to...

244
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,140
- I decided to live here in Poongduck Villa.
- What?

245
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,200
If you think I'm doing this because of that money, then you are totally wrong.

246
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,940
- Then what is it?
- It felt unfair.

247
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,990
I'm the victim.

248
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,380
Your friend is the one who tricked me, but you suspected me.

249
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,410
I thought about it, and it's not something I should end by leaving here.

250
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,580
No, if anything, I need to receive compensation for psychological damage.

251
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,210
Listen. I wasn't being suspicious of you, but I said we should wait until I get a call from Ho Cheol─

252
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,310
Are you confident about it?

253
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,270
Are you absolutely confident that you didn't suspect me at all?

254
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:26,110
At that moment, I lost my judgment because I got worked up.

255
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,540
- Sorry.
- Pardon?

256
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,780
You have to apologize to me in a situation like this.

257
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,370
Why don't you say that out loud?

258
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,190
S... I'm sorry.

259
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,780
- How old are you?
- Excuse me?

260
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm asking about your age.

261
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm 27.

262
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm 29.

263
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm older, so I will speak comfortably to you.

264
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,520
You were already doing that. Why are you saying so now?

265
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,730
Agree with this.

266
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,280
Agree with what?

267
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,660
Agree that I will be living in this Poongduck Villa until our payment is clear.

268
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,230
Don't get me wrong.

269
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,390
I am doing this for the public so that there won't be more victims like me.

270
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,590
And, of course, I will hold your friend accountable as well.

271
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,960
What did you say?

272
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,950
That's right, also, about the bathroom.

273
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,300
The bathroom?

274
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,280
I think it's a great idea to switch the amenities.

275
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,110
What? Ameni... what?

276
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,180
If it's hard to choose, the ones from Cosy Brown from France are good as well.

277
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,560
5-star hotels usually use something like that.

278
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,690
What?

279
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,620
Cheers.

280
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,670
If it's hard to choose, the ones from Cosy Brown from France are good as well.

281
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,600
Take that into consideration.

282
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,100
5-star hotels usually use something like that.

283
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,020
5-star hotels?

284
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,190
Have you ever been to a place like that? What a bluff!

285
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,930
[Seung Seok, what are you up to?]

286
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,930
I got transferred to a new team and got a weird tenant!

287
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,890
It's a total mess.

288
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,370
[New Business Planning Team]

289
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,310
Jae Yun, you came in early.

290
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,940
Assistant Manager Kim.

291
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,910
I guess you didn't sleep well. You don't look okay.

292
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,010
You, too.

293
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,290
Well, it would be strange if you could sleep comfortably when we are about to get demoted.

294
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,430
- Can you organize the materials?
- Yes, I will.

295
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,270
A meeting with the team leader?

296
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,320
Well, I'm Manager Choi Chu Won. Nice to meet you.

297
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,740
Hello, Manager Choi. We've met before at a meeting.

298
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,020
I'm Assistant Manager Kim Bit Na.

299
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,500
I've never expected us to become a team like this.

300
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,550
It's also meant to be.

301
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,020
- Jae Yun, it's also nice to meet you.
- Yes. Hello, Sir.

302
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,430
I wonder what I did so wrong!

303
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,510
I thought about this the entire morning.

304
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:18,970
I worked at Geumnam for ten years, and I'm devoted to this company.

305
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,270
I was going to bury my bones here.

306
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,070
No, I didn't even mind if my bones were melted and turned into nothing.

307
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,840
Manager Choi, I completely understand your feelings.

308
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,550
Did you also work overtime more than three days per week?

309
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,110
It was even seven days a week in the busy season.

310
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,170
Then did you have tearful wagyu sushi at the Hayashi sushi place

311
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,040
after getting off from work at dawn?

312
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,260
I'll add to that.

313
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,000
The halibut sushi with sake is the best combo in that place.

314
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,040
Ganbare Obasan sake!

315
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,840
Wow, she knows how to eat!

316
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,220
How can they make me this miserable after giving me such a great HR review?

317
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,200
What did I do wrong?

318
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,490
If you get devoted, you get dumped!

319
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,240
Exactly. It's no good to work hard for this darn company.

320
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,650
Why don't you all calm down a bit?

321
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,710
Oh, I think the new team leader is here.

322
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:48,110
♫ Oh, look around, there is nothing easy in this world ♫

323
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:55,590
♫ Uh, but it seems that my heart is at ease ♫

324
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:02,130
♫ Sometimes I don't know why you act so edgy ♫

325
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,550
♫ And it's so strange that I still don't hate that ♫

326
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,430
Give me all the credit cards you have right now.

327
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,600
- Go out and live on your own for two years!
- Wait!

328
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,150
This is the contract for you to work as a team leader of the New Business Planning Team of Geumnam Group.

329
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,500
Such a great thing just happened to me!

330
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,310
Landlord!

331
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,440
But you should've told me first!

332
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,530
Here are your 500,000 won.

333
