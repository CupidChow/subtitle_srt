[Roommates of Poongduck 304]

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,910
Why are you coming home so late?

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,569
Oh, that's right. I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,160
Were you out this late buying a food container?

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,230
Oh, it was a freebie.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,310
A freebie? What did you buy?

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,369
But you haven't gone to bed yet.

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,007
No, I'm not sleepy.

9
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:47,450
Maybe it's because my forehead hurts because of someone.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,329
Then will you have a drink with me?

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,930
I mean, I feel bad for what happened today, and I also feel grateful to you.

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,940
Also... to celebrate our reconciliation.

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,432
That's right. You said you don't eat anything after 7 p.m.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,750
Forget about it. I'll drink alone.

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,360
What are you doing?

16
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,560
You said let's have a drink.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,170
But are you good at drinking?

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,520
You don't look like you would be.

19
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,190
♫ Oh Baby, when I can't fall asleep ♫

20
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,710
Cheers!

21
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,860
Cheers.

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,680
♫ I'd like to see you again ♫

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,580
♫ Oh no, Baby! ♫

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,300
♫ You were so beautiful ♫

25
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,250
Do we have to mix this?

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,900
Just give it a try. It's embarrassing to say it with my own mouth,

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,690
but I'm the Poongduck-dong Golden Bat.

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,560
Golden Bat?

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,700
It's coming from the fact that I'm incredibly good at mixing soju bombs with a golden ratio.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,120
It might not look like it, but it's quite delicious.

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,720
How delicious can a soju bomb be?

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,150
♫ Stay in my dream, let's be together ♫

♫ I'll hold you tight and never let you go ♫

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,690
We're having fried squid as a snack!

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,130
Put the special sauce that I made.

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,350
Here you go. Try this.

39

00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,880
Yes, mix another one.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,020

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,960
♫ Dreaming of you every day ♫

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
It's good.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,190
Thanks to you, I feel much better now.

48
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:26,435
I mean, there's nothing more gratifying than someone enjoying the food that I made.

49
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,990
It doesn't make sense.

50
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,600
When you say you feel much better now, it means you were feeling terrible before,

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,340
but somehow it got better. It has that order of process as the base.

52
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,772
So it's completely different from you feeling happy with this and that.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,340
Are you wondering how I figured it out?

54
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,190
Your face when you came home told me about it.

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,720
Someone who bought something and got freebies and stuff,

56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,681
should be smiling, at least. But you weren't like that.

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,990
Tell me. What happened to you in that short moment?

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,710
Oh, please don't read too much into it.

59
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,970
Nothing happened.

60
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,420
Can I tell you one of my secrets?

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,560
If I drink, I don't remember anything the next day.

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,390
It means no matter what you do now, to me, it will be as if it never happened.

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,920
That's a lie. Do you think I'll fall for that?

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,830
If you don't want to believe it, you don't have to. It will only make you frustrated.

65
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Team Leader...

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,230
It's a really funny story.

67
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,120
Do you know how many insurances I have?

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,080
How many do you have?

69
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,930
- Is it two?
- No!

70
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,240
It's twelve.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,940
One indemnity insurance, one life insurance, and five savings insurances...

72
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,780
And what were the other ones? I can't remember!

73
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,505
Anyway... I have twelve insurances.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,540
But do you know who's the agent of all these insurances?

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,400
- Who is it?
- It's Yu Seung Seok.

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,840
Yu Seung Seok? From the White Class?

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,560
Yes! Yes, that Yu Seung Seok.

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,140
You took my chocolate the other time!

79
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,730
It was from him.

80
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:11,460
If you go out to that balcony, the jade mats are piled up this high!

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,507
You can use one of those.

82
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,760
I bought fifty!

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,480
Fifty of those. Fifty.

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,580
They cost 200,000 won each. (~ 140 dollars)

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,530
- But what about it?
- It hurts.

86
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,020
- What?
- It hurts so much!

87
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,170
If you lie down, it hurts your back.

88
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,550
If you wake up in the morning, there's a circular mark on your face.

89
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,170
It's not even warm enough!

90
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,500
But do you know who sold those mats to me?

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,670
- Yu─
- That's right!

92
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,130
Yu Seung Seok!

93
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,490
Wow, what a total sucker.

94
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,760
Yes, I'm a total sucker. I am!

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,340
So today, I signed a contract to buy two massage chairs from him.

96
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,420
So my Seung Seok can be the sales king.

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,790
Then I should feel happy!

98
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,350
But I don't know why I feel pain in my heart.

99
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,980
Hey, stop it. Stop it.

100
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,450
That bastard!

101
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,160
I treated you so well, but how can you never look at me even once?

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,010
Hey, please stop crying.

103
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,030
Team Leader...

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,510
You smell like alcohol. Please be quiet.

105
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:58,915
It would have been nice if I were born as someone who loves like a normal person.

106
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,800
It would have been nice if I could have been like that.

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,134
Then I wouldn't be like this!

108
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,688
Seo Jae Yun.

109
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,556
Seo Jae Yun.

110
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,240
Are you sleeping?

111
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,387
What a frustrating person.

112
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,990
Jae Yun, can you check for any typos in this material? It's for today's meeting.

113
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,380
- Yes.
- Thank you.

114
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,904
By the way, Team Leader is coming in late today.

115
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,920
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning...

116
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,830
Team Leader! What happened to your forehead?

117
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,020
- I got hit.
- What?

118
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,370
What? Did you get hit by someone?

119
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,230
Have you ever heard about the kitty cat punch?

120
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,540
Kitty cat punch... Are you talking about the animal cat?

121
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,460
I was walking by and saw a cat, so I played with him for a bit.

122
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,030
But then suddenly, he kicked me right here.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,890
He was using the famous kitty cat punch.

124
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,030
You should have been careful! Did you get scratched by the cat's claws?

125
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,630
Did you put some ointment on it?

126
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,710
Yes. But with my big generosity, I gladly forgave that cat.

127
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,827
As I thought, your personality is as great as your handsome face!

128
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,280
- But is every cat like that?
- Pardon?

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,100
I thought I got pretty close to him.

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,190
But he's cold to me again the next day.

131
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,890
Well, speaking about that, one of my friends has a cat.

132
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,560
And cats take longer to get close to, which is different from dogs.

133
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,850
Is that so? Isn't it more like they are ungrateful?

134
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,270
I doubt it. Why would people call the cat a very intelligent animal?

135
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,910
They'll remember every grateful moment with you.

136
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,980
They'll remember it.

137
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,540
That actually upsets me more.

138
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,602
By the way, Team Leader. Where did you go during the get-together last night?

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,030
I had something urgent come up.

140
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,860
Oh, I'm thirsty all of a sudden.

141
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,350
Why did I share that with him? I must have lost my mind.

142
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,920
No, no.

143
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,130
He said he can't remember anything when he drinks, so let's trust his words.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
What are you trusting?

145
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,580
- Don't you think it's not okay?
- Pardon?

146
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,095
I got late to work because of you. You made me drink a ton last night.

147
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,430
How can you just come to work by yourself? You should have woken me up.

148
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,340
Well, the thing is...

149
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,555
I thought you didn't want to drink alone, so I drank with you for you.

150
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:50,230
If I were you, I would have made some honey tea.

151
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,870
How can you ditch me completely?

152
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,630
You made my head look like this too.

153
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,800
I had an urgent task to take care of this morning.

154
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,790
Then I'll go back to work now.

155
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,580
Seo Jae Yun.

156
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,820
Yes?

157
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Didn't you forget something?

158
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,380
Your memory is a bit...

159
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,790
What? What about my memory?

160
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,680
Your coffee.

161
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,050
Right, thank you.

162
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,010
Right, my coffee.

[Report on business items of the New Business Planning Team]

164
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,910

168
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,410
- Jae Yun.
- Yes?

169
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,240
I just sent you a file to your email address. Can you put that on the screen?

170
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,927
Yes, Sir.

171
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,870
Oh? This is...

172
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,030
- What are you waiting for?
- Oh, yes.

173
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,370
Why don't you all take a look?

174
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,637
Influencer?

175
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,421
These days, the advertising market prefers influencers over celebrities.

176
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:37,957
Influencers with great followings use their influence to sell many things and make a profit.

177
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,765
Somebody said something like this.

178
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:49,460
Uber doesn't have any cars, and Airbnb doesn't own any houses.

179
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,300
But still, they are ranked number one in their respective areas.

180
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,200
So are you saying that we should build a market platform for influencers?

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,690
Well, wait─

182
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,280
I think it's great.

183
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,780
Yes, I agree.

184
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,350
I also look at influencers I like on social media to see what they are up to.

185
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:17,003
And it's a platform where they are collectively concentrated?

186
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,630
I think it will work.

187
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:26,980
You can find new influencers and get every information like their clothing and lipsticks.

188
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,000
Wow! Is this your idea, Team Leader?

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's amazing! Why didn't you share this until now?

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,590
- It's Employee Seo Jae Yun's idea.
- Really?

191
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,330
Daebak.

192
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,170
I saw Seo Jae Yun's portfolio that he submitted when he got into this company,

193
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,600
and it was pretty good.

194
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,820
I personally liked it and was reviewing the idea.

195
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,480
I guess we are out of date now.

196
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,550
No matter how hard we try, we can't catch up with the fresh ideas of the young employees.

197
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,060
Jae Yun, why didn't you share this idea until now?

198
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,030
You'll see once you review this, but so many things are not enough.

199
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,040
- Why can't you trust yourself?
- Pardon?

200
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,943
Whether it will work or not is something for the other senior team members or me to decide.

201
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:31,330
Team Leader, how about having a meeting with Geumnam PR?

202
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,180
The fields are different, but they are the ones who work with the influencers the most,

203
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,850
so it'll be easier to learn about inclinations and needs.

204
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,964
Right, they have the biggest pool of influencers in this country.

205
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,620
Okay, sounds good.

206
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,730
Then who would be the best fit to go to the meeting?

207
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,780
- Employee Seo Jae Yun.
- Yes?

208
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,910
Why don't you come with me?

209
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Me?

210
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,320
This is your idea.

211
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,450
Who do you think knows the most about this idea among us?

212
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,870
But I've never done something like this before.

213
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:23,073
Right. Team Leader, Jae Yun is still an employee starting to learn.

214
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,470
For how long will you write minutes because you are just an employee?

215
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,190
You have to start having hands-on experiences.

216
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,620
Jae Yun, you contact them on your own to schedule a meeting.

217
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,300
And make a list of all the questions we need to ask at the meeting.

218
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,910
Manager Choi and Assistant Manager Kim, please help him out a lot.

219
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,740
Yes, Sir.

220
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,190
That's all for today. The meeting is over.

221
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,780
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you for everything.

222
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,560
Wait, Team Leader!

223
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,280
What is it?

224
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,230
Well...

225
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,880
What is it?

226
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,300
It would have been nicer if you had told me first.

227
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,160
If I told you first, would anything have changed?

228
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,070
I thought about it a lot,

229
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,590
but I think it's better for you to go to the meeting with Assistant Manager Kim than with me.

230
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,170
- What if I go and make a mistake?
- Employee Seo Jae Yun.

231
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes?

232
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,263
Did you fight with me the whole last week just to do this?

233
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,880
Well, you started that first.

234
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,800
You know.

235
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:46,550
When you are not doing anything, but the opportunity just flies toward you,

236
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:53,330
some people don't even know that's a chance and just shake it off.

237
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,105
But if you want to grab it again later, it's twice as hard.

238
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:07,100
If you don't understand what I'm saying, think about why you wanted to work in marketing in the first place.

239
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,280

As you know, Geumnam pays the best.

318
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,450
But that's not the only reason.

319
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,013
This kind of story needs some alcohol to be talked about.

320
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,790
Are you saying that because I didn't buy you a drink?

321
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,216
My family went bankrupt big time once.

322
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,002
My father was having a boiler business, and he blew it.

323
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,740
That's when I learned that the red stickers I only saw in TV shows actually exist.

324
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,230
You haven't seen those in real life, have you?

325
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,080
It's really daunting.

326
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:03,167
My father worked really hard day and night to develop the technology.

327
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,470
But one day, the same exact product came out in the TV ads.

328
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,010
It turned out that another company copied my father's technology.

329
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,950
And it all started from there. A sad tenant's life has begun.

330
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,440
It's all in the past now.

331
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,530
But did he not do anything about it?

332
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,960
We couldn't do anything because my father didn't even put out a tiny ad in a newspaper.

333
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,120
But the other company did everything they could, like TV commercials and home shopping.

334
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,873
So when we got ourselves together,

335
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:50,509
it was my father who copied them, not the other way around.

336
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,960
So since then, I have wanted to know.

337
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,347
I wondered what my father, who only worked hard, should have done.

338
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,800
That's why I joined this company. I came here to learn.

339
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,520
To learn?

340
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,992
Yes.

341
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,680
I suddenly feel a great amount of responsibility.

342
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,467
I already learned something from you.

343
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,340
I didn't show you anything.

344
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,410
You told me this before.

345
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:36,250
Don't lose the opportunity you got, no matter what. Hold on to it tightly.

346
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,790
Honestly, I got scared at first.

347
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:48,952
But after hearing what you said, I thought about why I wanted to do this work once again.

348
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:55,491
But of course, I have to wait ten days to do so.

349
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,870
I should have bought some alcoholic drinks.

350
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,320
I know. It's too bad.

351
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,300
What's bad is your uncontrollable behavior when you get drunk.

352
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,970
- My drunken behavior?
- Yes.

353
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,330
- I don't have any specific behavior when I get drunk.
- What?

354
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,560
Do you think you don't have one? Oh, my...

355
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,190
♫ Whenever it is, ♫

356
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,010
♫ I can tell how lonely you would be alone ♫

357
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:29,868
Do you remember that day?

358
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,595
If the day you are thinking of is the day I'm thinking of, then yes.

359
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,610
Jade mats?

360
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,002
And your twelve insurances and massage chairs.

361
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Then... What about Seung Seok?

362
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,750
Oh, your fiancé?

363
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,000
You said you don't remember when you drink!

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Right, but somehow I remember every detail of that day.

365
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,550
- Did you lie to me?
- No.

366
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,590
Technically, it wasn't a lie.

367
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:18,276
I really don't remember what happened when I drank, but somehow I do remember that day.

368
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,620
Let's do cheers. It's all in the past.

369
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,670
I kept it secret for the past week, in case you are concerned about it.

370
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,420
- Let's do cheers. My arm is about to fall off!
- It's embarrassing!

371
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,310
Don't talk to me. I'm embarrassed.

372
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,056
Cheers.

373
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,640
But, by the way.

374
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,830
Should I tell him to stop being such a pushover? Or am I being too nosy?

375
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,980
- But what?
- It's nothing.

376
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,167
You always stop talking in the middle of the sentence. Oh, well!

377
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,182
Let's just go now. We'll get caught in the traffic.

378
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,280
♫ If my existence gives you strength and comfort, ♫

379
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,620
When am I going to come here again?

380
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,860
♫ That is enough ♫

381
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,380
♫ I'll be your light, your tree, ♫

382
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,060
It's beautiful.

383
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,460
♫ A resting place in great shade ♫

384
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,980
♫ For you to rest without thinking, ♫

385
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,750
I'm talking about the ocean.

386
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:08,720
♫ Oh, look around, there is nothing easy in this world ♫

387
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,270
♫ Uh, but it seems that my heart is at ease ♫

388
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:22,670
♫ Sometimes I don't know why you act so edgy ♫

389
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:29,140
♫ And it's so strange that I still don't hate that ♫

390
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,980
Seo Jae Yun!

391
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,680
He's earned scholarships all through college.

392
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,880
I have a feeling.

393
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,240
I have a sixth sense kind of feeling that this guy will make my salary rise dramatically.

394
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,790
I thought it was odd since he's quite young to be a team leader.

395
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,220
But I figured he was such a talented person after hearing about him.

396
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,720
Manager Choi and Assistant Manager Kim, you two do project planning and system development.

397
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:01,320
And Seo Jae Yun, you and I will contact the influencers until the market opens.

398
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,654
Jae Yun! I'm sorry to ask you such a favor at the last minute.

399
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,068
What's going on?
