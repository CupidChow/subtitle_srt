Excuse me, Team Leader.

What is it?

7
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,510
I was wondering if there's any other work you want me to do.

8
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,870
Did you recheck all the meeting schedules with the influencers?

9
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,270
Yes, I did. If there's no more work for me to do, then─

10

Then we can have a team dinner tonight!

11

It's a day when Manager Choi and Assistant Manager Kim also don't have any meetings.

No, an extra, extra special Korean beef dinner get-together tonight.

How is everyone's schedule?

15
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,390
I think it's meaningful when we all go together.

16

Korean beef? It's amazing!

17

No, I can keep doing it.

Jae Yun, don't people from the MZ generation know that?

31
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,404
Oh, a man who grills meat.

32
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,680
But Team Leader, I thought you'd only eat meat that someone else grilled.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,540
But it's a pleasant surprise that you are good at grilling!

34
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,980
Is that so?

35
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,500
But Team Leader, this is already turning into charcoal.

36
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,993
Just eat it.

37

- But still, it's extra, extra...
- Stop it.

38

It's extra special beef.

Okay! Team Leader, why don't we clink glasses?

Don't you think this is not okay?

165
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:09,527
What's not okay?

166
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,597
Just everything what happened today.

167
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,174
Hey...

168
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,137
all of that was a misunderstanding.

169
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,655
You also saw it. It's just that people misunderstood things─

170
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,319
I bought a lot for you until now!

171
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,547
Seung Seok, if you did this much─

172
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,335
You bought it "for me?"

173
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,198
Hey, Seo Jae Yun.

174
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,266
Are you also despising me now?

175
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:37,457
It's funny now that I think about it.

176
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,407
Tell me honestly.

177
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,087
You are also embarrassed by me, aren't you?

178
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,758
Why are you trying to lecture me all of a sudden?

179
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:46,975
Why?

180
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,417
Do you feel like you are something now since you became a landlord and are collecting rent money?

181
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,534
Sure.

182
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,457
You did buy a lot for me. I know that and am thankful for that.

183
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:02,908
But I'm the one who thought of you, you know?

184
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:07,683
I shared the things with you because those are good things. I wanted my friend to use good things!

185
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:15,201
Wow, I'm hearing such nonsense in my life.

186
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,093

187
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,385
Are we really friends?

188
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,893
What the heck are you saying now?

189
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,215
It's been a while.

190
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,343
Hey, thanks for coming.

191
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,900
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

192
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,497
There's no particular reason.

193
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,685
I was busy with work.

194
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,967
Are you dating someone?

195
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:18,481
No, it's not like that.

196
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:23,835
I can't get used to you not having someone next to you.

197
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,177
What do you want to drink?

198
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,137
It's on me.

199
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:31,887
Do they sell soju bombs here?

200
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,137
Hey, how can you look for a soju bomb here?

201
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,922
Are you out of your mind?

202
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,904
I already have a glass of whiskey I'm drinking.

203
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,100
There's something going on with you.

204
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,900
What about it?

205
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,850
Hey,

206
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,421
do you know how many employees I have in my company?

207
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:06,091
I can tell that just by looking at your face.

208
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,574
You are amazing indeed.

209
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,547
What's going on?

210
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,582
You can tell me about it.

211
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,904
It just bothers me.

212
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:23,972
What?

213
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:28,917
I mean...

214
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:34,040
There's a really frustrating person that I know.

215
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,246
I really can't understand that person.

216
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,150
That person doesn't spend any money on themselves,

217
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,964
but they just give everything to other people.

218
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:51,428
It's just so absurd that it makes me angry when I look at that person.

219
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:54,412
But besides that,

220
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,165
that person is a great person.

221
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,877
A smart and hard-working person.

222
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,554
Also, pretty good-looking.

223
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,802
So when I pull pranks on them,

224
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,000
their reaction is very funny.

225
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,419
So I want to keep making jokes around them.

226
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,777
Either complimenting or talking bad about them, can you just do one thing?

227
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,997
Oh, Ji Ho Jun.

228
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,419
Why?

229
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,387
You totally fell for that person.

230
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,817
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:29,820
It's clear that you have feelings for that person.

232
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,288
Feelings...

233
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,347
Hey, it's not like that.

234
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:38,627
It doesn't make any sense.

235
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,407
It's total nonsense. What are you talking about?

236
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:45,964
Right.

237
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,447
Why was I like that?

238
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,428
- What?
- What?

239
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,634
It's nothing.

240
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,420
I can't do that.

241
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,987
If that's the case, it doesn't matter to you, does it?

242
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,767
You don't have to care about that person living like that or not.

243
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:07,468
When did you care about other people that much anyway?

244
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,942
Stop being a pushover!

245
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,513
It's annoying to see that from the side.

246

252
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,098

00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:35,715
You can leave them there.

If you go like this now!

I'm never going to be involved in your life ever again.

257
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,181
We'll only be the team leader and the employee,

258

only that shell of a relationship will remain.

You don't feel the aftermath of the decision at that moment.

260
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,877
Because it always comes a second later.

00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:26,148
Or that you saved my number as "Pushover?"

328
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,341
You really are the worst.

329
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,575
How can you call me the worst?

330
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,180
I mean, Jae Yun.

331
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,534
I didn't say anything wrong.

332
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:03,917
Hey! What do I become if you go like this?

333
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,977
I don't care what happens to you anymore.

334
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,519
Seriously, fuck!

335
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:17,568
Jae Yun, do you know how much effort I put into you?

336
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,945
You bastard!

337
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,187
You can't say such bullshit to me, you know?

338
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:28,045
What?

339
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,503
That's right.

340
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:42,277
I didn't know you were such a bastard until now, and I devoted myself to you for years.

341
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:45,797
Sure, I'm the crazy bastard.

342
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:49,857
You better be glad we have the rule of law in this country.

343
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:52,686
Otherwise, you would have been dead already.

344
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,917
Assistant Manager Kim.

345
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,667
Did you see the team leader?

346
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,047
Well, I'm not sure.

347
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,214
Where did he go?

348
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,773
Okay, I get it.

349
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,257
I'll treat you big time soon.

350
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:37,349
You are so suspicious about things.

351
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,137
Me? I'm at the office, of course.

352
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:43,204
Where are you?

353
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:44,415
Today?

354
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:46,305
Today, I...

355
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:52,890
Okay, see you later today. I'll hang up now.

356
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:06,533
What is it?

357
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,597
A few days ago, I was being─

358
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:11,480
Employee Seo Jae Yun.

359
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,668
Yes.

360
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:23,757
I think I was wrong.

361
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:24,977
I'm sorry?

362
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,856
As you said,

363
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:30,552
whatever you do, it's your private life.

364
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:34,587
I crossed the line.

365
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:35,704
Team Leader.

366
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:42,042
Why does my heart ache whenever he calls me "Employee Seo Jae Yun"?

367
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:59,940
♫ I desperately hope that you will lean on me now ♫

368
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,563
Jae Yun.

369
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:06,460
From now on, let's only focus on work.

370
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:15,940
♫ Wherever it is, I'll be by your side, so that you aren't afraid, ♫

♫ My sweetheart, my sweetheart  ♫

374

375
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:52,330

♫ I'll be your light, your tree, ♫

377
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,130
Huh?

378
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:09,660
♫ For you to rest without thinking, ♫

379

00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:19,107
Baby, stop teasing me!

382
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:22,220
Have a bite. Here you go!

383
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,294
Why is everyone a couple?

384
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,420
♫ Now tell me, instead of crying alone ♫

385
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,265
Hey, Piggy.

386
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:38,659
Do you have someone in your heart?

387
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,439
Someone who is rich and pretty.

388
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,167
Ah, no.

389
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:50,407
Wait, no.

390
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:54,030
I meant a pig like that.

391
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,970
♫ Whenever it is, ♫

392
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:03,347
You are very quiet. Okay.

393
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:07,479
Since we met for the first time today,

394
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,447
I'll tell you my story first.

395
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,109
Listen to my story first,

396
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:16,467
and you have to... you have to...

397
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:19,320
tell me about your story. Okay?

398
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,400
♫ If my existence gives you strength and comfort, ♫

399

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,250
♫ I'll be your light, your tree, ♫

401
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,873
It was my first time.

402
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:41,730
He was the first person to accept me for who I am.

403
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,530
♫ I want to become a comfortable person for you ♫

404
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,829
No matter if I like animals

405
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,510
or alcohol...

406
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,300
♫ What should I do to know ♫

407
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:56,793
Or if I...

408
00:29:56,793 --> 00:30:00,977
Or if I like men.

409
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:04,577
Also, that person keeps telling me

410
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:10,734
that I'm doing good, you know?

411
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:14,017
It's fun when I'm with him.

412
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:17,917
He's pretty hilarious.

413
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:21,182
But he's also cool.

414
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:23,677
I know I shouldn't say this.

415
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:29,453
But he thinks he's very handsome.

416
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,220
Anyway, I might have...

417
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,374
♫ I'm crying just by seeing ♫

418
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:38,480
I might have a crush on him. Do I?

419
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,140
♫ I want to be a warm person like that ♫

420
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:53,377
Thank you.

421
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:56,137
Did you know how to say something like that?

422
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,387
What about it?

423
00:30:57,387 --> 00:31:01,012
Since you're so arrogant, I thought you didn't learn how to say

424
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:04,100
"thank you" or "I love you."

425
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,063
What? Seriously.

426
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:07,833
I'm just joking.

427
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,477
Why are you getting upset so easily?

428
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:14,097
Anyway, let's do well on this project.

429
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:18,422
It's the first project that you and I are collaborating on.

430
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:20,028
But what got into you?

431
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,677
It's unusual for you to ask me a favor.

432
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:26,670
You are the best influencer in this country.

433
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:33,377
I know your cosmetic brand is famous for not collaborating with influencers.

434
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:35,957
So you made a huge decision for me.

435
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:38,088
I think you're misunderstanding something.

436
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,027
But this is all debt.

437
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:43,787
When my brand has a hard time, I'll also come to your company.

438
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:47,329
Not to you, but to get help from your father.

439
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:49,975
Sure, please do so.

440
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,437
But why did you do it?

441
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:54,817
What are you talking about?

442
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:59,857
When you didn't work, you didn't ask others for help.

443
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:05,160
And you are definitely not a third-generation chaebol who is passionate about the work.

444
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:10,547
I'm just wondering if there's a reason why you changed your attitude.

445
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,154
I just...

446
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:17,260
I just wanted to make this project successful.

447
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,100
♫ Oh Baby, you who can't fall asleep; was it difficult to walk on the path you came on? ♫

448
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,197
There are two reasons why people change.

449
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,137
What are you talking about?

450
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:29,127
The two main reasons why people change

451
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:33,723
are money and love.

452
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:38,537
But for people like us, money won't be the reason.

453
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,067
Then I guess

454
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:48,467
you finally met someone who you want to show the best side of you.

455
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,757
Oh, what is it?

456
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:55,977
That's right. You had a lot of women, but you never truly loved someone.

457
00:32:55,977 --> 00:33:00,107
Don't you know that all of your ex-girlfriends came to me to complain about you?

458
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:05,047
I thought I heard a recording because they all said the same thing.

459
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:09,277
They said they didn't know if Ji Ho Jun really loved them.

460
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:11,497
Or they said you were not interested in them.

461
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:15,930
Your relationships all ended within a couple of months as well.

462
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,147
That means I should stop here, right?

463
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,275
Okay.

464
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,815
It's already this late.

465
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:24,525
I have to go get my massage.

466
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:25,695
I'll get going first.

467
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:27,027
Hey, Song Ji Hui.

468
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:29,815
What is it?

469
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:33,220

I called you since your number was on recent calls.

474

The customer is completely drunk and passed out.

So I think you have to come and get him.

476

489
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:57,380
Sir, Sir! Please call 911 for me!

490
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,310
♫ Why does my heart beat like that?; I'm scared of being heard or getting caught, oh ♫

491
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:06,660
I'm going to put you in jail!

492
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,260
♫ It's a sound that is coming to me ♫

493
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:12,317
Please stop it...

494
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:17,180
Can you please shut up?

495
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:24,540
♫ Uh, maybe he's acting like he doesn't know ♫

496
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,150
♫ But at least I don't mind knowing him alone ♫

497
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:38,010
♫ Strangely, I don't dislike that ♫

498
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,070
♫ Just like you, just like you ♫

499
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,980
Why the heck did you drink this much?

500
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,120
♫ The world looks so beautiful ♫

501
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,210
♫ I like you, you make me up, ♫

502
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,100
♫ The vibe is always so good ♫

503
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,630
♫ Why does my heart beat like that? ♫

504
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,940
♫ I'm scared of being heard or getting caught, oh ♫

505
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,490
♫ I keep on hearing that heartbeat ♫

506
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,970
♫ It's a sound that is coming to me ♫

507
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:12,070
♫ What should I do? ♫

508
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:19,840
♫ The person in front of my eyes right now; Are these feelings right? ♫

509
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,860
♫ So that I know... Can you tell me? ♫

510
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,270
Seo... Seo Jae Yun.

511
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,390
♫ Just like you ♫

512
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,170
Please don't go.

513
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,640
♫ Just like you ♫

514
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,520
♫ I like you ♫

515
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,160
♫ Let's go; just like you, just like you ♫

516
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,090
♫ The world looks so beautiful ♫

517
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,220
♫ I like you, you make me up ♫

518
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,190
♫ The vibe is always so good, my baby ♫

519
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,630
♫ Why does my heart beat like that? ♫

520
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,060
♫ I'm scared of being heard or getting caught, oh ♫

521

♫ I keep on hearing that heartbeat ♫

522
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,560
♫ It's a sound that is coming to me ♫

523
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,283
I guess you don't remember.

524
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,897
I'm sorry? Remember what?

525
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:17,427
Employee Seo Jae Yun from the New Business Planning Team.

526
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:18,997
I heard that the chairman's son is in the office.

527
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:20,732
Not among the new permanent employees, is he?
