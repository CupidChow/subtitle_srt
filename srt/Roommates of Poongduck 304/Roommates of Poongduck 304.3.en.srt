[Roommates of Poongduck 304]

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,830
Jae Yun, thank you.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,660
Thank you.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm not thankful.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:43,150
To my knowledge, this is not the form for the Geumnam Group's weekly meeting. Am I wrong?

6
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,980
Team Leader, this is─

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,950
I'm asking Seo Jae Yun.

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, Sir. We've been using this form in the Sales Team before, so─

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,490
Do you think you are still in the Sales Team?

10
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,390
Also, it's still a wrong form, even if you used this before.

11
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,060
Then why would the Business Management Team take their time to distribute the form to each department?

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,510
I'm sorry, Sir.

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,890
It's good that you know that.

14
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,530
Please keep the basics first.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,860
I believe you all thought about the new business's direction.

16
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,770
Then...

17
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,890
Shall we start with Seo Jae Yun?

18
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,290
Sh-Should I go first?

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,060
Ah, yes...

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,700
Well, the direction I thought about was that it might be good to start with the distribution.

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,930
In Korea, there is no concept like the general discount store in Japan yet.

22
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:56,520
That idea was a big failure from the previous New Business Planning Team two years ago.

23
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,070
Isn't the case study of prior business a basic thing to do?

24
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,480
Team Leader, I was looking at that material first─

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,513
Did I ask you, Assistant Manager Kim?

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm sorry, Sir. My research wasn't enough.

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,850
Then you need to research more.

28
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,150
Pardon?

29
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,946
Jae Yun, analyze why every idea from the previous

30
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:28,157
New Business Planning Teams has failed, and submit a report.

31
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,982
The deadline is...

32
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,687
Until I'm satisfied.

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,180
Of course, don't forget to match the Geumnam's form.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,680
Then, let's hear Assistant Manager Kim's idea.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,410
Yes, Sir.

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,340
I prepared an idea related to the kiosk.

37
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,070
It's been trending these days, and...

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,030
[Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard.]

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,690
Do you think I can't do this?

40
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,340
Okay, get yourself together.

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,192
- Don't you have a band-aid?
- Band-aid?

42
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,034
Here it is.

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,771
You... I mean, Team Leader, why are you still at work?

44
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,540
- To watch you.
- Pardon?

45
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,850
I'm just kidding.

46
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,110
I forgot my phone, so I came back.

47
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, but you worked on a lot.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,299
Right.

49
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,360
Seo Jae Yun.

50
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,010
Take care of your health while working.

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,650
I just became the team leader, but I'll be in trouble if there's a work accident.

52
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,013
What did you say?

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,590
There you go.

54
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,620
You know what I meant, right?

55
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,970
Then I will really get off work now. See you tomorrow.

56
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,224
Also, I don't think I can see your face at home since I will go to bed soon.

57
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,940
Good night.

58
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,487
I can get through this.

59
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,102
It's infuriating. How many days has it been?

60
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,510
Why?

61
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,120
Are you exhausted? Are you getting tired already?

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Not at all. Why would I get tired?

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,120
I was just checking in with you.

64
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,902
But...

65
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,284
Your face is smiling, but your attitude is not.

66
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,350
Is it just my feeling?

67
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,740
Why? I'm smiling, as you can see right now.

68
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,510
When did you come to work?

69
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,775
I'm not going to tell you about it. Also, you don't really care to know.

70
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,370
Right.

71
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,260
Oh? There's coffee.

72
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,005
I wanted to have some. Do you mind if I drink this?

73
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,610
You mixed it well.

74
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,510
Jae Yun, you are good at things like this.

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,050
Let's work hard, too. Okay?

76
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,890
Cheers.

Anger is something like that.

82
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,210
It's like a cup filled with water to the brim, and a single drop makes it overflow.

83
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,620
And also, there was something I forgot.

84
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,480
I was the one with the power.

I can't even peel it off! What are you going to do about this?

93
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,210
Oh, did I not tell you that?

94
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,780
What? "Did I not tell you that?"

95
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,570
You can only park one car per unit here.

96
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,120
What?

[One car per unit. Please comply!]

Until now, I generously let you park your car. But!

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,590
You can't do that anymore.

101
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,060
What?

102
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,560
Seo Jae Yun. You don't even have a car!

103
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,470
I don't have a car!

104
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,430
But I have my Boksil.

105
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,980
What's that?

106
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,854
If you understand, can you remove your car now? This is my Boksil's spot.

107
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,270
Oh, also, Mr. Tenant.

108
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,350
"Mr. Tenant?"

109
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,568
Yes! I thought about it, and I think it's better to only call you "Team Leader" when we are in the office.

110
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,530
Seo Jae Yun. So you are going to come out like this.

111
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,640
Are you not going to regret it?

112
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,533
You better think about who crossed the line first.

113
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,464
Are you declaring war on me?

114
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:32,037
You are pretty quick-witted.

- Team Leader.

It's nothing.

What about it?

128
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh, that place? Team Leader, that restaurant is going viral

129
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,670
for its delicious food on social media right now!

130
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:17,900
I know! Team Leader, we haven't had any get-togethers yet,

131
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,570
so shall we go there together to lift our team spirit?

132
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,400
- Get-together?
- Yes!

133
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,380
Jae Yun, you can also come tonight, right?

134
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,930
What should I do? I have plans for tonight.

135
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,620
Then just the rest of us should go.

136
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,300
Three of us: Manager Choi, Assistant Manager Kim, and I.

137
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,710
- Jae Yun, you should come with us, too!
- Right, Jae Yun.

138
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,902
No! Jae Yun, you don't have to come when you don't feel like it.

139
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,340
- Let's go.
- Then, shall we push─

140
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,260
Just come with me.

141
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,448
- Manager Choi, what do you want to eat?
- Pork belly...?

142
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,320
Team Leader! It disappeared in my mouth! Wow, where did it go?

143
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,660
It would've been nice if Jae Yun could have come with us.

144
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,180
That's right.

145
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm not a person who forces anyone to come to company get-togethers. Let's stop talking about that.

146
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,770
I didn't mean it that way─

147
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,530
I noticed that your car was different, Team Leader. Did you get a new car?

148
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,890
No, I already had that one.

149
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,810
You have two cars! Then do you choose which one to ride depending on that day's mood?

150
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,920
That's so awesome!

151
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,220
No, it's not like that.

152
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,230
I'm going to ride that modest car for the time being.

153
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,850
The car I was driving this whole time...

154
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,300
It got abused horrifically,

155
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,200
so I had to say goodbye

156
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,290
for a very brief time.

157
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,010
Let's clink glasses. (T/N: wordplay, it also sounds like "It's sad, right?")

158
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,780
I guess she drank a lot.

159
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,950
She kind of got drunk after she kept drinking little by little on her own.

160
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,830
What should we do?

161
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,720
There's still meat left, so why don't we have some more drinks?

162
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,830
Sounds good.

163
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,260
- By the way, Team Leader.
- Yes?

164
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,580
Doesn't Jae Yun look like he's having a hard time lately?

165
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,530
Do you think so? I didn't think that way.

166
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,820
How can you not know that? If you just look at him, he looks exhausted.

167
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
He has crazy dark circles.

168
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,350
Assistant Manager Kim!

169
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,270
- But I was unexpectedly surprised by Jae Yun.
- What about it?

170
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,200
Honestly, all of our company's employees graduated from universities in Seoul,

171
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,330
except for Jae Yun.

172
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,920
Frankly, I was worried about him as a team member, regardless of him being the youngest.

173
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,250
But also, Jae Yun was the one who broke my prejudice.

174
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,150
He studied and worked the hardest among all the employees I've seen.

175
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,390
How should I put this? When I look at Jae Yun, he's a man of tenacity.

176
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,940
He is a man of perseverance who is serious about marketing.

177
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,340
Is that so?

178
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,960
But I'm a bit worried about him lately.

179
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,340
What are you worried about?

180
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,560
Wow, don't you know? We are worried that he might be knocked out!

181
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,190
Team Leader, we really can't function without the youngest team member.

182
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,550
So please treat him well.

183
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,480
What's wrong with you, Assistant Manager Kim?

184
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,380
Why? Did I say something wrong?

185
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,030
Cheers again.

186
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,580

Why don't you just keep going your way?

188

With whose permission? I wouldn't have started if I weren't going to see the end.

191
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,910
I'll go until the very end of this.

192
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,210
You do have strong tenacity.

193
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,070
Or is it just being very stubborn?

194
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,300
- What are you talking about it?
- There's something like that.

195
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,305
Then, why don't we do it this way?

196
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,860
Let's hit that machine, and whoever gets the higher score wins.

197
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,120
If I win, you leave the company.

198
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,927
And if you win, I leave the house.

199

Mr. Tenant, I played this for ten years. Do you see that record?

That's my record. The second one is by Seung Seok.

That's too much information.

So, are you going to play it or not?

You can't take it back.

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,450
You might be dating someone over there or something, aren't you?

321
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,410
Hey! It's not like that.

322
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,780
I know I'm your friend, but I might get weirdly jealous if you start dating someone.

323
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,900
- What? Jealous?
- Yes.

324
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,150
We are not just regular friends, are we?

325
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,160
It would be great if I could work with you as well. But I'm not capable.

326
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,330
That's so not true.

327
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,210
But I always cheer up because of you.

328
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,880
I should save a lot and buy a building like you did.

329
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,250
Hey, it's all mortgage.

330
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,460
- Hey, your parents run a restaurant, right?
- Yes.

331
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,580
If they carry stuff around, are their backs okay?

332
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,670
I think they are okay so far.

333
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,490
Okay, so far.

334
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,100
- Jae Yun.
- Yes?

335
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,270
When I saw this product, I thought of your parents immediately.

336
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,130
Okay, wow...

337
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,800
This is a full-body massage chair.

338
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,690
It's waiting for the American FDA approval.

339
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,610
I'm telling you, especially because it's you. You can't buy this now, even if you want to.

340
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,560
It's so special that I took these out first for you.

341
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,770
Wow, okay. Is that so?

342
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,074
- What's wrong?
- What?

343
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:12,406
No, I mean, I'll ask my parents first if they need one.

344
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,920
Of course, you should ask them first.

345
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:24,260
But Jae Yun, isn't a present something they need and you buy as a surprise?

346
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,050
But I'm not a person who pressures you with this kind of thing. Please don't think that way.

347
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,070
Of course, I know you're taking care of me.

348
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,800
But I have a concern these days.

349
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
A concern?

350
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,730
But what's the point of saying this? You are a busy person, and it'll just make you worry.

351
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,160
No, I have time!

352
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,640
Really?

353
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,360
You said you would be back soon.

354
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,600
Since when did someone take care of me anyway?

355
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:19,120
♫ I want to be a warm person like that ♫

356
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,720
I thought I would be the sales king this time.

357
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,570
But I got pushed to the second for three consecutive months, making me feel like this was my limit.

358
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,060
And it was hurting my pride.

359
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,710
I'm trying my best to be successful like you.

360
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,300
Seo Jae Yun! You did the right thing.

361
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,490
Seung Seok will be the sales king this month.

362
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,590
And my parents will be happy with the gift.

363
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,630
Yes. Fighting, fighting!

364
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,290
♫ Oh Baby, when I can't fall asleep ♫

365
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,120
♫ You who shines even in my dreams ♫

366
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,680
♫ I'd like to see you again; oh no, Baby! ♫

367
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,420
♫ You were so beautiful; I'm going to fall asleep ♫

368
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,690
♫ To meet you again ♫

369
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,320
Will you have a drink with me?

370
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,970
Team Leader.

371
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,950
I got the famous kitty cat punch.

372
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,650
- It's Employee Seo Jae Yun's idea.
- Really?!

373
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,710
♫ Stay in my dream, ♫
