[Roommates of Poongduck 304]

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,080
Living with someone means a series of agreements.

3
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:29,404
Even if it's a very small thing, if you don't make an agreement,

4
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,568
every moment of your life will be exhausting.

5
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:44,144
Of course, whenever you decide on things,

6
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,414
you have to go through persuasion, which we call a conversation, but in reality it's a battle,

7
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,894
so it's very energy-draining.
[Rule Agreement]

8
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:59,450
I think it's unavoidable... to live with others.

[Seung Seok, I saw your package out front, so I put it in your apartment.]

10
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:17,730
Seo Jae Yun!

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,354
You look great today.

12
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:26,284
I finally had a good night's sleep.

13
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,164
Thanks to someone.

14
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:29,554
Let's go together.

15
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,416
Go where? To the office?

16
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,884
Yes.

17
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,320
Now my car is modest as well.

18
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:41,754
I'm giving my team member a ride as the team leader, so hop on.

19
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:44,554
I won't ask you for a cab fee.

20
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:48,944
Well, it's still before 9 a.m.

21
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:52,414
It's time for you to respect me as your landlord.

22
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,015
That's right.

23
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:58,054
I will, my lord.

24
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,904
We are going the same way, so why don't we go together?

25
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:04,467
Well, if that's the case, shall we?

26
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,054
I'll see you upstairs as the team leader.

27
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,953
Okay, go on.

28
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,960
Ho Jun, the chairman wants to see you right now.
[Secretary Yun Ajeossi]

29
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:38,534
- Are you not coming?
- What?

30
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,828
Why don't you go inside first? I have to stop by somewhere beforehand.

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,222
Okay.

32
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,852
Wait a second.

33
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:52,910
You really need to be taken care of a lot.

34
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:58,189
This is for giving me a ride. I will see you in the office.

35
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,136
How is your life?

36
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,760
I know you have heard everything about where I live.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,793
What else are you curious about?

38
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,123
Also, that question is weird.

39
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,391
Father, you kicked me out,

40
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,144
but why are you asking how my life is?

41
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,054
You also think it's a weird question, right?

42
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,904
We are at the company!

43
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,958
Call me Chairman, not Father.

44
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:32,924
But there are only the three of us here.

45
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,444
You punk!

46
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:38,920
You always make me say things twice.

47
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,372
Father... I mean,

48
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:43,946
Chairman.

49
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,294
Isn't the minimum wage too harsh?

50
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,858
I heard the other team leaders

51
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:52,050
get paid hundreds of millions of won.

52
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:56,274
Those team leaders have experience, you punk.

53
00:03:56,274 --> 00:04:01,154
What did you do after graduating from college besides going around partying?

54
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:05,056
The minimum wage is more than enough for you.

55
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,634
I should just stop talking.

56
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:11,667
How is work after doing it for about a month?

57
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:16,214
I have no idea yet, since it's just been about a month.

58
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,514
You punk! Are you not going to answer sincerely?

59
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:24,464
I am your son, indeed. But why are you yelling at me whenever I say something?

60
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,970
Aigo...

61
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,811
Secretary Yun,

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,706
is the chairman experiencing andropause?

63
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,860
Aigo...

64
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,940
Aigo.

65
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,360
But Chairman...

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,888
The young master did finish selecting all the new business items.

67
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,170
Is that so?

68
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,544
Well, that's good to hear.

69
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:51,474
I thought you weren't doing anything.

70
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:03,243
As you will already know,

71
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,322
real business

72
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:08,604
is completely different from the theories that you learned in college.

73
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:11,478
I know you studied business in New York

74
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,694
and had excellent grades.

75
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:18,734
But that only means you learned the basics.

76
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,081
Now you are a team leader.

77
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,644
That means you have to do well, but on top of it,

78
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,674
managing smart employees well is also your ability.

79
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:29,934
Okay.

80
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,294
Try your best.

81
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,584
As long as you get a good result, I will raise your salary as much as you want,

82
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,414
so you won't be disappointed.

83
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:39,089
Okay, I get it.

84
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,883
Do you really understand?

85
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,983
I said I got it.

86
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,322
By the way,

87
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,984
you aren't seeing any women these days, are you?

88
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:52,644
No, I am not.

89
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,264
This punk.

90
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:56,604
You are making me nervous.

91
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:59,434
I'm saying I'm really not seeing anybody.

92
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,620
Weirdly, I don't have any interest in women these days.

93
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,750
That's one good thing to hear from you.

94
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,820
You have to get yourself together first...

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,694
and focus on work. Okay?

96
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,179
I will.

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,284
Do you have any other things to say to me?

98
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:23,684
I have to go to do the work that you love so much, Chairman.

99
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,824
Go, you punk!

100
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,428
Okay.

101
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:33,511
Then your punk will make his way out now.

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,065
By the way, Chairman,

103
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,982
we are at the company right now.

104
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,914
Don't you need to call me Team Leader Ji?

105
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:45,265
You punk!

106
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,544
Chairman, would you like some more tea?

107
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,475
No, I'm good.

108
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:04,124
But isn't it a relief that the young master comes to the office daily?

109
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,952
Right?

110
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,409
I know it's for myself,

111
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,234
but I can't let go of my expectations of him as his father.

112
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,353
I believe you also remember this.

113
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,248
When Ho Jun was in college,

114
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,465
his professor came to me

115
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:24,302
and told me multiple times that Ho Jun needed to do business.

116
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:29,924
I bragged so much about my son while playing golf at that time.

117
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:31,707
You know other people's kids

118
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:35,704
got into college by paving the grass field or constructing a building in school.

119
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:38,954
They had to pay the grants to make their kids go to college.

120
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:44,236
But my Ho Jun has earned scholarships all through college.

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,694
Chairman, you look the happiest when you talk about the young master.

122
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,478
That's why it's even more unfortunate.

123
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,475
He's a brilliant kid.

124
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,247
Why can't he get himself together?

125
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,600
Team Leader.

126
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,293
What are you thinking?

127
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:17,214
Why do you care about what I'm thinking?

128
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,204
It's time for our meeting.

129
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,512
Can the team leader be late for the meeting?

130
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:27,484
Let's go.

131
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,139
The limit of this...

132
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,364
Yes.

133
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:42,344
It seems like influencers usually take small orders.

134
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:46,274
I think it's difficult for them to handle big orders in the first place,

135
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:49,391
in both purchase management and delivery.

136
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:53,254
Well, I have an idea.

137
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,816
If that's the case,

138
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,924
can't we take care of that part?

139
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,004
Us?

140
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,336
Tell me more about it.

141
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,629
So, my idea is...

142
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,201
What if we provide

143
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,224
a purchase management program to the influencers?

144
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,887
And the delivery for the purchases through that program

145
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,678
can be connected to our affiliate, Geumnam Delivery.

146
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,764
A program...

147
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,404
What do you think about this idea?

148
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:26,539
We need to discuss it further, but it would benefit every party.

149
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,236
Right, I also think it's a good idea.

150
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,753
Our affiliate's open market has developed and are using a similar system.

151
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,804
It has great reviews as well.

152
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:39,329
So if we can bring a few from the Development Team and the task force,

153
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,367
I think it'll be a great idea to proceed similarly.

154
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,637
Then,

155
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:47,204
why don't you two review if it's possible or not?

156
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,833
Okay.

157
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,324
Let's end today's meeting here.

158
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:01,774
Thank you, everyone.

159
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,979
Thank you.

160
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:30,354
What's up with him again?

161
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,164
I have a feeling.

162
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,888
I have a sixth sense kind of feeling that this guy

163
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,970
will make my salary rise dramatically.

164
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,924
You look very pretty today.

165
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,241
Pardon?

166
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,251
It's nothing.

167
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:06,654
What's going on with him?

168
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:14,814
How's the New Business Planning Team?

169
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:16,718
It's just the beginning stage.

170
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,244
But it's not as terrible as we thought.

171
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:23,674
Right, I just had a glimpse, but the team seems to be in good spirits.

172
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:27,734
It's different from the previous teams.

173
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,023
We have to do our best.

174
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,754
So we can avoid getting assigned to rural areas.

175
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:36,434
Your team leader is a New York University business graduate, so he will do well.

176
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,244
Did he graduate from NYU?

177
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,449
Did you not know about that?

178
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,224
Not at all.

179
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,184
I also heard it from Manager Jeong from Sales Team 2.

180
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:46,794
I heard that he was famous in school.

181
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:50,414
One of Manager Jeong's friends graduated from NYU as well,

182
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:52,494
and that person said that your team leader was a very brilliant man.

183
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,218
What did they say?

184
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:57,694
You know, you plan business for the school projects, right?

185
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:00,625
And his was a very profitable model,

186
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,864
so the professor gave a standing ovation after hearing his presentation.

187
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:07,894
I guess it was a famous story from their school.

188
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,337
Anyway,

189
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,294
the point is he's a very smart guy.

190
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:15,624
But why did he not launch that business and joined this company instead?

191
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,624
Who will know about that?

192
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,822
Anyway, I thought it was odd since

193
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,244
he's quite young to be a team leader.

194
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:23,756
But I figured he was

195
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:26,984
such a talented person after hearing about him.That's why he got hired.

196
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,289
But he's still so young.

197
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,390
What the heck is that?

198
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,684
I can make a better movie than that.

199
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,441
Seriously, what is that?

200
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,814
It's absolutely boring.

201
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,275
A brilliant mind?

202
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,567
Is he really a brilliant person?

203
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,806
What?

204
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,964
I'm just wondering.

205
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,494
What is it?

206
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,241
Are you a sujae?
(T/N: "Sujae" means a brilliant person here, but it also sounds the same as handmade)

207
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:19,716
This?

208
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,154
I don't think so.

209
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:23,810
I think it's just factory-made.

210
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,154
No, I'm not talking about that.

211
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,392
I happened to hear

212
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,949
that you had excellent grades in college.

213
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,817
Did that word spread all the way to you?

214
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,484
I told Manager Jeong not to talk about it.

215
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,064
Yes, I was good in college.

216
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:46,294
I was always at the top of my class.

217
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:57,604
What's with that incredulous look on your face?

218
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:02,026
I might not look like it, but I'm your team leader from 9 a.m. until you get off work.

219
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:05,860
Why would I have gotten that position?

220
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,674
It's because I'm smart, so the chairman─

221
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:11,134
I mean, the company hired me.

222
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,294
I know, exactly.

223
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:17,624
Why? Do I look different now?

224
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:21,347
Well, a little bit?

225
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,570
What did you think of me all this time?

226
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:30,304
Well, I also thought of you differently today.

227
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,312
Differently?

228
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:32,750
Yes.

229
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,907
When I saw your portfolio to enter the company,

230
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:40,344
I thought you just got lucky with that one good idea.

231
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,494
But when I saw you at today's meeting...

232
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:43,926
Yes? At today's meeting?

233
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,885
You were great.

234
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,826
You have potential.

235
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,516
Potential?

236
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,374
Yes!

237
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:55,604
I think you have a good sense of marketing.

238
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,780
I got recognized for the first time.

239
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,952
Oh, that's right. I'm the tenant right now.

240
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,613
I shouldn't have said something like that at this hour.

241
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,004
I'm sorry, my lord.

242
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:16,100
I think today can be an exception.

243
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,914
You have been smiling a lot lately.

244
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,673
It's like the saying "Compliments make the whale dance."

245
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,890
Are you also a whale?

246
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,295
When did I smile?

247
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:35,359
I'm going to bed.

248
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,521
I guess you got shy!

249
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,154
You are leaving the room because you got embarrassed, right?

250
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:42,230
A person is still here!

251
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,424
What's wrong with you, really?

252
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,799
Huh?

253
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,264
[Seung Seok: Can you come out for a second?]

254
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,954
What are you doing?

255
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,733
What? Oh, it's nothing.

256
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,120
He's pretty cute.

257
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:16,374
- What are you doing?
- My goodness!

258
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:19,334
You surprised me.

259
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,814
Your reactions are so great. What should I do?

260
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,941
Is it fun?

261
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,379
Yes.

262
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,560
By the way, Seo Jae Yun,

263
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:32,158
where did you go last night?

264
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,324
You told me that you would go to bed.

265
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:36,196
Last night?

266
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,304
Why?

267
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,691
The remote control wasn't working,

268
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:43,918
so I was going to ask you about it, but you weren't in your room.

269
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,504
The battery might be dead.

270
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:51,084
Do you think so?

271
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:54,214
I think you can just buy new batteries on your own.

272
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,644
So where have you been?

273
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:58,185
Well, just...

274
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,853
Just?

275
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,834
I just went out somewhere close.

276
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:18,900
Everyone, please pay attention.

277
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:24,794
From now on, our team will go on two tracks.

278
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,338
Manager Choi and Assistant Manager Kim,

279
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,404
you two do project planning and system development.

280
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:32,743
And Seo Jae Yun, you and I will contact

281
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:36,446
the influencers until the market opens.

282
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:41,484
It'll be a challenging journey from now on.

283
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:46,244
But let's gather our strength and go forward to achieve the goal.

284
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,434
Yes, Team Leader!

285
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:53,104
Employee Seo Jae Yun, are you not going to answer?

286
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,484
Yes, Team Leader.

287
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:58,624
Team Leader, why don't we shout "fighting" together on that note?

288
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,894
Okay, one, two, three.

289
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,084
Fighting!

290
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:07,170
What's wrong with my throat after shouting?

291
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,820
♫ I'll hold you tight ♫

292
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,220
♫ Dreaming of you every day ♫

293
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,161
Jae Yun.

294
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,544
Yes?

295
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:24,848
I'm so jealous of you.

296
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,044
Why is that?

297
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:28,316
You are working alongside the team leader.

298
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,120
I heard that our team leader is a very brilliant person who graduated from NYU.

299
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,210
I think you'll learn a lot from him through this project.

300
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,116
I think it's possible that...

301
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:43,182
You were great. You have potential.

302
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,348
Jae Yun?

303
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:48,220
Why are you not finishing your sentence?

304
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,914
I'm sorry. What were you saying before?

305
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:54,559
You are silly. It's nothing.

306
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,435
Yes, this is Assistant Manager Kim Bit Na from the New Business Planning Team.

307
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,395
I wonder if I'm going to learn something for real.

308
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:17,484
But I question again at this point.

309
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:22,024
How is he being considered a brilliant person? How?

310
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,977
Wow, it's so hard! This is driving me crazy.

311
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,184
It's not easy to gather influencers.

312
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:34,827
But did you look into it at all?

313
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:38,510
Of course, I looked into it.

314
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,205
I asked Geumnam PR as well.

315
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,973
Oh? What did they say?

316
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,227
They said it's a total start from scratch.

317
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,261
Influencers are not like celebrities with agencies,

318
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:53,150
so we just have to contact them directly and meet them individually.

319
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,410
I wonder if there's any better way.

320
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,350
- Team Leader.
- Yes?

321
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,614
Were you really the top student at the NYU Business School?

322
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:03,964
What?

323
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,581
Seo Jae Yun.

324
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,206
Even if the best of the top workers comes,

325
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,544
there's no better solution for this kind of grinding work.

326
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,246
Team Leader, do you want to see this for a second?

327
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,384
What is it?

328
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:24,934
I thought I had to know about this if I was going to do marketing.

329
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:29,304
So I organized influencers by category on my blog all the time.

330
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:33,673
We only have to meet the ones regarding beauty and fashion.

331
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,069
So, if we do that...

332
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,851
It will be about 500 people.

333
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:45,884
I hear the sound of my annual salary going up.

334
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:56,324
It's amazing!

335
00:20:56,324 --> 00:21:01,304
Seo Jae Yun, it's not me, but you are the brilliant mind.

336
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,972
Where did this lucky charm come from?

337
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,734
A lucky charm?

338
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:24,024
Then shall we start contacting them one by one?

339
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:25,439
Wait.

340
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:30,444
Let's sort them by their follower count.

341
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:33,124
Don't you think we should start reaching out to people with a bigger impact?

342
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,647
Yes, you are right.

343
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,457
Let's do it this way.

344
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,274
Let's make a bet for higher efficiency.

345
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,280
A bet?

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,514
Yes.

347
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,674
I'll contact people regarding beauty, and you do fashion.

348
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:55,548
Let's make a bet on who will get more meetings with influencers in a week.

349
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,931
What will we bet on?

350
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:04,154
How about making a wish come true?

351
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:07,824
A wish? Making a wish come true?

352
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:09,454
Okay, sounds good.

353
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,929
Okay, you are all dead now.

354
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,380
♫ Let's go ♫

355
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:26,450
♫ Just like you, just like you; the world looks so beautiful ♫

356
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,400
♫ I like you, you make me up; the vibe is always so good, my baby ♫

357
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,380
♫ Why does my heart beat like that?; I'm scared of being heard or getting caught, oh ♫

358
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,650
♫ I keep on hearing that heartbeat; it's a sound that is coming to me ♫

359
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,650
♫ I keep on hearing that heartbeat; it's a sound that is coming to me ♫

360
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,003
Thank you for all of your hard work.

361
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:04,612
It's been some time since I launched the New Business Planning Team.

362
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:07,038
But there were no results until now,

363
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,027
so frankly, I've been unhappy about it.

364
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,413
But...

365
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:22,733
it seems like I can have some expectations now.

366
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:26,574
Assistant Manager Kim Bit Na.

367
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:27,974
Yes, Chairman.

368
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,237
The word spread all the way

369
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:33,454
to the chairman's room that you are very meticulous.

370
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,254
Keep up your good work.

371
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:39,664
Geumnam is a company that compensates you as much as you put in your hard work.

372
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:41,289
Yes, Sir.

373
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,904
Manager Choi Chu Won.

374
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:45,194
Yes, Chairman.

375
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:53,414
I heard you are giving many great ideas for the new system development.

376
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,851
I also saw the first draft.

377
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,979
You are great at project planning.

378
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,600
Thank you so much, Sir.

379
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:06,164
And are you Employee Seo Jae Yun?

380
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:07,406
Yes, Sir.

381
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,964
Okay.

382
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,469
Employee Seo Jae Yun,

383
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,507
you should learn a lot from Team Leader Ji Ho Jun.

384
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:18,174
This will all become a great experience for you.

385
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,470
Yes, Sir.

386
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:24,564
And Team Leader Ji Ho Jun.

387
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:28,976
When did you gather so many influencers in such a short time?

388
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:36,524
Everything is important,

389
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:40,294
but the core of this business is the influential people.

390
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:44,754
So when you look back later after being successful with this business,

391
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:51,099
you'll figure out how significant Team Leader Ji's work was.

392
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:56,480
Thank you.

393
00:24:58,314 --> 00:24:59,979
But Chairman...

394
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,463
The thing is...

395
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,224
Are you okay, Chairman?

396
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,384
Talking so much makes this old man thirsty.

397
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,834
Secretary Yun, can you bring me some water?

398
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,860
I will bring it to you, Sir.

399
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,694
Father... I mean,

400
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,534
Chairman.

401
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,241
Why did you suddenly come to see us?

402
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:38,994
Aren't you busy?

403
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,482
We are in the same building,

404
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:44,793
so can't I come to see what my son is doing?

405
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,484
You could have called me first.

406
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:49,404
It's not a surprise party.

407
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:56,537
I heard that your team members are pulling all-nighters every day, so they must be tired.

408
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:59,724
What else is there besides recognition and money for the employees?

409
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,344
So in times like these, the higher-ranking person should come and compliment their work

410
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:07,021
and give a monetary reward to encourage them.

411
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,110
I'm thankful for that, but─

412
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,501
Why is there a "but?"

413
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:15,574
Why are you not taking care of our youngest member?

414
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,284
What? The youngest?

415
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,734
Oh, you mean Seo Sae Yun.

416
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,769
Chairman, it's Seo Jae Yun, not Seo Sae Yun.

417
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:27,374
Our youngest member works the hardest.

418
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:30,529
But why are you not complimenting him and not paying the incentive?

419
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,275
Isn't he also part of the Geumnam Group?

420
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,574
I didn't know you knew how to take care of other people.

421
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,604
Until now, I thought you cared only about yourself.

422
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:48,390
But the thing is, he's not a permanent employee.

423
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,574
But still!

424
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:57,024
How can you not give a word of compliment to him when we all worked hard together?

425
00:26:57,024 --> 00:27:00,296
Also, the incentive is not that much money!

426
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:03,084
Can you still call yourself a businessman after doing so?

427
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:08,834
By the way, how dare you yell at your father when I spared my precious time to come see you?

428
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,324
Are you trying to lecture me right now?

429
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:12,531
Please, give it to me right now.

430
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,624
Give what?

431
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:15,217
Our youngest's incentive!

432
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,914
What?

433
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,180
Where's your wallet? Please hurry up and give it to me now.

434
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,094
Wait, you punk!

00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:21,744
- Stop it!
- Hand it over now.

436
00:27:21,744 --> 00:27:23,744
- Team Leader.
- Is it in the back pocket?

437
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:26,386
- What the heck are you doing?
- It's here.

438
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,769
Did he read and ignore it?
