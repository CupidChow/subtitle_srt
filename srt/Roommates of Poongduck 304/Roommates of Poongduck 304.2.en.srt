[Roommates of Poongduck 304]

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,986
Yes, Baby. Just a minute.

3
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,073
What's going on?

4
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,690
Secretary Yun?

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,540
I guess your last night was pretty fine, Young Master.

6
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,985
What?

7
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,010
My shirt... Do you know where my shirt is?

8
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,394
F-Father...

9
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,880
You punk! Come here!

10
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,070
- Please, Father! Please calm down and listen to me!
- How dare you cause an issue again!

11
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,456
How many times was that?

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,965
Didn't I tell you to stop dating celebrities?

13
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,970
How many times did I tell you it's not good to be gossiped about by reporters?

14
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,640
Listen, Father. I didn't do anything, but they came to me─

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,541
You punk! How dare you talk back to me?

16
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,444
Don't you know what this woman does?

17
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,469
Of course, I know what she does. She's the actress Han Ju Ah.

18
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,560
Do you even think before doing something?

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,830
Out of all people, how can you date the one who does Jinseong Group's commercial?

20
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,100
She's the one who brings all the sales for them! What do you think the reporters will say about this?

21
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,510
Well...

22
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,890
[Han Ju Ah and Ji Ho Jun are in a serious relationship. Are they going to be official?]
[Han Ju Ah is dating the heir of the Geumnam Group. When will they get married?]

23
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,420
[Caught the secret date scene of Geumnam Group's Ji Ho Jun! What about his relationship with Ms. M in the past?]
[Geumnam Group's Ji Ho Jun is dating a rival company's model! Is this a reconciliation between the two companies?]

24
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,601
I guess they can say a lot.

25
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,160
- Secretary Yun.
- Yes, Sir.

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,990
- Which newspaper company was it?
- It was the Fact Patch, Sir.

27
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,084
The news got exactly two pages like this.

28
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,670
Oh, my head.

29
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,964
How long do I have to take care of this punk?

30
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,391
Raise your head.

31
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,720
Do you think you are living comfortably because you are great?

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,150
Yes, I think so.

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,860
Unlike you, I'm tall and have wide shoulders.

34
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,726
Also, my face looks wealthy and handsome.

35
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,750
It's written on my face that "I'm a chaebol."

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,459
So how am I not supposed to be popular?

37
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,479
No, Sir.

38
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,830
I will give you a final chance.

39
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,234
What? Final?

40
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:16,950
How can you say it so scarily?

41
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,963
Even the genie of the lamp makes three wishes come true.

42
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:27,660
Well, you are not the genie.

43
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,710
- There are two conditions.
- And there are even conditions.

44
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:38,330
First, give me all the credit cards you have right now, and then go out and live on your own for two years!

45
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,005
Wait!

46
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,790
Seriously, you bastard!

47
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:52,470
Secondly, I will appoint you as a team leader in the headquarters.

48
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,450
So make a profit out of there somehow.

49
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,630
Father, why are you doing this to me? You know that I'm not interested in business─

50
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,984
When you make a profit, I will bring back all the support for you.

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,130
- Secretary Yun!
- Yes, Sir.

52
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,798
Sell all of his cars in the garage!

53
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:16,760
Wait, not my cars!

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,787
Hello, Accounting Team. Please sell all the cars of Young Master now.

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,667
Sure. We need to sell them.

56
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,860
What are you waiting for?

57
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,881
I'm sorry? Oh...

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,370
- But, Father.
- What?

59
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,460
I will get paychecks when I'm working, right?

60
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,497
Seriously...

61
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,502
This is absolutely disgusting!

62
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,404
Even if I made it with my feet, it would be more delicious.

63
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,223
I don't have any money to see any of you right now.

64
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,210
By the way, I wonder how much I will get paid for that job.
[Secretary Yun]

65
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,865
Ajeossi!

66
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,572
Yes, Ho Jun!

67
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,536
So, where are you staying right now?

68
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,077
I don't know. Don't ask me about it.

69
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,750
This is just a temporary place to stay.

70
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,130
I will move into a hotel immediately when I get paid next month.

71
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,530
Right. It's not easy to find a place that fits our young master's taste.

72
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,940
What's wrong with my taste?

73
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,460
The water pressure from the shower has to be above a certain pressure.

74
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,960
It must meet your scalp with a specific feeling between pricking and refreshing.

75
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,180
Don't you remember your nanny went through a hard time with your bath times?

76
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,329
By the way, your face looks so much better.

77
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,840
I guess you are doing great since I'm not there.

78
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,727
No! I couldn't even sleep well because I was worried about you.

79
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,321
Isn't that a pillow mark on your face?

80
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,370
Did you finally have a good night's sleep?

81
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:17,680
Anyway, Ho Jun. This is the contract that says you'll be working as Geumnam Group's New Business Planning Team's team leader.

82
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,710
Sign here, and let's move your place to a hotel next month.

83
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,720
Don't change the subject. Give me a pen.

84
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:37,286
But how much am I getting paid? 400 million won? 500 million won?

85
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,640
Wait, this doesn't have the front page.

86
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,690
- What is it? Why are you not saying anything?
- What?

87
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,780
I'm saying this doesn't have the front page. I need to know how much I'm getting paid.

88
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,440
Why don't you sign here first?

89
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,610
It's right there. Right next to your butt.

90
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,482
Why are you acting as if you put it aside on purpose?

91
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,770
Ho Jun, wait.

92
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,410
- Give it to me.
- One second, please.

93
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,978
I said, give that to me!

94
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,860
What? The annual salary is 22 million won?

95
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,570
Minimum wage?

96
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,696
Ajeossi, are you kidding me?

97
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,830
What kind of team leader in conglomerates works on a minimum wage?

98
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,327
Ho Jun, so the thing is...

99
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,050
Ho Jun, wait! Please wait!

100
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,210
Let me go.

101
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,170
Ji Ho Jun! If I go like this, the chairman will kill me.

102
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,550
I don't care. That's not my problem!

103
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,730
Don't you ever think of seeing me again unless there's another zero behind the annual salary.

104
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,840
No! Wait, Ho Jun.

105
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,860
This is the contract and your team members' résumés, so please read it all and come to work!

106
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,150
- Let me go.
- No, Ho Jun!

107
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,350
I said, let me go!

108
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:33,990
Seriously, isn't the minimum wage too harsh?

109
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,303
They all look stifling.

110
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,163
What?

111
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,420
[Résumé]
[Seo Jae Yun]

112
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,670
Your portfolio was amazing.

113
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,099
Thank you so much. I just worked hard on what I had to do.

114
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,330
I guess something good happened to you.

115
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,524
Yes, such a great thing just happened to me!

116
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,350
Oh, we haven't ordered coffee yet. Let me get it for all of us.

117
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,260
I will come with you, Sir.

118
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,140
No, please have a seat.

119
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,420
- Oh, my goodness! What should we do, Jae Yun?
- Excuse me?

120
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,280
Jae Yun, after joining this company, I wanted to quit 14 times until now.

121
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,960
But I never actually handed in the resignation letter. Do you know why?

122
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,880
What's the reason?

123
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,540
Strangely, I couldn't hand it in, as if someone was pulling my hands.

124
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,020
But now I get it. It was all to meet Team Leader Ji, like destiny!

125
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,060
He's so handsome! Amazingly handsome!

126
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,760
Wow, it's really motivating me to work.

127
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,430
I will be back from the restroom.

128
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,000
Landlord!

129
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,630
You need to build up some lower body strength.

130
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,920
Why? Do you have something to say?

131
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,870
- What's going on?
- What about it?

132
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,110
I'm asking why the heck you are here.

133
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,970
I'm not "you" but "Team Leader."

134
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,650
Team...

135
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,710
Team Leader.

136
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,429
Since you called me Team Leader, I will answer your question.

137
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,812
I got the job. That's why I'm here.

138
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,910
I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this situation.

139
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,060
So can you tell me in more detail? What happened?

140
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,862
Where should I start?

141
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,147
Did you already know that I was working here?

142
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,980
Since when? Did you already know when you were looking for the house?

143
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,530
No.

144
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,500
I figured it out about 12 hours ago.

145
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,760
I saw your résumé only yesterday.

146
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,900
Until then, I had no idea either.

147
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,190
Then are you saying this is a pure coincidence?

148
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,790
I think so.

149
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,060
Wait.

150
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,360
But if you figured it out about 12 hours ago, you should've told me beforehand!

151
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,840
This morning, yes! You could've told me this morning.

152
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,350
I told you so.

153
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,849
Landlord.

154
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,770
Where are you going?

155
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,520
I'm going out now, too. I will give you a ride.

156
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,461
Why are you staring at me? I said I will give you a ride.

157
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,530
Is he joking around with me? Seriously...

158
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
I was going to tell you at that time.

159
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,728
Anyway. Employee Seo Jae Yun, you were pretty good.

160
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
What are you talking about it?

161
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,660
Although you graduated from an online college,

162
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,210
you got hired by this conglomerate with a blind test, beating the top university graduates.

163
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,379
You didn't just get hired. You came in first place in the marketing division.

164
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
I don't feel like listening to that right now.

Why not?

166
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,490
Is it because of me, for getting the team leader position, even though I'm just your tenant?

167
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:16,960
I guess your face right now can be interpreted as, "I wanted to kick out this lousy tenant, but now I have a problem."

168

Not at all.

174
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,339
