00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,460
A year has passed

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,150
since I made a promise to someone.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,160
I want you to plan your life.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,690
So that you will be happy in the future.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,780
Especially

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,900
your belief and faith in yourself.

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:08,560
I believe that faith and self-belief
will make you achieve anything.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,600
Okay, I promise.

13
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,120
I don't know if this effort is enough
for me to ask for some blessings.

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,820
If possible,

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,450
I hope we can meet again this winter.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,150
I miss you so bad...

17
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,460
Pan.

18
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,600
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 1)

19
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,360
Who is calling me at this time?

20
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
Or...

21
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,670
will my wish come true?

22
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,030
Hello.

23
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,079
Hello, P.

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
How are you? Are you well?

25
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,260
Hello, Cher.

26
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm fine.

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,410
Good.

28
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,380
You haven't submitted any
content for upload to the blog yet.

29
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,950
So I'm worried that
something might happen to you.

30
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,579
Or maybe you have some problems.

31
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm not rushing you.

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,840
Sorry.

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm looking for beautiful places and information
for the blog and submitting to you, Cher.

34
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,779
Okay.

35
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,029
I'll wait for it. Don't take too long.

36
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,030
Please write it interestingly.

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,810
Sure.

38
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Yes, bye.

39
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,830
What should I write on the blog?

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,300
Traveling in winter is lonely enough,

41
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,050
but traveling alone is even lonelier.

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,900
I shouldn't have said that.

43
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,499
Okay, it's definitely interesting.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,120
I will upload and send it
to you as soon as possible.

45
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
What upload do you mean?

46
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Up...

47
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,210
Huh?

48
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Who are you?

49
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,930
Plai.

50
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,310
Yes.

51
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,610
Who do you think I am?

52
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Nothing.

53
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm working.

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,020
So I didn't see who was calling.

55
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,359
But you said it was
definitely interesting just now.

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
I will upload it for you.

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,840
Or...

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Did you open a sex account?

59
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,960
Sex my ass.

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,840
You are so ridiculous.

61
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,520
Alright.

62
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,160
It's not a sex account.

63
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,010
Are you free? So you have
time to call and pester me.

64
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,140
Are you free right now?

65
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
What are you doing?

66
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,050
I have no time for you.

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm eating.

68
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,870
It means you are free.

69
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,220
Let's video call.

70
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,530
I need to talk to you.

71
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,480
Are you alone?

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,790
What about Pan?

73
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,280
You'll know after we
turn on the video call.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,920
Well.

75
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
Peek-a-boo, my friend.

76
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Miss you.

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,310
Why do you look so disappointed?

78
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,930
Can't you pretend to be happy?

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,580
I told you I'm busy.

80
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm going to eat and continue working.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,990
Why do you want to video call me?

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,020
Just hurry up and say it.

83
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,030
Wow. Damn.

84
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,450
You complain nonstop.

85
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,956
I'll hang up if you don't have
anything important to say.

86
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,150
I will continue eating.

87
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,930
I asked the company for a
vacation before starting a new project.

88
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,150
And I received sponsored
plane tickets and transfers.

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,469
It's awesome.

90
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,310
So I want to travel to Japan.

91
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,209
Do you have any beautiful prefectures in
Japan that you would like to recommend?

92
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,570
I want to go on vacation.

93
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,210
What style do you want to travel?

94
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,410
Nature or city?

95
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,150
Peaceful or lively?

96
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,010
I'm okay with everything.

97
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,300
I just want to see snow this winter.

98
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,140
I want to go skiing.

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,900
Ski... snow...

100
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,350
You should go to the mountain.

101
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
There are many places.

102
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,870
What province do you live in now?

103
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,160
Shimane.

104
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
Is it beautiful there?

105
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,690
What is that province
like? I've never heard it.

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,060
It's a natural and peaceful town.

107
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,380
There are no crowds.

108
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,230
And there is an old shrine.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,580
And it has a lot of beautiful architecture.

110
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,300
Hey! Interesting.

111
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,610
Where is this province?

112
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,760
West coast of Japan.

113
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,420
You can take a plane from Osaka or Tokyo.

114
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,960
And take the train for about an hour.

115
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,170
Hey. It's pretty good.

116
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,780
You can search for pictures on
the internet to see if you like it.

117
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,670
Okay.

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,940
I chose Shimane.

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Chose!

120
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,480
Since you live there,

121
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,430
do you have a room for me for 7 days?

122
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,110
Hold on.

123
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,610
Don't you need to talk to your company?

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,600
I don't need to do it.

125
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,770
Because actually, I am the CEO.

126
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm going to hang up now.

127
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,370
Hey, I'm just kidding.

128
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,840
How many people came here?

129
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,110
Me,

130
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,150
my manager,

131
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,299
the junior artists in the company,

132
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,250
and...

133
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Who?

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,550
Pan.

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,280
There's expectation
clearly written on your face.

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,600
What do you mean?

137
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,820
When will you guys come here?

138
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Next week.

139
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,370
Huh?

140
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,900
Hey. It's okay if you're not comfortable.

141
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,920
I can ask the manager
to find another hotel.

142
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,020
Hey. It's not.

143
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,080
I just didn't think it would be that fast.

144
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,190
You can stay at my house.

145
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,860
But my house is not big.

146
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,570
You know I'm a chill person. Damn.

147
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,770
Just chill.

148
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,140
Thank you.

149
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,560
Hold on.

150
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,550
Are you alone now?

151
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,730
Yes.

152
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
Why?

153
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,930
What about Pan?

154
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Is he working?

155
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,870
Are you missing him?

156
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,910
You're trying to trick me, right?

157
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,980
No.

158
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,030
I'm just curious.

159
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,100
Why? You guys are famous now.

160
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Yeah.

161
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,620
This is his peak period.

162
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,720
He said, fans often ask him to take photos
wherever he goes.

163
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,740
And many people like him.

164
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,410
Both parents' generation,
artists, and major sponsors.

165
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,200
You keep playing hard like this.

166
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,080
Push and pull.

167
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,910
I won't help you if someone
else takes him away.

168
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,880
Which brand sponsors?

169
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,190
I won't buy them.

170
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Your jealousy of Pan is really funny.

171
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,280
Just call and ask him
yourself if you're curious.

172
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,820
Alright.

173
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,910
I won't disturb your meal time anymore.

174
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,570
I'll tell you in the chat later.

175
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
Thank you, my friend.

176
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,210
Yeah.

177
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
My pleasure.

178
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,620
Bye bye.

179
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,319
See you. Xoxo.

180
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Bye.

181
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,850
How can I have an appetite?

182
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,800
Damn. After you said this.

183
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,130
[Inasa Beach, Goddess
Benten will grant your wish]

184
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,140
Cher will definitely scold me.

185
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,690
If I start writing a topic like this.

186
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,030
I hope we can meet again this winter.

187
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,590
Why did I make a wish for us to
meet each other, not to love each other?

188
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
[The plane is about to take off]

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,520
[You don't have to
pick me up at the airport]

190
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,250
[My sponsor has already
booked a van for me]

191
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,310
[It's really great]

192
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,390
[Okay]

193
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,490
[Have a safe flight]

194
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
[See you]

195
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Pan!

196
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
P!

197
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,490
Why did you arrive so early?

198
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
What about the others?

199
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,040
Other people are at a convenience store.

200
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,180
So I rushed to see you first.

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Miss you.

202
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
Me too.

203
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,560
Wow.

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,050
Your house is so spacious.

205
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Are you here alone?

206
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeah.

207
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,850
Alone.

208
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,960
There is no one else here.

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,820
I only wait for you.

210
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm in front of you now.

211
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,690
Actually, I had something I
wanted to tell you back then.

212
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,110
But I didn't have the courage.

213
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,430
Now I'm ready.

214
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
What?

215
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,930
I...

216
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,810
I think

217
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,910
we'd better move into a room?

218
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
Wake up, P!

219
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
P!

220
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
P!

221
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,160
P!

222
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Okay! Wait a moment!

223
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,130
What the hell is this dream?

224
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,300
Damn, it's so realistic.

225
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,350
Are you okay?

226
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,650
Yeah, let's go.

227
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Let me call him first.

228
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
So cold.

229
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,850
P!

230
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,420
P!

231
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,550
What the hell are you doing!?

232
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
Louder.

233
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,260
Open the door!

234
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,230
Wow.

235
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,150
What the hell are you doing?

236
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
We're about to be frozen
while we wait for you.

237
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,520
Ton and I are thinking of
casting a spell to open your door.

238
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Well.

239
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Sorry.

240
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,670
Why didn't you call me?

241
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,230
Look.

242
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Look!

243
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,560
Well, sorry.

244
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,260
I didn't hear it.

245
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,910
What about the others?

246
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
There's only us.

247
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,980
I forgot to introduce him.

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
He is TonTaee, my manager.

249
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,960
Well.

250
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Hello...?

251
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,150
I'm P.

252
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,799
Hello, P.

253
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,250
Plai, do you have a friend this some-hand?

254
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,190
Handsome!

255
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
That's it.

256
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,209
Are you interested in
working in entertainment?

257
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,780
I will take care of you.

258
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
That's enough.

259
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,700
You are lazy even though
you have work today.

260
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,100
How will you take care of him?

261
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,070
Don't say that.

262
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,249
You should use the phrase
'I'm taking care of you'

263
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,490
Who would let my little
brother travel alone?

264
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,710
Right, P?

265
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Yeah.

266
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
He is right.

267
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,410
Are you still my friend?

268
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
What about Pan?

269
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,480
Oh.

270
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,789
Pan and PJ are working in Tokyo.

271
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,790
So they still can't come with us.

272
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,420
When will they get here?

273
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,930
They will follow us after the mis-com.

274
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Mis-com?

275
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,280
It's not like that.

276
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,120
They will follow us after
the mission is completed.

277
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,490
What do you imagine?

278
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,520
Not at all.

279
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,089
PJ and Pan are busy with work.

280
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,359
So I came here with Plai first.

281
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,030
So that I can prepare
a place for them to stay.

282
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,999
Stop making excuses.

283
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
This is 'making excuses to travel'.

284
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,880
What do you mean?

285
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,249
PJ can take care of Pan.

286
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,386
We don't need to worry about him.

287
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,510
But it's you. If I don't come
with you, you'll be lonely.

288
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,080
Stop it.

289
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Be quiet.

290
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,910
But P, do you have
anything I can help you with?

291
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
That's okay.

292
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,000
I have prepared a place for you.

293
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,040
You guys should go inside.

294
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,870
You guys must be tired from traveling.

295
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
It's cold outside.

296
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,980
Please let me tour your house.

297
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,070
Welcome.

298
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:17,276
You should have invited us
into your home a long time ago.

299
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,330
I'm about to freeze.

300
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,440
We kept talking.

301
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I'll help you.

302
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,520
What the hell did you bring?

303
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
It's really heavy.

304
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,950
Let me explore the room upstairs.

305
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
So beautiful.

306
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Is this real wood?

307
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
Real wood, right?

308
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
What?

309
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,420
Who is PJ?

310
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,540
My junior artist.

311
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,870
He works in the same company as me.

312
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,610
But it's so weird.

313
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,410
His name sounds similar to yours.

314
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,650
Why don't you work with them?

315
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,610
I took a plane here after work.

316
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,940
I would become their
third wheel if I stayed there.

317
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,730
They have events together.

318
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,530
Together?

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Like a duo artist?

320
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,300
It's not.

321
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,290
The imagined couple.

322
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
Do you know?

323
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,250
Do you know anything?

324
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,660
I should explore the house with Ton.

325
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
So headache.

326
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,540
Ton!

327
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Where are you?

328
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,280
Your house is so beautiful.

329
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,230
Is this real wood?

330
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes.

331
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Is this teak?

332
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,050
Okay, it's teak.

333
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,210
Thai teak is shipped all the way to Japan.

334
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,290
I forgot to tell you.

335
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,280
It has two bedrooms.

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,560
On this 7-day trip, you guys...

337
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,090
You and Ton can relax here comfortably.

338
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,130
I'll sleep on the sofa outside.

339
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,660
Hey, that's okay.

340
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,580
Just sleep in your bedroom.

341
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Why?

342
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,390
Because those two are
staying in Tokyo tonight.

343
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
They haven't come here yet.

344
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:46,550
Plai and I will be in the same room.

345
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,530
Those two didn't arrive here today?

346
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,090
Yeah. The event they
attended was held in the evening.

347
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,370
So I booked a hotel for
them to sleep together.

348
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,050
They haven't come here today.

349
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:02,800
They will come here tomorrow.

350
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,020
Sleep together?

351
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,840
Yes.

352
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,069
They sleep together.

353
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,929
Actually, I planned to book two rooms.

354
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,040
But as I said, I have a small budget.

355
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,716
You know the cost of living in Japan, right?
You have been in Japan for a long time.

356
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
It's expensive.

357
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,109
I teased and reserved a small room
for them to sleep in, huddled together.

358
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,629
Most importantly, I booked
an open bathroom. Clear glass.

359
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,630
They can see everything
while taking a shower.

360
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,936
Well, let's put it this way.

361
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,400
We will sleep together.

362
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,540
You just sleep in your room, P.

363
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Make yourself at home.

364
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Okay.

365
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,760
You talk like this is your home.

366
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,460
I forgot.

367
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,970
You can tour the house now.

368
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,470
I would like to go to the bathroom.

369
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,830
Won't you show us the bedroom?

370
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,730
Never mind.

371
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,300
Your friend must really need to pee.

372
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
I saw him holding in his pee
when he came out to greet us.

373
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,850
He must really need to pee.

374
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,130
Ton, you can tour the house first.

375
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,240
P!

376
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,410
Wait for me!

377
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,620
Is this really teak wood?

378
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,300
This house is so beautiful.

379
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,920
You walk so fast.

380
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,020
Why are you following me?

381
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm going to pee.

382
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,250
Just pee.

383
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,790
You just stand and stress
in front of the bathroom.

384
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,280
Why do you have to nitpick me?

385
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,830
No, I'm not.

386
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,900
I need to pee, so I followed you.

387
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,760
I'll go to the bathroom first if you don't.

388
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm not stressed.

389
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Really?

390
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:17,040
But Pan and PJ are in
the same room tonight.

391
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,590
Just two of them.

392
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,020
Two of them. Two of them. Two of them.

393
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,970
Get away!

394
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,970
I'm going to pee.

395
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,040
Where is this? So beautiful, Ton.

396
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,830
Wow, the sky.

397
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,700
I want to take pictures here.

398
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,710
The sun is so perfect.

399
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,519
The view here...

400
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,970
Look, the sun is so beautiful.

401
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,440
Look at the sea here.

402
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,810
Oh, P.

403
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm not someone who often
peeks at other people's work.

404
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,430
But I want to know the
location. It's beautiful.

405
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
It's the work I've been
working on since last night.

406
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, is that the work you
said you had to upload?

407
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,410
Yeah.

408
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,970
Have you uploaded it yet?

409
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Not yet.

410
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,380
I got feedback that
it's not interesting yet.

411
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,090
So I'm going to look for
another perspective to present.

412
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,120
So I'm planning to go there again today.

413
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,910
Is it far?

414
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,390
About...

415
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,210
About 15 minutes from here.

416
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,490
I have free time today.

417
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,950
Can I go with you?

418
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,360
Please.

419
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,899
It's so beautiful.

420
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,189
I want to send them pictures
because they are busy with work.

421
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,190
Right?

422
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,870
Plai!

423
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Will we disturb P?

424
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,330
But it's good if we go there because I'm
looking for a peaceful place to take pictures.

425
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,150
Because taking care of these two is like
taking care of a 5 or 10 year old child.

426
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,659
It gives me a headache.

427
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Ton!

428
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,070
I didn't cause that much trouble.

429
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,600
You are exaggerating.

430
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,740
See?

431
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,980
He's acting like a child.

432
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,380
I don't know if it would
bother you if we went together.

433
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,860
I don't think we'll bother you.

434
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,480
It would be like that if you say so.

435
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,760
Then, let's go.

436
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,840
Let's see who the real troublemaker is.

437
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,880
I can't believe it.

438
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,990
Okay, let me prepare myself first.

439
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,170
See you here half an hour later.

440
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,019
Plai, your room is over there.

441
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
And...

442
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,649
You can bring your
belongings into the room first.

443
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,650
Ton!

444
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,810
Hey, I'll prepare my stuff.

445
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,150
Ton!

446
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,709
What are you doing!?

447
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm getting dressed.

448
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,929
I told you your outfit is fine.
Why do you have to change your outfit?

449
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,930
No, I want to change into a nice outfit.

450
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,599
I can't believe it. Is it you
or me who is the artist?

451
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,140
Can I borrow this outfit from you?

452
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,899
No way! That's my work outfit.

453
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Let me borrow it.

454
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
P!

455
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,850
We are ready.

456
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,140
I want to go on a trip.

457
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Let's go.

458
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,720
You didn't forget anything, right?

459
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,880
No.

460
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,670
I don't need to carry anything.

461
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,590
It's only Ton who carries a lot of stuff.

462
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
You too.

463
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,980
But it's not, P.

464
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:52,070
Because we are chill tourists.

465
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,430
It's okay if we forget something.

466
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,760
But I just ask you, don't
forget your house key.

467
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,500
It's cold outside.

468
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,220
But you can always tell
us if you need any help.

469
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,630
That's okay.

470
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,730
You and Ton can feel free to wander around.

471
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,630
Hey.

472
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,150
What is the name of the
place we are going to?

473
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,540
Please find it in the map for me.

474
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,350
Hinomisaki Lighthouse.

475
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,550
How should I spell it?

476
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Hiroki?

477
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Hinomisaki.

478
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,330
It shows up. Just 15 minutes.

479
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,630
Shall we go?

480
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,050
Let's go.

481
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,800
Go!

482
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Let's go!

483
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,110
Have you heard it? My name is Hiroki.

484
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,060
Ton, calm down. The
stairs are about to break.

485
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,710
Japan, Asia. I remember it.

486
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,179
Amazing!

487
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,609
So beautiful!

488
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,930
Plai, look.

489
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,620
The weather was very nice and romantic.

490
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,110
It looks really romantic.

491
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,430
But all of us here are single.

492
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,370
You're right.

493
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,360
Single people come to romantic places.

494
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,319
I felt sad as soon as I said it.

495
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,680
Look, other people come here as couples.

496
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,920
It's okay if my friends are single like me.

497
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,080
Right?

498
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,270
Who are your friends?

499
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,360
Damn.

500
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,201
You immediately stopped
being friends with me.

501
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,780
It seems like your friend,
P, doesn't want to be single.

502
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,350
I think so.

503
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,820
We'll separate here.

504
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,260
You and Ton can take
photos in the meantime.

505
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,830
Let me do my work first.

506
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,340
Let's take a photo.

507
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,970
- Come on.
- Keep fighting.

508
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,980
Please take a photo for me.

509
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,870
Again.

510
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,010
- I want a high angle shot.
- I have to be the photographer every time.

511
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,050
Yes. Good!

512
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,590
Good.

513
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,200
P.

514
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,480
Can you move for a while?
You're blocking the view.

515
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,920
You are really a troublemaker.

516
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,310
He is working.

517
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,130
Yes. Like that. Cheese.

518
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
Cheese.

519
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,290
Yes, like that.

520
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,820
Good.

521
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,650
Let me check the picture.

522
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,360
Did it come out well?

523
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,180
Here.

524
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,850
- Wow.
- It's good.

525
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,080
Picture...

526
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,740
The pictures came out very well.

527
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,560
It's okay for here.

528
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,210
Good?

529
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,210
I will find another location.

530
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,509
I'll call you later.

531
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,806
- Oh?
- Please be my photographer.

532
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,800
Aren't you going to take a picture for me?

533
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,080
I will find the location.

534
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
Wow, I can't believe it.

535
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I should take P's photo.

536
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,240
He is focusing on his work.

537
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Yes. Good.

538
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,870
Good.

539
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,030
Good.

540
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,960
[We are traveling while waiting for you]

541
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,490
[Did you send the wrong photo?]

542
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,960
[I think you like this view]

543
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,490
[Umm]

544
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,150
[What does 'umm' mean?]

545
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
[Yes]

546
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,830
[I'll continue working]

547
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,960
[Have a nice trip]

548
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,060
[See you tomorrow]

549
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,560
So beautiful.

550
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
The weather here is also good.

551
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
P.

552
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,560
Do you do a column about lonely
and sad trip for single people?

553
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,360
Look at the view. How do
you want me to express it?

554
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,130
You can take pictures in
other places that are more lively.

555
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,900
Right there.

556
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,230
Shall we go?

557
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Let's go.

558
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,530
P, come here.

559
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,110
Walk over here.

560
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,390
Send me the camera.

561
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,290
Here.

562
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,310
Look.

563
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Good.

564
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,319
This angle is also good.

565
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
This angle is okay.

566
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,940
Good.

567
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,760
This angle is also good.

568
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Awesome.

569
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,440
That's it.

570
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,770
Look.

571
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,460
Do you see how crazy the picture looks?

572
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,550
Yeah.

573
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,680
Thank you.

574
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,350
Give it a try.

575
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Look at Ton.

576
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
So crazy.

577
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Plai, look.

578
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,330
This is the horizon.

579
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,580
Very wide.

580
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,280
Wow.

581
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,879
I got the power of the sea.

582
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,530
So beautiful, Ton.

583
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
How do you guys feel?

584
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,730
Are you guys bored?

585
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
No.

586
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,520
Look, the sky is gradually changing color.

587
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,930
It's like I've gone to another place.

588
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,590
I'm not bored either.

589
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,730
It's quiet and romantic here.

590
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,110
I love it.

591
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,860
Yes.

592
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,280
It has only one disadvantage.

593
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,419
It's windy and cold.

594
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,460
If it weren't so windy and
cold, I could stay here all day.

595
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Yes.

596
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,410
The sky here always
gets dark early in winter.

597
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,420
The weather gets colder after sunset.

598
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,770
I think we should hurry back.

599
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,140
I want those two people to see here.

600
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,370
Right?

601
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,910
Photos are not the same as
seeing it with our own eyes.

602
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,249
So beautiful.

603
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
- So happy.
- Yes.

604
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,720
If they knew we were
here after they arrived,

605
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,539
they would definitely be jealous of us.

606
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,090
Yes.

607
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:38,100
Let's take a picture and send it to them.

608
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,200
Okay.

609
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:40,650
I agree.

610
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,260
Let's take a photo.

611
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,690
P, move a little closer.

612
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
1, 2...

613
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,591
The light is so beautiful.

614
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
1, 2...

615
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,780
I took a video.

616
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,239
Vide... wow.

617
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,720
It's a pity they didn't come here.

618
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,180
They missed a lot.

619
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,630
It's so beautiful here.

620
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,560
Let's go back.

621
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:03,693
Let's go.

622
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:05,017
I can't stand it.

623
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,137
We might get sick if we stay here longer.

624
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,099
Will it make us sick?

625
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Yeah.

626
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:11,572
It might make you sick.

627
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:12,639
I don't want to go back yet.

628
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,920
You still don't want to go back?

629
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,991
Why is it so cold?

630
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:27,591
I'm not going out anymore.

631
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:30,044
It's really beautiful but very cold.

632
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:32,379
So cold.

633
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
It's cold to my bones.

634
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,080
It got better after we got into the house.

635
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:43,213
Yeah.

636
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,866
Send it to me. I'll organize it.

637
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:47,275
Hey.

638
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:48,240
That's okay.

639
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:49,515
I will do it myself.

640
00:37:50,506 --> 00:37:51,506
Ton.

641
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,048
Let P do it.

642
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:54,675
He is a strict person.

643
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:56,128
Really?

644
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,120
Then I'll leave it to you.

645
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:02,951
Oh, hold on.

646
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,151
I bought it.

647
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:12,262
Can I take it?

648
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:14,235
Organize it.

649
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:23,657
I bought it.

650
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,057
Is it too much?

651
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:39,453
Your friend

652
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,511
seems like a nice guy.

653
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,462
He looks like a neat and clean person.

654
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:45,600
Look at his house.

655
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:46,791
It's like a model house.

656
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,995
I thought it was a rental
house when I walked in.

657
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,177
He is the best.

658
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:55,920
Is he really that strict?

659
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:58,991
Eat it.

660
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,629
No.

661
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,110
Try it. Many people have reviewed it.

662
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:03,613
Just eat it.

663
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:06,373
Just eat carefully.

664
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:08,164
Don't make a mess.

665
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:10,257
Otherwise, P will scold you.

666
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:11,902
He will kick you out of the house.

667
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,502
Why is he so fierce?

668
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:21,253
Actually, this house has rules.

669
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,453
Rules?

670
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:28,720
Something like, no loud noise after
9pm or no smoking in the house?

671
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:30,564
No.

672
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,613
That's a simple rule.

673
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,497
So what is the rule?

674
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:39,333
First rule.

675
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,933
This is a simple and easy rule.

676
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:46,755
Do not make the house dirty.

677
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:03,871
Throw it away.

678
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:06,946
Ton!

679
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,640
Throw it in the trash!

680
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,373
P will kick you out of the house.

681
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:26,800
Second rule.

682
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,884
It's a common thing
that you shouldn't forget.

683
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,564
You must flush after use.

684
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:53,835
Third rule.

685
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,266
Lift the toilet lid every time you use it.

686
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,431
And don't let the pee get on the floor.

687
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:19,115
Fourth rule.

688
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:23,937
If the mirror fogs up after a
shower, you need to wipe it.

689
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,000
The fifth and final rule.

690
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:39,457
You must dry your feet
after leaving the bathroom.

691
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:41,911
Don't let your feet wet.

692
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,066
What are you doing?

693
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,853
Are you checking today's photos?

694
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,133
Yeah.

695
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,786
I have to send it to the graphics team.

696
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:22,324
Where is Ton?

697
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,208
I don't know.

698
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:26,231
He must be unpacking things in the room.

699
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:33,488
Where are you taking your suitcase?

700
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,795
I will move to another place.

701
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,595
It's hard to find a hotel around here.

702
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:42,862
It's cold outside.

703
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,457
You will shiver if you go outside.

704
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:47,955
The rules you told me are serious, right?

705
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:49,977
Yes.

706
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:56,355
I'll stay somewhere else.

707
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:00,684
You can come back anytime.

708
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,711
Bye bye. Good luck, Ton.

709
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:05,937
I will wait for you.

710
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:07,195
Bye bye.

711
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:14,537
I'm back.

712
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:18,177
It's cold outside.

713
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,093
I'm asking you seriously.

714
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:22,928
Do you have to be this strict, P?

715
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,160
Are you talking informally to me now?

716
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:28,177
I can speak politely to you.

717
00:43:29,937 --> 00:43:31,149
Just kidding.

718
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,830
Just talk to me as informally as you want.

719
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:34,862
I am not a polite person.

720
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,702
This is the identity of Mr. Damn P.

721
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:41,346
You'll get used to it soon.

722
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:47,537
I was just pushing my suitcase around.

723
00:43:47,662 --> 00:43:49,182
I haven't been exercising much lately.

724
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,800
So I want to do some
cardio to warm up my body.

725
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:53,391
Can I go with you?

726
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:54,764
I want to do cardio too.

727
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:56,142
I'm going back inside now.

728
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:57,337
For what?

729
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,702
Your manager is so funny.

730
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:02,293
Yeah.

731
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:03,697
He is an entertainment unit.

732
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,831
I shouldn't disturb your work time.

733
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,266
Bye.

734
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,631
Hey, Plai!

735
00:45:21,982 --> 00:45:22,577
Huh?

736
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Why?

737
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:26,773
You don't bother me,

738
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:29,893
but the smell of your
noodles bothers me the most.

739
00:45:31,502 --> 00:45:32,502
Really?

740
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:34,346
I didn't know before.

741
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:37,120
Do you want to eat it?

742
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:39,733
There's still hot water.
I'll make it for you.

743
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:41,635
No.

744
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:44,382
I have to revise my work.
Otherwise, I'll be late.

745
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:46,466
Huh?

746
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,702
Revise?

747
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,120
Do you have an idea?

748
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:58,977
Previously, I presented this place as nice
and quiet, perfect for a family outing.

749
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:06,275
But after I went there again today, I thought
of presenting it in a relationship way.

750
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,057
How do you present it?

751
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:17,644
I'll present, this place is perfect
for lonely people, people in love,

752
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,466
and people who love themselves.

753
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,177
It's perfect not only with family,
but with friends and lovers as well.

754
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:28,151
Just hearing it briefly,

755
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,711
I felt it was right.

756
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,053
This idea is brilliant.

757
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:33,724
You're right.

758
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:34,755
I think it works.

759
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,026
I would like to buy this idea.

760
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:38,906
People will definitely want to visit here.

761
00:46:39,973 --> 00:46:40,973
Well.

762
00:46:41,004 --> 00:46:42,320
I hope this idea gets approved.

763
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:06,097
You are a health person.

764
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:08,471
You drink tea while working.

765
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,537
It's not.

766
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,662
I used to drink beer regularly.

767
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:18,053
I've wanted to ask you for a long time.

768
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:24,124
Why did you change from beer to hot tea?

769
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:27,591
I've never even seen you
put a beer down before.

770
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:28,884
Huh?

771
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:30,111
Why?

772
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,720
Someone told me to cut back on my beer.

773
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:38,124
Told me to use natural
remedies to relieve work stress.

774
00:47:39,546 --> 00:47:41,346
It made my body feel
better after I tried it.

775
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:42,977
So I tried to reduce my beer drinking.

776
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:44,462
But I have stopped drinking now.

777
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:47,004
The fact that they can
make you so obedient...

778
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:48,897
It's definitely your wife.

779
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,991
He was speechless.

780
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,520
Plai, I think your friend secretly
has a wife and didn't tell you.

781
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:01,595
Hey.

782
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,779
You have a wife and you didn't tell me?

783
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,444
Huh?

784
00:48:04,755 --> 00:48:05,755
No.

785
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:07,128
How can that be true?

786
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:13,568
Do you like here?

787
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:15,506
Yes.

788
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,466
I often stay in places
with lots of trees like this

789
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:22,133
when I don't have any
ideas for writing songs.

790
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,248
My eyes feel relaxed

791
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:25,453
and comfortable.

792
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:27,226
It gave me a lot of ideas.

793
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,404
If you don't believe me,

794
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,124
change from a bar

795
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,168
to a place with lots of trees.

796
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:44,897
You are absent-minded

797
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:46,951
and smiling like this.

798
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:50,151
If it's not your wife,

799
00:48:50,373 --> 00:48:51,629
it definitely be someone
you have a crush on.

800
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:52,653
Ton.

801
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:54,115
Don't tease him too much.

802
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:56,008
He might kick you out of the house.

803
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:57,217
Oh.

804
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:58,484
Sorry.

805
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,533
How did you meet them?

806
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:06,311
Have you ever heard the phrase
'Birds of a feather flock together'?

807
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,320
'Evil people gather together'.

808
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,537
I have a senior who runs
an entertainment company.

809
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:12,844
We already know each other.

810
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,302
He asked if I wanted to work with him.

811
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,850
So I told him, okay.

812
00:49:16,408 --> 00:49:18,835
So I became their manager.

813
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,546
I don't know if it's fate or karma.

814
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:23,088
I think it's karma.

815
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:24,146
My karma.

816
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:25,511
My karma!

817
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,617
Artists like us have to
take care of managers.

818
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:31,528
I can't believe it.

819
00:49:32,986 --> 00:49:34,248
Don't talk too much.

820
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:37,386
P probably doesn't respect me.

821
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:51,928
Oh?

822
00:49:52,328 --> 00:49:53,328
Is your work done?

823
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:56,160
I'm done.

824
00:49:56,231 --> 00:49:57,831
I've been working on this since morning.

825
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:02,928
What would you like to eat for breakfast?

826
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:06,506
I think I'll take a walk around here.

827
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:07,933
I will buy it for you.

828
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,977
I don't usually eat
anything in the morning.

829
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:14,693
But if you find something
delicious, buy it for me.

830
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:16,466
Okay.

831
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:20,631
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

832
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,217
Good night.

833
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:30,633
Thank you for allowing me to stay here.

834
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:31,386
Good night.

835
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,297
Good night.

836
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:35,142
Did I pronounce it wrong?

837
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:35,893
You pronounced it correctly.

838
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:37,186
Superb.

839
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:38,955
What flavor do you eat?

840
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:41,155
Same flavor as you.

841
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:43,440
My lips have turned red.

842
00:50:44,248 --> 00:50:45,248
My mouth is burning.

843
00:50:48,515 --> 00:50:49,635
Japanese ramen is delicious.

844
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:47,271
How are you tonight?

845
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:49,168
Pan.

846
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:07,040
Hey!

847
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:08,262
Who are you?

848
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,920
How could he do that?

849
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,400
Haven't you stopped yet?

850
00:52:13,582 --> 00:52:14,582
I told you to stop!

851
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:16,706
Hey!

852
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:18,786
I told you to stop!

853
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:21,626
Hey!

854
00:52:21,982 --> 00:52:22,982
Who are you?

855
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:24,551
How could he do that?

856
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:26,848
Haven't you stopped yet?

857
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:29,866
I told you to stop!

858
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:31,746
No!

859
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:40,088
I'll punch him if I keep dreaming.

860
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,137
Who's knocking at my door?

861
00:52:54,195 --> 00:52:55,195
Pan!

862
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,280
Pan.

863
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:17,644
It's here, right?

864
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:19,662
Your friend's house.
