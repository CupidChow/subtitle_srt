3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,510
(What do you want me to do ka, baby?)

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,010
(I will stay up all night talking to you ka, baby)

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
(Would you like me to put it in?)

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,690
PJ!

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,300
Yes, Ton.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,200
What are you doing?

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,600
Nothing.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,590
I heard laughter from the room.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,100
So I'm just going to knock on the door.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,940
They probably haven't gone to bed yet.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,040
Don't bother with them.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,800
Come here.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,250
Take me to the bathroom.

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,860
P will scold me if I make a mess.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,210
You have to go to bed immediately
after you take me to the bathroom.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,540
Otherwise, you won't be able to wake up early.

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm definitely awake!

20
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,960
Come on. Go to the bathroom.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,650
Wait, it's over there.

22
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,600
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 6)

23
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,960
Good morning ka. (Thai polite particles)

24
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,680
Stop saying it.

25
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,990
You like it, don't you?

26
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,310
Stop teasing me.

27
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,430
Not at all.

28
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,400
I will say it often if you like it.

29
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Stop it.

30
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,260
What would I do if you accidentally said it to someone else?

31
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
I will say it only to you.

32
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,250
You should speak less, as you did earlier.

33
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,580
Come on. Let's go take a shower.

34
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,300
Are you crazy?

35
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,880
What if the others catch us?

36
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Are you molesting me?

37
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,150
You can't leave the room then.

38
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,610
Stop it.

39
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,170
Just last night, I almost didn't sleep.

40
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,060
Who said he wanted to talk to me?

41
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,040
Stop saying it.

42
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,250
You molested me again.

43
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,220
Why?

44
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,410
Why? Huh?

45
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,340
Huh?

46
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,360
Huh?

47
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,040
You must be kissed.

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,810
Let me do it again.

49
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,050
Stop.

50
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Stop.

51
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,520
You did it all night long.

52
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,560
Just one more time shouldn't be a problem.

53
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,630
That's enough.

54
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm going to have a shower.

55
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,060
Can you get up ka?

56
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Please carry me ka.

57
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,090
How was it?

58
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,390
Are you losing control?

59
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,400
You're gonna get it.

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,420
That's enough.

61
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm exhausted.

62
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,650
I'm going to take a shower.

63
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
Hurry up and follow me.

64
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,320
Oh, Ton.

65
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,460
You woke up?

66
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,450
I'm going to take a shower now.

67
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,430
Are you asking me that question with confidence?

68
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,290
I didn't sleep.

69
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,280
He's really in a good mood.

70
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,610
How many times have you done it last night?

71
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Are you hungover?

72
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,660
What is up with you?

73
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,840
Again.

74
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,960
You asked me that question with confidence.

75
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,220
Why?

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you like it ka?

77
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,300
Do you feel spasm ka?

78
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,770
Do you think I can freaking sleep?

79
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,200
Did you hear it?

80
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
It's more than just hearing.

81
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,700
You should sleep here.

82
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,970
I'll moan in the room for you to hear.

83
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,210
That's okay.

84
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,310
I don't care what you do.

85
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
But you should be careful.

86
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,800
What would you do if PJ heard it last night?

87
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,090
You know the relationship between me and Pan...

88
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,330
More than knowing.

89
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,270
Who am I?

90
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,470
I'm the manager.

91
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,110
I noticed everything.

92
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,670
And you...

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,760
I have nothing to scold you guys.

94
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,920
But you have to be careful.

95
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,940
You should be careful when you go outside, understand?

96
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,160
Don't let it affect Pan's work.

97
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,650
It will damage him.

98
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,850
It's not just Pan, it's me too.

99
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,510
Do you love him?

100
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,420
If you love him,

101
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
you wouldn't want him to lose his job, right?

102
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,400
Yes.

103
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
This is an example.

104
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,030
If you guys hook up again.

105
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,820
Turn down your volume.

106
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,200
But if you really can't hold it in.

107
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,040
It will help you.

108
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,840
I used to do it in the back of the car.

109
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Like this.

110
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,920
Did you hear that?

111
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,140
No, right?

112
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,250
It can help you.

113
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,620
Cover your mouth with your hand.

114
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,370
Cover them.

115
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,790
Cover your whole mouth.

116
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,650
Did you see it?

117
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,910
It will sound muffled.

118
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,130
Are you awake?

119
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,720
Yes.

120
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
You were so drunk last night.

121
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,240
Do you remember?

122
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,270
No.

123
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,370
Hey. I didn't do anything bad, did I?

124
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,470
Who told you?

125
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,530
You almost hook me up last night.

126
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,360
You really don't remember it?

127
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,270
Not at all.

128
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,410
I didn't do it at all.

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,840
Didn't do it?

130
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,480
Why do you look so confident?

131
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,250
Otherwise, how could you have hugged me last night?

132
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,000
Why?

133
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
I don't get it.

134
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,700
Kind.

135
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,210
Stop being so nice to me.

136
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,560
Plai.

137
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,720
Don't ask anyone to sleep like that again.

138
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Otherwise, I'll hook you up.

139
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,710
Like this.

140
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,940
Don't ask anyone to sleep like that again.

141
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,650
Otherwise, I'll hook you up.

142
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
Like this.

143
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm sorry

144
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,930
for my crazy dreams.

145
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,140
Don't get mad at drunk people like me.

146
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,490
Why do you have to apologize to me?

147
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,540
I'm not mad at you.

148
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,350
It's normal for drunk people to have strange dreams.

149
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,780
You shouldn't drink too much, Plai.

150
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,810
Why?

151
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,010
Do you have a headache?

152
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,440
No.

153
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,950
I'm embarrassed.

154
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,650
Please forget it if I did something bad.

155
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,640
Stop it.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,030
You guys laughed all night long.

157
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,460
How can I sleep?

158
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,280
You haven't slept?

159
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,340
Of course.

160
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,860
I know everything.

161
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,040
I can imagine what kind of poses you guys are in.

162
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,270
Please drink something hot to get rid of your hangover.

163
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,080
Don't be nice to me.

164
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,200
You guys are... really.

165
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,210
You can sleep at home if you are tired.

166
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll go, even if I'm exhausted.

167
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You guys might cause more trouble.

168
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,850
Drink it slowly.

169
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,460
It's hot.

170
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,760
What's wrong with these two again?

171
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,440
You guys just keep looking at each other.

172
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,280
What's wrong with you guys?

173
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:09,810
Huh?

174
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,170
What's wrong with you guys?

175
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,970
No.

176
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,720
Nothing.

177
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,020
Are you sure?

178
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,020
Don't let me know that a problem has occurred.

179
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,730
How could this be a problem?

180
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,340
Why do you need to worry?

181
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
Why shouldn't I worry?

182
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,780
You guys have been causing trouble
every single day on this Japan trip.

183
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,010
Taking care of you guys is like getting all the ducks in a row.

184
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,760
We don't cause any trouble anymore.

185
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,900
Where are we going today?

186
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,480
I heard you wanted to go play in the snow, didn't you?

187
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,600
Huh?

188
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,870
Don't tell me...

189
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,590
Since you came here in winter,

190
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,820
and the weather is nice today.

191
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,870
So I'm going to take you guys skiing.

192
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Seriously?

193
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,910
I've wanted to ski for a long time.

194
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,880
Really?

195
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,330
I want to take photos that
look like a young celebrity with lots of activities.

196
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm trying to think about your feelings.

197
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,660
You can play it.

198
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,670
But there are some prohibitions.

199
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,190
Don't do any pranks.

200
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,370
I will punish you if you get hurt.

201
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,370
Get it?

202
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,620
Yes.

203
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,140
Let's get ready.

204
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I would like to see snow too.

205
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,990
I haven't skied in a long time.

206
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,030
I really want to go skiing.

207
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,900
I think I haven't skied in many years.

208
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,380
I haven't experienced it before.

209
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,020
Is the snow in Japan whiter than in other countries?

210
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,630
Hello! We are now at Kotobiki Forest Park.

211
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,260
Today we're going skiing and snowboarding!

212
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,870
What are you guys doing?

213
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,730
Hey, P is here.

214
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,530
Look at this.

215
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,380
Our ski outfits are so cool.

216
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,520
Okay.

217
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,580
You should walk in cool poses like us.

218
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,560
That's okay, Ton.

219
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,300
You should do it for him once.

220
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,610
So that we can go skiing.

221
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,110
Go.

222
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes. Come on.

223
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,550
Right there.

224
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,440
Go there.

225
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Starting point.

226
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,120
Walk in a cool way.

227
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,880
Hurry up.

228
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,650
Hurry.

229
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,320
Right there.

230
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,220
Make a cool pose.

231
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,090
Yes!

232
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,660
3, 2, 1 Come on!

233
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,860
Wow.

234
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,700
So cool.

235
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
So cool, man.

236
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,370
Let's applaud our friends!

237
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,570
Plai, Pan.

238
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,150
Huh?

239
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
Do I look handsome now?

240
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,570
Yes, you are.

241
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,830
So what are we waiting for?

242
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,840
Let's go!

243
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,670
Hurry up!

244
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,780
P.

245
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,070
You appeared on my camera.

246
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,320
Or do you want to take a selfie with me?

247
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,910
Huh?

248
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
You can do that.

249
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,380
I don't have a partner yet.

250
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,150
Okay?

251
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,270
It's okay.

252
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,400
Well, I'll take a selfie alone.

253
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,780
P.

254
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,150
Let's take a selfie.

255
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,830
Some fans want to know your warp (social media).

256
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,920
What is warp?

257
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,520
Like Facebook or Instagram.

258
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,390
I haven't used it for a long time.

259
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,620
I forgot my password.

260
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,860
Would you like me to sign up for a new one for you?

261
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,970
It's okay.

262
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,760
Just the travel pages and blogs
are giving me a headache enough.

263
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,590
You have a travel blog.

264
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,650
1, 2, 3!

265
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,510
I'll be right back.

266
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,550
PJ.

267
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,540
It's good that you came.

268
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,020
Please help me check this.

269
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,920
Which picture do you think I should post?

270
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
I think all the pictures are similar.

271
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,820
Where is the similarity?

272
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,800
Look carefully.

273
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,750
In this photo, my right side of the mouth is up higher.

274
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,280
Do you see the angle of my mouth?

275
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,270
It's different.

276
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,720
I think this picture is good.

277
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,010
You smile a little.

278
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,040
It's cute.

279
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,240
You have really sharp eyes.

280
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,090
I also selected this image.

281
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,920
I will post it later.

282
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,370
Ton. It's your turn.

283
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,090
What?

284
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,800
Do you think I should post a selfie with P?

285
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,270
It may become a dramatic issue again.

286
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,340
It won't be like that.

287
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,640
Trust me.

288
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Now everyone wants to see P.

289
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,940
I think it's good timing.

290
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,990
We will get a lot of engagement.

291
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,800
Is it good?

292
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,930
You have good reason.

293
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,350
But before you post it,

294
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,640
you have to ask if he allows you to post it.

295
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,200
Don't post it if he doesn't give permission.

296
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,200
Yes, sir!

297
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,640
P.

298
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,680
Can I post a selfie with you on IG?

299
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,110
Hey!

300
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,270
Would that be a good idea?

301
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,290
Of course!

302
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,250
Everyone wants to see you.

303
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,530
Also, I asked for permission from Ton.

304
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,350
He doesn't mind me.

305
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,890
He told me to ask your permission.

306
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,890
But what if there is a problem...?

307
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
No way.

308
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,730
Trust me.

309
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,810
'The snow that dropped couldn't make my handsomeness drop'

310
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,720

# DoubleHandsome #Promote_the_handsome_blogger #RoamWithP]

315
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,820
Don't worry.

316
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,600
I'll go look for Pan and Plai there.

317
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,390
Okay.

318
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,660
Let's take a selfie.

319
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,030
Come on, let's selfie.

320
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,840
1, 2, 3.

321
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,560
What's up?

322
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Are you okay?

323
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,320
You have to stand like this

324
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,780
and make your legs strong.

325
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,150
Yeah. And...

326
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,500
Bend your legs like this.

327
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,550
Yeah.

328
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,520
Okay?

329
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,320
Like this.

330
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,380
Yeah.

331
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,520
Your posture is okay.

332
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,320
Nice.

333
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm worried that it'll be okay just for the pose.

334
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,550
You will do well if your posture is beautiful.

335
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,440
Be careful.

336
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,520
Is it okay?

337
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah.

338
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,210
Ready?

339
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,400
No.

340
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,560
Are you afraid of falling?

341
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,710
I'll apply medicine to you if you fall.

342
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,440
Be careful.

343
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,280
You promised.

344
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,690
Can you play it?

345
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,500
I played it once with Pan.

346
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,800
I'll be right back.

347
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,350
I'll go with you.

348
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,330
Why are you following me?

349
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,950
Wait for me.

350
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,320
Don't follow me.

351
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,200
This is how to make a turn.

352
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,610
Yeah.

353
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,300
- Tilt the body like this?
- Yes.

354
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,170
If I tilt my body too much, it will...

355
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,990
I think I know how to play it.

356
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,440
Please show me some samples.

357
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,170
So you want that?

358
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,780
Yeah.

359
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,420
So I'll leave my phone with you.

360
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,450
Ahem!

361
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,410
You guys don't seem the least bit suspicious, maybe.

362
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,270
Where were you before?

363
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,370
Around there.

364
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,250
Uh, Ton.

365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
You don't have to worry at all.

366
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,560
The two of us kept a distance of 1 meter.

367
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,860
There's definitely no problem if someone sees or takes a photo of us.

368
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,260
There's definitely no problem?

369
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,740
It can.

370
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
You just keep backing in and out of him.

371
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,070
You're acting weird.

372
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,640
Just act natural.

373
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,720
I only ask one thing, don't reveal too much.

374
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,480
So you want that?

375
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,680
Of course!

376
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,170
You keep backing in and out.

377
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,790
I think you are dancing the waltz.

378
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,420
My head hurts. My heart frets.

379
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,370
Oh? Where are you going?

380
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm going to take the cable car.

381
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,790
Do you want to go up the cable car together?

382
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,010
Yeah.

383
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,860
Let's go.

384
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,610
Plai. Wait for me.

385
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm going to the toilet.

386
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,200
It's not true.

387
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
You are avoiding me.

388
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,840
What do you mean I'm avoiding you?

389
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
It's ridiculous.

390
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,520
You're running away from me like this.
If it's not avoiding me, what does it mean?

391
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,350
I'm going to the toilet.

392
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,510
I will go with you.

393
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,940
Why would you go to the toilet if you don't want to use it?

394
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,460
I want to use the bathroom.

395
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,480
I'm feeling better.

396
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,480
I'm going to continue playing.

397
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,390
Please teach me.

398
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,890
Ask Pan to teach you.

399
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,990
They've all taken the cable car.

400
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,010
Well.

401
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,010
I will teach you.

402
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,780
If you guys are going to look at each other like this,

403
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,080
should you guys just kiss?

404
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,410
We can?

405
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,470
I'm sarcastic!

406
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,960
Follow me!

407
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,660
Yes, Ton.

408
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,760
Follow me!

409
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,370
Hurry up!

410
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,100
Will I have the chance to ask you to be my boyfriend?

411
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,460
Well, I'll play with you.

412
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,680
Why are you taking pictures of me?

413
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,320
You still haven't stopped?

414
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
Why are you laughing?

415
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,240
You still haven't helped me?

416
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,690
Why are you sitting there?

417
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,050
Are you tired?

418
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,560
Hey!

419
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,660
Won't you help me?

420
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,980
I'll go now.

421
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,860
Oh.

422
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,690
Ouch.

423
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
What happened?

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,780
Does your leg hurt?

425
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,530
My leg hurts.

426
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,280
Around my calves.

427
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,250
I think you definitely have cramps.

428
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,040
I'll take you to rest there.

429
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,320
My board.

430
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,490
I'll carry it for you.

431
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,360
Are you okay?

432
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,670
Walk slowly.

433
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,950
Are you feeling better?

434
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,580
Where?

435
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,450
Around here.

436
00:30:53,230 --> 00:31:01,230
Did you know? Cramps are caused by
a lack of potassium, magnesium and calcium.

437
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,650
Are you lacking rest?

438
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,810
Thank you.

439
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,930
I feel better now.

440
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,570
It's so cold.

441
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,890
Why is it so cold?

442
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,390
Why is the evening air so cold here?

443
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,750
You're right.

444
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,870
My muscles are beating.

445
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,480
I'm definitely going to get cramps tonight.

446
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,240
I should let you use the sauna room.

447
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,860
It helps your body relax.

448
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,910
It reduces cramps after exercise.

449
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,530
Nice idea.

450
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,020
Plai.

451
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,200
Will you go to the sauna with me?

452
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:22,880
No.

453
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,640
I will take a shower and go to bed immediately.

454
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,750
But you just got a cramp.

455
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,480
Oh, Plai.

456
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,560
Do you have cramps?

457
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,910
Just a little bit.

458
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,290
It's not that serious.

459
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,360
You're hiding your illness from me again.

460
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,890
I'm your manager.

461
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,760
Hey, Ton.

462
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,360
It's not serious.

463
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,750
I think you should try the sauna.

464
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,340
So that you won't have as much pain tomorrow.

465
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah. I agree with P.

466
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,010
So that you can feel better. Go.

467
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,890
I'll wait for you there.

468
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,400
Follow me later.

469
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,610
Would you like to go to the sauna

470
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,520
or would you like me to massage you?

471
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,360
Ton, please be gentle.

472
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,530
You have a cramp.

473
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,720
You're making his condition worse!

474
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,170
Well. I'll go!

475
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,390
I'll go.

476
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,170
You're going now, right?

477
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,200
I shouldn't have helped him.

478
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,800
My tendons are tense.

479
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,400
You are always like this.

480
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,060
You often do things without realizing your age.

481
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,250
What age do you mean?

482
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,730
Slap your mouth three times.

483
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,340
That's my face!

484
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,140
I will do it again as an apology.

485
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,830
You're crossing the line too much.

486
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,560
I'm sorry.

487
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,030
What about the other side? Try standing up.

488
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,100
You massaged my fart trigger points.

489
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Don't massage there!

490
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,140
It stinks so bad, Ton.

491
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,920
Massage that tip right there!

492
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,980
What did you eat?

493
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,680
Don't talk too much.

494
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,330
Stop massaging him. He'll fart again.

495
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,920
You massaged my fart trigger points.

496
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,480
Hey, what are you guys doing?

497
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,900
Is your sauna working properly?

498
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,140
It works normally.

499
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,750
That's good.

500
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,300
I need to tell you the rules for using the sauna.

501
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,680
First, you need to shower to reduce the spread of germs.

502
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,880
After that, you need to drink a lot of water.

503
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,790
To prevent dehydration.

504
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,600
Oh, don't forget to take off all your accessories.

505
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,060
To be safe and not dangerous.

506
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,460
You must wear a towel and slippers before entering.

507
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,380
For the first step,

508
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,220
people who have never been in a sauna
should go in for 5-10 minutes first.

509
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,630
After that, go outside and rest for 10-15 minutes.

510
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,800
Drink some water and go back in.

511
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,410
But if you feel dizzy or weak, you must come out immediately.

512
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,170
Yes, sir.

513
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,620
Did you copy the rules from a real sauna?

514
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,230
I should tell you just in case.

515
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,720
What if they are in danger?

516
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,120
Okay.

517
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,180
Thank you.

518
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,380
Is there any more water here?

519
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,830
I saw only one bottle of water left this morning.

520
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,350
Then I'll go outside and buy water.

521
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,130
Come on. Don't prolong it.

522
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,210
Let's take a shower.

523
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,300
Okay.

524
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,280
Pan.

525
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:21,720
Huh?

526
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,320
Would you like to buy anything else?

527
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,230
No.

528
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,040
Be careful when you go outside.

529
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,300
Uh...

530
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,200
You won't go with me, will you?

531
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,450
Yeah.

532
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
No one wants to buy anything else, right?

533
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,270
Go take a shower!

534
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,510
I told you to take a shower!

535
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,880
I think that wasn't my trigger point just now.

536
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,850
I'm really having stomach cramps.

537
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,280
Hurry up, Ton.

538
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,810
I'm going to the sauna after this.

539
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,180
Plai, you first.

540
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,430
Are you feeling better from the cramps?

541
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
I have a little pain.

542
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,560
But it's not serious anymore.

543
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,710
Let me know if you have that symptom again.

544
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,340
I will give you a massage.

545
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,240
You don't have to do it.

546
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,510
It's not that serious.

547
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,050
Are you uncomfortable when you're with me?

548
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,120
Why do you have to run away or avoid me?

549
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,560
Did I do something to make you feel bad or angry?

550
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,360
Normally, we are not close to each other.

551
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,300
You don't need to care about it.

552
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,070
Please act normally as usual.

553
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,200
Don't try to approach me

554
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,930
and say it was me who avoided you.

555
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,940
Why can't I approach you?

556
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,170
I feel uncomfortable.

557
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,250
You are lying.

558
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,680
The atmosphere between us yesterday was still good.

559
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,020
Nothing was true that day.

560
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,610
We just disguised ourselves as PJ-Pan.

561
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,550
Fans' imaginary couple.

562
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,210
It may not be true for you.

563
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,950
But for me,

564
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,660
I never saw you as Pan.

565
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,470
I'm sorry

566
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,660
if I made you uncomfortable.

567
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,460
It's good

568
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
that we stopped here.

569
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,480
Since we are staying at his house.

570
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,590
Let's plan a surprise birthday party for him.

571
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,100
Who will buy the cake?

572
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,850
I forgot about the cake!

573
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,210
How do we surprise him?

574
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,000
We can buy it later.

575
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,360
Who will hold the cake?

576
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,240
You.

577
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,380
Who lit the candle?

578
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,100
You.

579
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,860
Don't you think of giving other people other duties?

580
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,720
What are your duties, PJ?

581
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,720
I will sing the birthday song.

582
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,710
Hey. You can't.

583
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,270
It will...

584
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,680
Let's split up!

585
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,630
Split up?

586
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,840
Hello.

587
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,030
- I'm so sleepy.
- It was a long day.

588
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,480
Let's clean up.

589
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,360
Plai.

590
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,220
I'd like to go to bed.

591
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,930
Let's go to bed.

592
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,870
I'm going to bed now.

593
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,420
What are you doing?

594
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,260
Nothing.

595
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,300
Just keep scrolling.

596
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,170
Plai.

597
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,080
Huh?

598
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,800
What happened between you and PJ?

599
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,880
Is it okay?

600
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,460
Just... nothing.

601
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,500
It's normal.

602
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,820
Plai.

603
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,040
I'm your brother.

604
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,400
How can I not know how you feel about him?

605
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,260
When I feel it, I can stop feeling it.

606
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,200
One more thing.

607
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,790
It's impossible.

608
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,280
Why is it impossible?

609
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,660
Have you tried it yet?

610
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,360
Huh?

611
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,950
You don't need to pay attention to it.

612
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,740
Just focus on yourself.

613
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,360
What are you going to do next?

614
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,280
Huh?

615
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,560
I don't know.

616
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,950
I don't know what to do.

617
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,710
It feels just like last time, doesn't it?

618
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,480
Yeah.

619
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,780
Exactly.

620
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,570
Hey. Wait.

621
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,840
Huh?

622
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,710
Me?

623
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,870
Yeah.

624
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,690
Did you call the wrong person?

625
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,730
Well. I'll talk to you.

626
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,020
What do you want to talk to me about?

627
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,080
Umm...

628
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,480
I'd like to ask Pan for a relationship.

629
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,040
What do you think I should do?

630
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,100
I have tomorrow as my last day.

631
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,350
I can ask him before he goes back.

632
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,150
I don't want to wait for him for years anymore.

633
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,020
I feel you, P.

634
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,790
But I'm worried about Pan too.

635
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,010
I don't know how serious you are with him.

636
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,020
But we are going back to Thailand soon.

637
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,770
The distance is far.

638
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,310
How do you guys stay in a relationship?

639
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,250
Also, there is the problem of imaginary couples.

640
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,140
Can you really handle it?

641
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,950
If you can't handle it and leave him,

642
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,810
I'm not okay.

643
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,030
I want you to think carefully

644
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,840
about whether you are really okay with this kind of relationship.

645
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,440
Before you ask him out.

646
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,740
Yeah.

647
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,530
Thank you for giving me advice.

648
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,680
You don't have to wait for him to come to you tonight.

649
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,880
He has already fallen asleep.

650
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,840
I'll go get some water.

651
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,110
I'm very thirsty.

652
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,160
You don't have any other questions, do you?

653
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,670
Please think about it tonight.

654
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,420
I'll go now.

655
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:22,970
So thirsty.

656
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,820
"P is so handsome"

657
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,190
"Who is he? He's so handsome"

658
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,520
P is trending right now.

659
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,010
There are some groups cheering for him and Pan.

660
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,090
Hold on.

661
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,440
#PJPlai

662
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,020
PJ.

663
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,220
Look at this.

664
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,860
What is the source of #PJPlai?

665
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,580
But you guys seem to get along well when you're together.

666
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,960
Right?

667
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:02,920
Right?

668
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:06,620
Yes.

669
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,540
Hey!

670
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,430
Did you hear what I said?

671
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,940
What's wrong with you?

672
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,520
I saw that you had been spacing out since evening.

673
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,630
Just tell me what happened to you.

674
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,270
Ton.

675
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,800
What?

676
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,080
Do you know what these feelings are called

677
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,830
when I want to be close to someone,

678
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,080
make him happy,

679
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,940
make him smile,

680
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,730
tease him,

681
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,280
make him laugh,

682
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,320
and be close to them all the time?

683
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,510
You mean Pan?

684
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,120
No.

685
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,900
Don't tell me...

686
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,860
You mean me?

687
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,140
It's ridiculous.

688
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,680
Who do you mean then?

689
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,800
Plai.

690
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,480
Plai?

691
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,560
Would you like some advice from me?

692
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,480
What you said is what you did to Pan.

693
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:52,330
I would tell normal people that
it's how people feel when they fall in love.

694
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,770
But actors like you have acting techniques.

695
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,140
You have a method for acting.

696
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,240
It's hard to say it.

697
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,450
I can't confirm it.

698
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,920
But I never use it with Plai.

699
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,080
You may be doing many things during this time.

700
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,120
I think you might be confused.

701
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,810
My advice...

702
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:33,420
You should try to remove all your acting techniques and methods.

703
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,120
After that...

704
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,710
Ask your heart's voice.

705
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,050
Ask your heart, who makes you happy when you're with them.

706
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:46,040
Hey.

707
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,140
You look so serious.

708
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,270
Don't bother me.

709
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:03,840
Thank you.

710
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,200
Where are you going?

711
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,530
Sleeping in separate rooms for a night won't kill you.

712
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,430
You're passing out.

713
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,500
I can't believe you.

714
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,940
Just die here.

715
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,700
Don't leave the room.

716
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,250
Sleep here.
