00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,040
Pan, please walk slowly.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,190
You might fall down the stairs.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,250
Just catch me if I fall down.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,040
You're just joking around.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,200
We bought a lot of things.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,770
Send it to me. I'll sort it out.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,450
Sort it well.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,850
P is a very organized person.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,900
Exactly. Very strict person.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,240
Are you guys going out to buy something?

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,720
Yes.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,270
Why didn't you tell me what you wanted to buy yesterday?

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,960
So that I can buy it for you.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,890
It's cold outside.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,550
I just realized that I want to drink 7-11's cocoa.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,610
Send me the bag. I'll store it for you.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,770
That's okay, P.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,040
Pan and I will store it ourselves.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,600
You can relax and chill.

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,130
Okay?

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,480
Please relax.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,380
Come here.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,720
Store it carefully.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,160
P is a strict person. Otherwise, he will complain about you.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Let's go.

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:26,880
This one too.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,680
Okay.

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,100
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 7)

31
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,750
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

32
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,130
Yeah.

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,400
What did you decide?

34
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,590
You are also my friend, P.

35
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm not just Pan's brother.

36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,780
You also have the right to choose your happiness.

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm not angry at you at all.

38
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,620
No matter what your decision is.

39
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,680
I have decided.

40
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,300
I can't live without him.

41
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,630
I can do anything.

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,090
Just having him by my side.

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,640
I think I can overcome everything.

44
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,240
What about you and PJ?

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
There seems to be something between you guys these days.

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Did something happen?

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,800
What's wrong with you guys?

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
You guys keep asking me back.

49
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,410
You're irritated like this...

50
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,730
What?

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Nothing.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,460
You can consult me ​​about anything.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,190
Nothing changes even if I tell you.

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,030
My problems are no different from yours.

55
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,210
I'm tired of starting a new relationship again.

56
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,920
I thought you would overcome it

57
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,690
for your own happiness.

58
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,310
I must have misjudged you.

59
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,360
Hey.

60
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,420
If that feeling has already arisen...

61
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,710
Just try to open your mind again.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,720
Once again.

63
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,260
I don't even know his feelings.

64
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
Or the person in his heart.

65
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,900
What if the person in his heart that I have to fight for...

66
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,390
is Pan?

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,890
I will not continue it.

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,590
Well, then.

69
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,610
I'll ask PJ about it.

70
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,590
About what he thinks and feels about Pan.

71
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,670
Okay?

72
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,730
There's nothing better than
eating something warm in the cold weather.

73
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,830
If there is a soy milk and fried dough stick shop here,

74
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,150
I believe it will be a successful sale.

75
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,080
At least, I was in line since morning.

76
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,280
Ton.

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,880
Japanese people eat warm baked potatoes.

78
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,250
What's wrong with you?

79
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,840
Uh.

80
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,530
It reminds me of Thailand.

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
When I talk about it, time flies, doesn't it?

82
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,210
When I realized it, it was almost time to return to Thailand.

83
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,070
Yeah.

84
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,840
Yeah.

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,590
I still want to continue traveling.

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,450
Tasty.

87
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,900
He has arrived.

88
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,540
Where is my cocoa?

89
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,080
Did you buy this to drink alone?

90
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,450
I asked you yesterday.

91
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,780
Why didn't you tell me? Huh?

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,530
Are you really okay?

93
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Plai.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,760
Drink my cocoa.

95
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,780
I'm full now.

96
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,210
Hey. It's okay.

97
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,120
Just drink it.

98
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,470
Ahem!

99
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Thank you.

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,460
Since today is the last day already.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,760
Where else would you like to go?

102
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,370
I want to stay here longer.

103
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,370
Ouch!

104
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,680
Please say something that is possible.

105
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,280
How can you stay here?

106
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,660
Look. Look at him.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Look at Mr. P's face.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
He's really annoyed with us.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't annoy you guys.

110
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,630
But don't stay here for too long. It's a waste of electricity.

111
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,920
Oh, he's so stingy.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,390
Yeah.

113
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,040
He makes me want to withdraw money right now.

114
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,230
Just kidding.

115
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,990
Well, then.

116
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,670
No need to go anywhere today.

117
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,600
Just stay home and pack your bags for the trip home.

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,050
Hey, Ton. It didn't take long to pack.

119
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,020
We should go out since we are abroad.

120
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,320
Please. Please. Please.

121
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,190
Uh, P.

122
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,080
Do you have any other tourist attractions to recommend?

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
I have a place to recommend.

124
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,780
But I don't know if you guys want to go there.

125
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,620
Of course!

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,020
Others haven't answered it yet.

127
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,290
You answered it immediately.

128
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,030
Where is it, P?

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
The shrine.

130
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,140
Huh?

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
Why do you have to say huh?

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,730
I think it's a good idea.

133
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,880
T...

134
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,900
The shrine is good.

135
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,360
But after I consider Mr. P's style,

136
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,230
is he going to take us to the shrine?

137
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,120
Hey, Ton.

138
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,220
Pay my electric bill now.

139
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,280
Just kidding. I have nothing left but 500 yen.

140
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,360
Uh!

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
We went to pray at the shrine before returning on the last trip.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,280
Really?

143
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,720
How was it after you guys made your wishes there?

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,420
Please revieww it for me.

145
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,690
Review!

146
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,710
Hey, you all spoke in unity.

147
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,200
How is it? Please tell me.

148
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,700
It's nothing much.

149
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,680
I pray that I want to be an artist.

150
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,600
Look at me now.

151
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,930
You are so proud.

152
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,660
Don't you guys already have the ability?

153
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,310
It's true.

154
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,060
But if we have the ability but no opportunity,

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,300
dreams don't come true, isn't it?

156
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey.

157
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,700
Could you please be a little more humble?

158
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,970
Let others compliment you first.

159
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,930
Yes. He is overconfident.

160
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Uh, P.

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,780
What is the highlight of the shrine you will take us to?

162
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,550
If possible, I want something about love.

163
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,890
Because I felt like I was third wheel on this trip.

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,680
If possible, can I go to the shrine about love?

165
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,290
This place is famous for love and marriage.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,150
Mostly, everyone prays to the goddess of love.

167
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,350
They wish them success in love and happiness in their love life.

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,330
I think Ton should have a lover after this.

169
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,770
Yes, it should be like that.

170
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm okay with everyone right now.

171
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,010
I don't care if it's an individual or group collaboration.

172
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,360
I will ask the goddess of love to bless me.

173
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,180
This shrine has a mirror pond.

174
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,970
They are famous for predicting people's love.

175
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,630
I think you should try to predict it.

176
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,990
So what are we waiting for?

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,010
Let's go.

178
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,350
- This way!
- This way!

179
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,190
- Let's go.
- You are overly hurried.

180
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,810
Let's go.

181
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,840
I can't wait.

182
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,930
The goddess of love. Please wait for me.

183
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,490
Let's go.

184
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,230
Where is good love?

185
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,960
Love, wait for me!

186
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,310
Hurry up.

187
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,990
Wow.

188
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,100
Hey. Hey. Hey.

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,870
Guys.

190
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,340
I think we should purify our minds before asking for blessings from the sacred.

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,970
Breathe in.

192
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,500
Breathe out.

193
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,640
Breathe in.

194
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,740
Breathe out.

195
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,320
You have to blend in with nature.

196
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,200
I think it's time for the goddess to listen to my deepest heart's prayer.

197
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,460
But I think the goddess doesn't bless everyone.

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,960
Hey, Ton.

199
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,070
Don't be a bad mouth here.

200
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,550
This place is sacred.

201
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,220
Both of you, that's enough!

202
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,480
You will know after entering which request the goddess will listen to.

203
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,920
P.

204
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,020
Can the goddess understand Thai?

205
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,530
I don't know either.

206
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,480
But I think I'll make a wish in Japanese.

207
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,260
That's not fair to us.

208
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,100
We can't speak Japanese.

209
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,870
Can you teach me then?

210
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,300
How do I say "I wish I could find my lover" in Japanese?

211
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,470
I think we should go inside.

212
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,160
Hey.

213
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't make noise if you go inside.

214
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,810
Okay.

215
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,250
- Fine! I don't beg you.
- The weather is great!

216
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,960
This is a new era!

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,000
I won't beg you guys.

218
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,620
I will ask them.

219
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,190
How do I say "I wish I could find my lover" in Japanese?

220
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,890
No matter how much you pray, you will never have a lover. LOL.

221
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,160
Goddess, that is not my prayer.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,210
Goddess!

223
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,810
[trying to say "Excuse me" in Japanese]

224
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,160
[trying to say "Excuse me" in Japanese]

225
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,440
Hey.

226
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,180
PJ.

227
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,670
Why are you staring at me?

228
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,040
I saw you muttering something.

229
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,600
What did you wish for?

230
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,340
PJ.

231
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,590
Who will tell their own prayer?

232
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,680
Huh?

233
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,750
Huh?

234
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,000
Pan, wait for me!

235
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,940
Huh?

236
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,130
Where have they gone?

237
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,030
That's okay, goddess.

238
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,640
Goddess, will you understand if I pray in Thai?

239
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
If you don't understand me.

240
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,760
I wish I could find my lover.

241
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,680
This is my prayer.

242
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,800
I wish I could find my lover.

243
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,680
Thank you.

244
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,090
So cold.

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,650
P.

246
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah.

247
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,740
Please take care of my junior for a while.

248
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,210
I have something to say to Plai.

249
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,710
Sure. Don't worry.

250
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Hey. Hold on.

251
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,850
I have something to say to you.

252
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,130
Plai.

253
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,200
Why are you spacing out so much?

254
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,000
Plai!

255
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,160
Huh?

256
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,290
What did you say?

257
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,450
I asked, 'Why are you spacing out so much?'

258
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,350
It's not.

259
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,840
Just...

260
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,230
I just walk around and look around.

261
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,280
It's peaceful here.

262
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,260
Why don't you talk to PJ?

263
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,070
Or did he do something bad to you?

264
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,720
Huh?

265
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,630
No.

266
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,310
It was me

267
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,320
who spoke badly to him.

268
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,050
How can I have the guts to speak to him?

269
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,280
Shouldn't you just apologize if you said something bad to him?

270
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,600
That's all.

271
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,510
Do you want to apologize to him?

272
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,370
Huh?

273
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,440
That's all.

274
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,990
Go apologize to him.

275
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,210
How do you feel about Pan?

276
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,290
How do I feel about Pan?

277
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,170
I had fun being with Pan.

278
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,830
He is a talented person.

279
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,680
And he taught me many things.

280
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,250
I like it.

281
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,980
But...

282
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,120
I feel more fun when I'm with Plai.

283
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,840
Fun?

284
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,400
Hey, it's not.

285
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,630
I'm both fun and happy.

286
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,830
He makes me happy even though he didn't do anything.

287
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,260
What do you mean?

288
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
I love Plai.

289
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,210
Are you sure of what you said?

290
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
I wasn't sure before.

291
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,270
But after I saw you being happy with Pan,

292
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,950
I was sure that my feelings for Plai

293
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,220
were the same as yours.

294
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I know

295
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,350
how you both feel.

296
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,430
But what I do is my normal thing.

297
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,130
Because I feel really close to Pan.

298
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,090
I didn't mean to make you feel bad or uncomfortable.

299
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,570
Yeah.

300
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,450
I will try to understand your work as well.

301
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,890
But please keep it within limits.

302
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,280
I don't like anyone to be near Pan, except me.

303
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,410
You don't need to worry about that.

304
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,440
Pan has me as a partner.

305
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
No one would dare to flirt with him.

306
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Yeah.

307
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,270
So what are you going to do with Plai?

308
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
Are you serious with him?

309
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,380
If not, stop those thoughts and actions.

310
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,820
Plai is also one of my best friends.

311
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,640
I want him to succeed in love.

312
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,430
I don't want him to be sad again.

313
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,210
If he gives me a chance,

314
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,590
I will give it my all.

315
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,950
Just ask him for a chance.

316
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,130
But he just said he was uncomfortable.

317
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,760
Just make it clear.

318
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,280
So that there will be no awkwardness between you guys.

319
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

320
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,170
Nothing. Just...

321
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,790
broad topics.

322
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,110
Are you sure?

323
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,020
Yeah.

324
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,200
Oh, you guys can take a walk.

325
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
I will find Ton.

326
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,290
I don't know where he went.

327
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,960
Hey. Wait for me.

328
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,950
Just talk to each other first. Okay?

329
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,080
Call me after an hour. Okay?

330
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,940
P.

331
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,140
P.

332
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,300
Wait for me.

333
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,870
Why don't you stay with PJ?

334
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,230
What if someone secretly takes a picture of us?

335
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,120
Huh?

336
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,230
But I want to be with you.

337
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,490
I'm okay.

338
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,950
But today is the last day

339
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,620
we will be together.

340
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,890
Come here.

341
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,830
Come here.

342
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,700
What?

343
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,890
Hurry up.

344
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,550
What?

345
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,860
Aren't you going with me?

346
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,780
I will kiss you on the cheek if you don't come with me.

347
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,180
No.

348
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
Will you go or not?

349
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
No.

350
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,270
Will you go or not?

351
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,400
No.

352
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,130
- Will you go or not?
- Hey.

353
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,330
No.

354
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,740
Huh?

355
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,800
Say it again.

356
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,030
Will you go or not?

357
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,330
I won't. I won't. I won't.

358
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,720
Hey, that's enough!

359
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,050
Okay, I'll go.

360
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,580
Just tell me honestly if you want me to kiss you on the cheek.

361
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,870
Huh?

362
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,060
I said I'll go.

363
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,040
Well. I'll go.

364
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,130
People will see us.

365
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,970
Let's go.

366
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,570
- I have something to tell you.
- I have something to tell you.

367
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,180
You first.

368
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,180
You first.

369
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,990
I can say it later.

370
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,840
I...

371
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,390
I...

372
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,600
Can you give me a chance to court you?

373
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,280
Huh?

374
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
Pardon?

375
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,820
Can I court you?

376
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,860
Can you please stop avoiding me like you are doing now?

377
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,300
I...

378
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,960
I love you.

379
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,330
Can you give me a chance?

380
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,360
H... hold on.

381
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,540
Calm down.

382
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,140
Don't tease me like that.

383
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,660
I don't enjoy it.

384
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm telling the truth.

385
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,920
And I really speak my true feelings.

386
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,360
How is that possible?

387
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,920
What about Pan?

388
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,570
There's nothing between me and Pan.

389
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,330
We are just very close partners.

390
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,920
There's nothing more than that.

391
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,380
Are you sure?

392
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,210
If you're not sure,

393
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,290
can you allow me to make you feel certain?

394
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,710
You can consider it later.

395
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,840
Even though I'm not so handsome that it hurts your heart,

396
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,820
but in my heart there is only you.

397
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,270
Did it take you a long time to think about it?

398
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,400
Just now.

399
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,480
Then...

400
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,960
Will you give me a chance?

401
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,440
If you dare to ask me like this,

402
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,360
I...

403
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,210
Okay.

404
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,610
Really?

405
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,040
Yeah.

406
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,430
Just try it.

407
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,340
But...

408
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,920
what were you going to tell me before?

409
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
Oh.

410
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,270
I'm going to tell you that...

411
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,320
I'm sorry

412
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,160
for speaking badly to you yesterday.

413
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
And...

414
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,590
the days we traveled together

415
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,950
were so much fun.

416
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
Then...

417
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,020
Next time, let's go on a trip together just the two of us.

418
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,720
Fine.

419
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,540
Let's go.

420
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,730
Wow.

421
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,140
We have arrived.

422
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,810
Is this the mirror pond you told me about?

423
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,950
Yeah.

424
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,320
Would you like to try making a wish?

425
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,720
Sure.

426
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,200
What should I do?

427
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,650
Do you remember the paper we bought at the shrine earlier?

428
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,260
Yeah.

429
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,170
Is it still with you?

430
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,330
Here.

431
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,800
We need to put this paper on the water surface.

432
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,550
And place a 100 yen in the center.

433
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,370
Place it in the red text in the middle here.

434
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,050
Okay.

435
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,560
If this paper sinks quickly,

436
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,120
it means we are soulmates.

437
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,540
Really?

438
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,650
But if this paper sinks slower than 30 minutes,

439
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,790
it means that this paper will make us meet faster.

440
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,210
So can we just push it down right away?

441
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,900
Should we just push it down?

442
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,160
Yes.

443
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,060
Let's go.

444
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,700
Go.

445
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,870
Paper.

446
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,130
Let's go.

447
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,300
I have something I want to give you.

448
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,440
What is it?

449
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,160
Is it beautiful?

450
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,120
Yes.

451
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,040
Thank you.

452
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,180
Yeah.

453
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,070
Let's go.

454
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,440
Pan.

455
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,410
Throughout the past year,

456
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,460
I have done everything you told me to do.

457
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,300
Thank you

458
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,440
for making my life better.

459
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,730
Yeah.

460
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,480
I appreciate that you are serious too.

461
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,010
Thank you for keeping your promise to me.

462
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,550
Thank you for trying to understand me.

463
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,350
Even though many things are difficult for you.

464
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,540
Thank you for feeling the same way I do.

465
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,430
Will you be my boyfriend?

466
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,340
I promise

467
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,070
I will be a better person.

468
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,250
And I will be nice to you only.

469
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,900
Okay.

470
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,070
Ahem!

471
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,980
So sweet.

472
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,260
Ton.

473
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,460
I was shocked.

474
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,410
Why are you so shocked?

475
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,930
You guys are in trouble if I'm a Pan fan. You know?

476
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,260
Didn't you say you would be careful?

477
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,580
So what does this mean?

478
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,170
I'm sorry, Ton.

479
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,330
I checked and there really is no one around here.

480
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,560
And you are the culprit.

481
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,650
I will be more careful next time.

482
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,350
Yeah.

483
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,030
I have no problem with it.

484
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,070
Do you know that you have to be careful?

485
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,490
Let's go.

486
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,190
Let's go find PJ and Plai.

487
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,750
It's almost evening.

488
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,270
The supermarket here closes early.

489
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,290
Let's go.

490
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,640
Okay.

491
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,590
Let's go.

492
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,000
Let's find PJ.

493
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,570
I'm watching you.

494
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,090
Be careful.

495
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,510
Goddess.

496
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,460
It's my turn.

497
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,390
Goddess.

498
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
I come from a distant place.

499
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,230
I don't know if I've broken the rules.

500
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,360
If someone else gives you 100 yen.

501
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,920
I will give you 500 yen.

502
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,730
Since I'm here.

503
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,380
Please give me a big blessing

504
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,870
that will amaze me.

505
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,830
I don't care if it's an individual or group collaboration.

506
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,110
Oh, my goddess...

507
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,650
I have only one coin.

508
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,470
Oh my god.

509
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,940
My goddess...

510
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,790
I have only one coin.

511
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,140
Please accept my blessing.

512
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,000
It took me a long time to get here once.

513
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,070
I can't use banknotes.

514
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,920
This is all the money I exchanged.

515
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,100
Please accept my blessing.

516
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,070
Don't let me return to my country with nothing.

517
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,940
I'd like to take my leave now.

518
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,220
Does anyone have any more coins?

519
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,840
We shop every day.

520
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,710
Yes, Ton.

521
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you think how much money
do you think we have spent in Thai baht?

522
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,870
I think it's about 100,000 baht.

523
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,550
I have no money left.

524
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,710
You can put things here. I'll sort it out for you.

525
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,940
So that you can prepare your bag.

526
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,510
Is it okay?

527
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,240
Would you like me to help you?

528
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,740
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,720
It's not much.

530
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,960
Then sort it out,

531
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,150
hurry up and pack your bags.

532
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,500
So that you don't have to rush tomorrow.

533
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,060
Yes, Ton.

534
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,150
Come on, I'll help you.

535
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,900
Your work, right?

536
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,420
Yeah.

537
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,950
I think I need to revise my work.

538
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,860
I'd like to call about work.

539
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,660
Okay.

540
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,900
So what are we going to do?
Are you going to surprise him on his birthday?

541
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,310
Sure.

542
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,370
She called me like this...

543
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,190
I hope she doesn't tell me to revise the work.

544
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,180
Hello, Cher.

545
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,510
Hello, P.

546
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,160
Hey, why was your voice so depressed
when you answered my call?

547
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,200
I'm a little sleepy.

548
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,220
It's late in Japan.

549
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,050
I was just about to say that

550
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,180
the bird garden blog...

551
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,030
It's...

552
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,130
It's...?

553
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,920
The engagement rate is great!

554
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,310
Fans are really enjoying it.

555
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,190
Have you seen it yet?

556
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,180
Not yet.

557
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,190
I haven't checked it yet.

558
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,050
It's incredible that you have an artist friend.

559
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,180
The couple taking photos at the heart arch are so cute!

560
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,120
They look good together.

561
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,830
Please give me their autographs. Hehe.

562
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,090
They don't look good together at all.

563
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,390
I also have a picture of that arch.

564
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,700
Why don't you send me that picture?

565
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,190
Did you know that many people are interested in your blog?

566
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,630
You are famous now.

567
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,590
There are people who want to see your picture.

568
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,090
Next time, post your photos on your blog.

569
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,720
It can increase engagement.

570
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,590
I'm not very used to it.

571
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,720
You should expose yourself to social media.

572
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,570
Okay.

573
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,340
If I have good pictures, I will send them to you.

574
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,280
So cute.

575
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,640
I'll wait.

576
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Okay.

577
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,940
Oh.

578
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,190
For ski resorts, you have compiled the information well.

579
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,380
But I would like you to research other ski resorts.

580
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,870
So that readers will have more options.

581
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,360
And please send your pictures.

582
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,980
Okay. I'll try it.

583
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,410
Yep.

584
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,990
Bye bye.

585
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,060
Yes. Good bye.

586
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,100
She doesn't disturb my sleep time.

587
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,230
But I have to do the job she told me to do anyway, isn't it?

588
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,150
Are you working?

589
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,630
Yeah.

590
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,010
I need to revise the work a little.

591
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,100
Then I'll go pack my bags first.

592
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,360
Keep fighting.

593
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,860
Thank you.

594
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,430
I'll go now.

595
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,830
Keep fighting.

596
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,750
P.

597
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,880
I'm going to boil instant noodles.

598
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,580
Do you want some?

599
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,200
What about the others?

600
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
How about inviting them to eat together?

601
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,790
Others are packing their bag.

602
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,720
They will follow us soon.

603
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,450
Do you want to eat it?

604
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,810
I'll add hot water for you.

605
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,630
I want some.

606
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,640
I'll help you.

607
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,330
Hey!

608
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,050
Why do you have to help him with such a small thing?

609
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,930
To boil instant noodles,
just open the lid, pour hot water, and wait.

610
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,440
Just do your work.

611
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,050
Okay?

612
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,830
Come on.

613
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,070
I will do it for you.

614
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,330
Just do your work.

615
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,310
Is it finished yet?

616
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,780
Is it finished yet?

617
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,760
Would I still do it if I finished it?

618
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,670
Why does it take so long to add hot water?

619
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,430
I'll go call him.

620
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,090
Okay?

621
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,410
Just do your work.

622
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,420
Okay.

623
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,250

Happy birthday.

631
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,170
Make a wish now.

632
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,640
Make a wish now.

633
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,060
I don't have to blow out the candles, do I?

634
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,730
Happy birthday.

635
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,680
I wish you much happiness.

636
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,820
And please be my only best man forever.

637
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,130
- My only best man.
- My only best man.

638
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,530
Love you.

639
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,040
- Love you.
- Wow. Love.

640
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,280
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

641
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,250
Kiss now!

642
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,680
If I were a BL shipper, I would scream until I faint.

643
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
And passed out again after waking up.

644
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, then.

645
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,270
No one will bless him now, right?

646
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,760
Let me start first because I'm the oldest.

647
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,000
I wish you happiness.

648
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,250
And nice to meet you, P.

649
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,230
But if you want to change your mind to
become an actor or an artist,

650
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,690
don't forget to call a manager like me.

651
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,990
I will share the percentage with you fairly.

652
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,950
70-30.

653
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,020
P got 70%?

654
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,620
I'm 70 and P 30.

655
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,190
Uh, P.

656
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,520
I have a gift for you.

657
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,700
I...

658
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,910
I...

659
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,990
Hey, don't eavesdrop.

660
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,980
I have a gift for you.

661
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,260
I bought some headphones.

662
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,190
I'll sleep on the sofa tonight.

663
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,840
So, you can lash out like a combo set.

664
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,770
Ton!

665
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,470
That's enough.

666
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,310
Ton!

667
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,210
You whispered so softly.

668
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,000
Thank you so much, Ton.

669
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,770
Happy birthday, friend.

670
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,320
Did you know? Pan chose to come to Japan
during this time because of your birthday.

671
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,380
I wish you all the best in everything.

672
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,670
And...

673
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,540
I'm glad to be your friend.

674
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,860
Yeah.

675
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,170
Thank you.

676
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,850
Happy birthday, P.

677
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,130
Actually, we just got to know each other.

678
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,370
But you're so cool.

679
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,560
Thank you for letting us stay here for free.

680
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,220
For Pan, I will take care of him for you.

681
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,190
Thank you, bro.

682
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,200
But Pan can take care of himself.

683
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,630
Right?

684
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah.

685
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,390
Of course, isn't it?

686
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,160
Can I eat it?

687
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,060
Hurry up and eat it. So P can go back to his work.

688
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,670
He hasn't finished his work yet.

689
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,990
- I'm done.
- Done?

690
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,920
Yeah.

691
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,900
Then, let's party.

692
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,840
Happy birthday. I wish you happiness.

693
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,110
Happy birthday!

694
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,140
Happy birthday.

695
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,200
Please take me on another trip.

696
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,250
Ton!

697
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,050
Still not stopping.

698
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,630
Ton!

699
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,850
Are you interested in the strawberry love scene?

700
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,400
I think the person who should plug their ears is not you.

701
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,130
It's P.

702
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,250
Strawberries hit my face.

703
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,560
Eat it! I'll eat it too.

704
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,070
What are you watching?

705
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,150
IG.

706
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,760
I just posted the picture.

707
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,390
Wouldn't it be a problem if you posted it?

708
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,360
PJ can also upload selfies with you on IG.

709
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,130
So why can't I do the same?

710
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,170
And today is your birthday.

711
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,860
I don't care. I want to post it.

712
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,750
I want to flaunt them!

713
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,790
What are the fans commenting on?

714
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,650
They keep praising you.

715
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,420
It makes me want to delete it.

716
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,300
Huh?

717
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,580
I don't like it.

718
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,090
Go to sleep now.

719
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,480
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

720
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,270
I don't want to go back yet.

721
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,380
Do you think I should throw away the ticket
and stay for 2-3 days?

722
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,490
But you have to go back anyway, don't you?

723
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,290
Hmm?

724
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,450
You don't seem to want to be with me.

725
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,240
We won't see each other for a long time.

726
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,580
Are you sulking me?

727
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:39,440
Huh?

728
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,470
Stop it.

729
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,520
Let me kiss your cheek.

730
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,110
But you don't want to be with me.

731
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,480
Tonight is definitely not our last night.

732
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,240
Don't worry.

733
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,240
Really?

734
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,580
Come on. Let's hug.

735
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,600
I brought you some water.

736
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,080
Yeah. Thank you.

737
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,310
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

738
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,240
When I sleep with you.

739
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,590
No.

740
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,260
It's not.

741
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,160
Just...

742
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,570
When I'm not drunk today, I feel weird.

743
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,610
Then...

744
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,550
Do you want me to sleep outside?

745
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,670
Sleep together!

746
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:24,800
You can.

747
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,450
Okay.

748
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,990
You can tell me honestly
if I make you feel uncomfortable.

749
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,890
I will do everything you want.

750
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,280
I know.

751
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,740
You don't need to worry that much.

752
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,720
I just...

753
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,680
shy.

754
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,990
I don't feel uncomfortable.

755
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,640
Are you embarrassed by me?

756
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,440
Just go to sleep.

757
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,230
I haven't done anything yet,

758
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,710
but are you embarrassed by me already?

759
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,410
Do you hate it?

760
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,760
No.

761
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,140
I'm just shocked.

762
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,850
I must have approached you too fast.

763
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:56,960
I'm sorry.

764
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,750
I don't know

765
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,320
why I'm so excited.

766
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,560
Stop apologizing to me.

767
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,800
In the evening, I allowed you to court me.

768
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,870
Just do anything you want.

769
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,740
Don't say that again.

770
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,390
It's dangerous.

771
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,360
If I can't stop.

772
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,990
Are you threatening me?

773
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,350
No, I'm not.

774
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,390
So what do you want to do?

775
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,480
More than a kiss.

776
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,480
Do you allow me?

777
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,980
Do you mean...

778
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,480
Hook up.

779
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,710
Fine.

780
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,040
Aren't you going to take off your pants?

781
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,440
Plai.

782
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:01,760
I'm cumming.

783
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,020
What are you doing?

784
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,020
Apply lipstick.

785
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,260
What lipstick?

786
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,970
Pips.

787
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,640
It's sweet.

788
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:10,480
I like it.

789
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,020
Is it really sweet?

790
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
It's really sweet.

791
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,220
Don't wriggle.

792
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,360
Then don't touch me.

793
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,610
It's because your skin is smooth.

794
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
I like it.

795
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,940
Can I touch it all day?

796
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,510
I also want to hug you like this every day.

797
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,280
The way you kiss me

798
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,360
makes my lips mushy and adhere to yours.

799
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,040
You're buttering me like this,

800
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,480
how can I resist?

801
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,640
Huh?

802
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,550
Do you want to play gameplay with me?

803
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,200
But I don't have a game console at home.

804
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,950
But I have.

805
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,200
Your joystick is so small.

806
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,560
Yeah.

807
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,110
It will be big soon.

808
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,390
Will it really be that big?

809
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,090
It doesn't look that big.

810
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,080
Shall we start the game?

811
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,250
You only have a joystick.

812
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,320
But I have a button.

813
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,270
Wait a moment.

814
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,040
Would you like to press my start button?

815
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,310
Be careful, the stop button might break.

816
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,500
Hey, press my button.

817
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,910
When will your joystick get big?

818
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,970
Please suck my joystick.

819
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,700
Is my joystick big?

820
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:12,820
It's just right.

821
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,210
Please suck my joystick too.

822
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,540
Your joystick is too deep.

823
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,960
How can we start the game?
I haven't plugged in the joystick yet.

824
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,940
I'm going to put it in now.

825
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:06,580
Yeah.

826
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,980
Put it in properly.

827
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,470
Is my joystick big?

828
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,000
Yes.

829
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,140
Would you like to try my joystick?

830
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,040
That's not a good idea.

831
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,480
Your mouth is pale.

832
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,500
Put on some lipstick.

833
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:54,720
Are you cumming?

834
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,760
Not yet. Just a little bit more.

835
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,230
Just a little bit more.

836
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,060
Can you stand it?

837
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,470
I'm fine.

838
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:03,960
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

839
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,590
Sorry.

840
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,220
My joystick is too big.

841
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,560
I'm cumming.

842
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,080
No one helped Ton.

843
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,360
Is it really that heavy?

844
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,980
That's what I like. Don't mess with me.

845
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,310
It's so fast, isn't it?

846
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,300
Yeah.

847
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,660
I don't want to go back.

848
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,460
- I shouldn't pack so much stuff.
- I'm definitely going to miss this place.

849
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,760
I will encounter hot weather
as soon as I return to my country.

850
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,900
Gosh, lifting heavy luggage in the cold weather.

851
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,330
Guys.

852
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,030
Have you checked your luggage properly?

853
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,240
You didn't forget anything, did you?

854
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,880
No.

855
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,120
If I forget, I'll leave it to P to take care of,

856
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,240
as an excuse to come back here again.

857
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,230
Uh, he has a good idea.

858
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,100
Hey, guys.

859
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,210
I think someone doesn't want to go back.

860
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,310
Pan.

861
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,160
Why do you have to make that face?

862
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,400
You're going to find an excuse
to come back here anyway, aren't you?

863
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,460
Otherwise, P can take a plane to come to us.

864
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,610
I just don't want to go back to work.

865
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,550
I want to continue traveling.

866
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,750
So how are you going to make money if you keep traveling?

867
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,940
Won't P come out and see us off?

868
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,470
Umm. You're right.

869
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:28,640
P!

870
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,130
What?

871
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,520
You came last

872
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,690
but you won. Your outfit.

873
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,760
I will go back with you guys!

874
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,900
I'm on vacation.

875
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,350
I want to be with my boyfriend.

876
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,640
Wow.

877
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,210
Is that true?

878
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,420
I'm so envy people who have lovers.

879
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,060
Well. Let's go.

880
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,350
Hold on.

881
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,660
I have something to give you guys.

882
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,560
Thank you.

883
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,500
Thank you, P.

884
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,790
Stop bugging me.

885
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,090
Send it to me quickly if you want to give it to me!

886
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,400
Wow.

887
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:48,960
Hey!

888
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,760
So beautiful.

889
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,230
So beautiful. What is this?

890
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,880
It's a love amulet.

891
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,720
Love amulet?

892
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,220
My time has come.

893
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,880
With the power of love...

894
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,220
I'm going now!

895
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:11,940
Let's go.

896
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,610
Let's go.

897
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,740
So beautiful.

898
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,680
I have to succeed this time.

899
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,340
I also want to have a lover.

900
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,400
Do you want me to help you carry this?

901
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,130
That's okay. I can carry it myself.

902
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,150
I wish that every season from now on

903
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,880
will be a season of love.

904
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:55,920
(Next Episode)
Where would you like to go today?

905
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:57,330
Let's go after we finish eating.

906
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,000
I would like to take you to see beautiful scenery,

907
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:01,740
and...

908
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,310
Is it a good idea to wear Thai national costume?

909
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:10,600
I can't believe I'm standing here in Thailand
enjoying the view with you.

910
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,150
Yeah.

911
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,670
I also don't think my wish will come true.

912
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,210
P.

913
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,490
Why?

914
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,160
I love you.

915
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,840
Love you so much.

916
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,450
No matter what happens in the future,

917
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,660
don't give up on me.
