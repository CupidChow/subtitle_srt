3
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,840
Is it reality or a dream?

4
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,380
Oh, P.

5
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,910
Yeah. Are you awake?

6
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,930
I woke up to go to the toilet.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,460
I went to the toilet once last night.

8
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,080
But I wanted to go to the toilet again this morning.

9
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,510
I probably drank too much last night.

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,550
Last night...

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,170
Yes.

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,360
No. Nothing.

13
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,480
Is everyone else awake?

14
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,500
Ton is awake.

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,680
But I saw him talking on the phone in the garden.

16
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,190
Then I'll go into the room and get things.

17
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,760
Okay.

18
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,320
See you.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,400
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 4)

20
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,808
I'm screwed.

21
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,250
Yes, boss.

22
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,110
Yes.

23
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,540
Yes.

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,240
Yes.

25
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,200
I just want to chill out and have fun.

27
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,490
What should we do?

28
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,530
It should never have happened.

29
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm so fed up.

30
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,310
I have to answer the phone since morning.

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,140
What are you guys doing?

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,650
Go. Let's get something to eat.

33
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,430
Did anything happen to you guys?

34
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,170
Look at this.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,560
[Thank you for the leaked photos that made me wide awake. Hurt again.
I need time to heal. No more #PJPan]

36
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
What is it? I don't understand.

37
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,420
Someone took a photo of the two of you
and posted it on social media.

38
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,220
Ton just received a call from clients this morning.

39
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,790
They want to cancel the job because of this picture.

40
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,500
Why?

41
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,670
I don't understand.

42
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,410
Gosh...

43
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,600
Plai, please explain to P.

44
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,700
Let me talk to Pan and PJ first.

45
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay.

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
Let's go.

47
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,790
Get up.

48
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,450
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,120
Yeah.

50
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,080
That's okay.

51
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,200
Actually, you didn't do anything wrong.

52
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,130
The picture that was posted is not harmful.

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,690
But it's just a few fans who are mad.

54
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,060
Clients call me,

55
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,600
they are worried about what happened.

56
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,830
I think the same as Ton.

57
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
In this picture, you guys look too close.

58
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,350
So the fans who cheer for us are mad.

59
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,950
But I think I found a solution.

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,250
Why are my and Pan's secretly taken photos such a big deal?

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,990
Pan and I have known each other for a long time.

62
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,350
Why?

63
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,750
I don't understand.

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,420
Pan can't get close to anyone except that kid?

65
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,280
Now PJ is an imaginary couple with Pan.

66
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,370
It may be difficult for you to understand
because it is something far from you.

67
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,310
But most of the work they get is because of the fans
cheering and supporting them when they are together.

68
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,920
So what is happening now is affecting their work.

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,350
Do you understand?

70
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,820
So what should I do?

71
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,700
Should I stay away from him?

72
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,760
I could only look at him closely and intimately with PJ.

73
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,160
Is that all I can do?

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,540
I know it's hard.

75
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,150
I feel you, P.

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,290
But you might have to stay away from him for a while.

77
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,660
I didn't even have time to be with him for a week.

78
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,620
Are you still telling me to stay away from him?

79
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,620
Solution?

80
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,400
What solution?

81
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,120
The time zone here is two hours ahead of Thailand, right?

82
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,640
I think the fans might feel better if we take action quickly.

83
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,420
Yeah.

84
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,440
Interesting.

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,180
Well, let's do this.

86
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,760
You should explain and post on social media.

87
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,030
I think posting is not enough.

88
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,830
If Pan is okay, I think we should go live.

89
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,800
To confirm that there is nothing.

90
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,960
That's good.

91
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,080
I think it works.

92
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,880
Well, let's do this.

93
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,240
You two have to go live
and say that you and him are just friends.

94
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,480
So I'll call the company and tell them this is our solution.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,730
Are you okay, Pan?

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,390
Your expression doesn't look good.

97
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm okay.

98
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,890
Well, you guys can get ready.

99
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,690
I'll call the company and tell them.

100
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,320
Okay?

101
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,420
Get ready.

102
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,540
Pan. Don't worry.

103
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,980
I will help you say that I was with you at that time.

104
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,620
Thank you, PJ.

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,880
Pan.

106
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,120
I think your body is warm.

107
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,060
Are you sick?

108
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm okay.

109
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,710
I don't want to call him at all.

110
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,840
Hello, boss.

111
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Yes.

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,630
I think I found a solution.

113
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,560
Yes.

114
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,270
I have an additional plan.

115
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,750
I think it can cover up the news.

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
Yes.

117
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,230
I would tell them to be more careful.

118
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
Don't worry.

119
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,470
I can handle it.

120
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,520
Yes.

121
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,020
Hello.

122
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,280
Yes.

123
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,120
Oh, Jeab.

124
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,650
I'm Ton.

125
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,070
I apologize for calling you earlier.

126
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,910
Yes.

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
There's nothing at all.

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,440
Well.

129
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,460
You can look forward to their live, Jeab.

130
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,880
It's really nothing.

131
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,100
Please continue to take care of them as usual.

132
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,050
Yes.

133
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,270
Both presenter and advertisement. Please.

134
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,250
Please love them as always.

135
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,980
I'll tell the company to give you a nice package.

136
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,620
I will tell the company to give you a good offer.

137
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,400
But don't tell anyone.

138
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,860
I'll give you a free event.

139
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,890
Yes.

140
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,900
Please love them as always.

141
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,510
Where is P?

142
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,360
He probably went to the toilet.

143
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,780
Does he...

144
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
understand it?

145
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,610
I think he would understand it.

146
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,250
But please give him some time.

147
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,440
Is he okay?

148
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,370
It's nothing.

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,220
Are you guys going to start yet?

150
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,360
If you start a live,
I will tell the fanbase in the open chat.

151
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,930
You guys need to go live and explain it.

152
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,940
Ready?

153
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,960
Are you ready?

154
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,210
If you are ready,
I ask you not to stress out in this live.

155
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,460
Please take it easy.

156
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,560
Here it's 11am, in Thailand it's 9am.

157
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,650
It's the right time.

158
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,770
Go live and explain it to them.

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
So we can go find something delicious to eat.

160
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm hungry.

161
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,590
Okay. I'll go get the tripod.

162
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,310
Okay.

163
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,060
Let's go.

164
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,560
Are you ready?

165
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I'll let him go live and explain what happened.

166
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,410
You can start now.

167
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,130
Should we start now?

168
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,980
Yes.

169
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to press start now.

170
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Okay.

171
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,550
Pan, you first.

172
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,580
Do we have to wait a while?

173
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,610
Yes.

174
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,810
People have started joining.

175
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,100
People gradually joined in. Keep smiling.

176
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,450
Keep smiling.

177
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,280
You can start talking now.

178
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,150
Right now?

179
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,180
- Should we start now?
- Yes.

180
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,960
Hello.

181
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,770
Are you guys awake yet?

182
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,330
We are in Japan.

183
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,130
It's now a little past 11am.

184
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,280
It's 9am in Thailand. Is everyone awake yet?

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
[Are you guys together?]
Are you guys awake yet?

186
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,940
[Are you guys together?]

187
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,470
Yes. We are together.

188
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Yeah.

189
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,280
I think the fans have joined.

190
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,750
Let's get started?

191
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,220
- Let's start? Okay.
- Yes.

192
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,120
Let's get started.

193
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,820
[I can't sleep. Hurry up and tell us]
We would like to encourage anyone who is working right now.

194
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,430
[Who is the person in that picture?]
Please be careful while traveling this holiday.

195
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,220
I think everyone wants to hear our explanation.

196
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,590
Let's get started.

197
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,100
People who can't sleep
can sleep comfortably after hearing it.

198
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,960
[Please reassure me that you and he are not in a relationship]
The place we visited was a bird park.

199
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,800
The picture you see is after we saw
the penguins and took an ice cream break.

200
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,390
[Please reassure me that you and he are not in a relationship]
We were all there. Not just two people.

201
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,430
We are editing the video to show you how much fun that day was

203
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,970
and how cute each bird was.

204
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,210
But I traveled too much, so I fell asleep.

205
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,040
I fell asleep before I could edit the video.

206
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,870
[Where are the people in that picture?]
I took a shower and Plai passed out.

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,590
Huh?

208
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,990
I just can't stand it. I'm sleepy.

209
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,890
Yeah.

210
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,480
What you want to know is
who is the man in the picture, right?

211
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,100
[If there's really nothing, just bring him to the live]
Actually, the man you saw is our friend.

212
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,740
Yeah.

213
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,830
[I'd feel better if he was just your friend]
The place we are live streaming is his house.

214
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,610
Yes.

215
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,570
Actually, we went to help P with his work that day.

216
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,750
You will see our cute pictures after he updates his blog.

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,720
Yeah.

218
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,830
P and I are just friends.

219
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,400
We aren't in a relationship like you all think.

220
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,710
Yes.

221
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,800
[But seriously, the man in the picture is handsome. I want to get to know him]
That picture is because we are very close.

222
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Those who do not know
may have doubts and misunderstand.

223
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
[I love and support you as always. Don't worry]

224
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,560
When we talked about him, he was right here.

225
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,660
Come on, P.

226
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,500
Here. Our fans.

227
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,250
- What a coincidence!
- The owner of the house has arrived.

228
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,190
Come on.

229
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,580
Here, guys. They are close friends.

230
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,920
They are close.

231
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,610
This is the owner of the house.

232
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,530
As you can see.

233
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,380
Yes.

234
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,890
Please greet them.

235
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,400
Yes.

236
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,330
I'm P.

237
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,900
[Their names start with P]

238
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,270
We had so much fun here.

239
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,990
Please look forward to our content.

240
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,450
[Pan had a strange expression]
Yes.

241
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,850
They always have fun when they meet up.

242
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,460
Right?

243
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,050
These kids give me a headache.

244
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,050
They are very naughty.

245
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,180
- But the two of them will go on another trip together, right?
- Yes.

246
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,810
Yes.

247
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,010
They will go on a trip together.

248
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,360
Well, fans. Don't worry. They are friends.

249
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,100
They will take cute moments for the fans to see.

250
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,190
Anyone like it? Please like.

251
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,410
Please send us lots of hearts.

252
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,160
Please send lots of hearts.

253
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,800
Thank you very much to everyone who supported us.

254
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm really sorry to everyone if I misunderstood you.

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,630
From now on, we will continue to
have fun traveling together like this.

256
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:32,980
Yes.

257
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,390
Yes.

258
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,240
We will travel on your behalf.

259
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,680
Let's end the live.

260
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,560
Well, fans.

261
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,450
Are your doubts cleared up now?

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,140
Don't worry.

263
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,170
Anyway, let's continue our trip.

264
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,590
Let's go.

265
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,620
Let's end the live.

266
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,970
[Let's continue sleeping. #PJPan are still going on]
Don't forget to take care of yourself.

267
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,950
For Pan, I will take care of him myself.

268
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,850
Oh my god.

269
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,240
So sweet.

270
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,780
[Hurry back to Thailand. I miss you]
Well. Let's end the live here.

271
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,450
Okay, bye bye.

272
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,190
Bye bye.

273
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,720
There's nothing at all, fans.

274
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,130
Don't worry.

275
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,630
Please wait for the signal to end.

276
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,570
Wait for the signal to end.

277
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,090
3 2 1.

278
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,800
Ton.

279
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,860
It was the most stressful live of my life.

280
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,590
Do you think they will believe us?

281
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,060
Thank you all for helping me.

282
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,380
PJ.

283
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

284
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,530
That's okay, Pan.

285
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,100
We are partners.

286
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Also, you and P are not really dating.

287
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,980
We didn't lie to our fans. Right?

288
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,620
I also apologize to all of you.

289
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,180
I will be more careful next time.

290
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,390
Guys.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,300
You don't have to stress.

292
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,260
The situation is slowly getting better.

293
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,030
The expressions on both of you are so bad.

294
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Hold on.

295
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,460
Let me check the feedback.

296
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,980
I think the feedback is gradually getting better now.

297
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,030
But I thought of another way to distract them.

298
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,060
What?

299
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,360
Is that what you said?

300
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,940
Travel together and live.

301
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah.

302
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,840
P.

303
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,080
Do you have any recommended tourist attractions?

304
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,720
Evening atmosphere, sunset, beautiful light.

305
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,630
Let them travel and film the moment.

306
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,510
And you have to take a short video to post for your fans to see.

307
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,400
Is it good?

308
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,180
Hey.

309
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,780
You have a temperature.

310
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,140
Are you okay?

311
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,340
You're right.

312
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,950
Can you postpone it to another day?

313
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,380
Pan is really high temperature.

314
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,470
Exactly as I thought.

315
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,080
What should I do? I want you guys to travel today.

316
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,790
But I think it's cold outside.

317
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,860
The weather outside gets colder after the sun sets.

318
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,220
I think today's trip is not a good idea.

319
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,270
What should we do? I want us to travel as soon as possible.

320
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,700
It will be even more beneficial to us.

321
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,930
Check the feedback.

322
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,840
Here.

323
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,060
It's true that the feedback is good, but...

324
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,760
Someone asked who you are.

325
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,270
What should I do?

326
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,500
This comment says

327
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,730
'Is this acting?'.

328
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,380
Like this.

329
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,580
What should we do?

330
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,980
Can you be patient?

331
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,890
Can you endure this?

332
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
No way. He is sick.

333
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,690
How can he travel?

334
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,870
It's so cold.

335
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,060
Take your medicine first.

336
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,320
Thank you.

337
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,190
I have an idea.

338
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,360
What?

339
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,630
Plai.

340
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,930
Pan.

341
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
You have to disguise each other for one day.

342
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,470
Huh?

343
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,050
Don't huh?

344
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,230
The faster it is, the more beneficial it will be to us.

345
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,970
Ton.

346
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,640
Fans will probably understand
after editing the video of that day's trip.

347
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,940
We don't need to do that much.

348
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,840
I think it's good.

349
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,680
See? PJ also agrees with me.

350
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,780
I agree with Ton.

351
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,650
Oh?

352
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,710
You just have to travel with me.

353
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,140
It wouldn't be good.

354
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,190
What about Pan?

355
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,770
Pan?

356
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,530
You are sick. Please stay home.

357
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,570
P.

358
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,370
Can you take care of Pan?

359
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,390
If you travel with us, fans will pay more attention to you.

360
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,070
Otherwise, the fans will bite you.

361
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,100
Yes.

362
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,540
Your request, I can think of a place.

363
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,100
It's the place where the sunset is as beautiful as you want.

364
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,840
Well. You two should go get ready.

365
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,240
Are you serious?

366
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,960
Yes.

367
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,320
Are you ready?

368
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,730
Yes.

369
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,270
Let's go.

370
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,260
Let's hurry up. So we can go find something to eat.

371
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,660
Stress makes me hungry.

372
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,560
But you guys have to switch.

373
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,850
Have you ever seen it in a movie?

374
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,350
You guys have to switch shirts.

375
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,020
Your character must be like Pan.

376
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,540
You must be Plai. Okay?

377
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,140
Fans won't remember us?

378
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,250
There's no way they'll remember.

379
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,680
I still confuse you guys even when I work with you.

380
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,250
I have been with you for many years.

381
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,350
Trust me.

382
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,700
Are you serious?

383
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,760
Are you Pan or Plai?

384
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,770
See? I don't even remember.

385
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,200
Your fans won't remember you.

386
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,370
Go. Go get ready.

387
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,800
I'm not ready at all.

388
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,420
Hurry up.

389
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,860
Go.

390
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,060
Go. Go. Go.

391
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,250
Let's get started. Hurry.

392
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,160
Lively. Smile.

393
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,540
Hello!

394
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,220
We're here.

395
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,900
We are heading to Shimane Art Museum today.

396
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,150
This place is praised as
one of the top 100 most beautiful sunset spots!

397
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,140
Yes.

398
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,220
It's very romantic here.

399
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,300
Whoever wants to travel or date here, you will definitely be satisfied.

400
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,790
Yes.

401
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,580
Today, me, Pan and...

402
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,500
Me, Ton.

403
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,540
We are responsible for taking beautiful photos for you all.

404
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,420
Yes.

405
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,700
Let's hurry up.

406
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,860
It's cold.

407
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,290
Let's go.

408
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:13,850
Oh.

409
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,860
Guys.

410
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,550
It seems our Pan is not feeling well.

411
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,250
Pan is having a cold.

412
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,230
But don't worry.

413
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,700
I will look after Pan well.

414
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,770
Illness cannot stop our desire to travel.

415
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,220
Let's go!

416
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,670
Just turn it off.

417
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,060
Take a good rest at home. So you will get well soon.

418
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,620
Give me your sweater. I'll change it.

419
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,100
P.

420
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,740
Please take care of Pan.

421
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,340
Let's go. Stop saying goodbye.

422
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,120
You guys change your clothes and hurry back to us.

423
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm cold.

424
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,490
Okay.

425
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,130
Hurry!

426
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,380
Will it be crowded?

427
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,310
I think so.

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,690
Wow.

429
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,070
I thought you were Pan when I walked past.

430
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,610
Do I look like Pan now?

431
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,620
No.

432
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,700
Huh?

433
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,500
Even if someone says you two look alike...

434
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,040
But in my eyes, you two don't look alike at all.

435
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,310
Shall we go?

436
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,770
Yeah.

437
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,500
Let's go.

438
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,510
Come on, let's get started. Hurry.

439
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,790
Hello!

440
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,930
Now we are near the Shimane Museum.

441
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,660
The view from our back is so beautiful!

442
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,610
I can't imagine how beautiful the sunset
would be in the evening.

443
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,770
We will take you on a tour around the museum.

444
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,430
Pan.

445
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,540
Please show up for viewers.

446
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,090
Hello.

447
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,470
Hey.

448
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,840
Guys.

449
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,780
I can't stand it anymore.

450
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,560
What happened?

451
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,840
I want to poop.

452
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,380
I think it's because of the seaweed soup.

453
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,460
Guys.

454
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,960
Now our Ton wants to poop.

455
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,420
Poop.

456
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,470
We'll let Ton finish his business first.

457
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,130
And the two of us will take you all on a tour around here.

458
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,880
Yes.

459
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,790
See you.

460
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,450
Turn it off!

461
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,520
Bye bye!

462
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,000
Why do you have to tell them?

463
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,780
Fans will enjoy it after it is edited.

464
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,320
Yeah.

465
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,930
Fans will know that Ton wants to poop
after the video is edited.

466
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,840
I can't stand it anymore.

467
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
You guys keep filming.

468
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,090
I'll be going now.

469
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,500
Just go, Ton. Hurry...

470
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,710
I have a gift for you.

471
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,240
What?

472
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,850
Disgusting!

473
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,700
I think I don't have to push to poop anymore.

474
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,840
Hurry up.

475
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,920
Hurry back!

476
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,220
Yeah.

477
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,920
Ton.

478
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,330
Let me ask you.

479
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,500
Do you have intestinal problems?

480
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

481
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,010
Here, a jacket.

482
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,780
I took it from the car.

483
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,920
I see you're cold.

484
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,390
- Thank you.
- I'll hold it for you.

485
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,900
I feel much better.

486
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,710
It's even more beautiful here than in the picture, right?

487
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,840
It's very beautiful, right?

488
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,840
It's like a painting.

489
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,980
Do you like this vibe?

490
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,830
Of course.

491
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,960
But it's been a long time
since I've seen something this beautiful.

492
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,830
Me too.

493
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,250
Not many people like this vibe.

494
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,610
They probably don't have time.

495
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,200
So it's more important to do something else.

496
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,320
So...

497
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,000
have you ever watched a sunset like this with anyone?

498
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,610
No.

499
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,950
This is the first time.

500
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,330
Plai.

501
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,830
Huh?

502
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,630
There's just the lake and the sun in front of you.

503
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,340
Don't worry about who can see you.

504
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,430
I have read some information.

505
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,030
There's a rabbit here.

506
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,280
Really?

507
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,110
Where?

508
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,350
Not far from here.

509
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,930
Do you want to go see it with me?

510
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes.

511
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,630
There really are rabbits here!

512
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,840
I think you'll be disappointed

513
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,670
that it's not a real rabbit.

514
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,900
What do you mean I'll be disappointed?

515
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,480
Even though it's just a statue, it's still a rabbit.

516
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
It's cute.

517
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,950
Yeah.

518
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,800
It's cute.

519
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,300
I have read it before.

520
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,380
Apart from the 12 rabbit statues,

521
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,540
this place is also famous for praying for happiness in life.

522
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,050
Try praying.

523
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,440
Let's pray together.

524
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,460
Why?

525
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,550
Do you think I'm kidding you?

526
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,950
If you're not kidding me, let's pray together.

527
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,500
Hey.

528
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
Are you teasing me?

529
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,460
No, I'm not.

530
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,850
But I think that wish will come true.

531
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,550
Is it that fast?

532
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,340
So, do you feel happy now?

533
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,220
The sun is about to set.

534
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,380
Let's take a photo.

535
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,390
Let's go.

536
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,950
Stand here.

537
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,740
Where?

538
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,480
Right here. I will take a photo for you.

539
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,220
Eat some porridge.

540
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,060
So that you can take your medicine.

541
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,290
I'm not hungry yet.

542
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,170
Can you put it there first?

543
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,200
Please eat even a little bit.

544
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,070
So that you can get well soon.

545
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay.

546
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,380
Yes, Cher.

547
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,410
Yes.

548
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,590
I will edit and send it as soon as possible.

549
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,310
Would you like to upload it tomorrow?

550
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,230
Okay.

551
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,060
Okay.

552
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,970
Yes, bye.

553
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,220
Just do your work.

554
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,250
I can take care of myself.

555
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,970
I won't work if you don't eat and take medicine.

556
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,010
Fine.

557
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,750
P.

558
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,680
Did something happen to you?

559
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,920
Nothing.

560
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,610
I'm just stressed about work.

561
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,750
I need to edit and submit the work quickly.

562
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,420
How is your condition?

563
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,780
Have you recovered from your headache yet?

564
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,140
I feel a little better.

565
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,210
Would you like to take a nap in the room?

566
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah. Okay.

567
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,970
Then go into the room first.

568
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,190
I'll bring water and medicine for you later.

569
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,920
Yeah.

570
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,700
Your medicine.

571
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,780
I wouldn't have had the chance to do this
if there were someone else.

572
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,210
I'm not that sick.

573
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,080
I think last night...

574
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,730
Last night, why?

575
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,540
I was drunk last night.

576
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,860
I think it's causing my headache.

577
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,320
Then just sleep.

578
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,780
I'm going to work on the sofa outside.

579
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,640
But I will come to take care of you often.

580
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,700
In case your fever gets worse.

581
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,300
You can't bring your work here?

582
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,520
I don't think so.

583
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,820
The keyboard sound will disturb you.

584
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,010
Didn't you say you were going to work outside?

585
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,030
Aren't you worried about the keyboard sound disturbing me?

586
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,230
I'm more worried that you'll be mad at me.

587
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,120
Stop being mad at me.

588
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,700
Please sleep quickly.

589
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,300
So that we can travel together.

590
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,850
Fine.

591
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,840
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

592
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:42,940
Yes.

593
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,780
The weather is great, don't you think?

594
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,660
Yes.

595
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,980
Plai.

596
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,420
Huh?

597
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,160
This picture is so beautiful.

598
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,700
Should I post it?

599
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,500
Yeah.

600
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,420
Is it good to post it with this picture?

601
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,000
It's cool.

602
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,310
It's also backlit.

603
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,010
So...

604
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,490
What about this picture?

605
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,220
You are cute in this picture.

606
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,610
This picture is not okay.

607
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,550
You have to use a picture of me wearing a mask.

608
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,880
So I can't post any pictures today?

609
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,230
It's not a problem at all.

610
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,530
I can see it alone.

611
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,620
But...

612
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,850
But I want to post your picture.

613
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,940
It's been a long time since we've traveled together.

614
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,880
I think the fans don't know.

615
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,660
Does my face really look like Pan?

616
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,260
For others...

617
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,180
I don't know.

618
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,830
But for me,

619
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,440
I identified you from the beginning.

620
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,940
Ahem.

621
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,880
Hurry up and shoot the end of the video.

622
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,880
So that we can hurry home.

623
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,390
Where did you go?

624
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,650
I told you I went to the toilet.

625
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,030
I'm alone, let me travel alone.

626
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,060
Hurry!

627
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,900
Hurry up!

628
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,810
Okay.

629
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,960
Let me wear a mask.

630
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,950
Do I look okay now?

631
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,040
Is it okay?

632
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,800
Okay.

633
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,820
Come on.

634
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,640
Well, today we ended with fun.

635
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,860
It's time to say goodbye to everyone.

636
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,560
We will end the video here.

637
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,560
Don't forget to follow us.

638
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,670
We have to go now. Bye!

639
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,610
Bye.

640
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,980
Let's get back.

641
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,980
Take off your clothes.

642
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,380
It seems like the others are coming back.

643
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,420
Just go and meet them.

644
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,100
Are you feeling better now?

645
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,910
I feel better after you wiped me down.

646
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,830
Then I will go meet them.

647
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,970
If you want to follow me, wear a shirt

648
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,460
and follow me.

649
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,270
Okay.

650
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,630
I'm really proud of you guys.

651
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,630
I applaud you.

652
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,810
We did very well today.

653
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,220
There is only your chemistry in the air.

654
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,580
Really, Ton?

655
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,260
Yes.

656
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,360
Can you believe it? I just walked past you guys from behind...

657
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,670
You guys are so sweet.

658
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,580
I think you guys are a real dating couple.

659
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,030
Come on.

660
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,540
Let's celebrate our success.

661
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,730
Problems are starting to be solved!

662
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,810
Oh, P.

663
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,360
What is Pan's condition?

664
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,460
He had a low fever in the afternoon.

665
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,220
He is feeling better now.

666
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,310
He will probably be fine tomorrow.

667
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,150
Tomorrow?

668
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,490
What about tonight?

669
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,380
I bought a lot of stuff.

670
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,690
We can eat it another day.

671
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,940
Just let Pan rest for another night.

672
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,180
Alright.

673
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,790
Fine. Tomorrow is okay.

674
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,690
I'll put it away.

675
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,860
Hey, I'll help you.

676
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,010
You're really overacting.

677
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,150
How can that be?

678
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,200
I'm going to wash Pan's towels.

679
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,220
Okay.

680
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,250
P.

681
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:56,530
What's up.

682
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,650
How was it?

683
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,670
The place I recommend you.

684
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,580
Is it as romantic as you want it to be?

685
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,560
Yeah.

686
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,140
It's so romantic.

687
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,400
The vibe is good too.

688
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,500
The sunset view is also beautiful.

689
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,230
Also, I pray to the rabbit statue on your behalf.

690
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,660
Really?

691
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,780
How about you?

692
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,210
How was it?

693
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,250
I don't know.

694
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,830
I don't know how to describe it.

695
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,810
Are you okay?

696
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,590
I...

697
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,540
feel like I'm at a dead end.

698
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,030
I don't know what to do next.

699
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,510
I don't even know what I can do.

700
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,760
You know the situation now.

701
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,720
Fans' feedback started to improve
after I traveled with PJ instead of Pan.

702
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,810
Please be patient a little longer.

703
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,900
I think things will get better soon.

704
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:25,480
Okay?

705
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,000
I can endure it.

706
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,940
I can wait.

707
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,830
If he had the same feelings as me.

708
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,290
But I'm not sure now.

709
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,380
P.

710
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,460
How do you think I'm supposed to feel

711
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,830
hearing him say...

712
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,920
"Honestly, I don't feel anything."

713
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,660
"We're just friends."

714
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,180
"There's nothing more than that."

715
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,710
Did he just say it because of the situation?

716
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,900
What if he feels the way he says?

717
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,880
What are you guys doing?

718
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,190
Let's call Pan to eat together?

719
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:38,990
He hasn't had dinner yet, has he?

720
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,960
Not yet.

721
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,420
I let him eat porridge and medicine during the day.

722
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,650
Yeah.

723
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,450
I'll call him for dinner, so he can take his medicine.

724
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,470
Okay.

725
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,470
I'll go call him.

726
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,230
It's okay, P.

727
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,480
Pan! Ton told me to tell you to have dinner!

728
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,080
Where did Pan go?

729
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,840
Have you seen Pan?

730
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,640
No.

731
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,460
Didn't you say he was in the room?

732
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,850
He is not here.

733
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,520
I went to call him for dinner but he wasn't in the room.

734
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,730
Or is he in the bathroom?

735
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,880
I'll go find him.

736
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,740
What happened?

737
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,650
Have you seen Pan?

738
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh? Isn't he in the room?

739
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,150
Not there.

740
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,050
Hey, guys.

741
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,760
He is not in the bathroom.

742
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,430
Or did he go outside?

743
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,410
The sound of the door closing that we heard?

744
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,960
Going outside at this time?

745
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,300
But I think it's already late.

746
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,590
Then I'll go look for him outside.

747
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,180
- I'll go with you too.
- Me too.

748
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,600
But I will stay here.

749
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,380
In case he didn't find anyone when he comes back.

750
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,420
So I can tell you guys.

751
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:26,960
Okay.

752
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:27,780
Okay.

753
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,790
Please try calling him.

754
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,460
He didn't answer?

755
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,990
Please find him carefully around the house.

756
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:44,680
Okay.

757
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,830
Please call me if you find Pan.

758
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,780
Okay.

759
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,200
I leave it to you.

760
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,940
Okay. I'll wait here in case he comes back.

761
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,020
Where are you, Pan?

762
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,240
What about you?
Do you have anywhere in particular you want to go?

763
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,910
Actually,

764
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:37,400
since I came to a prefecture by the sea,
it made me want to walk on the beach in Japan.

765
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,150
Or is it the sea?
