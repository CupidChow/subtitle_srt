Where are you, Pan?

What about you?

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,316
Do you have anywhere in
particular you want to go?

8
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,610
Actually,

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
since I came to a prefecture by the sea,

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,050
it made me want to walk
on the beach in Japan.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,840
Or is it the sea?

13
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,690
"Honestly, I don't feel anything."

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,370
"We're just friends."

15
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
"There's nothing more than that."

16
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,750
Pan!

17
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,690
Pan!

18
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Pan!

19
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,510
Pan!

20
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,776
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming outside?

21
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
Everyone is worried about you.

22
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,930
Yeah. I found Pan.

23
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,690
Please tell everyone not to worry.

24
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,290
I will hurry back.

25
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,210
Okay.

26
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,090
Come on. Let's go back.

27
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,710
I will take you back here later.

28
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,650
You are sick.

29
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,730
I'm fine now.

30
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
What's wrong?

31
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,230
Are you angry at me?

32
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,360
Can you stop pretending to care

33
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,200
or worrying about me?

34
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,590
No way.

35
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,070
Why do I have to do that?

36
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,380
Because you don't really
have any feelings for me.

37
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,960
How do you know I don't
really have feelings for you?

38
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,610
Do you think all I do these
days with you is just for fun?

39
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,890
Pan!

40
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,760
You said it yourself.

41
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,856
You said you don't
have any feelings for me.

42
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,310
Why do you have to do that to me?

43
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,520
You have a big misunderstanding.

44
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,959
What is the truth?

45
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
Can you answer me?

46
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,310
P, answer me.

47
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,300
What is the truth?

48
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,840
Can you answer me?

49
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,049
Answer me!

50
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,620
I love you, Pan!

51
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
So...

52
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,890
What does the talk you had with Plai mean?

53
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
You tell him that you really
don't have feelings for me.

54
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm just repeating
what you said in the live.

55
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,820
When you said we were just friends.

56
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,350
We are not in a relationship.

57
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,610
I should be the one asking you

58
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,620
if you have feelings for me like you say.

59
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
P.

60
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
It's okay.

61
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,500
Let's just say I never asked you.

62
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Let's go back.

63
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Hold on, P.

64
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,740
What you just said...

65
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,720
was it true?

66
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,820
If you don't believe me,

67
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,680
you can ask Plai.

68
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,840
I never meant that.

69
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,730
Even a little bit.

70
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,470
Umm.

71
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,520
What you hear in live...

72
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,030
You also misunderstood me.

73
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I got it.

74
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,020
Don't go out without
telling anyone next time.

75
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm worried about you.

76
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Let's go home.

77
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
I'm cold now.

78
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,310
I'm sorry to you too.

80
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,070
How far did he go to find him?

81
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,430
It's so cold outside.

82
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't know if something happened to him.

83
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,110
Where did those two go?

84
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,010
Exactly.

85
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,160
Would you like me to call them again?

86
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,450
Yeah. Call them.

87
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,370
They have arrived.

88
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,720
Where have you all been?

89
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,060
We were all shocked
that we couldn't find you.

90
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,730
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,150
I have something to think
about while I'm outside.

92
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,700
"I have something to think
about while I'm outside"?

93
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,840
Well.

94
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,430
I can't scold you.

95
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,990
It's good to see you've returned safely.

96
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,480
Don't disappear without
telling anyone next time.

97
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
I also thought you had
transmigrated to another world.

98
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,186
If you still do it next time...

99
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,960
Yes, Ton.

100
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,210
Plai almost cried many times.

101
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,060
It's not true.

102
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
It's true.

103
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,700
You were in tears just now.

104
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,470
Because I'm worried about him.

105
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
Let's put it this way.

106
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,000
Since today we are
facing something difficult.

107
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,849
Let's get drunk to death tonight, shall we?

108
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,890
Great!

109
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,070
Ton.

110
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
Would you both like a drink?

111
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay.

112
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,930
Then say 'Hey!'.

113
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,190
Hey...

114
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,830
- Hey!
- Hey.

115
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,659
I'm relieved he's back.

116
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,980
Go. Let's take a shower.

117
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,739
♫ Sea, sea ♫

118
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,669
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

119
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,670
Hey!

120
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,450
P.

121
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,790
Yeah.

122
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,910
Have you cleared things up with Pan yet?

123
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,210
Yeah.

124
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I did it.

125
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,880
Why is your face still so serious?

126
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,890
Or are you just pretending to be cool?

127
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,190
Yeah.

128
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm pretending to be cool.

129
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,090
You don't understand
about ship couples, do you?

130
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,070
I actually don't really understand it.

131
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,200
But I try to control my feelings.

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,820
You have to have trust.

133
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,360
And everything will
not affect your feelings.

134
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,310
Okay?

135
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,600
There will be a way out.

136
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,440
Don't be stressed.

137
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Okay.

138
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,890
It's fun, isn't it?

139
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It's fun.

140
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,529
♫ The crabs are surrounded
by beautiful beaches ♫

141
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,789
♫ The crabs, the crabs ♫

142
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,829
♫ Look at those fish ♫

143
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,309
♫ Those fish, those fish ♫

144
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,260
♫ A variety of shrimp and shellfish ♫

145
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,986
I only know 'shrimp,
shellfish, crab, fish'.

146
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,226
A variety of shrimp and shellfish.

147
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,930
'Shrimp, shellfish, crab, fish', isn't it?

148
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,620
- ♫Shrimp, shellfish, crab, fish ♫
- ♫A variety of shrimp and shellfish ♫

149
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,070
I think I've had enough.

150
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,510
I'm tired of singing.

151
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,690
- What's next?
- Now it's time for...

152
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,189
game time.

153
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,160
Oh, Ton. But I haven't sung yet.

154
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,540
You are a singer. You can sing anytime.

155
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,800
I can feel you guys in the past.

156
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,090
When I suggested playing
a game while drinking.

157
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
Who do you play games with?

158
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,040
You guys.

159
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,510
This is a command.

160
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,660
You all have to play a
game with me tonight.

161
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,300
- What game?
- Yeah.

162
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,979
Just play with him.

163
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,700
He kept saying it since he was in Thailand.

164
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
Drinking party games.

165
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,336
You guys didn't drink
when you were in Thailand.

166
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,549
But we already talked about it,

167
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,859
we would drink until we died.

168
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,370
Yeah.

169
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,210
The name of this game is 69 Dangerous.

170
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,500
So dangerous.

171
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,059
So you have to say the numbers 1-5.

172
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,419
Just 5 numbers only.

173
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,489
Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

174
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,010
The next person can
also just say 5 numbers.

175
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,630
The first person to say the number 69

176
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,650
must be punished.

177
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Okay?

178
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Let's begin, shall we?

179
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,280
69 Dangerous.

180
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,690
Starting with me.

181
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,319
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

182
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,990
Huh?

184
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:52,970
You idiot!

185
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,296
You said you were a master, didn't you?

186
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,900
You can only say 5 numbers.

187
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,000
Get it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

188
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,560
You said 6, 7, 8, 9...

189
00:14:59,580 --> 00:14:59,930
Oh!

190
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,459
Why do you have to say 11, 12?

191
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh, okay. Let's do it again.

192
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,250
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

193
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,420
11, 12, 13.

194
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,400
14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

195
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,980
19, 20, 21.

196
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,180
22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

197
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,730
27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

198
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,330
32, 33, 34.

199
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
35.

200
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,350
36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

201
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,280
Faster.

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,050
What number is it now?

203
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,640
40.

204
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,999
41, 42, 43, 44, 45.

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,690
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

206
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,400
51, 52, 53, 54, 55.

207
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,799
56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

208
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,879
61, 62, 63, 64, 65.

209
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
66.

210
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,810
67.

211
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,810
68.

212
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,330
6...

213
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,450
9

214
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,310
This is a sample.

215
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,340
The person who was
punished in this round was P.

216
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,660
What is the penalty?

217
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Well.

218
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,130
You have to drink it for 3 seconds.

219
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,219
After that, you have to slowly
take off your shirt piece by piece.

220
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,680
Those wearing only boxers
had to go outside in the cold

221
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,929
for 69 minutes.

222
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,510
Huh?

223
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,510
69 minutes?

224
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,710
Is it too long?

225
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,110
Yes. I think we should change it.

226
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,340
Well. 6 minutes is fine.

227
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,120
You cut out a lot.

228
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Yeah.

229
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,010
69 minutes was too long,
so I cut it down to 6 minutes.

230
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,379
Oh, okay. It's good.

231
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
So think of this as a trial round.

232
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,980
Hey.

233
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,310
Well. Okay.

234
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,850
You talk about trial rounds
with such a simple game?

235
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,229
But I have a condition.

236
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,350
No one is allowed to wear any more shirts.

237
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,430
Get it?

238
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay.

239
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,830
Let's continue.

240
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,530
Come on.

241
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,690
Whose turn? Who starts first?

242
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,690
P will start first.

243
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,119
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

244
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,239
6, 7, 8, 9.

245
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,740
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

246
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,050
15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

247
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,220
20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

248
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,910
- Faster.
- 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

249
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,309
30, 31, 32.

250
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,870
33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

251
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,130
38, 39, 40, 41, 42.

252
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,450
43, 44, 45.

253
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,050
- 46, 47...
- (Stomach growling)

254
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,560
Whose stomach is growling?

255
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,526
You guys just keep drinking
and no one eats any snacks.

256
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,589
- Hurry up.
- Just now it was 49.

257
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,689
- 49 already.
- 49 now.

258
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,230
50, 51, 52, 53.

259
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,440
54, 55, 56, 57, 58.

260
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,680
59, 60, 61, 62.

261
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,720
63, 64, 65.

262
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,270
66, 67.

263
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
68.

264
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,370
Why me?

265
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,869
It switches until your turn.

266
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,460
Yes.

267
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Fine!

268
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Hey.

269
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I even wore a yukata.

270
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,129
Well, start with me.

271
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,820
- 1.
- 2, 3.

272
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,650
- 4, 5.
- 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

273
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,410
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

274
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,330
17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

275
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,330
68...

276
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,320
It's too much!

277
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,820
You guys are too much!

278
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:48,857
Take it off!

279
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,490
Come on.

280
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,710
1, 2, 3, 4.

281
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,220
5, 6, 7, 8.

282
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,709
- 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
- 66, 67, 68.

283
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,710
68.

284
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,160
It's too much!

285
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,570
What you guys did to me was too much!

286
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,030
1.

287
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,460
12, 13.

288
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,790
67, 68.

289
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
69.

290
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,700
Take it off! Take it off!

291
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,500
You have a prominent nose.

292
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
69.

293
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,070
Wow.

294
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,450
- 69!
- 69!

295
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,649
Take it off! Take it off!

296
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,450
Go for it!

297
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,280
69!

298
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,320
Damn game!

299
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,290
I won't play this game anymore.

300
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,739
Do I need to go out now?

301
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,980
- Yes.
- Sure thing.

302
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Alright. I'll go.

303
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,830
- Hold on, Ton.
- Hold on.

304
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,960
What?

305
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,030
3 seconds.

306
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,790
3 seconds.

307
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,999
- 2.
- 2.

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,180
- 3.
- 3.

309
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,100
Good.

310
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I will go to bed.

311
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,690
Wait.

312
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,370
Wait until my turn.

313
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,370
Be patient!

314
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,470
I have to be patient!

315
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Oh, I have abs.

316
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,880
Are you still going to take pictures of me?

317
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,890
Ton.

318
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,550
Ton. What are you doing there?

319
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,097
It's cold.

320
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,610
Come out here.

321
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Come out here.

322
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,850
Time it.

323
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,930
Time it!

324
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,060
Ton. Who told you to stand here?

325
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,940
Damn it.

326
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,020
Fighting, bro.

327
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,660
- I'm rooting for you.
- Just 69 minutes.

328
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
6 minutes!

329
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,540
Oh. It wasn't 69 minutes?

330
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,230
Do you believe me?

331
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,530
Now...

332
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,730
It has shrunk to this size.

333
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,700
I can't find it.

334
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,090
Where are you?

335
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Wait until my turn!

336
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Bye, Ton.

337
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,520
Don't go!

338
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,079
Stay with me.

339
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Bye bye.

340
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,490
PJ.

341
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,280
Please count down for me.

342
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,900
How many minutes are left?

343
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,320
5 minutes.

344
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,870
Good luck, Ton.

345
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,880
Yeah.

346
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,500
Just go.

347
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,859
I'll be waiting for you inside.

348
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Yeah.

349
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,090
Bye bye.

350
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,650
Ton.

351
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,470
It's so cold outside.

352
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,360
So cold.

353
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,190
Even though I wasn't outside
for long, it was really cold.

354
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Look at Ton.

355
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Let me get dressed.

356
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,760
It's cold even inside the house.

357
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,990
Shirt. Shirt. Shirt.

358
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,500
But I really couldn't bear it just now.

359
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,619
But think about it again, he is pitiful.

360
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
- Right?
- Yeah.

361
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,160
It's true that he's pitiful.

362
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,629
But it's funny.

363
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,930
He kept asking us to play games.

364
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,950
How's our plan?

365
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,440
Hey, guys.

366
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,880
Would you like to play
another game before bed?

367
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm excited now.

368
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,330
Okay.

369
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,450
Just one game.

370
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,440
Okay.

371
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,170
This game isn't hard.

372
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,060
Because it's a rapprochement game.

373
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,420
I noticed you'd been sleeping
on the floor for several nights.

374
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,160
So I'd like you to test your luck.

375
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,030
We will pick up the short and long sticks.

376
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Okay?

377
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,190
Would that be okay?

378
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,430
Yeah.

379
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,970
That's okay. I'm not serious about it.

380
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,040
You guys can sleep in the room as usual.

381
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,040
No.

382
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Don't interrupt me.

383
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,460
I agree with Plai.

384
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,210
Sleeping on the floor
is not very comfortable.

385
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,469
What about Ton?

386
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,726
Should we call Ton to play with us?

387
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,840
He's probably frozen now.

388
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,450
He will become frozen.

389
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,340
Yeah.

390
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:51,600
- Frozen.
- Of course.

391
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,920
Well, okay.

392
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,110
I will ask him.

393
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,939
It's okay.

394
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,010
I will ask him myself.

395
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,490
Please prepare a short stick and
a long stick while waiting for me.

396
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,660
Okay?

397
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,270
Okay.

398
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,010
Let's go.

399
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,010
Maybe Ton is already frozen.

400
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
- So cold.
- Ton!

401
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Ton.

402
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,710
What pranks are you doing?

403
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,839
You are going to be
frozen. Come in quickly!

404
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,050
You can go inside now.

405
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,530
Who are you?

406
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,550
PJ?

407
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Yes.

408
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
PJ.

409
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,920
Go get a carrot and stick it in my nose.

410
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,100
I'll become Olaf if you do it.

411
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,850
You can go inside now.

412
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,440
Plai is about to play another game.

413
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,850
What the hell game is he going to play?

414
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,660
I don't want to play.

415
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,430
I don't want to play games anymore.

416
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,169
It's a simple game.

417
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,296
Picking up the short and long sticks.

418
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Come on. Hurry up.

419
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,486
I don't give a damn
whether it's short or long.

420
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,260
Hurry.

421
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,600
Mine has all shrunk.

422
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Hurry up.

423
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,200
No. I don't want anything short or long.

424
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,850
Ton. Hurry up.

425
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,440
Ton.

426
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,280
You are so slow.

427
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,879
I still laugh at his outfit.

428
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,370
- He's here.
- He's here.

429
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,450
I can't take it anymore.

430
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,919
Come on. Sit down.

431
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,990
So cold.

432
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,030
Wow.

433
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,680
If you stick a carrot on my nose,

434
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,190
I will definitely become Olaf from Elsa.

435
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,770
Look!

436
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
In no time!

437
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,480
I've got pneumonia.

438
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
You guys...

439
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,439
I think Ton is very drunk.

440
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,209
- Yeah.
- I've got pneumonia. Look.

441
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,570
I've got pneumonia. If you
don't believe me, just touch it.

442
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,550
Let's continue playing.

443
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,790
What game are you guys going to play?

444
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,570
I think Ton is beyond now.

445
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,130
Well.

446
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,710
Come on!

447
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,870
We will play a game of
picking up short and long sticks.

448
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,930
There will be two long sticks in here.

449
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
Two short sticks.

450
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,180
And one medium sized stick.

451
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,630
Those who pick the same size stick

452
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,060
will sleep in the same room.

453
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,000
But but but!

454
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,180
Whoever picks up the short stick
must drink half a can of beer each.

455
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,250
Okay?

456
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,430
Whoever picks up the long stick
must drink one can of beer each.

457
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,880
The person who picked up the
medium sized stick was unlucky...

458
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,536
You have to drink two cans of beer

459
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
and sleep on the floor.

460
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,510
Okay?

461
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,100
Yeah.

462
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,110
Come on!

463
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,590
- Should we start now?
- Go ahead!

464
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,390
Come on.

465
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,770
You are so slow.

466
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,080
Let's Oh-Noi-Ork. (A game about eliminating
people by up and down their hands)

467
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,800
Oh-Noi-Ork!

468
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,439
Plai. You first.

469
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Let's start.

470
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,570
I will choose this stick.

471
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,209
Hey, long stick...

472
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,650
I got a long stick!

473
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,110
You have to drink half a can.

474
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,390
One can!

475
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,210
One can?

476
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,950
Yeah.

477
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,950
You're drunk, Pan.

478
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Come on.

479
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,820
You can put it down.

480
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,430
My nipples are falling off now.

481
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,120
Let's continue, hurry.

482
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,680
Let's continue.

483
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,280
Oh-Noi-Ork!

484
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,470
Oh-Noi-Ork!

485
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Me!

486
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
My turn.

487
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,010
What kind of stick(Mai) is this?

488
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,640
Mai-roo. (I don't know)

489
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,420
Mai-roo my ass.

490
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,160
What mai?

491
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
Mai-roo.

492
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,140
- Mai-roo.
- It's mai-roo.

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,120
Mai-roo.

494
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Alright.

495
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,080
Oh-Noi-Ork!

496
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,610
P! Pick it.

497
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
I got a short stick!

498
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,770
Well.

499
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,580
Let's see who will sleep with P.

500
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
But...

501
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,010
You will definitely not sleep on the floor.

502
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,580
Because the person who
sleeps on the floor is...

503
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,420
Let's start.

504
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,750
- Let's start.
- I'll start now.

505
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,600
1, 2, 3!

506
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,230
I got a long stick!

507
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I got a short stick!

508
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,780
Why are you so happy, Pan?

509
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,170
What about...

510
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,710
What should I do with this damn stick?

511
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,339
Tell me!

512
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,130
Ton got a middle stick.

513
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,590
Sleep there, Ton.

514
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,280
The floor.

515
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:52,681
- The floor, Ton.
- The floor. Okay?

516
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Huh?

517
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,370
Why do I have to sleep on the floor?

518
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,840
Because you got a middle stick.

519
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,460
Really?

520
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,580
You are lucky.

521
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,960
This whole room is yours.

522
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,620
Yes.

523
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
He's right.

524
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,120
It's a big room.

525
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,521
It's the largest room in the house.

526
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,960
Don't forget it, Ton.

527
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,240
Two cans.

528
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,840
- Two cans.
- Two cans.

529
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
Go.

530
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,799
I should be happy, right?

531
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Yes.

532
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,360
Yeah.

533
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:27,550
- Yeah.
- That's right.

534
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,400
I'll go now.

535
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,150
Ton.

536
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,090
Ton...

537
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,100
Ton, just get some rest.

538
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,890
Then...

539
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
I would like to take a shower.

540
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,616
I'll follow you to your room later.

541
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,870
Ton, sit carefully.

542
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,070
Have they stopped drinking yet?

543
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Yeah.

544
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,540
I saw that Plai and PJ were still drinking.

545
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,200
But Ton is already asleep.

546
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,490
That's his normal thing.

547
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,030
Yeah.

548
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,170
What about you? Are you going to bed yet?

549
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,760
I think I'm going to bed now.

550
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,600
Let me see. Are you still feeling feverish?

551
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,720
Your fever isn't that high anymore.

552
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,000
But I don't know why I feel cold.

553
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Are you feeling cold?

554
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,290
Are you sick?

555
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,030
Did you caught a cold from me?

556
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,570
No.

557
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,960
I just want to hug you.

558
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,400
You... P.

559
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,720
Hurt. I'm hurt.

560
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Why?

561
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,870
You should be beaten.

562
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,810
You're bad.

563
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,390
It hurts.

564
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,920
Are you faking it again?

565
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
It hurts.

566
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,720
Why are you hurt?

567
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,240
I just hit you lightly.

568
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,910
Are you injured?

569
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,900
I think it's because I fell
when I went to find you.

570
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,780
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

571
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,120
So I can find some medicine for you.

572
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,500
Just being with you, it heals me.

573
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,440
I can apply the medicine later.

574
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,660
But now I want to hug you more.

575
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,690
That's enough.

576
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,790
Where did the old you go?

577
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,710
A quiet person.

578
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,350
I'm really going to hit you.

579
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,300
I will be more talkative.

580
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,460
Be careful, you will get hurt.

581
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
It's okay.

582
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Come here.

583
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Let me hug you.

584
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,710
Why are you such a good drinker?

585
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,820
No, I'm not.

586
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,280
The two people who were
good drinkers in that room.

587
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,870
Really?

588
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,060
I'm not surprised.

589
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,970
They drank a lot but didn't look drunk.

590
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,110
He's drunk, actually.

591
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,940
He's just acting cool.

592
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,910
He always tapped his neck and said,
"I have a very solid neck (heavyweight)"

593
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,310
I didn't drink much in the past.

594
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,640
But I drank more after I met P.

595
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,440
But I don't know why he drinks less.

596
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,840
He must be improving himself.

597
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Really?

598
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Yeah.

599
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,480
I didn't see you two drinking
alcohol when you were in Thailand.

600
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,990
We can't drink it.

601
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:26,640
But drinking after having something to think about
or something stressful makes me feel refreshed.

602
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,880
You can tell me if you
have anything stressful.

603
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,500
Stop being so nice to everyone.

604
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,600
I'm not nice to everyone.

605
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,610
So please exclude me.

606
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,390
Why are you backing away from me again?

607
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,770
Because I'm scared.

608
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,380
How scary am I?

609
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,290
Everything.

610
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,770
I'm going to bed now.

611
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,040
Pan is waiting for me.

612
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,870
You have to sleep with me tonight.

613
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,750
Did you forget it?

614
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,240
Yeah.

615
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
You're right.

616
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,990
Come on. I'll take you to bed.

617
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,110
Be careful.

618
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,690
Slowly. I feel like throwing up.

619
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,070
Are you okay?

620
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,670
No...

621
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,850
Plai. Please take a seat.

622
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Please take a seat.

623
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
Are you okay? Do you
want to go to the bathroom?

624
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,580
No. I want to go to bed.

625
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
So...

626
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,880
Would you like some water first?

627
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,400
Good.

628
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Please go to bed.

629
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,710
Don't speak politely.

630
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,870
Don't laugh too.

631
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,840
I laugh at drunk people.

632
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,380
Stop laughing.

633
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,860
Go. Let's go to bed.

634
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,019
I told you not to speak politely.

635
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,570
Stop saying it.

636
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,490
What are you thinking?

637
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,590
Just some random stuff.

638
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,780
What's random stuff?

639
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,050
A place to take you on a trip.

640
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,650
Where are you taking me tomorrow?

641
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,040
Do you want to go skiing?

642
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,170
Ski?

643
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Deal!

644
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,450
Traveling with many people is fun.

645
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Do you know how to ski?

646
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,330
I skied once.

647
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,870
But it's been a long time.

648
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,340
What about you? Have you ever skied?

649
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,150
No.

650
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,480
But I want to try it after you come.

651
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,870
Are you telling the truth?

652
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,800
You've been in Japan for a
long time, but have never skied?

653
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,490
Yeah. Normally, I used to be at the bar.

654
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,670
You didn't force yourself
to change, did you?

655
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,840
Not at all.

656
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,840
It might be difficult at first.

657
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,280
Because I'm not used to it.

658
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,130
But it's okay after time passes.

659
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,760
I tried doing as you said.

660
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,340
I also want to try

661
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,140
to see what it would be like if I did it.

662
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Thank you

663
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
for giving me advice.

664
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,650
Yeah.

665
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
So...

666
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,550
How is your work going?

667
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,630
Are we disrupting your work?

668
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,010
I have sent the draft
to the team for review.

669
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,940
If there is nothing to fix, just edit the
graphics and everything will be done.

670
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,540
You can tell me if you need to work.

671
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
Yeah.

672
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
Don't worry.

673
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,430
Just a moment.

674
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,840
You can tell me if you need to work.

675
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,980
Ointment.

676
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,750
How can you enjoy skiing tomorrow
if you don't apply the medicine?

677
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
It's okay.

678
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,490
It's just a minor wound.

679
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,330
Be careful.

680
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
You will get hurt again.

681
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,536
What minor wound do you mean?

682
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
It's all red.

683
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,730
Are you hurt?

684
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,630
Yes.

685
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm hurt here too.

686
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Right here?

687
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,790
Right here too.

688
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,890
Does it hurt here?

689
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,590
Yes.

690
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Doesn't it hurt here?

691
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,060
Right here too.

692
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,010
Please apply for me.

693
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Does it hurt here?

694
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,820
Does it hurt?

695
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Yes.

696
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm sorry.

697
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,910
I'm sorry to you too.

698
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,740
That's enough.

699
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,000
Wash your hands.

700
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,260
So we can sleep together.

701
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,850
I want to continue the massage.

702
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,620
No. You need to wash your hands.

703
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,990
So we can sleep together.

704
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll be right back.

705
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Be careful.

706
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,170
What should I do next?

707
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Take off your shirt.

708
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,030
Please raise your arms.

709
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Come on.

710
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,880
Oh, PJ.

711
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,500
Pan.

712
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,900
You haven't slept yet?

713
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Not yet.

714
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I think you're asleep.

715
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,830
I'll go to bed in a while.

716
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:35,400
Are you looking for something?

717
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,830
I came to get a towel.

718
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,170
I'll go now.

719
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,790
Good night.

720
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Yeah. Good night.

721
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,610
What are you doing?

722
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,740
I'll wipe you down.

723
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,710
Vomit stains will make
you sleep uncomfortable.

724
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,030
I told you to stop being nice.

725
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,450
So that others don't go overboard.

726
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,270
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

727
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,600
But now, change your shirt first.

728
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,520
That's enough.

729
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
I'm sorry.

730
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,220
I'm cold.

731
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,550
Calm down.

732
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Please wear a shirt.

733
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,530
You look like a child when you're drunk.

734
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,720
I'm grown up.

735
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,470
Okay. You're grown up.

736
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,000
Now, grown people must sleep.

737
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,800
Japanese beer is really strong.

738
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,240
It makes you feel hot even in cold weather.

739
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,430
What's wrong?

740
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,540
You can't sleep?

741
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,910
Yeah.

742
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,030
Probably because I
slept for a long time today.

743
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,600
It's good that you sleep a lot.

744
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,080
So you will get well soon.

745
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,190
Actually, I want to stay
up all night talking to you.

746
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,620
Since we sleep in the same room.

747
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,940
So tonight, let's stay up and talk all
night until we're all sleepy, shall we?

748
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:34,310
Yeah.

749
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,800
Do you have anything you
want to talk to me about?

750
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,980
A lot of things happened today.

751
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,590
Even though the problem has been resolved.

752
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,510
But I don't know why

753
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,120
I still feel bad.

754
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,060
Is it because of me?

755
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,870
No.

756
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,690
It's because of me.

757
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,440
I don't know

758
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,490
why it's so messy.

759
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,930
Are you okay?

760
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,570
Don't worry about it.

761
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,400
Even though I still don't understand it.

762
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,930
But I will try.

763
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,440
You know? I thought last
night was just a dream.

764
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,740
Do you remember it now?

765
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,590
About what you did to me.

766
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,480
We almost got caught.

767
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,010
Luckily, PJ didn't notice it.

768
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,380
I'm sorry.

769
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,750
Why are you sorry to me?

770
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,330
If we don't talk about the
worry of getting caught...

771
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,550
I like it.

772
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,530
Is there...

773
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,340
anything else you like?

774
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,240
Actually...

775
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,870
I have something I'd like you to try.

776
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,960
Would you like to try?

777
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,830
Yeah.

778
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,910
What is it?

779
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,800
Let me think.

780
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,540
Can you say 'ka' cutely?
(Thai polite particles)

781
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,150
Okay ka.

782
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
That's right ka.

783
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Do you like it ka?

784
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,790
Huh?

785
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,400
Are you satisfied ka?

786
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,630
I feel cheesy now ka.

787
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
That's enough ka.

788
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,110
Are you teasing me ka?

789
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,670
Are you challenging me ka?

790
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,800
No.

791
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,580
Do you like it ka? Huh?

792
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,430
That's enough.

793
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,230
I feel cheesy now.

794
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,250
Tell me if you hurt naka.

795
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,240
Do you feel a spasm ka?

796
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,930
I'm embarrassed now.

797
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,010
Why?

798
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:09,850
Am I not doing well?

799
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,940
Don't you like it?

800
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:13,810
Don't you like it ka?

801
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,400
How many times would you like tonight?

802
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:28,830
Huh?

803
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,170
What do you want?

804
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,370
Which position do you like ka?

805
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,070
What?

806
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:40,820
Do you want to squeeze me?

807
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,086
Do you want to squeeze me?

808
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,110
Squeeze.

809
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,830
Just do it.

810
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,380
Would you like me to do it now ka?

811
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,730
Take off your pants.

812
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,460
What do you want me to do ka, baby?

813
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,910
I will stay up all night
talking to you ka, baby.

814
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,760
Are you feeling good ka?

815
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,520

816
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,650
Mine is all hard ka.

817
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,736
Would you like me to put it in?

818
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
I've slept a lot.

819
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,040
I have a lot of energy.

820
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,950
He might be cold.

821
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
Your blanket.

822
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Good night.

823
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,210
Yeah.

824
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,420
(What do you want me to do ka, baby?)

825
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:08,149
(I will stay up all night
talking to you ka, baby)

826
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,190
You suck. Are you leaving now?

827
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,800
I can play alone.

828
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,930
Rock, paper, scissors!

829
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,670
You have to drink it if you lose me.

830
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,320
Rock, paper, scissors!

831
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,380
You lost. You have to drink it.

832
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:51,284
I love you.
