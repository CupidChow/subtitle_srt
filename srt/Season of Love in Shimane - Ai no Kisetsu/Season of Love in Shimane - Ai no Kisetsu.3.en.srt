00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,130
Where is his blanket?

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,630
It was still there last night.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,580
You might get sick.

8
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Hey!

9
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,530
Plai...

10
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,160
Why are you standing there?

11
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,270
It shocked me.

12
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,770
Stop pretending to be mad at me.

13
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,320
I wonder where my blanket has gone.

14
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,150
It turns out that you brought
a blanket for your hus...

15
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I mean P.

16
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,739
P sleeps without a blanket.

17
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,790
He might be cold.

18
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,860
But can your little
brother sleep in the cold?

19
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,816
But your man needs to sleep warm?

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,990
Like this?

21
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,130
Alright.

22
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,490
Are you satisfied yet?

24
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,940
Since you're awake.

25
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,900
Would you like to go get some
cold and fresh air at the park?

26
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,360
Get some fresh air.

27
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,570
Cold and fresh in the morning.

28
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,960
Your mucus will turn to ice
if you go outside at this time.

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,360
You want to have an aesthetic mood
without checking the weather.

30
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Oh?

31
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,810
Are you guys awake?

32
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,870
Do you need any help from me?

33
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,950
I came to get my blanket.

34
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
I found it.

35
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,240
Let me go back to sleep.

36
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,570
Okay.

37
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,210
Just keep sleeping.

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm going for a walk outside.

39
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 3)

40
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,660
Plai is right.

41
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
So cold.

42
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,730
Why did you come outside?

43
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,790
It's cold outside.

44
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,290
Thank you.

45
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,970
You didn't sleep well last night?

46
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,190
Why did you wake up so early?

47
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,470
No.

48
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,470
I stepped outside for some fresh morning
air, expecting to feel refreshed and relaxed.

49
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,430
But I didn't think it
would be this cold outside.

50
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,240
I got your coat…feeling a bit better now.

51
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,410
Be careful of getting sick.

52
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
That's okay.

53
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,480
It's okay if there are
people who take care of me.

54
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,730
I often sit here when I
have no ideas for work.

55
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,860
And close my eyes.

56
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,840
Take a deep breath.

57
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,940
As you told me.

58
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
How were the results?

59
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Did it help you?

60
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
No.

61
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,210
Huh?

62
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,750
It means you are doing it wrong.

63
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,370
Do it again.

64
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,410
Sit and close your eyes like this.

65
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,890
And take a deep breath

66
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,800
into your lungs.

67
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,860
Breathe out for a long time.

68
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Like this.

69
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
Why don't you follow me?

70
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,010
I did it right.

71
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,480
As you told me.

72
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,670
Then why don't you have any ideas?

73
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,300
You'll get oxygen when
you take a deep breath.

74
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,080
It makes the blood pump in your body

75
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,750
and clears your mind.

76
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,010
It's because I keep thinking about you.

77
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Every time I close my eyes, I
keep thinking about what you said.

78
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,660
I tried to do everything.

79
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,650
But it didn't help me at all.

80
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,170
Alright.

81
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,260
Don't do it next time.

82
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,290
Thanks for the blanket.

83
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah.

84
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,050
Where is your blanket?

85
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,140
I still saw it last night.

86
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,040
You guys woke up early.

87
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,810
Excuse me.

88
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,020
Are you guys shooting a music video?

89
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,350
It's terribly cold.

90
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,620
Ton, are you awake?

91
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,070
You asked a weird question again.

92
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm probably sleepwalking to speak with you
for such a long time.

93
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,330
P.

94
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,390
Do you have coffee or a warm drink inside?

95
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,210
I think if we put something
warm to slam into our mouths

96
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,130
it would be so satisfying.

97
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,930
If you mean coffee, I have some.

98
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
I'll go look for it again.

99
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,659
Thank you.

100
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,900
It's okay if you can't find it.

101
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm thinking about finding something
delicious to eat around here.

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,140
Hey, let me go with you.

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,310
I want to find popular
food in a convenience store.

104
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,279
Hurry up and take a shower
if you want to go with me.

105
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,870
Go!

106
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,709
P. You don't need to find it.

107
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,550
I'd rather go buy food with them.

108
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,510
Do you want anything? I'll buy it for you.

109
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,540
It's okay.

110
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,750
Let's go.

111
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,926
Why are you still sitting here? Go shower.

112
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,950
Okay.

113
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,056
Would you like the same coffee as before?

114
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Yeah.

115
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,630
- Okay.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,720
Hurry up and take a shower.

117
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,699
I'm going to find PJ.

118
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
In case he wants to come with me.

119
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,130
Hey, Ton!

120
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,890
You don't have to do it.

121
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,670
I'll wake him up later.

122
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,210
He said he was tired.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,510
I'll leave it to you.

124
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,836
I'm going to change my shoes.

125
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,790
Pan, hurry up and take a shower!

126
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,170
Yes, Ton.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's so cold.

128
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
I should go inside.

129
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:54,688
Where?

130
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:55,826
Diet?

131
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,111
Have a cup of tea in the morning.

132
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,712
I'm also happy to drink tea.

133
00:10:58,782 --> 00:10:59,782
Exactly.

134
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,230
Oh?

135
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,880
PJ, are you awake?

136
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,870
Yeah.

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,550
Move closer so he can sit.

138
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,570
Yes, I am.

139
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,520
Have you been awake for long?

140
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,980
Why didn't anyone wake me up?

141
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,440
P has woken you up since this morning.

142
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,630
But you didn't wake up.

143
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,160
I thought you were tired,
so I let you sleep more.

144
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,790
I'm going to wake you up.

145
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,590
Is that right?

146
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,940
I think I am a person
who is easily awakened.

147
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,130
It must be because you are tired.

148
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,760
I really went to wake you up.

149
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
PJ.

150
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Wake up.

151
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,760
Everyone has woken up.

152
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,800
You are such a sleepyhead.

153
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Just keep sleeping.

154
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,890
P.

155
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,130
What are you doing?

156
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,580
Nothing. I...

157
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:11,730
came to wake him up.

158
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,780
But he didn't wake up.

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,830
Yeah.

160
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,600
He must be sleepy.

161
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,360
He must be tired.

162
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,520
You are not a sleepy person
when you are in Thailand.

163
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,011
It turns out that you are a
sleepy person while in Japan.

164
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Huh?

165
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,950
Me?

166
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,590
You can ask Plai.

167
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,879
Plai is my witness.

168
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,040
I really went to wake you up.

169
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,130
Right?

170
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,590
Yes.

171
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,350
I saw P in front of your room.

172
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,180
Well, let's forget about it.

173
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,540
It's good that you're awake.

174
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,060
Come on. Let's eat.

175
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,760
Eat it, PJ.

176
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,450
This dish is delicious.

177
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Here.

178
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,880
Milk.

179
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,640
I see you like to drink it in the morning.

180
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
Hey.

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,720
Why do you know what I need?

182
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,080
It's just a common thing.

183
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,110
Anyone knows it.

184
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,690
'Anyone knows it'

185
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,040
What do you mean it's common?

186
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,000
I take care of him but
I don't even know it.

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
Do you like to drink milk?

188
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,570
Just pay attention to your food.

189
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,100
You are really talkative.

190
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,209
Uh, P.

191
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,640
Yeah.

192
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,380
Where are you taking us today?

193
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,080
I think I'll just do a little
bit of my work today.

194
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Sure.

195
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,559
I've been wanting to
ask you since yesterday.

196
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,230
What do you do?

197
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm working on a travel page and blog.

198
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,480
Since the last time I
took you guys on a trip.

199
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,660
It made me know myself better.

200
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,240
I was good at it, so I gave it a try.

201
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,640
Are you promoting Shimane
on your blog right now?

202
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

203
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,210
I'm promoting it together
with Shimane prefecture.

204
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,870
About seasons or
festivals. Something like that.

205
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,980
Wow.

206
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,400
Awesome.

207
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,200
You get to travel and
work at the same time.

208
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,350
So good.

209
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,350
Exactly.

210
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,180
It's quite challenging.

211
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,860
About making the
presentation more interesting.

212
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,690
Each season has different festivals.

213
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,670
How can I help you with your work?

214
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,020
Please let us know if there is
anything we can help you with.

215
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,179
They have a lot of fans.

216
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,480
Yes.

217
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,760
- They can help you.
- Yes.

218
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,260
It's considered compensation
for letting us stay here for free.

219
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,570
Please let us know if you need any help.

220
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,449
Who said I would let you
guys stay here for free?

221
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,910
Huh?

222
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,110
Huh?

223
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,990
Don't tell me you're going
to charge us like last time?

224
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,830
Yes, P.

225
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,120
Why are you so cruel?

226
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,270
I'm your friend.

227
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
We are not strangers like last time.

228
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,220
I don't charge you any money.

229
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,320
But you have to work instead.

230
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,590
I'm going to work today.

231
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,660
I will take you guys to
help me with my work.

232
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
Working?

233
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,840
Is that work difficult?

234
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,930
I'd like to pay in cash if it's difficult.

235
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,120
Don't forget the company policy
that your boss told you about.

236
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,170
Just use money to solve the problem.

237
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,680
Yes.

238
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:26,801
I would like to pay in cash.

239
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,100
Hey, Ton.

240
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,860
You escaped so quickly.

241
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,390
Let's hurry up and eat.

242
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
So that we can get ready to go out.

243
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,440
I want to work so bad.

244
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,160
Yes, I want to travel.

245
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,360
I'll drink milk then.

246
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,159
Wow.

247
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,010
- Is this real?
- So good.

248
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,520
Is this a real flower?

249
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,150
Is this real?

250
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
So beautiful.

251
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Guys.

252
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,050
This place is so beautiful and magnificent.

253
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Exactly.

254
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,100
This was a garden that
exceeded my expectations.

255
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,370
Right?

256
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,960
Right?

257
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,680
I never thought that such a
beautiful place would exist.

258
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Uh, P.

259
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
What would you like us
to help you with your work?

260
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm just kidding.

261
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,750
It's nothing.

262
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm going to work.

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,580
You guys can rest comfortably here.

264
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,730
Let's message each other after this.

265
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,540
No, P.

266
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't be considerate of us.

267
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,060
You can tell us how we can help you.

268
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,210
Yes.

269
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,370
You can tell us.

270
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,760
We are willing.

271
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,390
Well.

272
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,640
Thank you so much.

273
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,136
Actually, I just need to take a picture of
the overall view to upload to the blog.

274
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I usually ask tourists to be models.

275
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,359
Especially when the
place has activities to do.

276
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Such as here.

277
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,410
P.

278
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,289
You can tell me to be a model.

279
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,960
This is a chill job for us.

280
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,120
I’ll have Pan take a picture with me.

281
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,970
Fans will go crazy about it.

282
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,510
PJ is right.

283
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,090
Think about it.

284
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
Such a beautiful and romantic place.

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,210
Look at the flowers.

286
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,150
If they take pictures as an
imaginary couple, the BL series.

287
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,550
PJ-Pan.

288
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,850
I guarantee fans will go crazy about it.

289
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Trust me.

290
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,960
I think just taking a single
portrait would be enough.

291
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,710
Gosh, P.

292
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,800
Trust Ton.

293
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,200
Yes.

294
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,840
I think your boss might like this idea.

295
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,350
Alright.

296
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Then I will do that.

297
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,900
But first, I need to give a
brief description of this place.

298
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,070
This is a bird park.

299
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,540
It has many beautiful
bird species on display.

300
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,360
We are standing in the
climate-controlled glasshouse

301
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,700
that displays beautiful
flowers all year round.

302
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh, and it has a souvenir shop and a cafe.

303
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,530
I think you guys will like it.

304
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm sorry to bother you today.

305
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,640
I'm relieved to hear that.

306
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,660
Do you know what I imagined at first?

307
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,870
I understand that you will
tell me to help you carry things.

308
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,309
I can't really help you if that's the case.

309
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,429
But if it's this case, it's so chill.

310
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,180
I'll let two of them help you.

311
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,960
Let me go hang out around here.

312
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,930
I want to see the
beauty of various flowers.

313
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Hold on.

314
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,770
No way.

315
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,370
You have to stay here.

316
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,120
Yes. You too, Ton.

317
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,340
I need several models for today.

318
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,810
Come on.

319
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,760
- Help him.
- Help him.

320
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,080
Are you going to run away?

321
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,690
Alright. Okay.

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm not very good at it.

323
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Let's get started?

324
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,779
I really want to take
a picture with flowers.

325
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
Shall we go there?

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where should we go first?

327
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,230
Here?

328
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Wow.

329
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,070
How should I sit?

330
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,170
Just sit here.

331
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,040
Right here?

332
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,770
Yeah.

333
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,630
Like this?

334
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes.

335
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:02,790
Good.

336
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,600
How should I pose?

337
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,020
Please cross your legs.

338
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,950
Okay.

339
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,670
Okay?

340
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,670
Yes.

341
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,860
I won't let you guys get close to
each other after the job is done.

342
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
What are you reading?

343
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,730
Information for writing a blog.

344
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,246
It doesn't have some
information on the internet.

345
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,200
In case it can be presented.

346
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I see.

347
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,190
Are you bored?

348
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,540
Would you like to go to another zone?

349
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,610
Wait a moment.

350
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Not at all.

351
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,330
I really like this.

352
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,410
It's a nice atmosphere, spacious and cool.

353
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,030
I'm glad you like it.

354
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah.

355
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,690
Is there anything I can help you with?

356
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,510
Yes.

357
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,060
I'm looking for it.

358
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Come on.

359
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Let's go.

360
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Penguin!

361
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,870
Are there penguins here?

362
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,760
Yes.

363
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,480
They have a penguin
show schedule twice a day.

364
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,350
We came at the right time.

365
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,460
I've never seen a penguin up close.

366
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,910
So cute.

367
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,630
Let's take a photo?

368
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,480
Yes.

369
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,940
Please be my model later.

370
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Okay.

371
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,710
This place is very good, don't you think?

372
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,630
It's a temperature-controlled garden.

373
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,060
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
able to eat ice cream like this.

374
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,170
Even though the weather
outside is very cold.

375
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,100
Exactly.

376
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,630
I've never been here either.

377
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,580
I didn't think it would be this good.

378
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,840
I really like this vibe.

379
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,260
Like flowers or trees.

380
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,380
The atmosphere here is also good.

381
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,020
Moreover, there are many birds.

382
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,920
How many months have you been working?

383
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,840
About 4-5 months.

384
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,160
I have a sister that I know
who runs a travel page.

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,550
She is creating a new blog.

386
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,160
So she told me to try it.

387
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,450
You've been here for months.
Is there a place you've never been to?

388
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,670
Sure.

389
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,950
At first, I went to many places.

390
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,060
When I write a blog, I need to
spend more time with each location.

391
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,100
I have to go to some places many times.

392
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
It's not easy.

393
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,590
It's true.

394
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,220
I knew right away it wouldn't
be easy after seeing you today.

395
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,770
What about you? Do you have
anywhere in particular you want to go?

396
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,170
Actually, since I came
to a prefecture by the sea,

397
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
it made me want to walk
on the beach in Japan.

398
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,290
I wonder what the sea
will be like in winter.

399
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
The sea?

400
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,246
There are actually some
seas that are not far from home.

401
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,820
It takes 10 minutes to walk there.

402
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,680
I used to walk there when I had no idea.

403
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,090
I went to enjoy the view and nature

404
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,660
as someone around here once told me.

405
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,710
It's relaxing.

406
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,450
Ahem!

407
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,040
Pan.

408
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,110
P.

409
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,760
You guys are here?

410
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,090
What are you guys doing?

411
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,580
Maybe I'm doing laundry.

412
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,120
You saw me eating ice cream.

413
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,390
I'm just asking you nicely.

414
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,980
Why are you so upset with me?

415
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,450
Can you guys please stop fighting?

416
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,160
What about the others?

417
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Huh?

418
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,030
I don't know.

419
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,090
I was taking pictures of owls. But they all
disappeared after I looked for them again.

420
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,609
Just now, I saw that
you guys were about to...

421
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,680
Are there owls here?

422
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,820
Where?

423
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,460
Take me there. Please?

424
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,979
Right, P?

425
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,326
They said you have to come see the owls
if you come here, right?

426
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,089
Yes, owls are famous here.

427
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,600
Owls are number one.

428
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,610
Suddenly, owls are important to you.

429
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,320
Let's go. Take me to see the owls.

430
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,000
Right there, right?

431
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,340
Pan.

432
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,800
I just joined the show with the owl.

433
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,700
Look.

434
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,720
It came out so beautiful.

435
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,770
Yeah.

436
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
This picture is so cute.

437
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,549
This picture is also beautiful.

438
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,140
Is it good?

439
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Yes.

440
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey.

441
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:10,880
I also went to see the penguins.

442
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,260
Here. Look. Did you see that?

443
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
See?

444
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,540
I have a video.

445
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,109
Just now I raised my hand as they said.

446
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,410
I hold the hoop and
let the owl pass through.

447
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,190
Mine, they flew right through this hole.

448
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,710
Here.

449
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,810
See?

450
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,940
What happened to you guys?

451
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,346
You guys are competing like children.

452
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,880
Especially you, you shouldn't
even brag about it to anyone.

453
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,049
You snatched a 3-5 year
old child to put on a show.

454
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,849
The child's mother
had to comfort her child.

455
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,099
You are taking away
children's opportunities.

456
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,210
Hey, whoever is faster gets it, right?

457
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,470
But I like it. Did you see its
lover fly through the hoop?

458
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,420
Its face is as white as a Chinese person's.

459
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Exactly.

460
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,329
Uh, P.

461
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,220
Is your work done?

462
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,280
Is there anything missing?

463
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,950
My work is done.

464
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,750
But I'm hungry now.

465
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Let's go get something to eat.

466
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,700
Hey, don't go yet.

467
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,520
I still want to stay here.

468
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,120
Do you still want to stay here?

469
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,666
You've been here so long that
every bird has recognized your face.

470
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,440
Go. Let's find something to eat.

471
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,080
- Let's go.
- True.

472
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,169
- I'm hungry.
- Alright.

473
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,540
Let's go.

474
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,959
Come on. Take a picture for me.

475
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,080
Let me clean the lens first.

476
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,510
Why are you in such a hurry?

477
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,710
I see you're not taking a picture of me.

478
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,730
Really?

479
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,010
Just like that.

480
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,500
You look like a model.

481
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,630
PJ.

482
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,460
I don't know where the bathroom is.

483
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,970
Please check that way.

484
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,260
I'll check this way.

485
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Okay.

486
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Yeah.

487
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Ton.

488
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,150
Let's go inside.

489
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Is it okay now?

490
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,480
Plai, go inside.

491
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,480
Please send me an airdrop.

492
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Sure.

493
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,150
PJ!

494
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,300
I found the bathroom. It's over here.

495
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,630
I'm telling you there's
no bathroom over there.

496
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,380
Thank you, bro.

497
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,680
Wow.

498
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,320
Wow.

499
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,270
My dish looks so delicious!

500
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,519
This dish looks more delicious, Ton.

501
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,120
This dish looks the most delicious, Ton.

502
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,560
The noodles are very big.

503
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,036
Aren't you going to the bathroom?

504
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,180
I'll finish eating first and
then go to the bathroom.

505
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,840
Ton, it looks so delicious.

506
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,960
It looks so delicious.

507
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Please share it with me.

508
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,580
This dish looks so delicious.

509
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,100
Guys, do you know?

510
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,750
The food here is so delicious.

511
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,240
You haven't arrived yet
if you come here and don't dine here.

512
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,810
Really?

513
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,116
Come on. I will scoop it for you.

514
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,690
Let me see.

515
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:53,150
Let me see. Come on.

516
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,290
Is it really delicious?

517
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,490
Look at this pork.

518
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,490
- Wow.
- Let me see.

519
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,370
Stewed beef.

520
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:58,640
So hot.

521
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,970
It's really good.

522
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Here, Ton.

523
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,340
Thank you.

524
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,450
Thank you so much.

525
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,460
Thank you.

526
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,860
Umami.

527
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,410
Do you want some more?
I'll scoop some for you.

528
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
That's enough.

529
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,660
My plate is full.

530
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,830
The food here is very delicious.

531
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,550
The atmosphere outside is also good.

532
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,440
My mouth and eyes are so lucky.

533
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,640
I've been here on Saturday and Sunday.

534
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,689
Every table was full of people.

535
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,690
Really?

536
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,250
Actually, I want to try every menu.

537
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
But we've ordered several dishes already.

538
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,030
I can't take it. I'm full.

539
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,080
Pan.

540
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,100
Would you like to try this?

541
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
It's so delicious.

542
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,230
I'll scoop it for you.

543
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,710
Hey, just eat it.

544
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,770
Let me try this dish first.

545
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,730
Do you want to order anything more?

546
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,640
P doesn't eat much.

547
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,520
Look at him.

548
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,010
He kept giving food to others.

549
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,620
His bowl was almost empty.

550
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,330
I have a question.

551
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,560
I see that the three of you are close.

552
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,300
How did you guys meet?

553
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,220
We've met in Japan before.

554
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
In Tokyo.

555
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,159
Why?

556
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Is that weird?

557
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,740
I would say that this
seaweed soup is very delicious.

558
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,440
So how did you guys become so close?

559
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,560
I asked to sleep at his house.

560
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,740
I booked the wrong date.

561
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
So we became close.

562
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,290
You are so easy-going.

563
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,010
You guys have never met before,

564
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,520
but you're staying at his house.

565
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,400
You will die if he is a psychopathic
killer who slit your throat.

566
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,690
It's what I'm afraid of.

567
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,650
But I won't have a
bed if I don't follow him.

568
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,040
He also charged me last time.

569
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Yes.

570
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,950
Why are you so stingy?

571
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,789
You look rich.

572
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,950
But why do you look so stingy?

573
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,550
Uh, P.

574
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,000
Let me ask you something.

575
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,390
Are you interested in working in the entertainment
industry like the lead actor in a series?

576
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,630
I don't think so, Ton.

577
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,750
I'm not good at it.

578
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,600
Don't say you're not good at it.

579
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,080
This idiot can't do anything.

580
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,939
I went back to the
faculty to help my seniors.

581
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,480
When I met him, he was a cheerleader.

582
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,980
He wasn't a cheerleader like 12-123.

583
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,540
Have you ever seen a
cheerleader with a pom-pom?

584
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:24,520
Wearing tight pants and
dancing like Ah-ah-ah!

585
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,580
The girls are screaming their lungs out!

586
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,520
I saw him and felt that he had potential.

587
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,109
So I polished stones
and gravel into diamonds.

588
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,559
Look at him now.

589
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,830
He became an artist. He became
an imagined couple with Pan.

590
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,979
They became a famous imagined couple.

591
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Did you see it?

592
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,730
You're praising me too much.

593
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,830
Excuse me.

594
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,390
I haven't even praised you yet.

595
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
If you don't believe it.

596
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,640
PJ, try making your old-school
cheerleader pom-pom.

597
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,130
12 123 12 12 1 Hey!

598
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,280
What the hell are you doing?

599
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,870
Do you remember?

600
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
It's pretty perfect with him.

601
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
Guys.

602
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,326
I think we should hurry and finish it.

603
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,810
Yeah.

604
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,030
I'll take you guys back to drink.

605
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,440
Let's burn our heads.

606
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Will you do it?

607
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,820
Sure.

608
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,999
So let's hurry up and finish it.

609
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,830
Let's start it.

610
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,770
Hey, watch out.

611
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,409
We finally arrived home.

612
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,910
Is this really our home?

613
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,420
Well, come on.

614
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,689
I have a headache.

615
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,930
It's about to start. Japanese
(alcohol) is attacking me.

616
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Guys, hurry up.

617
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,870
Japanese (alcohol) is attacking us.

618
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,380
Thailand lost.

619
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
I need to pee.

620
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,790
I'm going to pee first.

621
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,859
Just go to the bathroom if you need to pee.

622
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,360
It's no surprise, when you drink so much.

623
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,530
I need to pee.

624
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:09,570
I'm going to pee first.

625
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,329
Okay.

626
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,970
This way!

627
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,630
Ton.

628
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,830
Right there.

629
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,130
Ton. Are you crazy?

630
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,940
I want to take a warm shower in that room.

631
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,170
Let me take a shower first.

632
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,530
Just go.

633
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,370
There is one more bathroom left.

634
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,676
Does anyone want to take a shower first?

635
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,779
P...

636
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
You take a shower first.

637
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,200
I will edit the video to show my fans.

638
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,330
I want to upload it today.

639
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,369
Okay. I'll call you after I take a shower.

640
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,000
Stop it.

641
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,590
Just let Pan take a shower first.

642
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,740
I want to edit videos.

643
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,320
Plai, why are you so diligent at this time?

644
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,300
Are you still going to edit
videos when you're this drunk?

645
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,960
Will you finish it tonight?

646
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
What the hell are you complaining about?

647
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,200
You guys have to sleep outside tonight.

648
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,290
I will edit the video.

649
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,710
Annoying.

650
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,160
Where have they all gone?

651
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,390
PJ!

652
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,900
Let me go into the room and get something.

653
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,160
Come in.

654
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,540
I didn't lock the door.

655
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Okay.

656
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,490
Uh, P.

657
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,420
Is your sauna still usable?

658
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,850
I would like to try going in.

659
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,940
I've only been there once.

660
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,440
I'll check it another day.

661
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Great.

662
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,830
I'll ask Pan to go in there with me.

663
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,910
I'll post an IG story
to show off to my fans

664
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,690
that your house is really nice.

665
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,120
It also has a sauna.

666
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,110
Have you and Pan been
close for a long time?

667
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,890
I think...

668
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,420
About half a year.

669
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,070
You don't know about it yet.

670
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Come here.

671
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,840
Let me tell you something.

672
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,720
Pan doesn't like people who cling to him.

673
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,920
He is a person who gets annoyed easily.

674
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,840
I guess he never told you.

675
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,930
He wouldn't say it.

676
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,360
He was worried that others
would be disappointed.

677
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,850
I'm warning you with good intentions.

678
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,050
Don't cling to him too much.

679
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,850
In the future, he might
get so annoyed with you

680
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,470
that he might jump up and bite your ear.

681
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,130
Pan is as fierce as a dog?

682
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Yes.

683
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,300
And he is a Pomeranian.

684
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,420
He barked, barked, barked.

685
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
It's really scary.

686
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
I'll go now.

687
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,300
I warned you.

688
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,080
But Pan didn't seem annoyed with me.

689
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,240
Pomeranians are really scary.

690
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,470
PJ.

691
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,720
What's wrong with you?

692
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:52,840
You look stressed.

693
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Ton.

694
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,570
Pomeranians are really scary.

695
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Pomeranians?

696
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,760
You drink a lot.

697
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,860
Or did you take something weird?

698
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,120
I'll tell you something.

699
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,949
Pomeranians tend to bite dicks.

700
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,280
Hey!

701
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,650
Gosh. Ton.

702
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Pan.

703
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,890
I finished taking a shower.

704
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
Plai has fallen asleep.

705
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,150
Huh?

706
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,610
Didn't he say he was going to
edit a video to show his fans?

707
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
He's drunk, right?

708
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Yeah.

709
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,490
He hasn't been drinking much lately.

710
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,630
He became a more lightweight.

711
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
What about you?

712
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,580
Are you okay?

713
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,790
I'm a little drunk.

714
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,950
But I'm still okay.

715
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,510
I'll probably feel better
after taking a shower.

716
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,670
Just go shower.

717
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,960
I will continue working.

718
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,830
Okay.

719
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,140
What did Cher comment on?

720
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,330
I don't get it.

721
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,620
Huh? He walked past me.

722
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,720
I just filled up the water.

723
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Do you want it?

724
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,740
I know you must be thirsty.

725
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,840
Would you like some water?

726
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,960
Hey, do you want some water?

727
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,850
In case you're thirsty.

728
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,050
What am I talking about?

729
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,760
I dream of you again.

730
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,030
What did you dream about before?

731
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I can't tell you.

732
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,030
I miss you.

733
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,950
Me too.

734
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,790
Don't go.

735
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,020
Can you stay with me for a while?

736
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,210
Move over a bit.

737
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,690
There is no space for me.

738
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,910
I'm cold even with a blanket.

739
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,040
How have you endured this?

740
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,390
I can endure it.

741
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,340
Who would let you sleep
next to someone else?

742
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Pardon?

743
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,070
Hugging each other makes me feel warm.

744
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,400
It really warms up after hugging you.

745
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,040
It must be because I miss you so much

746
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
that I had a good dream.

747
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,039
[What is this? Pan? With whom? #PJPan]

748
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,760
[I don't want to be a shipper anymore.
[It really hurts. I quit. #PJPan]

749
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:28,920
[I'm sad. You guys have attended many events
together before. I'm done shipping. It hurts.]
