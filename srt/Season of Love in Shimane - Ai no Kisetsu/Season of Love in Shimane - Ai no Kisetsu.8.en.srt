3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,460
Won't P come out and see us off?

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,000
Umm. You're right.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,510
He walked like a model.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,350
You came last,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,530
but your outfit stole all the spotlight.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,430
Take me with you! I'm on vacation.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,780
I want to be with my boyfriend.

"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 8)

11
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,880
P.

12
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,000
P.

13
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,010
P. Wake up!

14
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
What are you doing?

15
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,710
Let's go back to sleep together.

16
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,040
I'd better look at pictures of other men.

17
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,470
Is he as handsome as me?

18
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,400
I think he is not handsome.

19
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,070
You mean...

20
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,990
he is not handsome or me?

21
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,870
It's you.

22
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,780
You're so mean.

23
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,460
Stop looking at it.

24
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,250
No way.

25
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,640
I like it.

26
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm here.

27
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,290
How could you say you like another man in front of me?

28
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,440
Put your phone down.

29
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,770
Come here.

30
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,760
You've been banned from using your phone.

31
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,900
How is it?

32
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,590
Can I like this guy?

33
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,490
Yeah.

34
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,790
I'm okay if it's him.

35
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,900
Give me back my phone.

36
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,110
No.

37
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,270
Give it back!

38
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,100
No.

39
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,640
Answer me honestly.

40
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Am I handsome when I sleep?

41
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,150
No.

42
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,380
It's more funny.

43
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,820
Who sleeps with their eyes half open like that?

44
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,210
But I don't snore like you, do I?

45
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,430
If you don't hear my snoring,

46
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,190
you'll be lonely.

47
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,390
Yeah.

48
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,980
I must be really lonely.

49
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,180
Let's continue sleeping.

50
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm so tired.

51
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,880
P.

52
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,180
P. Wake up.

53
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm hungry.

54
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,330
It's almost noon now.

55
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,140
I haven't had breakfast yet.

56
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,400
Because someone refuses to wake up.

57
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,090
And this is the face of that cruel person.

58
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,170
What are you saying?

59
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,460
Who is the cruel person?

60
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
You.

61
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,520
Look.

62
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,350
It's not true.

63
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,420
What do you mean it's not true?

64
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,450
Say it to the camera.

65
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,810
I will keep it as evidence.

66
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,000
Say it.

67
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,720
Here.

68
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,370
I won't say it.

69
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,170
I'm starving.

70
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,420
He wouldn't wake up.

71
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,600
Right?

72
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,490
I gave you all the pleasure last night.

73
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,420
I'm not a cruel person at all.

74
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,970
They are not the same.

75
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,500
Last night was just last night. Right?

76
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,040
They are not related.

77
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,040
Let's go.

78
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,420
Let's take a shower. I'm hungry.

79
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,080
Talk to me sweetly.

80
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,420
Come shower with me~

81
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
It's too light.

82
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,440
More, please.

83
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,150
Honey.

84
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,140
Your baby needs a bath.

85
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,250
That's it.

86
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Let's take a shower.

87
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,520
Didn't you say you were hungry?

88
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,690
Why are your hands being so naughty?

89
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,120
Just...

90
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm craving you too.

91
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,850
You're always buttering me up.

92
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,230
You cum already.

93
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,710
Go wait outside.

94
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,930
Let me take a shower first.

95
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh?

96
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,990
Where did you go?

97
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,670
I brought the food for you.

98
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,910
Here.

99
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,980
Drink this to ease your hunger.

100
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
Thank you.

101
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,160
When did you order it? Why did you come back so early?

102
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,180
When you act cute with me in bed.

103
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,410
Really?

104
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,050
Drink this coffee first.

105
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,520
Let's get dressed after this.

106
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,240
Oh, P.

107
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,650
Do you think this hotel is good?

108
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,080
So good.

109
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,470
I was very surprised when I came here.

110
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,450
Look. How many hotels in Bangkok have pool villas like this?

111
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,500
Just...

112
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
Normal things.

113
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,150
Who am I? Hmm?

114
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,660
An artist.

115
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,070
I have privileges.

116
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,160
Alright. Mr. Artist.

117
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,620
Let me put on some lipstick first.

118
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,000
How do I look?

119
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,130
Is this color pretty?

120
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,180
You are pretty with every color.

121
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,800
You're sweet-talking again.

122
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,510
Where are we going today?

123
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,550
I think we should go get something to eat.

124
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,380
And we will travel after that.

125
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,470
What should we eat?

126
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,770
Umm...

127
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,180
Papaya salad?

128
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,980
I know you like it.

129
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,150
Nah.

130
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,040
I just ate it yesterday.

131
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
You might get bored of it.

132
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,620
A la carte.

133
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,190
Crispy pork with basil, topped with a crispy fried egg.

134
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,460
Topped with fish sauce and chili.

135
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,640
Wow, it's delicious.

136
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,270
Nah.

137
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,180
It's noon. It's hot now.

138
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,800
Let's go to an air-conditioned restaurant.

139
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,580
Okay?

140
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,180
Do you want to eat Korean food?

141
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,490
Jajangmyeon, Bibimbap.

142
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,210
You will definitely like it.

143
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,950
Sounds good.

144
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,850
But I miss sashimi.

145
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,230
I want to eat fresh sashimi like in Japan again.

146
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,440
Take me to a Japanese restaurant.

147
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,750
Please~

148
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,900
If you want to eat Japanese food,

149
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,480
let's go to the Japanese market at Thonglor 13.

150
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,120
They say it has premium fresh ingredients imported from Japan.

151
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,400
Let's go there together.

152
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,400
Really?

153
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,560
Please take me with you.

154
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,510
Take me with you.

155
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,130
Please. Please. Please.

156
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,310
Yup!

157
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,210
But let's get dressed first.

158
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,360
That's enough.

159
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,760
I have to get dressed.

160
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,830
Let me go get dressed first.

161
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,790
Okay.

162
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,810
Go!

163
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,260
Let's EAT OUT later.

164
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,430
What eat out do you mean?

165
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,140
Food...

166
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
Didn't you have enough last night?

167
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,190
Let's stop here. I'm going to get dressed.

168
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Yup.

169
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
I'll be right back.

170
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,470
He is my personal driver.

171
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,140
He was imported from Japan.

172
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,300
And he came to Thailand especially for this.

173
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,150
But he flies back to Japan tomorrow morning.

174
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,530
What are you doing?

175
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,830
Let's go inside.

176
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,910
I'm shooting content with my driver.

177
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,960
Besides being a driver, I'm also

178
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,910
his husband.

179
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,860
What else?

180
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,250
Your everything.

181
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,870
What else would you like me to be?

182
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,740
I'll be whatever you need tonight.

183
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,150
You said it.

184
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,300
Let's go.

185
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,030
Hey. What is this?

186
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,790
Miso soup.

187
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,880
The one we ate in Japan.

188
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,240
Oh.

189
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,120
There are so many interesting things for sale here.

190
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,700
Yeah.

191
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,930
- They have so many sweets.
- Is this sweets?

192
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,050
Yes.

193
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,110
This is mochi.

194
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,540
That looks so tasty, and it's melon flavored too.

195
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,180
Hey. What is this?

196
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,440
Is this tea?

197
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,350
Yes, it's hojicha.

198
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,810
And it's organic.

199
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,070
Please make it for me later.

200
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,180
Yup.

201
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,710
We are now at Thonglor Nihon Ichiba.

202
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,660
Let's see what they're selling here.

203
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,450
Yep.

204
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,900
Hey, P!

205
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,910
Do they sell steak too?

206
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,070
Yes, this is Wagyu sirloin.

207
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,430
Right? Here.

208
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,660
Wow, this looks so good. Look at this!

209
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,950
Here?

210
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,600
Did you see it?

211
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,890
Here's what they're selling: maguro, otoro and akami.

212
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,730
- And what's on the right...
- Hey!

213
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,160
Is this uni?

214
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm sure a lot of you love this. It's uni, or sea urchin roe.

215
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,970
Hello. Welcome.

216
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,680
This is a crab, right?

218
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,740
Yes, this is a crab.

219
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,220
Taraba crab imported from Hokkaido.

220
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,040
This is a Taraba crab.

221
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,240
It's so big.

222
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,860
Yes.

223
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,920
We will show you how to catch the biggest Taraba crab.

224
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,450
This one weighs 3 kg.

225
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,650
Look.

226
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,080
- Be careful.
- It's so heavy.

227
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,280
So heavy.

228
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,690
Can you lift it?

229
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,410
It's very big.

230
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,150
We will try it today.

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,030
Its pattern is very beautiful.

232
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,680
It's huge, as big as my hand.

233
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,920
Wow.

234
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,830
We're going to...

235
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,190
Taste it?

236
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,730
Yes.

237
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,170
We're going to eat fresh oysters at Thonglor Nihon Ichiba.

238
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,630
Does it look delicious?

239
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,390
It's so fresh!

240
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,390
So fresh!

241
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,550
The texture is so bouncy.

242
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,040
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

243
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
- Don't blink.
- 1...

244
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,650
2, 3.

245
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,290
How is it?

246
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,970
How is it? Melts in your mouth?

247
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,770
- It's so creamy.
- Yes.

248
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm happy to hear that.

249
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,530
We're starving.

250
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,970
Let's find some food.

251
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,120
Let's go.

252
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
Wanna sit here?

253
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,510
Hello.

254
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,590
Hello. Hello.

255
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,070
- Can I sit here?
- Yes.

256
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,970
Thank you.

257
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,730
Alright.

258
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,100
Let me set up the camera first.

259
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,810
Okay.

260
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,820
What would you like to eat today?

261
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,080
I think sushi.

262
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,950
I would recommend the premium set.

263
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,370
It's the best value price.

264
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,020
Hey. Look!

265
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,900
This set is a sashimi set.

266
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,460
Wow, this set is so big.

267
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,570
Look.

268
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,810
This set, right?

269
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,330
Yes.

270
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,300
Hey. I'd like to order one set of this.

271
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,270
Yeah.

272
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,200
And... this one?

273
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,920
Uh, they recommend the premium sushi set just now.

274
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,430
It also has uni in the set.

275
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,140
It also has sea urchin roe.

276
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,350
I ordered another set.

277
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,430
This set is very big.

278
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,580
They can't see it. Bring it closer.

279
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,170
Does it look tasty?

280
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,540
Here. How's it look?

281
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,010
One set, please.

282
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,010
Would you like to order anything else?

283
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,760
Previous dish.

284
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,340
Oysters.

285
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,800
Is there a hidden meaning?

286
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,870
I won't tell you.

287
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,230
Is this dish good?

288
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,230
Here.

289
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,890
Guys, look.

290
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,750
The oysters we are about to order.

291
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,880
This set.

292
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,430
Okay. I'll order it.

293
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,970
Excuse me. This set, please.

294
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Would you like to order anything else?

295
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,120
Oh!

296
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,260
The previous crab.

297
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,350
The crab we were holding just now.

298
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,280
Can I order it?

299
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,560
Sure.

300
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,410
Daddy's got you.

301
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,370
Really?

302
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,970
Yeah.

303
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,590
This one, right?

304
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,540
Excuse me, I'd like to add the crab too.

305
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,810
Guys.

306
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,480
Someone's being a sugar daddy.

307
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,080
Look.

308
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,440
From the Taraba crab set.

309
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,700
It's so big!

310
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,400
My mouth's watering already.

311
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,030
I think we should be enough for now.

312
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,770
Right?

313
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,680
Is the camera okay?

314
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,320
Uh.

315
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,350
Where would you like to go today?

316
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,930
Let's go together after we finish eating.

317
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,610
Umm. Okay.

318
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,680
I would like to take you to see the beautiful view
of the Chao Phraya River.

319
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,430
And... do you want to dress up in Thai costumes?

320
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,110
Like a tourist.

321
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,730
After that, let's go for a walk and buy something delicious to eat.

322
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,490
Uh! And...

323
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,800
I want to take you to the temple.

324
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,700
Let's stop by the temple before you go.

325
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,530
Great.

326
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,520
I would like to go there too.

327
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,290
I haven't been to the temple for a long time.

328
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,150
There are only shrines in Japan.

329
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,720
You're right.

330
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,930
Let's go to the temple then.

331
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,300
And then let's take a tuk-tuk around Bangkok.

332
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,410
Okay?

333
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,750
Wouldn't it be a problem if we went to a crowded place?

334
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,940
What else do you want us to be?

335
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,680
Huh?

336
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,430
Please be serious, Pan.

337
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,460
That's okay.

338
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,250
Just...

339
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,370
We are close friends.

340
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,960
Is that right?

341
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,910
Are you sulking at me?

342
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,240
Huh?

343
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,440
You still haven't stopped sulking me?

344
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,670
Do you want me to feed you?

345
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:37,970
Come on.

346
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,660
Here.

347
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,200
Here. Yum!

348
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,440
Eat this.

349
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,350
Okay?

350
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,170
Just eat it.

351
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,640
You really won't eat it?

352
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,260
What's wrong with you?

353
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,350
You don't eat what I feed you.

354
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,060
Someone was looking at us earlier.

355
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,270
It's not true.

356
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,190
You're just sulking at me.

357
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,370
I'm not sulking at you.

358
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm just worried.

359
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,360
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

360
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,720
I also care about your feelings.

361
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,620
I don't want you to worry about having me as your boyfriend.

362
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,920
I don't want you to overthink.

363
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,750
I want you to be happy.

364
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,160
When we are together.

365
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,500
Even though I'm suffering, I still want to be with you.

366
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,160
Don't say that.

367
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,910
That's what I thought.

368
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,460
I wanna hug you.

369
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,360
For now, I will be satisfied with this.

370
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,340
Don't worry too much.

371
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,670
Fans will soon realize who they should ship PJ with,

372
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,740
and it's not me.

373
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah.

374
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,990
Wanna eat this?

375
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,150
I'll feed you.

376
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,520
I want that bite you just gave me.

377
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,670
It was delicious

378
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,540
and so fresh.

379
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,350
Isn't the fish already fresh?

380
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,040
I want you to feed me.

381
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,990
Can you?

382
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:09,950
Great.

383
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,500
Open wide~

384
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,520
This piece is really fresh.

385
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,600
Really?

386
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,480
Yes.

387
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,180
Give it a try.

388
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,360
So? Is it fresher than the others?

389
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,080
The fish is tasty,

390
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,810
but it's tastier when it comes from you.

391
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,980
You're quite the sweet talker.

392
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,280
If you like it, I'll feed you until the plate's empty.

393
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,350
You mean fish?

394
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,770
Everything else is good.

395
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,770
I want the clams first.

396
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,750
You should eat some.

397
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,000
Feed yourself.

398
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,890
Feed myself?

399
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
Feed me too.

400
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,160
I wish I had someone to feed me too.

401
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,310
Which one?

402
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,500
Your call.

403
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,230
Every piece would taste good if you're the one feeding me.

404
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,510
This one.

405
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,670
Wow!

406
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,660
Is it delicious?

407
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,110
So fresh.

408
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,070
I'd like to eat this piece.

409
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,640
Okay.

410
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,210
Your crab is served.

411
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,590
Wow!

412
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,680
The waiter is so handsome.

413
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,720
It's just a normal thing.

414
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
This restaurant hires staff based on their appearance.

415
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,370
What's this dish called?

416
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,510
TanLamBak crab. (difficult to eat)

417
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,450
Hey! I mean Taraba crab.

418
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,060
- TanLamBak crab.
- Difficult to eat.

419
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,130
It looks really difficult, doesn't it?

420
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,540
- Yes.
- It's difficult to eat.

421
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,030
But...

422
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,440
Are you two an imaginary couple?

423
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,800
I saw you shoulder-hugging just now.

424
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,320
Uh...

425
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,430
Yes.

426
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,570
Great.

427
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,500
Have you been dating for a long time?

428
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,280
Just...

429
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,430
- For a while.
- For a while.

430
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,950
Great.

431
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,860
This is the correct way to crack a crab.

432
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,610
Crack a crab like this, and feed it to each other.

433
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,410
Wow.

434
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,720
And you can eat it right away.

435
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,080
Like this.

436
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,920
You're not just a pro,

437
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,620
you're a sneaky pro!

438
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,400
Oh, sorry.

439
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,540
I just realized.

440
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,000
It's bad. It's a customer's dish.

441
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,090
But... you already ate it.

442
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,080
I forgot to ask you!

443
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,310
Have you done it yet?

444
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,300
Uh... last night.

445
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Oh! Not that!

446
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,060
I mean...

447
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
- Last night.
- Just now.

448
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,000
Just now.

449
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
No, I'm asking if you guys hooked up yet.

450
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,820
Awkward.

451
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,000
- Look.
- Now...

452
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,340
We have already ordered this dish.

453
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,570
Hey, switch to the front camera first.

454
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,160
TanLamBak crab. (difficult to eat)

455
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,200
- Hey!
- Hey!

456
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,160
Taraba crab.

457
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,820
Hey!

458
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,750
It's correct!

459
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,620
It's correct.

460
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,660
It looks super yummy!

461
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,880
It's so big! Look.

462
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,800
How big is it?

463
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,120
Compare it to my face.

464
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,730
How is it?

465
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,970
Amazing.

466
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,260
Shall we dig in?

467
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,000
It smells amazing.

468
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,870
Let's dig it.

469
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,850
I'm starving.

470
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,030
I love this joke.

471
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,390
TanLamBak crab.

472
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,780
They believe those who eat crab claws are blessed with luck.

473
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,350
Where did you hear it?

474
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,560
Just now.

475
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,990
He already ate it.

476
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,720
Eat this.

477
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,910
Can I pick it up with my hands?

478
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,780
Sure.

479
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,110
Or you can use chopsticks.

480
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,630
Come on.

481
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,200
It's easier to use my hands.

482
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,050
Your hands.

483
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,400
It's really difficult to eat.

484
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,800
Wipe my mouth for me.

485
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,960
Hey.

486
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,550
Umm.

487
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,550
Don't let anyone else wipe your mouth while I'm not around.

488
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,390
Keep it neat while you eat.

489
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,320
Whatever.

490
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,570
Just be my shadow then.

491
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,300
I can't force anyone.

492
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,270
One more thing.

493
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,120
My charm is overloaded.

494
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,880
If I didn't have to go back, I'd guard you 24/7.

495
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,720
Look after yourself while I'm not around.

496
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,490
Hey.

497
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,790
Are you jealous?

498
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,540
Huh?

499
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm more worried about you.

500
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,760
I trust you.

501
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:01,300
Does that mean anyone can approach me?

502
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,110
Huh?

503
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,770
So you're just trying to tick me off.

504
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,280
I trust you.

505
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,880
But I don't trust other people.

506
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,880
I'd totally fly over to keep an eye on you if I had the time.

507
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,810
Okay?

508
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,080
But now, you have to stop making me jealous first.

509
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
I'd rather eat this.

510
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,910
Can you wipe it for me?

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,520
Right here.

512
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,740
You keep acting childish.

513
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,500
Here too.

514
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,760
Please wipe it off all over my body.

515
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,120
Yeah.

516
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,680
Clean me up as much as you can now,
for the times you won't be here.

517
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,400
Keep staring like that. Be careful, I might kiss you.

518
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,290
Soy sauce is salty.

519
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,990
Why do you want to kiss me?

520
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,640
Huh?

521
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,560
Is it okay now?

522
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,270
Is it okay?

523
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,910
Yeah.

524
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,520
Your eyes are kinda dangerously charming.

525
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,810
I guess I'll have to fly over and claim my spot next to you.

526
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,160
I only look at you.

527
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,880
You can trust me.

528
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,430
I trust you.

529
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,180
But I don't trust other people.

530
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,430
Anyone who makes a move on you, they're in trouble with me.

531
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,340
Why?

532
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,250
What are you going to do to them?

533
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,180
Whatever!

534
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,430
I still can't figure it out.

535
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,170
I'm just pre-jealous.

536
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,280
You're being so frecking kissable right now.

537
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,790
My mouth is sweet now.

538
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,600
You can kiss me.

539
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,340
Then... Let's get the check.

540
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,340
Let's go to the restroom.

541
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,390
Let's go.

542
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,170
Did you see that?

543
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,960
You have to write your prayer on a Bodhi leaf and tie it here.

544
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,310
It's just like when I was in Japan.

545
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,290
When I told you to write your prayers and hang them up.

546
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,910
Yes, it's similar.

547
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,800
In Thailand, there is also a belief about
writing prayers and tying them.

548
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,310
And we have to donate there.

549
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,310
Write a prayer and tie it.

550
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:52,900
Let's go.

551
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,550
Tha Maharaj.

552
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,660
I want to take a selfie.

553
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,600
Wanna take one then?

554
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,350
Come on.

555
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,240
I should show this.

556
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,350
Hey, it looks so tasty.

557
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,510
This one.

558
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,800
Wow.

559
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,860
Peace!

560
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,720
Did it come out good?

561
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,870
Yes.

562
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,210
Pan!

563
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,360
Aren't you wearing a mask?

564
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,920
No.

565
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,320
I'm dressed this sharp. Why would I cover my face?

566
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,710
There are only tourists around here.

567
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,480
That's okay.

568
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,170
Also, I told Ton that I would take you on a trip.

569
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,180
Okay.

570
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
I'll be relieved if you've already told Ton.

571
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,800
Would you like some water?

572
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,920
It's so refreshing. Would you like to try it?

573
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,960
Here.

574
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
How is it?

575
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,460
Nothing beats a refreshing drink in Thailand's weather.

576
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,560
It's so refreshing.

577
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,740
Let me try it.

578
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,000
You're so stingy.

579
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,480
It's not too tight. I think it's okay.

580
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,850
And it's cute too.

581
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,330
Other people are looking at us.

582
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,800
- No one is looking at us.
- Is it tasty?

583
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,310
- It's good, but I like the other one.
- It's not unusual for people to stare at celebrities.

584
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,830
- I prefer that one too.
- Really?

585
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,570
Try it.

586
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,310
You're always tossing compliments like it's nothing.

587
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,570
I'm telling the truth.

588
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,470
- Hey!
- Hey!

589
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,020
Huh?

590
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,350
PJ Plai.

591
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,230
Why are you guys here?

592
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,640
Hello.

593
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,310
We unexpectedly met.

594
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,420
Yeah.

595
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,400
I'm just here to visit the temple.

596
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,090
I'm going back to Japan tomorrow.

597
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,080
What about you guys? Are you here for a trip too?

598
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,780
We're just here to shoot some content.

599
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,570
Why is Plai wearing a woman traditional top?

600
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,600
But it's beautiful.

601
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,800
It's like you guys just put on Thai costumes
for a morning wedding ceremony.

602
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,160
I lost the vote on IG.

603
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,940
I asked my fans on Instagram

604
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,320
who they'd love to see casually walking around in a traditional top.

605
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,890
And I will shoot a vlog.

606
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,540
Look.

607
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,560
I hit the jackpot.

608
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,910
But I think it suits you.

609
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,190
See?

610
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,440
I told you, you look cute in that outfit.

611
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,530
Stop buttering me up.

612
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,290
I'm getting all awkward now.

613
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,610
We should go now.

614
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,080
Let them enjoy their date.

615
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,560
Hey.

616
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,590
Wanna take a group selfie?

617
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,770
Before we go our separate ways.

618
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,580
Okay?

619
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:08,800
Okay.

620
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
P. Do you want to hold the camera?

621
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,100
Hold it.

622
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,770
Hold it for me.

623
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,450
This one too.

624
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,790
I'll use this phone first.

625
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,070
I have to carry myself like a traditional Thai lady.

626
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,750
1... 2...

627
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,370
Nice.

628
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,030
3.

629
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,950
One more shot.

630
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,120
1, 2, 3.

631
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,590
Another one.

632
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,640
That's enough.

633
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,410
- One more pic.
- One more pic.

634
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,350
1, 2, 3.

635
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,480
Let me see.

636
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,790
But I like your outfit.

637
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,770
Did you even ask me if I liked it?

638
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,490
This outfit makes me stand out among the four of us.

639
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,720
Of course, it has to be outstanding.

640
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,750
Our outfits are all manly.

641
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,670
You're the only one looking pretty.

642
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,670
So pretty.

643
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,530
Absolutely stunning.

644
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,440
Have a safe trip.

645
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,200
Let's meet up next time you're back in Thailand.

646
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,400
Okay.

647
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,570
I'll let you know after I get back here.

648
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,650
Watch over him for me while I'm not here.

649
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,160
Just in case someone around here is stubborn.

650
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,830
Don't worry.

651
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,540
We'll go now.

652
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,260
Have a nice date.

653
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,190
Yeah.

654
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,870
Take lots of content for me.

655
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,990
That outfit is serving.

656
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,300
Our outfits are also extraordinary.

657
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,860
We can't beat you.

658
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,690
Really?

659
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,030
I'm defeated.

660
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,340
Only me.

661
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,570
Costumes for a morning wedding ceremony.

662
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,110
I will change into my evening wedding costume.

663
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,150
And after party.

664
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,240
- Let's go.
- Shall we go?

665
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,200
You look suspicious, don't you?

666
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,800
I'll snap a pic for you.

667
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,700
Why are you blushing?

668
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,480
I'm just shy.

669
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,480
My outfit is tight.

670
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,800
Why does this outfit have so many accessories?

671
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,530
See?

672
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,950
Do you get it now when I said you didn't need to worry?

673
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,050
They stick together like glue.

674
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,600
Fans are all about #PJPlai now.

675
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,200
What about me?

676
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,410
So, can I be glued to you now?

677
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,360
When will your glue finally stick to me?

678
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,900
Huh?

679
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,340
Is it close yet?

680
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,050
Here.

681
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,270
Is it close yet?

682
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,000
That's enough.

683
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,680
Let's go.

684
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,490
Let's snap a pic!

685
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,390
- Okay?
- Okay.

686
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,430
Look at the temple.

687
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

688
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:00,720
Yeah.

689
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,650
I can't believe I'm standing here in Thailand
enjoying the view with you.

690
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,480
We spent time together and went to many places together.

691
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,860
Yeah.

692
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,420
I also don't think my wish will come true.

693
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,260
Where do you pray?

694
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,160
At that shrine?

695
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,200
Actually, I had prayed before that time.

696
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,210
At the beach near my house.

697
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,780
Just...

698
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,140
I missed you so much that day.

699
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,360
Maybe because the weather is cold and...

700
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,680
Probably because it's getting close to my birthday month.

701
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,280
Is that true?

702
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,920
Yeah.

703
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,240
I was angry that I made such a ridiculous wish at that time.

704
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,220
But when I got home, Plai video called me
to tell me that he was coming to Japan.

705
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,540
But you weren't with him that day.

706
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,070
Your prayer really worked.

707
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,690
I had a meeting with a company
about a fan meeting in Japan at that time.

708
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,310
So I asked Plai to call and ask the city where you live.

709
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,820
Why don't you ask me yourself?

710
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,200
Nah.

711
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,230
That's all in the past now.

712
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,880
One more thing...

713
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,910
I don't know how you feel about me.

714
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,890
When Plai told me you were in Shimane,

715
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,550
I searched for it.

716
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,770
I found a picture of a beach with a small shrine on the hill.

717
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,550
So I secretly prayed that

718
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,300
if we ever meet again,

719
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,520
please let me know

720
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,180
how you feel about me.

721
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,250
And you confessed your love to me there.

722
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,870
Me? I don't remember it at all.

723
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,420
Or is it someone else?

724
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,410
Who else confessed to you? I will smack his mouth.

725
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,920
Just smack your own mouth first.

726
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,500
Uh!

727
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,820
I reserved a table at a Thai restaurant.

728
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,400
Yeah.

729
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,810
It's a chef's table.

730
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,480
This restaurant has a great vibe.

731
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,020
I wanna eat with you.

732
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,830
Then... We can go back to the hotel to 'eat'.

733
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,480
Can I taste it?

734
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,590
You're talking about a different 'eat' from mine.

735
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,390
I can't let my guard down around you for a second.

736
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,340
You're just always looking for a chance to eat me.

737
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,960
Huh?

738
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,530
Let's go.

739
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,170
Let's eat.

740
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,280
What 'eat' do you mean?

741
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,170
Food.

742
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,180
Don't lie to me.

743
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,590
Let's go.

744
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,610
Quick!

745
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,830
How was it?

746
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,270
Wonderful.

747
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,750
Take a seat.

748
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,400
I'll set up the camera.

749
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,640
So that I can record good memories with you.

750
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,350
Do you think this restaurant is nice?

751
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,960
It's really nice.

752
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,440
It's better than I imagined.

753
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,340
Uh!

754
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,480
Did you know?

755
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,730
This isn't just a regular room.

756
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,620
This is a VVIP zone

757
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,090
where only a few people can enter here.

758
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,320
Really?

759
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,160
Yeah.

760
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,080
So I reserved it for you.

761
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,680
Thank you.

762
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,720
And...

763
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,600
The teamLab here takes from Tokyo.

764
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,610
Is this teamLab from Tokyo?

765
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,130
Yeah.

766
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,960
It's more beautiful than Tokyo.

767
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,020
Really?

768
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:09,820
Yeah.

769
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:19,450
I just found out that Bangkok has such a great vibe restaurant.

770
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,120
This is one of the top 25 restaurants in Bangkok.

771
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,580
Have you been here before?

772
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:29,720
No.

773
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,370
I checked the reviews.

774
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:39,090
I'd like to bring you here when you come back to Thailand.

775
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:46,160
But there are many places I want to go and eat with you.

776
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,580
Actually, we have time to travel together for the rest of our lives.

777
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,450
Just make a list of the places you want to go.

778
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,680
I'll take you there.

779
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,300
Yeah.

780
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,520
Give me your hand.

781
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,640
He's coming.

782
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,320
Hello, valued guests.

783
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

784
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,760
Welcome to Wang Hinghoi Restaurant.

785
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,380
Yeah.

786
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:29,100
Wang Hinghoi's theme today is sunset.

787
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:35,360
Therefore, today's food is food
that I created from local sources.

788
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,090
It is a food that is brought from all over Thailand.

789
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,380
Yeah.

790
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,050
We've turned traditional local dishes
into a modern Thai style.

791
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,600
Of course, I want you all to enjoy
and be in a romantic mood in this room.

792
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,540
Because this room is the most romantic room in our restaurant.

793
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,170
And it's really special.

794
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,970
Many people have come into this room and left with happiness.

795
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:56,330
Yeah.

796
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,720
I'll be serving three dishes today.

797
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,610
The first dish is Thai Savory Tartlets with Nam Prik Ong.

798
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,660
The second dish was Tom Yum Goong.

799
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,060
The third dish is Red Curry with Duck Confit.

800
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:14,510
These three dishes are modern Thai dishes that we have created for
the new generation to enjoy traditional Thai food.

801
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,710
Thank you.

802
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,140
If you're ready, I'm going back to the kitchen now.

803
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,140
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

804
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,970
Looks so tasty!

805
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:25,440
I've heard the menu name, but I'm not familiar with it.

806
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,960
Are you excited?

807
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,980
So much.

808
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,370
I'm looking forward to it.

809
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,980
It's full of fireflies.

810
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,080
Do you like it?

811
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,940
Yes.

812
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,900
It's rare to see fireflies these days.

813
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,100
In Bangkok, this is the one and only spot.

814
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,190
P.

815
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,330
Huh?

816
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,660
Why?

817
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,660
Love you.

818
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,760
Love you so~much.

819
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,930
I miss you even while you're standing right here.

820
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,270
I don't want you to go back.

821
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:05,880
Same as me.

822
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,440
I will call you every day when I arrive in Japan.

823
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,640
Yeah.

824
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,720
Don't forget it.

825
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,580
Don't you dare forget.

826
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,330
Yeah.

827
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,140
I definitely won't forget it.

828
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,820
No matter what happens in the future,

829
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,700
don't give up on me.

830
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:47,970
Yeah.

831
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,670
Let's get through this together.

832
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,330
I've told you before.

833
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,750
Even though I'm suffering,

834
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,010
I still want to be with you.

835
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,150
Hi.

836
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,660
You miss me again, right? That's why you opened this clip.

837
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,230
I miss you too.

838
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,520
I feel lonely even when I get out of the bathroom for a moment.

839
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,320
You must be feeling lonely too.

840
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,110
But please keep enduring.

841
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,520
I will also endure it.

842
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,000
I will go back to you in Thailand if I am free.

843
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,440
And after that, let's go on a trip together.

844
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,730
Everywhere you want to go.

845
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,000
Watch this on repeat when you miss me.

846
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,930
I'll be watching our memories over and over again too.

847
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,380
I won't be working here for long.

848
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,520
We will meet again soon.

849
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,250
Love you.

850
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,910
I saw your clip.

851
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,490
The one where you're talking while sitting down.

852
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,810
I just want to say,

853
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,030
keep working hard.

854
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,930
I wish you a safe trip wherever you go.

855
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,920
Take good care of yourself.

856
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,170
I'm waiting for your call.

857
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,470
Don't forget to call me.

858
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,280
Keep fighting.

859
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,080
It's just a short time, right?

860
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,800
We will meet again soon.

861
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,130
Next season,

862
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,040
let's keep traveling together.

863
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,920
Would you be my boyfriend?

864
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,400
Yes.
