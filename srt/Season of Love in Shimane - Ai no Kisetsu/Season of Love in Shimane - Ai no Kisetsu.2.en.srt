3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,040
It's here, right?

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,880
Your friend's house.

5
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,710
P, he is PJ.

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,080
He is a junior in the same company as me.

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,120
And he is...

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,270
P.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,560
He is my...

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,980
Homeowner.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,690
Hello.

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,950
I'm PJ.

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,430
Nice to meet you.

14
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah.

15
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,650
Please come into the house.

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,680
Let's go.

17
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,080
I didn't know before that you had friends in Japan.

18
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,160
It's not that important.

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,050
No, Pan.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,230
You should tell me everything.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,440
So that I will know if anyone asks me.

22
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,610
Is there anything else you haven't told me?

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,490
PJ.

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,090
Are you taking it too seriously?

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,060
I should be serious.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,210
I have to be the perfect partner.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,530
I have studied acting before.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,260
It's called method acting.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,330
It's a Hollywood actor's technique.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,370
I think it's a good method.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,410
I have to absorb it slowly.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,700
It's very good for us.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,470
Me... What?

34
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,750
Method acting.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,270
I'll tell you if I have time.

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,610
Forget it.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll go inside.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,700
"Season of Love in Shimane"
(Episode 2)

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,730
Wow.

40
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,570
Your house is so beautiful.

41
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,480
Are you well?

42
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,890
Yeah.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,710
Good.

44
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,720
What about you?

45
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,490
Are you tired?

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,680
Just a little bit.

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,000
But I felt better after knowing that
I was going to travel.

48
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,650
Yeah.

49
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,280
I will take you on a trip.

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,510
I told the company right away after knowing that
I had a schedule in Japan.

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,600
I plan to continue staying here
and filming content for fans.

52
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,940
This time I got sponsored with plane tickets and a van too.

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,980
At first, the company will find a sponsor for my hotel.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,510
I have to give them a review.

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,840
So I told them I had...

56
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,820
You have friends in Japan.

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,670
Yeah.

58
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,580
Hey, Pan.

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,270
Don't forget to take your medicine.

60
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,700
Why? Are you sick?

61
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,800
Why do you need to take medicine?

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,290
I'm not that sick.

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm just allergic.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,100
The flight from Thailand to Japan
must have caused my body to fluctuate.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,930
Don't worry, P.

66
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,340
I took good care of your friend last night.

67
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,880
I told him to turn on the live broadcast while
I was drying his hair and wipe his body, but he refused.

68
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,440
Otherwise, it would make the fans very happy.

69
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,820
The worries are definitely gone.

70
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,520
Why do you have to dry his hair and body just for allergies?

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,250
Not that much.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,830
I must have fallen asleep without drying my hair
because I was tired from the journey.

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm not sick that I need someone to wipe me down.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,980
What about the others?

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,440
Plai and Ton are outside.

76
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,930
They will be back soon.

77
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,330
Please take a seat.

78
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,300
You must be tired from the journey.

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
I'll get you some water.

80
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,170
Please give it to me too.

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,880
Me too.

82
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,400
Thank you.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Please take a seat.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,570
Please make yourself comfortable.

85
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,220
Why didn't you guys send me a message that you arrived?

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,610
Have you guys arrived for a long time?

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,200
Ton, hello.

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,080
Plai, hello.

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,640
Hello.

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Hang it there.

91
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,200
I just arrived.

92
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,340
I didn't know it was this close to the airport.

93
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,560
The driver told me we had arrived shortly after I got in the car.

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
You're right.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
I was so shocked yesterday.

96
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
Like, hey, I'm really here? Is it true?

97
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
It's so close.

98
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,610
What are you looking at? Sit down.

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,510
I bought some food for you.

100
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
There are many things. What did you buy?

101
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,360
These are the snacks.

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,990
This one is delicious.

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,430
This is mine.

104
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,150
- I already ate it.
- Really?

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,010
Here.

106
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,170
Thank you.

107
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,740
Oh?

108
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,240
Why did you only get water for Pan?

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,090
Pan is sick. He has to take medicine.

110
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,150
If anyone's thirsty, get it yourself. It's in the fridge.

111
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,330
Please tell me what happened at the event.

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,250
It's okay. Everything is fine.

113
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,830
Hey, Pan.

114
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,960
Is that all you told them?

115
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,340
I will tell it myself.

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,180
The staff took me to the waiting room after I arrived.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,650
The event seemed quiet at first.

118
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,200
There were very few fans
because it wasn't time to start the event yet.

119
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,090
But when the event started, suddenly many fans appeared.

120
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,450
It has fans crowding the area.

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,470
Pan was the first to sing.

122
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,280
He sings quite off-key.

123
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,960
We played a game before the event ended.

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,070
And we played the post-it game.

125
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,730
The fans were very happy at that time.

126
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
Pan and I are also happy.

127
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,050
I'm happy too.

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
You can't even speak Japanese.

129
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,920
You guys are stuck even speaking Thai.

130
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,010
Since you have so many Japanese fans.

131
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,270
It was worth my effort to train you guys.

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,800
It really made me feel delighted.

133
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,360
Hey, Ton.

134
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,840
There's no way I'm going to disappoint you.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,190
Pan.

136
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,530
Are you feeling better?

137
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,110
Would you like to stay home first?

138
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm better now.

139
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,080
I want to travel so badly.

140
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,750
We haven't traveled together for a long time.

141
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,690
I wonder where we are going to visit.

142
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,220
Well.

143
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,680
Let me give you a brief description of this city.

144
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,510
In case you don't expect too much.

145
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,340
This is Shimane Prefecture.

146
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,800
It's a coastal prefecture

147
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,970
with outstanding nature and local culture.

148
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,390
It is quite quiet here, unlike in big cities.

149
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,790
Since we're all here today,

150
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,520
I'm going to take you to see Japan's cultural heritage.

151
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,180
But you have to take a boat.

152
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,140
Wow, that's interesting.

153
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,060
Shall we go now?

154
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,120
I want to show the pictures to my fans so bad.

155
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,620
But, hold on.

156
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,260
You guys can take pictures.

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,600
But don't post it in real time.

158
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,450
Get it?

159
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay?

160
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,010
Let's hurry up and eat.

161
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,040
Let's eat.

162
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,510
Let's hurry up and eat.

163
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,160
Why are you in such a hurry?

164
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,000
Wow.

165
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,290
Guys, hurry.

166
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,000
Wow.

167
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Guys, look.

168
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,950
The view is so beautiful.

169
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,370
We saw a castle, pine trees.

170
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,560
Also, there are ducks there.

171
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,740
I think there is only one disadvantage.

172
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,840
The weather is freaking cold.

173
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,800
It's true.

174
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,000
The weather is nice and the view is very beautiful.

175
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,220
But it seems colder than before, right?

176
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,680
I think, it's not just seems.

177
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
Look at those two.

178
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,020
He has a runny nose.

179
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,540
It seems like he has a stuffy nose.

180
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,270
Pan, are you okay?

181
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,650
Would you like to wear my coat?

182
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,050
Hey, it's okay. Just wear it.

183
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm okay.

184
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,150
Hold on.

185
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,140
I think I have a hot pack.

186
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,740
Thank you.

187
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,980
Thank you.

188
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,860
Let's go.

189
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,530
The duck is so cute.

190
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,190
Thank you.

191
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,430
Plai!

192
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,990
Huh?

193
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,980
Hot pack.

194
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,960
Is it mine?

195
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,450
Yeah.

196
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,090
Thank you.

197
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,730
We haven't been on a trip like this for a long time, have we?

198
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,930
Yeah.

199
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,990
I miss the weather like this.

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,800
What about me?

201
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,220
Huh?

202
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,550
Don't you miss me?

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,140
Wow. The view here is really beautiful.

204
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,960
PJ.

205
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,090
Come here.

206
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,010
Why?

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,130
Please take a picture of me and show the whole view.

208
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,120
Let's go.

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,140
Please take a picture for me.

210
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,980
Okay.

211
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,610
Please make me look taller.

212
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,150
Okay.

213
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,740
Sure. I'll take a picture of you looking like a model, okay?

214
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,860
Okay. Tall, okay?

215
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,480
Okay.

216
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,170
1, 2...

217
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Is this okay?

218
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,760
Don't shoot from a high angle.
You have to shoot from a low angle. Sit down.

219
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,380
Oh, okay.

220
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,350
Yeah, sit down.

221
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,150
Ready...

222
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,040
1, 2...

223
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,840
1...

224
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,450
2...

225
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,890
Did it come out well?

226
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,200
Let me see.

227
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,480
I think it's okay.

228
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,820
What the hell are you taking a picture of?

229
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,040
Wow.

230
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,330
My legs look really big.

231
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Forget it.

232
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,670
I won't ask you anymore.

233
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,450
Okay?

234
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,320
Okay.

235
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,670
I prepared it.

236
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,730
High angle. Zoom.

237
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,120
How are you?

238
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,330
Are you feeling better?

239
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,450
I'm feeling better now.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,220
There's something warmer than this.

241
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,720
Plai.

242
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,560
Plai.

243
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,550
D*mn Plai!

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,840
Huh? Why, Ton?

245
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,740
Where would you like to take a picture?

246
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,700
It's not.

247
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm telling you

248
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,270
I smell something fishy.

249
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,500
I don't smell anything.

250
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,900
Is it because I have a stuffy nose?

251
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,920
I didn't mean it like that.

252
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,680
I mean the fishy smell there.

253
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,090
Did you see it?

254
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
They held hands.

255
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,300
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

256
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,460
No.

257
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,380
What's wrong with you, Ton?

258
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,200
Are you going to tell me or do you want me to ask them?

259
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,520
Well.

260
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,160
It's as you think.

261
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,330
I'm not surprised.

262
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm such a genius.

263
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,510
I knew it as soon as I saw it.

264
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
There's definitely something fishy about it.

265
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,720
How deep have they gone?

266
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,800
It's not that deep.

267
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
And how deep is “not that deep”?

268
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,880
Well… deep enough.

269
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,010
So, they kind of seeing each other?

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,330
Something like that.

271
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,560
You know right?

272
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,950
Tell it to your friends and your brother.

273
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,900
Don't let it affect his work.

274
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,070
Otherwise, the boss will definitely punish you all.

275
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,460
I know.

276
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,960
I don't care about taking pictures anymore.

277
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm not in the mood anymore.

278
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,910
Hey, guys.

279
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,740
Let's go.

280
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,120
- Shall we go?
- Let's go to the castle.

281
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,750
Let's go.

282
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,080
I don't know if I continue to stay here,
my nerves will explode.

283
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,310
Hurry up.

284
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,740
Pan.

285
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,630
Let's go.

286
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,250
Okay.

287
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,200
Let me film the content first.

288
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,450
- Yeah.
- See you.

289
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,160
I will follow you later.

290
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,590
This is a map of Matsue Castle.

291
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,780
This map is next to the stream.

292
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,030
So beautiful.

293
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,870
D*mn!

294
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,980
I was shocked.

295
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,030
What's wrong with you guys?

296
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,170
You keep interrupting my work.

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,560
P.

298
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,740
What?

299
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,760
Before, you just acted cool.

300
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,680
Look at you now.

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,090
I saw you holding his hand.

302
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,260
It's too sweet.

303
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,150
I just warmed up his hands.

304
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,350
I have no problem.

305
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,900
But my manager can smell your love.

306
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,530
What's next?

307
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,480
He has no problem with it.

308
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,550
He just told you to be careful.

309
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,870
He was worried that it would affect Pan work.

310
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,680
Yeah.

311
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,400
I understand.

312
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,880
I'm serious with him.

313
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,280
I will never make him sad.

314
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,700
Do you understand what I am saying?

315
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,240
I mean, please be careful about
flirting with him in front of Ton.

316
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,230
Well.

317
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,040
Okay?

318
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,390
Do you really understand?

319
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,480
Yes, I know.

320
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,190
Don't let him see it again.

321
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,400
Go. I will continue working.

322
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,300
Back off. You're blocking my way.

323
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,840
Let me work with you.

324
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,390
Get out.

325
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:15,360
This is the shrine at the entrance to Matsue Castle.

326
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,680
Before praying, we will...

327
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,880
Wash our hands here before praying.

328
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,940
It's not very sunny today.

329
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,080
The weather is quite okay.

330
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Above.

331
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,460
Plai.

332
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,440
Huh?

333
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,080
Why?

334
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,560
Pan and PJ are that close?

335
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,140
They are close.

336
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,660
PJ is a junior artist in our company.

337
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,580
I am his senior, so I became his advisor.

338
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,310
Teach him everything I can teach him.

339
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,810
But PJ has many outstanding points.

340
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,010
He is handsome, charming

341
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
and dedicated to his work.

342
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,680
We gradually became closer to him
after attending events with him.

343
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,660
They have been working together lately,
so it's like you can see.

344
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,100
Huh?

345
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,670
What about you?

346
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,370
So you're not dedicated to your work?

347
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,640
So you can't work together like them.

348
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,060
P.

349
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,850
What?

350
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,080
If you are jealous of Pan, why are you criticizing me?

351
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,830
I'm just kidding.

352
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,680
No, you weren't. You meant it.

353
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,280
Come on.

354
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,980
Let just enjoy the trip!

355
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,920
I'm here,

356
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,980
so let's have fun.

357
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,650
Let's go.

358
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,920
Pan.

359
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,640
Huh?

360
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,280
Why is the camera twitching?

361
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,140
Let me see.

362
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,740
Here.

363
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,450
You're right.

364
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
The camera is really hot.

365
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,410
What's wrong with you guys?

366
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,740
I don't know either.

367
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,810
Suddenly, it twitched while I was filming.

368
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,870
I think the battery is dead?

369
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
I don't think so. I just charged the battery.

370
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,000
It was fully charged this morning.

371
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,570
Your battery is dead after charging it this morning.

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,910
Do you use authentic or artificial batteries?

373
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, Ton.

374
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,560
I definitely use authentic batteries.

375
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,220
It's possible.

376
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,530
It's normal for batteries to run out quickly in cold weather.

377
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,280
What a shame.

378
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,660
Fans will not be able to travel with us.

379
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,880
You're right.

380
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
The battery ran out before we could do anything else.

381
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,700
How much can you shoot?

382
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,030
Not that much.

383
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,950
We only shot the beginning of the video.

384
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,520
It's not difficult.

385
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,740
If the camera doesn't work, use your phone.

386
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,250
Ton.

387
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,920
We'll be in trouble if our battery runs out.

388
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,160
None of us brought a power bank.

389
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,880
Well.

390
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,740
You can use my camera for now.

391
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,300
But I'll let you borrow it for just a moment.

392
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,860
I have to use it to work as well.

393
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,880
Okay.

394
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,490
Also, you have to respect some places.

395
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,390
Do not make loud noises.

396
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,760
And...

397
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,350
Japanese people are quite strict about social etiquette.

398
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,280
Right? What you want to say.

399
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah.

400
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,970
As Plai said.

401
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,250
Do not make loud noises.

402
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,610
Do not take photos showing other people in your photos.

403
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,500
Here. Take it.

404
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,870
Thank you.

405
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,080
Thank you.

406
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,213
I will return it to you as soon as possible.

407
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,857
Let's go.

408
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,320
Do you want me to hold it?

409
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,770
Yes.

410
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
Why are you smiling?

411
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,070
Go.

412
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,410
Join them.

413
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,610
Yes.

414
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,340
Namo… Meow-gek (a playful rendition of a chant).

415
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,800
We are now at the top of Matsue Castle.

416
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,060
Matsue Castle is one of the few remaining wooden castles.

417
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,360
And this place is registered as a cultural heritage of Japan.

418
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,670
The atmosphere here is very good.

419
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,420
What are you shooting?

420
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:26,364
Like that.

421
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,340
Yes. Great.

422
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,020
P, what are you shooting?

423
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,370
My work.

424
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,700
Is it true? Let me see.

425
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,590
No.

426
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,300
Hey, let me see.

427
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,330
Ahem!

428
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,520
What's up?

429
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,910
Strict about social etiquette.

430
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you guys doing here?

431
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,290
P secretly took a video of me.

432
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,700
Pan disturbs me while I'm working.

433
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,980
Just stop both.

434
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,700
Where are the others?

435
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,470
Ton went to poop.

436
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,830
PJ is waiting him.

437
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,270
So I came to you first.

438
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,290
- They are here.
- I'm here.

439
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,930
Sorry. My gut is bad.

440
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,530
But I feel better now.

441
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,230
But where do we go next?

442
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,420
Back home.

443
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,370
Huh? Why?

444
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,690
You may get sick from the cold wind.

445
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,260
I can endure it.

446
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,390
Let's go back.

447
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,810
I can't stand it.

448
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,660
Well, let's go back.

449
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,210
You come here to travel, poop, go back.

450
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,070
Exactly.

451
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,626
Two drinks, please.

452
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,830
Thank you.

453
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,800
I thought I won't be able to eat outside food at first.

454
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,320
Exactly.

455
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,820
You said you were going home.

456
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,630
P.

457
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Are they all famous restaurants?

458
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Yes.

459
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,000
Pan.

460
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,570
Huh?

461
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,610
Try it, Pan.

462
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,560
It's very delicious.

463
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,980
It's delicious, right?

464
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,500
Eat a lot, it's a carbohydrate.

465
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
Just eat, PJ.

466
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,760
Let me try this dish first.

467
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,750
It's about to overflow his plate.

468
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,350
Mostly, this is the local food of Japanese people.

469
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,490
Shimane is a coastal province.

470
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,490
So the seafood is especially fresh.

471
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,780
Especially this one.

472
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,090
Shijimi clam dashi soup.

473
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,020
This is Shimane's number one famous soup.

474
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,570
Is it really delicious?

475
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,900
Try it.

476
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,800
Let me try.

477
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,870
It smells so good.

478
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,340
Wow!

479
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,940
It's so delicious!

480
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,600
I don't trust anyone easily.

481
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,540
- Really?
- Try it.

482
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,390
Try it.

483
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,050
Hey!

484
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,420
Umami! (A savory taste in Japanese)

485
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,510
It's really delicious.

486
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,920
Everyone must try it.

487
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,960
Is it delicious?

488
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,630
It's really delicious.

489
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,490
Pan, try it.

490
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,300
See?

491
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,310
It's delicious.

492
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,670
What kind of shellfish is this?

493
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,930
- Shellfish.
- Let me eat it one more time.

494
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,510
One more time.

495
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,340
What are the shellfish like?

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,710
Oh, it's a shellfish like this.

497
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,410
It's a small shellfish.

498
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,370
Oh, sorry.

499
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,780
It's the second time.

500
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,670
It was just one time.

501
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,380
P.

502
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,450
But it's really delicious.

503
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,350
This is very delicious.

504
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,290
I'll give you a scoop.

505
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,470
- Really?
- Yes.

506
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,390
This one is also delicious.

507
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,010
It's all delicious.

508
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,930
Also, the vibe is very good.

509
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,090
Right?

510
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,510
Which dish do you like best?

511
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,280
From all of them?

512
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,810
I think...

513
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,670
This one.

514
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,310
Really?

515
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,950
It's very delicious.

516
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,750
I can keep eating it.

517
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,060
I like this dish too.

518
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,040
It's delicious and well-rounded.

519
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,530
It's very Umami!

520
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,610
For me.

521
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,730
If I were in Thailand, I would say that 'Every restaurant!
I would order this one, this one, and this one for takeout'.

522
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,920
And he is the one who pays.

523
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,400
Huh?

524
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,720
Why did it become me?

525
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,910
It's because you are my favorite brother.

526
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,900
So that you can help reduce your brother's expenses.

527
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,180
Then I'm not your favorite brother.

528
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,060
Are you my favorite brother?

529
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,120
Please leave me alone.

530
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
Are you my favorite brother?

531
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,040
Well, okay.

532
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,580
See?

533
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,210
You are not kind at all.

534
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,480
You must really like the food here.

535
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,660
Look. Your mouth is all messed up.

536
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,190
Yeah. It's delicious.

537
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,980
I'm not surprised that you were in Shimane prefecture before.

538
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,140
Let me go to the bathroom first.

539
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,360
Oh.

540
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,920
Where are you going? Do you want to poop?

541
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,060
Who would say poop at the dinner table?

542
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,360
Pan.

543
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,680
Let's take a photo.

544
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh? Plai, where are you going?

545
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,240
- I'm going to pee.
- 1, 2...

546
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,980
Pan, look at the camera.

547
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,000
P.

548
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,020
Wait for me.

549
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,360
Are you okay?

550
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,620
I just want to pee.

551
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,840
Pee?

552
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,930
Why are you so upset?

553
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,670
Am I being so obvious?

554
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,390
No.

555
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm just an observant person.

556
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,350
So I know you're feeling frustrated, right?

557
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,950
Yeah.

558
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,930
Are they that close?

559
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,980
I understand that they are seniors and juniors.

560
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,950
But I think there was something more than I thought.

561
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,720
They are quite close.

562
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,470
As you can see.

563
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,440
PJ doesn't have feelings for Pan, right?

564
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,440
I don't know.

565
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,530
I never asked him.

566
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,120
I don't know how to help you.

567
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,200
I feel you, P.

568
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,610
Why is my problem so difficult?

569
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,990
You can give up.

570
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,560
I think PJ is a good guy.

571
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,320
Huh?

572
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,690
You.

573
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,420
You really have a foul mouth.

574
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,880
Slap mouth now!

575
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,490
Your mouth, not mine!

576
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm just kidding.

577
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,960
Let's go.

578
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,140
Let's go to the bathroom.

579
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,040
I need to pee for real.

580
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,750
Where did those two go?

581
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,220
They will probably be back soon.

582
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,040
I'll back soon.

583
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,290
Where are you going?

584
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,310
Take a walk?

585
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,440
No.

586
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,740
I'm going to the bathroom.

587
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,500
Hey, wait for me!

588
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,850
Oh?

589
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,740
Where did you guys go again?

590
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,600
You left me alone at the table again.

591
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,670
Fine.

592
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,790
Did you guys leave the table?

593
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,490
I'll eat it all alone.

594
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,520
You will definitely be surprised
when you return to your table.

595
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,460
You guys just keep fighting to give each other food.

596
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,610
Huh? Where is P?

597
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,120
He is going to the bathroom.

598
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,380
He might be coming out soon.

599
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,900
Why are you here, Plai?

600
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
Aren't you going back to the table?

601
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,940
Oh.

602
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,790
I want to walk around here.

603
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,190
I like its vibe.

604
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,740
Please stay with Plai first, PJ.

605
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm going to the bathroom.

606
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,840
Oh, are you done?

607
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,490
Wait for me.

608
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,280
Umm.

609
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,160
Sure.

610
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,030
Let's take a walk.

611
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:17,160
But Pan told me to wait here.

612
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,400
It's okay.

613
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,760
I'll wait for Pan here.

614
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,900
Just take a walk.

615
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Good.

616
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,490
Let's go.

617
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,480
Let's take a walk.

618
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,770
It's so beautiful here.

619
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,730
The vibe is good too.

620
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,880
P.

621
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,030
Why are you so quiet?

622
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,570
Please say something.

623
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,950
Please recommend me a place.

624
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,160
This is Karakoro Kobo.

625
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,560
Besides being a good restaurant,
it is also a place to learn traditional Japanese arts and crafts.

626
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,420
Such as pottery or accessories.

627
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,190
Oh, and there are workshops too.

628
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,910
Really?

629
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,700
I like it.

630
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,080
Can you tell me more? Please, please, please.

631
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,630
Okay?

632
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,790
More.

633
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,800
What is your relationship with PJ?

634
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,350
Have you been quiet for so long
because you're curious about it?

635
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,270
Yeah.

636
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,170
I want to know.

637
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,400
Answer me.

638
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,820
We are just seniors and juniors.

639
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,940
Just seniors and juniors, right?

640
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,680
It's not exactly like that.

641
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,890
Fans love it when I'm with him.

642
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,160
So we've been working together more recently.

643
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,380
They call it an imaginary couple.

644
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,340
We may work together more in the future.

645
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,920
It's like partners who work together.

646
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,510
Do you understand?

647
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,320
I can understand.

648
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,310
If it's like you said.

649
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,990
In the future, if...

650
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,360
Now I have no feelings for him.

651
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,480
But I don't know the future.

652
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,640
PJ is a very cute junior.

653
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,080
Also,

654
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,920
I can open up and talk to anyone, can't I?

655
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,430
Huh?

656
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,380
Pan, you.

657
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,720
Where is the workshop?

658
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,700
Please take me there.

659
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,760
Please.

660
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
The tea workshop area is upstairs.

661
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,720
Let's go.

662
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,080
When will they come?

663
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,060
Cool.

664
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,610
The vibe here is really good.

665
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm serious.

666
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,860
About?

667
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,260
You guys have been gone for so long.

668
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,410
This was a heavenly voice.

669
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,640
You're exaggerating.

670
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,970
We just went for a walk.

671
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,640
Just a little bit.

672
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,800
A little bit? You took a long time.

673
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,400
What about the other two?

674
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,440
There.

675
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,910
You came as soon as I mentioned you.

676
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,860
Hurry up and sit down.

677
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,860
You guys have been gone for too long.

678
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,240
I think you cleaned the bathroom.

679
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,750
The food is all cold.

680
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,750
I'd be really mad if anyone left this time.

681
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,920
I'll tickle you guys.

682
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,580
You are such a complainer.

683
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,510
But...

684
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,400
Let's drink.

685
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,350
Thank you.

686
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,570
Here.

687
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,790
Send it to Pan.

688
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,300
Take another one.

689
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,600
Hey.

690
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,820
Do you guys smell anything?

691
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,480
What smell?

692
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,560
It smells like rotten food.

693
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,110
Rotten food.

694
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,110
Rotten food?

695
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,560
How is that possible?

696
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
It was still normal before.

697
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,650
Maybe it is possible.

698
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,960
Bacteria in the air can get on food.

699
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,750
Food may spoil after being left for a while.

700
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,770
It really stinks.

701
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,720
Let's drink.

702
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,760
- Send it to Mr.P.
- To Mr.P.

703
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,240
I don't drink it.

704
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,560
I forgot.

705
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,540
You are a non-alcoholic guy.

706
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,530
We are outside now.

707
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,070
I think it's better if someone doesn't drink.

708
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,500
You have to drink with me if we're home.

709
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,160
I will definitely do it if I am at home. Don't worry.

710
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,930
I forgot. He was obeying someone.

711
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,440
I think that's his wife.

712
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,410
Maybe.

713
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,780
Come on.

714
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,370
- Let's cheers?
- Cheers?

715
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,950
1, 2, 3.

716
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,950
Cheers!

717
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,760
3, 2, 1.

718
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,040
Come on.

719
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,570
Let's cheers.

720
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,460
So refreshing.

721
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,540
Hold on.

722
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,560
We come to Japan, we shouldn't just cheers.

723
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,430
P.

724
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,340
How do you say cheers in Japanese?

725
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,970
Kanpai.

726
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,400
Kanpai.

727
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,330
Okay? One more time.

728
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:35,740
Okay.

729
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,550
3, 2, 1.

730
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,860
Kanpai.

731
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,310
Bottoms up.

732
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,640
It's not. Can up.

733
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,590
P, hurry up.

734
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm freezing.

735
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,420
You're heavy.

736
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,960
Be careful.

737
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,720
The path is narrow.

738
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,470
You knocked my shoes off.

739
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,140
Ton, take off your shoes.

740
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,220
Hey, watch out for the stairs.

741
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,110
- Different level floors. Watch out.
- Different level floors.

742
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,760
Watch out.

743
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,030
You are such a burden.

744
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,770
You're so heavy.

745
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,060
Walk properly, Ton.

746
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,860
Walk properly.

747
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,450
Why are you drinking so much?

748
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,600
You really give me trouble. Get out.

749
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,200
So heavy.

750
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,960
- Slowly.
- Watch out. Different level floors.

751
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,080
I've only ever seen managers taking care of artists.

752
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,140
But artists like us have to take care of our managers.

753
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,930
I'm very impressed.

754
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,220
Don't talk too much.

755
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,270
That way.

756
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,270
It's my plan.

757
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,850
I am the manager.

758
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,740
I pretended to be drunk.

759
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,400
You will quit drinking after I get drunk.

760
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,600
So you can get home. See?

761
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,280
Everyone get home safely.

762
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,030
Happy ending.

763
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,180
Hey, Ton.

764
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,050
Get up.

765
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,760
He probably needs some relief.

766
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,680
It's just once in a while.

767
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,710
It's as you can see after we had some time to travel.

768
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,200
Come on, Ton.

769
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,440
I'll take you to sleep in the room.

770
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,810
Uh, P.

771
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,650
Which room are we going to sleep in tonight?

772
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,450
Oh.

773
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,000
I forgot to talk to you guys about this.

774
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,480
It has two bedrooms.

775
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,960
How do we share a bedroom?

776
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,600
Let's do this?

777
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,600
Let Ton sleep on the sofa tonight.

778
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Me, Pan and PJ will sleep together.

779
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,680
You just sleep in your room.

780
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,470
It's good.

781
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,550
3 people sleeping together?

782
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,840
No way!

783
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,550
It's okay. We can sleep huddled together.

784
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,700
It's not difficult. We just cuddle up together.

785
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,330
Umm...

786
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,030
The room is small.

787
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,640
It's uncomfortable if 3 people sleep together.

788
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,730
It makes you uncomfortable when sleeping.

789
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,940
I think it's okay.

790
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,680
You guys are small.

791
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,070
Also,

792
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,520
you are the homeowner.

793
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,080
Just sleep in your room.

794
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,310
Ton is drunk. Just let him sleep on the sofa.

795
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,770
Who's drunk?

796
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,520
Drunk people should sleep here.

797
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,910
So that I can easily go out and vomit.

798
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,910
I'm not drunk.

799
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,850
You're really not drunk...

800
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,430
Will it be okay?

801
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,340
Pan has a snoring habit.

802
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,620
PJ, can you sleep?

803
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,520
Or...

804
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,730
Do you want PJ to sleep with you?

805
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,090
- No way!
- No way!

806
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,050
Huh?

807
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,040
Why?

808
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,620
Just...

809
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,780
I'm not used to having someone else sleep with me.

810
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,240
It will make me sleepless.

811
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,840
You're right.

812
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,960
P is a person who has difficulty falling asleep.

813
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:11,860
Well.

814
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,460
Let Plai sleep with Pan.

815
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,500
PJ and Ton sleep in my room.

816
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,390
I will sleep here.

817
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,700
I will not contradict what the homeowner said.

818
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,850
PJ.

819
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,430
Please take care of Ton.

820
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,060
Okay.

821
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,620
Ton.

822
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,240
- Go.
- Go to sleep in the room.

823
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,310
PJ.

824
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,470
I can sleep here.

825
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,890
I can sleep anywhere.

826
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,400
I'm not picky about my bed.

827
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,710
Be careful.

828
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,480
I have a headache.

829
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,720
[PJ_KSN]

830
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,840
[I'm so shy. The perfect couple of 2025 #PJPan]

831
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,320
[I couldn't hold back my smile #PJPan]

832
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,100
[This couple looks so perfect together #PJPan]

833
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,280
So perfect?

834
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,520
Hey!

835
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,410
Why?

836
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,850
Did you have a nightmare?

837
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,040
You act like you saw a ghost.

838
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,790
I'm shocked by you.

839
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,920
You suddenly appeared without any sound.

840
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,580
I see you've fallen asleep.

841
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,300
So I walked slowly.

842
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,200
I'm worried that I'll wake you up.

843
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,440
Why did you come out of the room?

844
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,010
Nothing.

845
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,120
I just came out to drink some water.

846
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,380
My throat is dry. It must be the heater.

847
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Are you sick?

848
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,780
Do you have a sore throat?

849
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:25,960
No.

850
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,220
It may be because the air is dry.

851
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,460
Then, sit here.

852
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,340
I'll go get you some warm tea.

853
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,120
Here.

854
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:06,730
Warm tea.

855
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,160
It helps you sleep well.

856
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,640
The pictures you took are beautiful.

857
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,330
I'm selecting photos to upload to my blog.

858
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,680
I can only check it.

859
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,950
I'm not in the mood to work yet.

860
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,010
Why?

861
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,900
Are you stressed about work?

862
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,130
You sleep with a frown on your face.

863
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,160
I'm thinking of something a bit.

864
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,980
The editor is rushing me.

865
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,960
But I don't have any ideas to present to them yet.

866
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,240
So I'll find a new idea tomorrow.

867
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,940
Are you okay with sleeping outside?

868
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:57,880
Yes.

869
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,130
I'm fine.

870
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,130
If it keeps you from sleeping with other people,

871
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,420
I'm okay with everything.

872
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,600
Why? The tea is too hot?

873
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,060
No.

874
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,640
I just swallowed tea at the wrong moment.

875
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,300
You need to unbutton it first.

876
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,640
Are you feeling better yet?

877
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,520
Yes.

878
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,840
I'll get you a new glass of water.

879
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,740
Hey. That's okay.

880
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,570
I feel better after drinking your tea.

881
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:18,930
Just do your work.

882
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,780
I won't disturb your time.

883
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,410
Hold on.

884
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,050
Why?

885
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,150
No. Just...

886
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,600
Why?

887
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,290
Can't you sleep if you're not drunk?

888
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,490
Yeah.

889
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,700
I haven't had a drink in a long time.

890
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,700
I comply with your request.

891
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,030
It's good...

892
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,750
that you take care of your health.

893
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,820
Keep working.

894
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:04,750
I'm going to bed now.

895
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,790
Umm.

896
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,160
Okay.

897
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,910
Good night.

898
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,480
This way.

899
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,960
Sorry. I went the wrong way.

900
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,240
Hey.

901
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,880
Why does drinking water make you so dirty
you have to change your clothes?

902
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,800
What did you drink?

903
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,540
Huh? What water?

904
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,600
I told you to be quiet.

905
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:05,790
Annoying.

906
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,100
D*mn.

907
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,290
What?
