1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Wish

4
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Oh

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,740
Yes, ID Yoo Jung갔t超适也

6
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:45,860
Let's go inside, gotta hurry.

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,880
Pancake in a wrapped place

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:46,960
Pancake in a wrapped place

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,020
Pancake in a wrapped place

10
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,060
Pancake in a wrapped place

11
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,180
Pancake in a wrapped place

12
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,360
Pancake in a wrapped place

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
Pancake in a baby's clothes

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
Pancake in a baby's clothes

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Soyeon, why is your mom crying?

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Because Cho Rong-hye is dead.

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
She can't see her again if she dies.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
But she can live with her dog again.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
She can live with her dog again.

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
She can live with her dog.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
But Cho Rong-hye was our family.

23
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
But Cho Rong-hye was our family.

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I can't be your family.

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Cho Rong-hye is an animal.

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Even if she's an animal, if we eat and sleep together in the same house,

27
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
it's the same for family.

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
There's something that can't be changed by anyone.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Like a daughter to her mom, Soyeon.

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Soyeon.

31
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Where are you going if you die?

32
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
If you do good things, you'll go to heaven.

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
If you do bad things, you'll go to hell.

34
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Mom and I can't go to heaven.

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
But I'm glad I went with mom.

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm going to pick you up. Why did you come home alone?

37
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
To see Cho Rong-hye.

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Why?

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
When you finish kindergarten tomorrow, you'll come to the swimming pool.

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Why?

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
To learn swimming.

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Let's come home together after swimming.

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I don't like water.

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
It's scary.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
You can do it.

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Come here.

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Hold my hand and come in.

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Come on.

50
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Good.

51
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
It's okay.

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Let's catch it.

53
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
You can do it.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Good.

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Keep your body straight.

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Keep kicking.

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Keep kicking.

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Keep going.

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Good.

60
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Keep kicking.

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Good.

62
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Mom.

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I was surprised when you came home to divorce me.

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm so clueless.

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
You said So-yeon was sick.

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I heard from Mr. Kim that she's going to a psychiatrist.

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,720
She'll be getting regular treatment and she'll get better.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Yes, all kids are like So-yeon.

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
You have to take care of them.

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I think my granddaughter is fine.

71
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
But even a normal person goes to a mental hospital.

72
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Why don't you see your father?

73
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
What's that?

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Let's go to church and do something weird.

75
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll live here with you for a while.

76
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Grandma.

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
You're up.

78
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
What's this?

79
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Oh, my goodness.

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Did you draw this for me?

81
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Look at this.

82
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Ji-hye, you brought a bottle of water and this, right?

83
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Yes.

84
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Let me check.

85
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Yes, I brought a swimming suit and glasses.

86
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Oh, you put everything in. Good job.

87
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Teacher.

88
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Ji-hye.

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Hello, Ji-hye.

90
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Hello.

91
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Hello.

92
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Hello.

93
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Hello.

94
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Hello.

95
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Hello.

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Thank you, teacher.

97
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Ji-hye was shy and had a hard time moving in recently.

98
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, yes.

99
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Yes, she was happy and happy when she came to the swimming pool.

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Her face was bright.

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Please take good care of her.

102
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
What?

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Ji-hye is doing well, right?

104
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
You have a daughter, too.

105
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
She's the same age as Ji-hye.

106
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Yes.

107
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Ji-hye, it's me.

108
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh, your daughter?

109
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes.

110
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Ji-hye, do you want to say hello to my friend?

111
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Hello.

112
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
This is Jeon Ji-hye.

113
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Please be good friends with my daughter.

114
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
She's the same age as So-yeon.

115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Be good friends.

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Hello.

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Hello, I'm Kim So-yeon.

118
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Hello.

119
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Are you good at swimming?

120
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
No, I'm scared of water.

121
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
You're the same age as me.

122
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Are you scared, too?

123
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes.

124
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm calling you.

125
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
She said she had a horror experience.

126
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
So-yeon said she was going to do it on her own.

127
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Yes.

128
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
We told her to come here because

129
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,720
it's not the first time So-yeon has done something dangerous.

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Oh, yes.

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I heard that there are wounds on children's bodies or scratches.

132
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I got a call from the anti-racism group.

133
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I suspected the teachers first.

134
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Yes.

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
But as you can see...

136
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
You mean my daughter led the group?

137
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Yes.

138
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
What did you confirm so far?

139
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
So what we can say is...

140
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I told you you'd be punished if you did something wrong.

142
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,720
You have to go to another kindergarten because of what So-yeon did.

143
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
What are you doing there?

144
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Mom, are you sick?

145
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Are you sick a lot?

146
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm not sick.

147
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm sick.

148
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm sick.

149
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm sick.

150
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Are you sick?

151
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Yes.

152
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
What are you doing there?

153
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I drank water.

154
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
What's that?

155
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Ji-hye? Ji-won?

156
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
The girl you teach?

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Ji-hye?

158
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes, Ji-hye.

159
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
So-yeon took her to kindergarten.

160
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
She said she knew her.

161
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
She's in the same class as Ji-hye.

162
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
She's the closest.

163
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
She's the closest.

164
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
She's the closest.

165
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
She's the closest.

166
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
She's the closest.

167
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
She's in the same class as Ji-hye.

168
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
She's the closest.

169
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Oh, really?

170
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
She's the closest to Ji-hye?

171
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Eat up, So-yeon.

172
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
You're eating so well.

173
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Ji-hye.

174
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Are you sick?

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Yes.

176
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Are you sad because your sister is sick?

177
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes.

178
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Isn't she annoying?

179
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Yes.

180
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I'll go get her.

181
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Ji-hye, your dad will be here soon.

182
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Ji-woo, I'll go get some food for the kids.

183
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Yes, go ahead.

184
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll be right back.

185
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Do you want to practice?

186
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Practice?

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
11, 8, 9, 10, 11...

188
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Dad!

189
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Ji-hye, I'm late.

190
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Hello.

191
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Hello.

192
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Mom, my hand...

193
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
What's wrong with your hand?

194
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Did Ji-hye do that?

195
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Ji-hye, you shouldn't do that to your friend.

196
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm fine.

197
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the trouble.

198
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
No, it's okay.

199
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
You should apologize to your friend.

200
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Ji-hye.

201
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
I'm sorry. I'll apologize instead.

202
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
It's okay. I think I just scratched it a little.

203
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
You must be out of your mind.

204
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Go inside.

205
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I'll go inside.

206
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Thank you.

207
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Come here.

208
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Mom forgives quickly.

209
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Can you please help me?

210
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm in a situation where I can't pray.

211
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
God, I'm having a hard time.

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Please help me.

213
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
But everyone...

214
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I see.

215
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I can't see you.

216
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I prayed hard at home.

217
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm sorry.

218
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
It's okay.

219
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I thought you were his daughter.

220
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Yes, yes.

221
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Say hello to your sisters.

222
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
She's my daughter.

223
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I've never seen you before.

224
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
So-yeon's mom.

225
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Right?

226
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Hello.

227
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
You came to this neighborhood.

228
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
So-yeon's mom looks so pale.

229
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Is she still like that?

230
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,720
So-ra goes to the psychiatrist because of So-yeon.

231
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
She's very anxious.

232
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Did she go to church?

234
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Today...

235
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Are you conscious?

236
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Why?

237
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
To get rid of her?

238
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
With all your bravado?

239
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
So-yeon's weird.

240
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I guess there's no rumor here.

241
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
See you again, So-yeon's mom.

242
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Are you okay?

244
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
What?

245
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Just...

246
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Everything?

247
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Yeah, I'm fine.

248
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
So-yeon called me.

249
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
When? What did she say?

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Last week.

251
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
She just called me.

252
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
She called me late at night, so I was surprised.

253
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Nothing happened, right?

254
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
No, nothing happened.

255
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
So-yeon's calmer than before.

256
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
She's getting along with her friends.

257
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
But...

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Why did you move her to the kindergarten?

259
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
What?

260
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
So-yeon told me.

261
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
She told you everything.

262
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
I should know that.

263
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Why?

264
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
What do you mean?

265
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
What?

266
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
You don't deserve it!

267
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
You're not going to tell me to be quiet.

268
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Do you think I do?

269
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
I ran away because I was scared of my daughter.

270
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I'd rather be out of it.

271
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Out of it?

272
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
What do you mean?

273
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm not scared of her.

274
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
I'd be grateful if she was the only one who bothered me.

275
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
That's why we broke up.

276
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
You could've just gotten her hospitalized.

277
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Are you sure?

278
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Let's just say I'm cowardly.

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Are you sure?

280
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
It's the company. I have to answer it.

281
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
So-yeon, I'm going in.

283
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
So-yeon, I'm going in.

284
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
So, are you going to see So-yeon this afternoon?

285
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Yes.

286
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Please share So-yeon's condition with her.

287
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,720
You can come with her next time.

288
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Young-eun?

289
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Young-eun, you can't get tired.

290
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
You know that, right?

291
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Yes, of course.

292
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Can't you go to the hospital now?

293
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
I don't want to go to the hospital.

294
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
If you're doing well in the kindergarten and the swimming pool,

295
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I promise you won't go.

296
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm doing well.

297
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
You can't act like you did to Sora.

298
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I promise you won't go.

299
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm doing well.

300
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
You can't act like you did to Sora.

301
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm just playing.

302
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
If your friend says no, you shouldn't do it.

303
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Why do you keep telling me not to do it?

304
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Kim So-yeon.

305
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I can't do anything I want. Why? Why?

306
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you scared of me too?

307
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I'm going to catch two fish this time.

308
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Will you catch them?

309
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Yes, of course.

310
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Please don't come over there.

311
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Okay, I'll do that.

312
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I'll go and catch them.

313
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll go and catch them.

314
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll go and catch them.

315
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll go and catch them.

316
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I'll go and catch them.

317
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
I'll go and catch them.

318
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
I'll go and catch them.

319
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
I'll go and catch them.

320
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Mom.

321
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Yes?

322
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Chorong and the chicken are the same animal, right?

323
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Yes.

324
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
But can I kill the country chicken?

325
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Let's sleep.

326
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Okay.

327
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I talked to the teacher.

328
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
She's doing so well in kindergarten. Don't worry.

329
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Where's So-yeon?

330
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
She just got on the bus. She'll be here soon.

331
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Ji-hye.

332
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,720
No, you can't. Wait until 50.

333
00:26:47,720 --> 00:27:00,720
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

334
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I don't know.

335
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I don't know.

336
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I did the same in kindergarten.

337
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
I told them not to do it.

338
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
I told them I didn't want to do it.

339
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
If they don't do it, they'll make fun of me.

340
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
You must have been scared.

341
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Yes.

342
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Why did you do that?

343
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Ji-hye.

344
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Yes?

345
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Did you tell your mom or the kindergarten teachers that So-yeon was bullying them?

346
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
No.

347
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I didn't tell them.

348
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I see.

349
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I see.

350
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,720
You can't tell anyone else about this.

351
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Never.

352
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I'll make sure So-yeon never does that again.

353
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

354
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I promise.

355
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I won't tell anyone.

356
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
So-yeon.

357
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
So-yeon.

358
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
No.

359
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Why are you running away?

360
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Come here.

361
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I'll pick you up after class.

362
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Stay here.

363
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Mom!

364
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
So-yeon.

365
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
You're So-yeon, right?

366
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
So-yeon.

367
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
So-yeon.

368
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Stop.

369
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
You're hurt.

370
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
It's dangerous.

371
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Ji-hye.

372
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Kim So-yeon.

373
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Ji-hye.

374
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Wait.

375
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Ji-hye.

376
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Ji-hye, wake up.

377
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I'll call an ambulance.

378
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Ji-hye.

379
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
How did you raise her?

381
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Ji-hye is the best at being afraid of water.

382
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Why did you do that to Ji-hye?

383
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Why did you do that?

384
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
What?

385
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
You don't like me?

386
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
You don't need me?

387
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
You value So-yeon.

388
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Why do you always blame me?

389
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Because I do what I should do.

390
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Did you always want to torture me like you always did?

391
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Did you?

392
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Why did you do that?

393
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
I don't know.

394
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
I don't know.

395
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Look at this.

396
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Now? What happened?

397
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Do you want to ask?

398
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
So-yeon doesn't know.

399
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
She doesn't know why she's doing this.

400
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
What is it?

401
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm not confident.

402
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I lied.

403
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
I can do it.

404
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I'm fine.

405
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I can't do it anymore.

406
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Help me. Please help me.

407
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
What else should I do?

408
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Tell me.

409
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
What else should I do?

410
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
What else should I do?

411
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Hello?

412
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Hello?

413
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
So-yeon!

414
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,720
How could you let her come alone?

415
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Where are you?

416
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Why aren't you saying anything?

417
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Hye-won, I'll talk to her.

418
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, my.

419
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
I'll go and talk to her.

420
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Oh, my.

421
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Mom.

422
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Mom, what's wrong?

423
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Did So-yeon do this?

424
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Oh, my.

425
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Oh, my.

426
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
So-yeon, open the door.

427
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Open the door!

428
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Oh, my.

429
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
What are you doing?

430
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Oh, my.

431
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
So-yeon.

432
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Where did you get the knife?

433
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Mom, I lied.

434
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Put the knife down.

435
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
You said I was the most precious.

436
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You said I was the only one.

437
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I just gave it to you when I ran away.

438
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
You tried to throw me away.

439
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
It's all a lie.

440
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
You liar!

441
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Get rid of it!

442
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Stop it.

443
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Give it to me.

444
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Give it to me.

445
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Oh, my.

446
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Oh, my.

447
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Oh, my.

448
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Oh, my.

449
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Oh, my.

450
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Oh, my.

451
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,720
I can't leave So-yeon now.

452
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
So-yeon.

453
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
So-yeon.

454
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,720
So-yeon.

455
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
So-yeon.

456
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
So-yeon.

457
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Shall we swim?

458
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Yes.

459
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Are you still scared of the water?

460
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Yes.

461
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Ji-hye said she was scared of the water.

462
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Yes.

463
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Ji-hye was so surprised yesterday.

464
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
She was scared, right?

465
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
So-yeon.

466
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
So-yeon.

467
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm scared. I think I'm scared.

468
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Right.

469
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Ji-hye must have been very scared.

470
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I won't do that again.

471
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
I was wrong.

472
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Let's not do anything bad today.

473
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
For So-yeon.

474
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
No!

475
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
No.

476
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Ji-hye.

477
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
So-yeon.

478
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
So-yeon.

479
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
So-yeon.

480
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
So-yeon.

481
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
So-yeon.

482
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
So-yeon.

483
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
So-yeon.

484
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
So-yeon.

485
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
So-yeon.

486
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
So-yeon.

487
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
So-yeon.

488
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
So-yeon.

489
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
So-yeon.

490
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
So-yeon.

491
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
So-yeon.

492
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
So-yeon.

493
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
So-yeon.

494
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
So-yeon.

495
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
So-yeon.

496
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
So-yeon.

497
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
So-yeon.

498
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
So-yeon.

499
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
So-yeon.

500
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
So-yeon.

501
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
So-yeon.

502
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
So-yeon.

503
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
So-yeon.

504
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
So-yeon.

505
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
So-yeon.

506
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Mina.

507
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,340
Mom.

508
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Come out.

509
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,000
Don't beat her.

510
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's the boss.

511
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,680
Let's go out, okay?

512
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,920
Open.

513
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,660
Go away!

514
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,540
What are you doing?

515
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,040
packing cards

516
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,540
You're just looking.

517
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,100
You've been really growing these days.

518
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,780
You often go walk and talk about the past.

519
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,080
Yeah.

520
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,080
and you're orginated in the airport.

521
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,080
I heard you didn't even know how to say hi to your daughter.

522
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Don't do that.

523
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Let's talk next time.

524
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,080
It's better to give stimulation to patients.

525
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I'll call you later.

526
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
When will she come?

527
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Is your name Kim Min?

528
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
What's wrong?

530
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Nothing's working here.

531
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,080
I think we should throw this away.

532
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,080
You've been doing this for a long time.

533
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
Who's this?

534
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,080
Min, go to the basement.

535
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
See if there's anything there.

536
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Are you okay?

537
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Eat slowly.

538
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,080
You've been starving for days.

539
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,080
Have you ever done this before?

540
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
Yes, it's similar.

541
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
In Busan?

542
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Is your hometown there?

543
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,080
What are you doing now?

544
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
This is Seoul.

545
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Where do you live?

546
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
It's half past midnight.

547
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
It's your first day.

548
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Let's eat slowly.

549
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
What about your family?

550
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,080
Aren't your parents home?

551
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,080
I was abandoned when I was young.

552
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
Oh, my.

553
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
I'm sorry.

554
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
It's okay.

555
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,080
I don't remember.

556
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
What's wrong?

557
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Is it your first time seeing him?

558
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,080
It's not my first time.

559
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,080
You don't look like that.

560
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,080
Do you look like that?

561
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
It's good.

562
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
You two can communicate.

563
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Min, tell me one by one.

564
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,080
Why aren't you raising your hand?

565
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Are you okay?

566
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,080
You must be surprised.

567
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,080
I'll get the medicine.

568
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm fine.

569
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
I'm not feeling well.

570
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,080
Should I put this outside?

571
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Yes.

572
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,080
I'll go in first.

573
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Okay.

574
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,080
The black dot is a mark.

575
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,080
This part is a tear.

576
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,080
Can you hear the beating?

577
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
It's already so loud.

578
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
Of course.

579
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
It's been about seven weeks.

580
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,080
You have to take good care of it from now on.

581
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,080
You must get a regular checkup.

582
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,080
I'll be right there.

583
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
Oh, no.

584
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,080
Hey, Min.

585
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
You're here.

586
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,080
How long?

587
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,080
They said they were looking for a room for a while.

588
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,080
I thought they were looking for a place to stay

589
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,080
and provide a place to stay.

590
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,080
I guess that's what they said.

591
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,080
I'll just sleep in the next room.

592
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,080
I don't think there's a reason for it.

593
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,080
I can't just leave.

594
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,080
What about the manager?

595
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Just understand.

596
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,080
It's cold.

597
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,080
Let's go in.

598
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Okay.

599
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,080
Let's go in.

600
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,080
Hey.

601
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Hey, Min.

602
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,080
What are you doing?

603
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:58,080
Oh, the lady said I could wear anything in your room.

604
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,080
Look at this. It's amazing, right?

605
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,080
Don't come in here.

606
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,080
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
You must be really lucky.

608
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,080
What?

609
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,080
You said you wouldn't buy a single drop of blood.

610
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,080
I thought you were a distant relative.

611
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,080
You said you met each other at the construction site.

612
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,080
That's amazing.

613
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:37,080
So, can you stay here?

614
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,080
I've been around a lot.

615
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
I lived in the factory,

616
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,080
cleaned the hotel, and lived in a small room.

617
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,080
I used to live in my relatives' house, but my family did more.

618
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
You...

619
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Yes?

620
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,080
You're always so cold.

621
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh.

622
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,080
I want to rest now. Can you leave?

623
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
Didn't you see it?

624
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,680
It said it was a box of

625
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,080
antiques.

626
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,080
I didn't see it.

627
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,080
Me neither.

628
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,080
You guys are so mean.

629
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,080
You want us to drink?

630
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Have some green tea.

631
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,080
It's only been a week.

632
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,080
You're so professional.

633
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,080
Oh, you don't know her?

634
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
She's from the house before Hye-yeon came.

635
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Really?

636
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,080
Why?

637
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,080
Did something disappear?

638
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Maybe it's Byung-chul.

639
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Something suspicious happened to him.

640
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,080
He's always so mean.

641
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Check the house carefully.

642
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,080
Yes.

643
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Oh.

644
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,080
Hey.

645
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
I'm fine.

646
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
We can have dinner together.

647
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,080
Have dinner with your aunt.

648
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
Can't we try to guess?

649
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Today...

650
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,080
Are you...

651
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,080
Are you really looking for a house?

652
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,080
What?

653
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,080
Why?

654
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,080
You look so comfortable.

655
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,080
You're getting tired.

656
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Are you tired?

657
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,080
What? No.

658
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,080
You can say that.

659
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,080
I'm so happy with everything.

660
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,080
I must have been thinking too much.

661
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,080
I'm going to look for a house soon.

662
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,080
Why do you think that?

663
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,080
You can stay as long as you want.

664
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,080
I think you don't like me.

665
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
Did something happen between you and Min-hee?

666
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
No.

667
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,080
I just feel...

668
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,080
It's a little cold, right?

669
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,080
She's still like that to me.

670
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,080
She's sensitive and talkative.

671
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,080
But she's different.

672
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,080
She's just not good at expressing herself.

673
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Do you think so?

674
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,080
I don't remember when I was young.

675
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,080
I didn't know my real name.

676
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,080
I didn't know my last name.

677
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
I didn't know who my parents were.

678
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,080
I didn't know why they abandoned me.

679
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,080
That's why I don't trust people.

680
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Take your time.

681
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,080
Okay.

682
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,080
We recommend surgery for 10 seconds.

683
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Min-hee has been in the hospital for 8 seconds.

684
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Have you thought about it?

685
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
How long will it take to recover?

686
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,080
It depends on the person.

687
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,080
You can live your life without any problems.

688
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,080
I'm sorry.

689
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,080
I'll call you back.

690
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,080
Is this your wallet?

691
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,080
Yes.

692
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Wait a minute.

693
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Did you sell this?

694
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,080
My grandmother made this especially for me.

695
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,080
Where did you get this?

696
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,080
What?

697
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,080
Where are you going?

698
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Let go of me.

699
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Let go of me.

700
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,080
What are you doing?

701
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,080
You have to catch her.

702
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,080
Why are you here already?

703
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
Hey.

704
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Why are you sweating so much?

705
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,080
I was going to surprise you.

706
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,080
I heard from your aunt that it's your birthday today.

707
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,080
What?

708
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,080
You didn't forget your birthday, did you?

709
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:22,080
Happy birthday to my dear Min-hee.

710
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,080
Blow out the candles.

711
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,080
Congratulations.

712
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,080
It feels better to celebrate your birthday with three people.

713
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,080
Right, Min-hee?

714
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,080
I'm getting old.

715
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,080
I should do something like this.

716
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
I'm not a member of the family anymore.

717
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,080
What's the big deal about being a member of the family?

718
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,080
We cook together, do the dishes, clean the house, and drink together.

719
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,080
It's not easy to be a member of the family.

720
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Are you curious?

721
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,080
Who is she?

722
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Su-hwa.

723
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,080
Jung Su-hwa.

724
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,080
My daughter.

725
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,080
She looks like you.

726
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,080
What?

727
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Oh.

728
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,080
Oh?

729
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,080
She looks like you.

730
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,080
Really?

731
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
I feel good to hear that.

732
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
But she...

733
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,080
She hated the fact that I looked like her.

734
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,080
Where is she now?

735
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,080
She's gone.

736
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,080
She left me.

737
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,080
She's a bad girl.

738
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,080
She's the prettiest.

739
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,080
Look at me.

740
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Why are you sleeping?

741
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,080
You're sleeping while eating.

742
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,080
Stop drinking.

743
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,080
Why? It's lunch time.

744
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,080
I'm so sad.

745
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
There's no one like you in the world.

746
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Right?

747
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,080
I'll be your youngest daughter.

748
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
Youngest daughter.

749
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Why are you laughing?

750
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,080
I'm speechless.

751
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
I can't believe you said that.

752
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,080
You can't do anything.

753
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,080
We ate together, slept together, and lived together.

754
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,080
So?

755
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
You're the eldest daughter?

756
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,080
I'm the second daughter?

757
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
Oh, right.

758
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,080
Su-hwa was there.

759
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
Don't do this again.

760
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,080
Hey.

761
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,080
What's the problem?

762
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,080
Don't do anything that means nothing to me.

763
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
Am I jealous?

764
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,080
No?

765
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,080
I'm sorry.

766
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
Keep going.

767
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,080
I'm just kidding.

768
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,080
I said keep going.

769
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
I said I'm kidding.

770
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
I mean...

771
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
You're talking nonsense.

772
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,080
It's like you're talking shit.

773
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
This isn't your house.

774
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,080
Stay here and go.

775
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Don't make me tired.

776
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,080
Did I do something wrong to you?

777
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,080
I'm different from you.

778
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,080
You asked me that?

779
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,080
You didn't know, did you?

780
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:48,080
I didn't even know that you were thinking about me.

781
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,080
Are you okay?

782
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,080
Her mom couldn't reach her.

783
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
She's been in a bad mood for months.

784
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
I'm mad.

785
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,080
You're the one who's mad.

786
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
I'm mad because you're being pushed around.

787
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
Poor kids like you.

788
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
I feel bad for you.

789
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
It's so bitter.

790
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,080
Did something happen yesterday?

791
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
I don't remember anything.

792
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,080
What?

793
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,080
Hye-young.

794
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
It's nothing.

795
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
It's nothing?

796
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,080
She came to my room and started talking shit.

797
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,080
She?

798
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,080
Yeah.

799
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
I slept all night.

800
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Please help me sleep.

801
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
Why are you doing this to her?

802
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,080
How long are you going to keep her in the dark?

803
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
She's been talking shit.

804
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,080
I don't understand.

805
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,080
You and I were in the dark.

806
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
I'm out of breath.

807
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,080
Let's take a break until the team leader and I come back.

808
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,080
Hye-young.

809
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,080
I'm so irresponsible.

810
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,080
Why did she come out?

811
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,080
Put it back.

812
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
And wear your mask.

813
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,080
Be careful.

814
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,080
There's no one to take it.

815
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,080
There's a chance that the adoptive family will show up.

816
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
That's why I usually keep it for a month.

817
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
What are these people doing?

818
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
They don't even have the right to be danced.

819
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
I'm not a kid.

820
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Can't you just do your job quietly?

821
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,080
I know.

822
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,080
What's wrong with kids who don't know anything?

823
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,080
If you're a mom, you should do something to prevent them from dying.

824
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,080
What do you know?

825
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,080
What do you know to talk shit?

826
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Everyone has a reason.

827
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Hye-young.

828
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,080
If you have a reason,

829
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,080
is it okay to kill people?

830
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,080
Hey!

831
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,080
Kim Mi-ae!

832
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
Kim Mi-ae.

833
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

834
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,080
Come out. I'll talk to you outside.

835
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
You want to talk now, right?

836
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
Come out!

837
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
Come on, let go.

838
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,080
Come on.

839
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,080
Hey!

840
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,080
What are you doing?

841
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,080
What are you doing?

842
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Hey!

843
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080
What the fuck are you doing?

844
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,080
It doesn't matter.

845
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,080
You're still the same.

846
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,080
But honestly, is she really my kid?

847
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,080
You said it right.

848
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,080
She's not your kid.

849
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,080
She's not your kid.

850
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
She's my kid.

851
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,080
Stop talking shit.

852
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,080
Go and erase it when you say it.

853
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
Or I'll get rid of you right here.

854
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,080
What do you think you are?

855
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,080
Is it funny?

856
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,080
Do I look like a kid?

857
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,080
Hey, honestly, do you think you're qualified?

858
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,080
Do you think you can be a real mom?

859
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,080
Don't touch me, you son of a bitch.

860
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
You idiot.

861
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
You're crazy.

862
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,080
Are you okay?

863
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,080
What the fuck are you doing?

864
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,080
You son of a bitch.

865
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
Hey, mister.

866
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,080
What are you doing there?

867
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,080
See you later.

868
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
Stop right there!

869
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
Stop right there!

870
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,080
Are you okay?

871
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,080
Are you okay?

872
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,080
Yeah.

873
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,080
You son of a bitch.

874
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,080
Are you okay?

875
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
What's wrong?

876
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
What do you mean?

877
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,080
I heard you were being so loud in front of your sister.

878
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,080
I should've made it clear earlier.

879
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
I didn't want to see you.

880
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,080
I'm sure your mother would feel the same way.

881
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
It's like I'm in between you two.

882
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
I know how it feels like

883
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,080
to be taken away from someone else.

884
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,080
I know how it feels like to live without parents.

885
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
Hey.

886
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,080
Do you think it's different because you don't remember?

887
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,080
I heard about you.

888
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,080
Oh.

889
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
It's not that.

890
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,080
What?

891
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
I'm the one who doesn't remember.

892
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,080
It's my mom.

893
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,080
Your mom?

894
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,080
She's alive.

895
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,080
She doesn't remember anything.

896
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
When I was young,

897
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,080
I almost died in your hands.

898
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
She tried to die with me.

899
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,080
She lied on purpose.

900
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,080
It's obvious how much

901
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,080
she felt sorry for me.

902
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,080
That bastard was your dad, right?

903
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
He was a total psycho.

904
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,080
You can't let him get away with it.

905
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
That bastard.

906
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,080
I'm sorry.

907
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

908
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,080
Hey, Kim Min!

909
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
Hey!

910
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
What?

911
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,080
Oh.

912
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,080
Shit.

913
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
I'm dead.

914
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,080
Oh.

915
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
What did I do wrong?

916
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,080
Didn't I?

917
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
I hate being like my mom.

918
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
My misfortune

919
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
is all because of my mom.

920
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
I still can't forgive her.

921
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
What she did.

922
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
Why did you do it?

923
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
Huh?

924
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
Why did you do it?

925
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
I should've died.

926
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
I should've died.

927
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Back then.

928
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Together.

929
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Why did you do it?

930
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,080
Why did you do it? No!

931
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
I should've died.

932
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Oh.

933
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
I'm sorry.

934
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Oh.

935
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,080
Oh.

936
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,080
Hey!

937
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,080
Hey.

938
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,080
Did she leave?

939
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,080
What?

940
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,080
What are you doing?

941
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,080
I'm going to do the laundry.

942
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
I'll do it.

943
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
You're not well.

944
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,080
You want to?

945
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
I'm sorry.

946
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,080
2010.

947
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,080
The Desire.

948
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,080
I'm excited.

949
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,080
I'm excited because I'm at the restaurant.

950
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,080
It's been a while.

951
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,080
I'll go wash my hands before I eat.

952
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
Min.

953
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
What were you thinking about?

954
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Oh.

955
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
About Hae-young.

956
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
Didn't she say she lived in Busan?

957
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
She did. Why?

958
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,080
Excuse me. More side dishes.

959
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,080
Oh.

960
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,080
Oh.

961
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,080
Are you okay?

962
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,080
I'm sorry.

963
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
Auntie!

964
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
Auntie!

965
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,080
Oh.

966
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
I think it's working.

967
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
Oh.

968
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,080
What?

969
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080
You have to lower it.

970
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
What?

971
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,080
Oh!

972
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,080
Hey, you punk!

973
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,080
One, two, three!

974
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,080
Hey.

975
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,080
What are you doing?

976
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,080
Oh.

977
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,080
I don't want to leave the market.

978
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,080
My legs hurt.

979
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,080
Hey.

980
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,080
Give me your phone.

981
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
What? Why?

982
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,080
Hurry up.

983
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,080
Ta-da!

984
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,080
Isn't it pretty?

985
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
Look at this.

986
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,080
Oh.

987
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,080
Huh?

988
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,080
Excuse me.

989
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,080
Oh.

990
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
Oh, my God.

991
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,080
Oh.

992
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,080
Oh.

993
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,080
Oh.

994
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,080
Get in!

995
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,080
Oh.

996
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,080
Oh.

997
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,080
Oh.

998
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,080
Oh.

999
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,080
Oh.

1000
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,080
Pina.

1001
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,080
Oh.

1002
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,080
Oh.

1003
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,080
Oh.

1004
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,080
Oh.

1005
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,080
Oh.

1006
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,080
Oh.

1007
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,080
Oh.

1008
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,080
Oh.

1009
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,080
Oh.

1010
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,080
Oh.

1011
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,080
Oh.

1012
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,080
Oh.

1013
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,080
Oh.

1014
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,080
Oh.

1015
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,080
Oh.

1016
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,080
Oh.

1017
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,080
Oh.

1018
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,080
Oh.

1019
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,080
Hey.

1020
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,080
Park Hae-young.

1021
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,080
Where are you?

1022
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,080
Park Hae-young!

1023
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,080
Where are you?

1024
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,080
Park Hae-young.

1025
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,080
Where are you, Park Hae-young?

1026
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,080
What's this?

1027
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,080
Hey.

1028
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,080
Oh.

1029
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,080
Oh.

1030
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,080
Oh.

1031
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,080
Oh.

1032
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,080
Oh.

1033
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,080
What's wrong?

1034
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,080
What's wrong?

1035
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,080
Huh? Min-ah!

1036
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,080
Oh! Min-ah!

1037
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,080
Oh, my leg!

1038
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,080
Min-ah, my leg!

1039
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,080
Are you okay?

1040
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,080
Oh, my God!

1041
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,080
What's wrong?

1042
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,080
Are you hurt?

1043
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,080
It's 119. 119.

1044
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,080
Oh, my God!

1045
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,080
Oh, my God!

1046
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,080
Oh, my God!

1047
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,080
Oh, my God!

1048
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,080
Oh, my God!

1049
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,080
Oh, my God!

1050
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
Oh, my God!

1051
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,080
What's wrong with your brother?

1052
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,080
It's okay.

1053
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,080
Oh, Min-ah!

1054
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,080
Are you okay?

1055
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,080
Oh, my God!

1056
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,080
I want to talk to you.

1057
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,080
Wait a minute.

1058
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,080
I want to talk to you.

1059
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,080
I'm sorry.

1060
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,080
My dad committed suicide.

1061
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,080
I was so upset that I almost died.

1062
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,080
I'm not trying to brag about it.

1063
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,080
I can't be serious about it.

1064
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,080
I can get rid of it anytime.

1065
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,080
That's what I was going to think.

1066
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,080
I was afraid I'd be abandoned again.

1067
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,080
Wait a minute.

1068
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,080
I'm not your mom.

1069
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,080
I don't deserve that.

1070
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,080
I know how terrible it is

1071
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,080
to suffer alone

1072
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,080
when you have no choice.

1073
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,080
What you said earlier

1074
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,080
is not true.

1075
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,080
I know.

1076
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,080
I believe in you.

1077
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,080
I want you

1078
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,080
to let Haeyoung go.

1079
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,080
I want you to let her go.

1080
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,080
Don't mind me.

1081
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,080
Who is it?

1082
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,080
I'm here to see Park Haeyoung.

1083
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,080
Haeyoung.

1084
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,080
I'm sorry.

1085
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,080
We've met before, haven't we?

1086
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,080
I'm sorry.

1087
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,080
Let go of me!

1088
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,080
We became very close.

1089
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,080
I always said it like this.

1090
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,080
We are three sisters.

1091
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,080
She's my granddaughter.

1092
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,080
Soyeon.

1093
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,080
I treated her here.

1094
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,080
She's not Soyeon. She's Eunjin.

1095
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,080
I'm sorry.

1096
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,080
You guys, help me.

1097
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,080
Kim Soyeon.

1098
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,080
Give me your ID.

1099
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,080
I don't have an ID.

1100
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,080
I'm 27.

1101
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,080
You can't do that.

1102
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,080
Other people just gave me their ID.

1103
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,080
No.

1104
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,080
Team leader.

1105
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,080
I'm here.

1106
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,080
Sit on the sofa.

1107
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,080
I bought a bun.

1108
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,080
How is she?

1109
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,080
She's very good.

1110
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,080
It's cold.

1111
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,080
It's cold?

1112
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,080
Yes, it's very cold outside.

1113
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,080
You can just call her.

1114
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,080
She'll call you when she wakes up.

1115
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,080
Everyone thought it was an accident.

1116
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,080
There was no evidence.

1117
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,080
Tell me where Eunjin is.

1118
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,080
Tell me now!

1119
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,080
Soyeon...

1120
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,080
She's gone.

1121
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,080
Eunjin!

1122
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,080
Eunjin!

1123
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,080
Eunjin!

1124
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,080
Why didn't you come back?

1125
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,080
Grandma accepted me.

1126
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,080
She felt responsible for her death.

1127
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,080
I called everyone

1128
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,080
who was here.

1129
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,080
But how come

1130
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,080
they all said they didn't have their numbers?

1131
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,080
The only ones that were there were different places.

1132
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,080
Oh.

1133
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,080
Really?

1134
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,080
Did they all change?

1135
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,080
I looked it up on the internet.

1136
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,080
They all don't have their numbers.

1137
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,080
That's weird.

1138
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,080
Oh, I think it's ruined.

1139
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,080
The situation is bad these days.

1140
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,080
You said you'd call

1141
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,080
the head of the department.

1142
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,080
Can I call him now?

1143
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,080
Can I call him now?

1144
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,080
I just came to introduce you.

1145
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,080
But why is it important now?

1146
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,080
You knew

1147
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,080
what he said, right?

1148
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,080
Eunjin...

1149
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,080
There's more.

1150
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,080
This isn't all.

1151
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,080
It's CCTV.

1152
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,080
What are you doing?

1153
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,080
What are you doing?

1154
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,080
Hey.

1155
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,080
Hey.

1156
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,080
What am I doing?

1157
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,080
Grandma, you have to stop it now.

1158
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,080
Stop it.

1159
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,080
You're his grandmother.

1160
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,080
Don't look.

1161
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,080
How many more people will get hurt in the future?

1162
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,080
Excuse me.

1163
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,080
Yes.

1164
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,080
She's not a person.

1165
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,080
She's a devil.

1166
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,080
She's a devil.

1167
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,080
Yes, it's 111.

1168
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,080
Hello?

1169
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,080
Oh, yes.

1170
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,080
I'm sorry. I put it in the wrong place.

1171
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,080
You didn't have anything to do, did you?

1172
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,080
Yes, I put it in my pocket and it must have been pressed.

1173
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,080
Yes, I understand.

1174
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,080
Yes, I'm sorry.

1175
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,080
Oh, shit.

1176
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,080
You son of a bitch.

1177
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,080
Choi Youngkyung was born.

1178
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,080
What?

1179
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,080
Born?

1180
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,080
Yes.

1181
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,080
I'm sorry.

1182
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,080
Did you take my cell phone?

1183
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Aunt.

1184
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,080
Do you know that?

1185
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,080
I really liked you.

1186
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,080
Hey, Hyeyeong.

1187
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,080
Let's stop the car.

1188
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,080
Let's stop the car and talk.

1189
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,080
Do you remember the restaurant we went to before?

1190
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,080
The meat was really good.

1191
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,080
I wonder if it was too late now.

1192
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,080
Don't worry.

1193
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,080
It's going to be okay.

1194
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,080
Aunt.

1195
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,080
Aunt.

1196
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,080
Aunt.

1197
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,080
Oh, my God.

1198
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,080
Where's your aunt?

1199
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,080
I told you.

1200
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,080
Stay still.

1201
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,080
What's all this for?

1202
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,080
I want to finish it quickly.

1203
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,080
I'm really tired.

1204
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,080
Kim Soyeon.

1205
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,080
It's really your name, right?

1206
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,080
I met your grandmother.

1207
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,080
You're sick.

1208
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,080
You're amazing.

1209
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,080
I'll compliment you.

1210
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,080
But the crazy thing is not me.

1211
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,080
It's that grandmother.

1212
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,080
I'll help you.

1213
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,080
So stop it.

1214
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,080
You?

1215
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,080
What are you going to do?

1216
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,080
I'm going to kill you.

1217
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,080
What are you going to do?

1218
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,080
I was scared of my mother.

1219
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,080
I told her to kill me.

1220
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,080
She's a little kid.

1221
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,080
You know.

1222
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,080
You're a little trash.

1223
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,080
You're a little trash.

1224
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,080
No.

1225
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,080
No.

1226
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,080
No.

1227
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,080
No.

1228
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,080
No.

1229
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,080
No, no.

1230
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,080
No.

1231
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,080
No, no.

1232
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,080
No.

1233
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,080
No.

1234
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,080
No.

1235
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,080
No.

1236
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,080
No.

1237
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,080
No, no.

1238
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,080
No.

1239
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,080
No.

1240
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,080
No.

1241
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,080
No.

1242
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,080
People found out about it.

1243
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,080
You were the one who was shaking.

1244
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,080
Yeah, I'm gonna kill you.

1245
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,080
Oh, Kim Ji-won!

1246
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,080
That's your story.

1247
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,080
You're the one who killed your mom.

1248
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,080
I'm different from you.

1249
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,080
Do you feel better now?

1250
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,080
Killing someone who doesn't deserve love.

1251
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,080
You crazy bitch.

1252
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,080
That's why you're alone forever.

1253
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,080
Then we'll all die.

1254
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,080
I feel so bad, too.

1255
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,080
Let's stop now.

1256
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,080
Hey.

1257
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,080
See?

1258
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,080
You're the same as me.

1259
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,080
I shouldn't have been born like you.

1260
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,080
Why can't you be honest?

1261
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,080
Do you want me to make you suffer more?

1262
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,080
Kill me!

1263
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,080
Kill me!

1264
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:45,080
You can't have everything anyway.

1265
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,080
Poke me!

1266
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,080
Poke me!

1267
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,080
I'm gonna kill you.

1268
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,080
I'm gonna kill you.

1269
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,080
Yeah.

1270
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,080
You'll be unhappy if you're born like her.

1271
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,080
You don't deserve it either.

1272
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,080
Let's just burn it all up here.

1273
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,080
Wait!

1274
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,080
Stop!

1275
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,080
Stop!

1276
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,080
Stop!

1277
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,080
Stop!

1278
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,080
Stop it.

1279
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,080
Stop!

1280
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,080
Stop.

1281
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,080
It's okay now.

1282
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,080
It's okay.

1283
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:31,080
It's okay.

1284
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,080
It's okay.

1285
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,080
It's okay.

1286
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,080
It's okay.

1287
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,080
It's okay.

1288
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,080
Why?

1289
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,080
Are you trying to get mad again?

1290
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,080
I won't do it again.

1291
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,080
You can do better next time.

1292
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,080
No.

1293
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,080
Good job.

1294
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,080
Good job.

1295
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,080
I tried to be nice to you.

1296
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
You know I'm not normal.

1297
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,080
Yeah.

1298
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,080
How is it there?

1299
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,080
I'm here.

1300
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,080
It's warm.

1301
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,080
It's quiet.

1302
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,080
Is it hell?

1303
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,080
It's weird.

1304
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,080
There's no hell, Soyeon.

1305
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:30,080
It's just dark and quiet.

1306
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,080
Do you want to come with me?

1307
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,080
Are you sure?

1308
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,080
Yes.

1309
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:57,080
It's not going to hurt you.

1310
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,080
No.

1311
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,080
I like pain.

1312
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,080
Soyeon.

1313
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:21,080
People are honest when they feel pain.

1314
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,080
It makes me feel comfortable.

1315
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,080
Soyeon.

1316
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,080
I think I'm alive.

1317
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,080
I'm going to hell.

1318
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,080
I'm going to hell.

1319
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,080
I'm going to hell.

1320
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,080
I'm going to hell.

1321
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,080
I'm going to hell.

1322
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,080
I'm going to hell.

1323
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,080
I'm going to hell.

1324
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,080
