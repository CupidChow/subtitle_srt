1
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,760
(The hardest work they had done so far,)

2
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,001
(raking 28t of water laver ended.)

3
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,630
(But they couldn't escape the purgatory of laver.)

4
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,000
(Drying...)

5
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,240
(the Water Laver...)

6
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,870
(Project)

7
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,671
(Gosh, this is the purgatory of laver.)

8
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,241
(Someone should stop us.)

9
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:50,581
(They scooped out water laver in a mold.)

10
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,710
(Then it got dried...)

11
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,111
(to create the Fresh off the Sea's dried laver.)

12
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,520
(Did a problem occur?)

13
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,321
(Soft)

14
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,090
(I refuse to do more work on the laver.)

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,890
(Say goodbye to the laver.)

16
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:04,931
(Say hello to the oysters.)

17
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:08,260
(With the oysters,)

18
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:11,571
(guests came.)

19
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,241
(Kim Jae Hwa and Yoon Kyung Ho)

20
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,370
(Today's mission:)

21
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,471
(Disguise yourself as a staff member and fool the four siblings!)

22
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,411
(They came up with a grand scheme to fool the four siblings.)

23
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,881
(Yoon Kyung Ho as a camera director)

24
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,581
(Kim Jae Hwa as an audio director)

25
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,281
(The four siblings as victims)

26
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,991
(All preparations were over.)

27
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,421
(As they came closer, the guests felt nervous.)

28
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,460
(Kyung Ho's hidden camera prank seemed to be successful.)

29
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,491
(Hey!)

30
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:41,531
(Yoo Rim)

31
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:45,831
(Kyung Ho got caught right away.)

32
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,200
It's nice to meet you.

33
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,901
(Jae Hwa, please take care of the rest.)

34
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,571
(Then it's my turn.)

35
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:53,470
(Pretending to check the audio device,)

36
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:54,710
(she approached Jung Ah.)

37
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,610
(The audio director was clumsy.)

38
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,481
(What? What is it?)

39
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:03,321
(Hugging)

40
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,550
(Tell them that I'm someone you know.)

41
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,321
(I met someone I know!)

42
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,420
(To the confused members,)

43
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,391
(Jae Hwa revealed herself.)

44
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:13,431
(They didn't think that there would be a second guest.)

45
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,601
(Moved)

46
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,301
(The unexpected guests...)

47
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,501
(turned the port tearful.)

48
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,041
(Why are you guys crying?)

49
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,740
(With the dependable guests, Jae Hwa and Kyung Ho,)

50
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:28,040
(they set off to pick oysters.)

51
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,141
- How is it done?
- I know. It's fascinating.

52
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,211
(Their attention is focused.)

53
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,150
(What?)

54
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,551
(Exclaiming)

55
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,491
(Their first encounter with the oysters is extraordinary.)

56
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,790
(From the depth of the sea, they slowly show themselves.)

57
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,161
(A bed of oysters weighs 150kg.)

58
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,631
- There are so many!
- No way!

59
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,331
- Hold on.
- You can harvest them now.

60
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,200
Hold on.

61
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,270
(They're surprised by the sheer size.)

62
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:57,401
- Are these oysters?
- It's so fascinating.

63
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,471
There are so many.

64
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,441
- How did they know to stick here?
- Seriously.

65
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,211
Is this how you harvest oysters?

66
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,751
Seriously.

67
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,251
We lift them up.

68
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,681
- The weight...
- They're heavy, right?

69
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:11,691
Hold on. I think they'll drop.

70
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,520
- Hey, this is...
- Pull them up.

71
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,521
(It's hard to pull them up since the oysters are so heavy.)

72
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,390
- I'll cut the rope.
- Hold on. Let me put them down.

73
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,391
Put them down.

74
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:20,690
Then I cut the rope.

75
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:21,861
(Ji Yeon cuts the rope to separate the oysters.)

76
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,230
Hold on.

77
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,301
(My goodness)

78
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,031
(Struggling)

79
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,001
How are there so many oysters?

80
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,071
(He's flustered by the amount and weight of the oysters.)

81
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,311
All right. Cut the top.

82
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,510
(Cutting the rope isn't easy.)

83
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,711
(Cutting)

84
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,381
(When the youngest members cut the rope and move the oysters,)

85
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:47,221
(Jae Hwa washes off the mud.)

86
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,191
- Lift them up.
- This is...

87
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,130
Gosh, it must be heavy.

88
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,131
(Worried)

89
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,661
(Oh, my)

90
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,861
(Jae Wook seems to be struggling a lot.)

91
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,871
Is that all?

92
00:03:58,872 --> 00:03:59,931
Your back must hurt.

93
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:04,510
(He needs to bend over more because of his tall height.)

94
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,111
(The heavy weight is a bonus.)

95
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,480
Pull up the bottom part.

96
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,741
(Pulling up one line of oysters takes a long time.)

97
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,081
Hold on.

98
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,881
My back hurts so much.

99
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,551
Captain, the oysters are very heavy.

100
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,891
Yes, they're very heavy.

101
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,161
I can't believe the oysters we eat go through this process.

102
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,430
- Jae Hwa, we always say that.
- Right.

103
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,960
"I can't believe the food we eat goes through this process."

104
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,301
We said that about laver yesterday.

105
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,870
Seriously. We should eat everything with gratitude.

106
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,371
Seriously. It's true.

107
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,671
All right.

108
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,280
I'll rinse you guys cleanly.

109
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,781
(I'll rinse you guys cleanly.)

110
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,751
(Meanwhile, the youngest member, Jae Wook)

111
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:49,850
Hey, your back.

112
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:50,881
Hold on.

113
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,651
(Here comes the pulley.)

114
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,620
(Ji Yeon helps him.)

115
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:59,261
(My goodness)

116
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,560
(He works hard with his veins popping out.)

117
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,531
(The next target)

118
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,931
I'm nervous about this one.

119
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,501
Ji Yeon, you shouldn't cut it horizontally.

120
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,671
- It's easier to do it diagonally.
- Like this?

121
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,041
I'll try it.

122
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,211
(One shot)

123
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,011
(Meanwhile, the human pulley keeps working.)

124
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:21,381
Be careful.

125
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,151
I caught it.

126
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,291
(Shouting)

127
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,461
- Gosh, it goes all the way down.
- Move.

128
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,360
(They pull and pull, but there's no end to the rope.)

129
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,061
(Heave-ho!)

130
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,601
(Groaning)

131
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,870
(The groan comes from the depth of his body.)

132
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,171
It's so long.

133
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:44,471
(They also need to cut the main rope that connects other ropes.)

134
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,680
I can switch places with someone.

135
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,981
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

136
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,480
Hold on.

137
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,911
(Although they refused her help)

138
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,481
I'm...

139
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,721
I'm too scared to pull them up.

140
00:05:58,721 --> 00:05:59,721
(Coughing)

141
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:00,951
Your back hurts, right?

142
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,291
Jae Hwa, it's okay.

143
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,291
I'm serious. I'm switching places with you.

144
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,561
Switch places with me, Ji Yeon.

145
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,560
It'll be hard, Jae Hwa.

146
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:09,900
- It's okay.
- It's heavy.

147
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,031
(The younger ones are worried about Jae Hwa.)

148
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,301
Jae Hwa.

149
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,401
This isn't an easy task.

150
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,470
- Exactly. It's very hard.
- It's very hard.

151
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,600
- This work is...
- Shall I do this?

152
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,271
hard on the back, right?

153
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,941
It really is. I'll switch places with you in no time.

154
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,310
- Jae Hwa, can you cut the rope?
- Yes.

155
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,021
(The next 150kg bed of oysters comes up.)

156
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,220
Jae Hwa.

157
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,221
(Jae Hwa secures the oysters with a rope.)

158
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,250
Judging from the back,

159
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,920
- the work really suits you.
- Really?

160
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,561
- Jae Hwa, good luck.
- Okay.

161
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,091
- Just one side, right?
- Yes.

162
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,660
- Hold this.
- All right.

163
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,201
(It isn't just her back that makes her a professional.)

164
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,630
(Cutting in one go)

165
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,631
- Jae Hwa, nice.
- Nice.

166
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,771
Nice.

167
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,041
Gosh, the way you hold the sickle...

168
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,281
You know,

169
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,610
you can cut it easily when the rope is tight.

170
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,910
- I'll lift it up.
- Okay.

171
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,080
(I want to hire her.)

172
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,921
(This time, she holds the oysters by herself.)

173
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,350
(Cutting)

174
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:05,490
She's really good.

175
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,151
She cuts them so quickly.

176
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,061
(The professional worker doesn't need two tries.)

177
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:13,390
(She can cut with one swing of the sickle.)

178
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,501
(Even when a spot is hard to reach)

179
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:16,960
(Cutting)

180
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,801
(Jae Hwa becomes proficient in harvesting oysters.)

181
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,170
Heave-ho.

182
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,601
(Splashing)

183
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,400
Heave-ho.

184
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,471
(She transforms into a real fisherwoman.)

185
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,941
Jae Hwa's work is no joke.

186
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,081
What?

187
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,580
- You're the best.
- I like being good at work.

188
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,481
(I like being good at work.)

189
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,090
(Jae Hwa isn't only good at work.)

190
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,251
Will you be able to untie it?

191
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,320
- This is tricky. Hold on.
- Jae Hwa.

192
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,491
Your hat!

193
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,131
(Catching)

194
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,731
(Meanwhile, the big sisters' boat)

195
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,570
(The captain rinses an oyster cleanly.)

196
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,241
This is a top-grade oyster.

197
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,440
- This one. Yes.
- It looks nice.

198
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,771
- It's as big as the palm.
- Yes.

199
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,681
It's one year old.

200
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,741
- I see.
- It has been farmed for a year.

201
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,550
I'll open it.

202
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,081
(Curious)

203
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,780
- That's how you shuck it easily.
- Yes.

204
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,181
(He shucks an oyster that has just been rinsed.)

205
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,391
(Oh, my)

206
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,361
(Salivating)

207
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,431
To this, you sprinkle a bit of lemon juice.

208
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,001
Then you can eat it.

209
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,930
- A bit of lemon juice.
- Yes.

210
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:26,931
(The expectations make his tongue come out.)

211
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,271
Then you can eat it.

212
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,940
It goes down easily.

213
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,511
(It goes into the captain's mouth!)

214
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,711
- Is it good?
- It's tasty.

215
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,710
- It's tasty.
- He's a true fisherman.

216
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:39,910
I know.

217
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,950
- Will you eat it by yourself?
- He's a manly man.

218
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,280
I thought that you'd give us one.

219
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,950
You didn't say anything.

220
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,651
I was watching you.

221
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,791
(Kyung Ho finally gets a chance to taste an oyster.)

222
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,291
- I'll pick it up.
- Shake off the salty water...

223
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,261
like this.

224
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,131
You ate it too fast.

225
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,930
It's good, right?

226
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:02,441
(He rinses his mouth with seawater!)

227
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:03,941
(Impressed)

228
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,011
- Is it tasty?
- Is it definitely tasty?

229
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:07,871
It's very tasty.

230
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,881
(It's because you rinsed your mouth with seawater.)

231
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,311
It's tasty.

232
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,750
- It's sweet.
- Sweet?

233
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:14,781
Yes.

234
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,381
We say that it's sweet.

235
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,021
Why does he say that it's sweet when it's salty?

236
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,990
- Gosh.
- We say that it's sweet.

237
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,691
It's tasty. It's really tasty.

238
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,990
The aftertaste is sweet.

239
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,890
(Kyung Ho fools his taste buds.)

240
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,561
It isn't fishy at all. It's sweet.

241
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,031
- Hey.
- Okay.

242
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:31,900
(Kyung Ho and Jung Ah resume working on the 150kg oyster bed.)

243
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,071
- Did you lift it up?
- Yes.

244
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,671
(Staggering)

245
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,001
My goodness.

246
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,371
You're fighting against the oysters with desperation.

247
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,340
(Heave-ho!)

248
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:41,841
Let's go.

249
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:44,951
Be careful.

250
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,581
Oh, my.

251
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:49,620
(The weight of the oysters is too much for the paper doll.)

252
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,320
We're working so hard.

253
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,291
- What?
- We're working so hard.

254
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,791
- We just need to keep going.
- Yes.

255
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,061
You're doing well after one demonstration.

256
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:02,801
As for me,

257
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,301
- I've worked at sea many times.
- It looks that way.

258
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,871
(She resumes swinging the sickle as soon as she finishes talking.)

259
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:10,941
Like this.

260
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,111
There you go. Cut it without hesitation.

261
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,441
Lift it up.

262
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,341
- Lift it up.
- It's so long.

263
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:18,881
Lift it up.

264
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:20,880
Pull.

265
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,581
(He lifts it up with all his might.)

266
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,660
Pull.

267
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,191
(The paper doll wraps it up!)

268
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,331
(The oysters are scattered everywhere.)

269
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,801
(Leader Yum picks them up one at a time.)

270
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,240
There you go.

271
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,441
(Kyung Ho takes care of the heavy bundle of oysters.)

272
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,341
Good. Leave it there.

273
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,781
Jung Ah, I think I have a talent in sprinkling water.

274
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,151
(Laughing)

275
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,051
(She rinses the mud off the oysters.)

276
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:00,791
(A firefighter of the sea)

277
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,261
(Fresh members continue...)

278
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,261
(getting the beds of oysters.)

279
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,901
(Bring it on!)

280
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,200
- Are you set?
- Yes.

281
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,270
(The big sisters' boat gives the work the last spurt.)

282
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,370
- Let's go.
- Lift it up.

283
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,871
Let's go.

284
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,111
(The oysters roll around.)

285
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:25,581
(They gather the stray oysters on the floor.)

286
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,151
(They get a pile of oysters that weighs 450kg.)

287
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:32,691
- Your back must hurt.
- It's okay.

288
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,620
- Mak Sim, let's go.
- Let's go.

289
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:37,161
- Mak Sim.
- Put them on here.

290
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,961
- Nice.
- There you go.

291
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,861
(Laughing)

292
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,530
What? Are you reminded of the old days?

293
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:46,701
Yes.

294
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,440
- My goodness.
- Mak Sim.

295
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,540
(While Goo Deok and Mak Sim are absorbed in memories)

296
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,001
My Mak Sim.

297
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,941
We'll be nearly done after this bunch.

298
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,581
(They're nearly done harvesting 450kg of oysters.)

299
00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:59,881
Okay.

300
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,181
- Are you done?
- Yes.

301
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,951
(She adds the last oysters to the pile.)

302
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,420
Seriously.

303
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,991
(In 2 hours, they harvested 450kg of oysters.)

304
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:13,130
This is insane.

305
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,061
- I feel so proud.
- You feel proud, right?

306
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,601
We got a mountain of oysters.

307
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,900
(They celebrate hiking a mountain of oysters.)

308
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:23,370
- Where should I put it?
- Here.

309
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,600
- Now, - Yes?

310
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,571
you guys worked very diligently today.

311
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,180
I also run a fishery.

312
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,951
Let's go and see if there are fish.

313
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,450
- Fish?
- I see.

314
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,481
(They decide to go and check the captain's fishery.)

315
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,780
(The big sisters' boat sets off to the fishery.)

316
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:40,150
- So, Kyung Ho, - Yes?

317
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,590
what do you like the most?

318
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,991
- Are we talking about food?
- Yes.

319
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:45,161
I like gochujang jjigae,

320
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,091
kimchi jjigae, and doenjang jjigae.

321
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:48,500
- You like Korean food.
- You totally like Korean food.

322
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,701
I totally like Korean food.

323
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,971
We're planning to make oyster rice soup today.

324
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:53,670
I'll make it spicy.

325
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,671
Gosh, Jung Ah. I'd love that.

326
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:00,071
(They arrive at the captain's fishery.)

327
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:05,411
The oyster the captain shucked earlier...

328
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,050
It tasted salty back then.

329
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,180
- But the taste remains...
- Is it in your mouth?

330
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,251
Yes. It's tasty.

331
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,121
- The taste?
- Yes. It's tasty.

332
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,951
- Does it remain in your mouth?
- Yes, it does.

333
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,591
What did you say?

334
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,620
- First of all...
- He keeps thinking about oysters.

335
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:18,690
- It was so good.
- The oyster he had earlier.

336
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,761
- Is that so?
- Yes.

337
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,161
That's a brilliant idea.

338
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:25,870
- Okay.
- I'm like a fisherman now.

339
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,030
Of course, you're doing great.

340
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,801
- Good job.
- Oh, my.

341
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,671
Did you call the Dragon King before coming here today?

342
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,610
- I sent a text message.
- Well done.

343
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:37,641
Yes.

344
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:40,651
There might be fish, or there might not be.

345
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,181
Let's just have faith.

346
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,491
I wonder what we have caught.

347
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,691
The fish won't come because of the seaweed.

348
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,490
There's just so much seaweed.

349
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,591
(The seaweed is blocking the entrance of the net.)

350
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,801
(Are there no fish?)

351
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,231
- Should we pull it up?
- Yes.

352
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:00,471
- We have to do it together.
- Let's do it together.

353
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,001
Gosh, what is this?

354
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,470
It looks like something heavy is coming up.

355
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,471
- What?
- Yes?

356
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:09,781
There it is.

357
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:13,881
One, two. One, two.

358
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,021
- Okay. One, two.
- Oh, my.

359
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:17,820
What is it?

360
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,521
- One, two.
- Gosh.

361
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,561
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

362
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:24,960
- What is all this?
- This is amazing.

363
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,730
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. What's going on?

364
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:29,130
Is it really this big? What is this?

365
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:30,930
- It's black sea bream.
- So this is black sea bream.

366
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,001
- Black sea bream.
- Gosh.

367
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,801
They got stuck in here.

368
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,901
- There.
- Okay.

369
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,541
(Fishing season is from October to March.)

370
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,180
I told you that I sent a text message before coming.

371
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,181
- You did?
- Yes.

372
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,481
- This is unbelievable.
- That explains it.

373
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,650
We caught a lot, right?

374
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,280
Yes, this is not bad.

375
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,551
- Congratulations.
- Thanks to you.

376
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,891
- This is about good fishing luck.
- What are we congratulating?

377
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,491
- Here, try holding this.
- Right here?

378
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,761
(There's as much seaweed as there are black sea bream.)

379
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,390
Can we eat this seaweed as it is?

380
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,391
Of course, you can.

381
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:03,161
Then could you give us some seaweed?

382
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,700
- This seaweed?
- Yes.

383
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,701
Of course.

384
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,800
That's great.

385
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,640
I'm going to add seaweed to my oyster rice soup.

386
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,141
- Is that so?
- Yes.

387
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,370
- This is absolutely amazing.
- It really is.

388
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,381
- How big is this catch?
- I would say a solid 50cm.

389
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,710
Should I try lifting it up?

390
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:19,711
Go ahead.

391
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,381
- I can't even hold it, though.
- Don't let it go.

392
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,381
- Can you handle it?
- When would you ever hold it again?

393
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,020
That's it. Don't grab the tail.

394
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,920
(The cover model of the March issue of "Monthly Fishing")

395
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,591
People might think you caught it yourself.

396
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:32,691
Gosh.

397
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:35,900
I feel great, too.

398
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,100
It would be awkward if you came all the way here and there was nothing.

399
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,231
(The captain is pleased with a full catch.)

400
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,771
If you work hard today, I'll get you the biggest fish.

401
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,141
Really?

402
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,410
Do you mean the 50cm one?

403
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,611
(This is a black sea bream feast.)

404
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,541
It has been a while since I've seen a fish that big, too.

405
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,251
- Oh, my.
- I feel great.

406
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,581
It really feels good.

407
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,791
(It's even more fun with the Fresh members together.)

408
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:06,390
(But this wasn't the end.)

409
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:08,531
(Meanwhile, the younger members' boat returned to the port first.)

410
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,701
- There.
- Gosh, nice.

411
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,071
How are we supposed to move this? Is it over here?

412
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,182
- There.
- Gosh, nice.

413
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,622
How are we supposed to move this? Is it over here?

414
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:21,282
With this?

415
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,322
(Is that the one?)

416
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:28,362
(If you've harvested oysters,)

417
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:33,161
(you have to move them,)

418
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,602
(separate them,)

419
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,812
(and shuck them.)

420
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:46,612
(A crane moves toward the pile of oysters.)

421
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,751
(Holding)

422
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,312
All right, Ji Yeon. You go in first.

423
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,122
Put this in here first.

424
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,782
Okay.

425
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:56,422
All right. Lift it up.

426
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:01,292
(A 450kg pile of oysters is being hauled ashore.)

427
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,692
(Impressed)

428
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,032
It's absolutely massive.

429
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:09,972
- Look at this.
- We caught this ourselves.

430
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,402
(Feeling proud)

431
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,742
(Once the 450kg of oysters is moved ashore by crane...)

432
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:18,842
Lower it down.

433
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:21,412
(Clattering down)

434
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:27,422
(The oysters are pouring out.)

435
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,791
- You're moving the scallops?
- Yes.

436
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,452
(It's time to separate the clumped oysters.)

437
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,132
(Tapping the clump of oysters with a hammer)

438
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,561
(Making the oysters pop right off)

439
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:42,601
Hitting the scallop makes the others fall off.

440
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:43,602
Right.

441
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,841
Okay, this is the scallop. You are not damaged, right?

442
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:51,511
Then hit the scallop here.

443
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,082
(Oysters are popping right off.)

444
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:56,882
(While the younger members are busy separating the oysters...)

445
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,022
They're working on it over there.

446
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:00,122
- You're here.
- You got a lot of oysters?

447
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,992
- You're back already?
- Yes.

448
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:05,492
We're a bit late because we went to catch some fish, too.

449
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:08,191
A black sea bream. It's this big.

450
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,292
- Really?
- Hey.

451
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:10,562
We got a black sea bream...

452
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:11,931
(You are the best.)

453
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,002
Thank you.

454
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,202
(Kyung Ho joins in on the oyster separation.)

455
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,972
You have to crack it just right between here.

456
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,472
Okay.

457
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:22,871
(Tapping lightly)

458
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:24,642
(Tapping firmly)

459
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:27,942
(All the members gather, cracking oysters together.)

460
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,352
Now we've got to start shucking some oysters.

461
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:31,582
Do we have to shuck oysters?

462
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:33,082
That's the only way to eat them.

463
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:34,482
(This is the right answer to the wrong question.)

464
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,522
Okay, so this...

465
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:38,922
(The final step is shucking the oysters.)

466
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:39,962
(Sliding the knife into the gap in the shell)

467
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,291
- Stick this into the hole.
- Yes.

468
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,162
You have to twist the knife in.

469
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,061
- Lift it gently like this.
- Just lift it up...

470
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,802
Just gently scrape off this part.

471
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:53,441
And then we put it in here. Okay.

472
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,672
(Oyster shucking begins.)

473
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:58,441
Oh, my. I can't find the spot. How am I supposed to...

474
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,442
I really can't find it.

475
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:01,112
It's hard to find the gap.

476
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:04,351
- I'm really...
- Finding the hole is really tough.

477
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,421
(Struggling)

478
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:06,882
How are you supposed to find this?

479
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:09,322
- Did you find it?
- This is not easy.

480
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:12,092
Gosh. It just won't open.

481
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,462
It's not easy at all.

482
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,932
It feels like solving a math problem on the college entrance exam.

483
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,591
There are too many tough ones.

484
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,731
(Even for seasoned worker Jae Hwa, shucking oysters is tough.)

485
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,502
It's really not working.

486
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:25,501
(Thinking hard)

487
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:27,242
This is tough.

488
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:29,711
(There's no space for the knife to go in.)

489
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,542
If you were good at this, it could be really fun.

490
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:34,611
(Struggling)

491
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:35,952
I can't really see it.

492
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,512
Thank you.

493
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:42,022
- Is it working?
- Yes.

494
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:45,721
(Strength Ji Yeon opens it with a strong grip and no knife.)

495
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:46,762
I did it.

496
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,932
(This is an oyster strength show.)

497
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,961
(The first oyster is opened with great effort.)

498
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:55,262
- It's big.
- It's a giant oyster.

499
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:57,732
(Feeling proud)

500
00:19:58,502 --> 00:19:59,572
Now I got it.

501
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:01,842
Now I understand.

502
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:05,341
When it opens up this much,

503
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,941
- just give it a slight twist here.
- That's right.

504
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,641
Then scrape it off like this.

505
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:09,712
(Sliding the knife into the gap and giving it a slight twist)

506
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:13,121
If you do it like this, it slips right through here.

507
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,252
So that's how it opens.

508
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:19,321
When the gap opens just a little, cut it there.

509
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:22,092
Then it loosens up.

510
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,492
Finding the hole is...

511
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,402
- Finding the hole is no easy task.
- You're right. It's not easy.

512
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:30,501
(The hole?)

513
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:33,302
Specializing in proctological surgery helps.

514
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:35,202
(Feeling awkward)

515
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:39,582
It's my specialty. It's easy for me.

516
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,882
- Doctor.
- Yes?

517
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:43,982
If you have any issues down there, come see me.

518
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:46,382
(Laughing)

519
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,421
When you crack one of these open...

520
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,022
(Kyung Ho's advice helps everyone get better at shucking oysters.)

521
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:54,561
(Jae Wook's palm-sized oyster)

522
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:56,192
I want to grill and eat it like this.

523
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,092
Like this...

524
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,431
So we put it here. Okay.

525
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,432
(Jung Ah has got the hang of shucking oysters, too.)

526
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:05,102
(While everyone is getting the hang of it...)

527
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:09,011
(Jun Myun's oyster basket is still empty.)

528
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:10,641
When will I finish shucking at this rate?

529
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:11,642
(Jun Myun is making slow progress.)

530
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:12,781
Where is this hole?

531
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:15,111
Exactly. That's the hardest part, isn't it?

532
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,112
Yes.

533
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:17,952
(Being mindful)

534
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,821
- Seriously...
- There's no hole.

535
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:20,822
Right.

536
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,522
(Struggling)

537
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,452
Even if the entrance is cracked,

538
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:28,592
if you keep working the knife around, it seems to go in.

539
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:30,591
- You're just stabbing first?
- Yes, just stabbing first.

540
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:31,592
Okay.

541
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,502
- Hold it firmly like this.
- Right.

542
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,632
- There's a hole here.
- Yes.

543
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,972
- Good job.
- Twist it.

544
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:40,371
Bring it more.

545
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,872
(Working hard)

546
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,011
(Opening it)

547
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,581
I shucked it nicely for the first time.

548
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:48,582
It looks great.

549
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,212
(This is the first perfectly shucked oyster.)

550
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,951
- You can do it.
- Let's make some oyster jeon.

551
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:52,952
- Right?
- Yes.

552
00:21:57,052 --> 00:21:58,452
(Clenching teeth)

553
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,561
(Opening the shell)

554
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:01,962
(Revealing the pearly white flesh)

555
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,872
(Am I shucking the oyster,)

556
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:11,371
(or is the oyster shucking me?)

557
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,372
Really?

558
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,671
(Endlessly shucking oysters)

559
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,672
This reminds me of the song "Island Baby."

560
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:23,451
(When mother goes oyster picking)

561
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:27,681
(In the shaded area of the island)

562
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:28,992
Why do we sound so sad?

563
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,721
This song is actually scary.

564
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:32,621
(A scary song?)

565
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,061
- The baby is left alone.
- Yes, this song is very scary.

566
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,162
It's horrific.

567
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:38,832
Whose arm did the baby fall asleep on?

568
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,771
The mother went to work. Who does the arm belong to?

569
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,001
- It's scary.
- That's scary.

570
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,202
(The song's lyrics are so scary.)

571
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,472
The baby's own arm.

572
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:51,371
(The mention of an arm changed the song's genre.)

573
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,412
Jung Ah.

574
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,812
(Jung Ah...)

575
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,312
We should change the lyrics.

576
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:59,781
(Laying on its own arm)

577
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:03,222
(It gently)

578
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:07,821
(Falls asleep)

579
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,632
- I can't get over the lyrics.
- It's a sad song.

580
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:11,791
- This is...
- Another load of oysters for you.

581
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,962
(Extra oysters are brought to them.)

582
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,772
Goodness, you get to do more work.

583
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,372
- More?
- I forgot to bring these earlier.

584
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:21,041
(And another box of oysters)

585
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,202
Thank you.

586
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,782
(Oysters fall out of the box.)

587
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,821
We have an announcement to make while you're working.

588
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:36,251
You harvested oysters out on the boat.

589
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:38,052
For that you will be paid a fixed amount.

590
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:41,261
But on top of that, depending on the amount of oysters you shuck,

591
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:43,491
you'll be provided a special bonus.

592
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:44,792
- Goodness.
- We'll have to shuck a lot.

593
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,301
Per 500g of oysters,

594
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,471
you'll be paid 10 dollars.

595
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,802
- Really?
- Yes.

596
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,602
Did you say 500g of oysters?

597
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:55,501
- That's half a kilo.
- Then, 500g of oysters...

598
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:56,872
Are these 100g?

599
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,372
I don't think they'll even be 100g.

600
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:01,112
All the oysters we managed to shuck might add up to just 500g.

601
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,812
- We do need extra money.
- Right.

602
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:08,422
They want to go zip-lining...

603
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,652
or Jimmy Jibbing, or whatever it's called.

604
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:12,891
- What?
- She said "Jimmy Jibbing."

605
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:14,762
- They want to do that.
- You want to get on the Jimmy Jib?

606
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:15,962
You want to get on the Jimmy Jib?

607
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:18,291
(The two youngest members want to go zip-lining.)

608
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,461
They want to do that.

609
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:22,102
- But it's 18 dollars per person.
- It costs 18 dollars.

610
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:26,201
We might only be able to afford tickets for the two of them.

611
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:27,341
(That's why they have to make as much money as possible.)

612
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,211
To go zip-lining, it's 18 dollars per person.

613
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,942
Someone do the math, please.

614
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:37,782
(Avoiding eye contact)

615
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,122
(Silence)

616
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,922
(The silence speaks volumes.)

617
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:44,952
(Embarrassed)

618
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:46,421
(No one is saying anything.)

619
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:47,521
I'll do it on my phone.

620
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:50,632
It's 18 dollars times... How many of us are we? Are we 6?

621
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:51,891
(The answer: 18 dollars per person times 6 Fresh members...)

622
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,561
(equals 108 dollars)

623
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:56,501
- Eight times six equals...
- It's forty-eight.

624
00:24:56,502 --> 00:24:58,531
Move the four.

625
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:00,541
- Eight times six?
- And one times eight equals eight.

626
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:04,672
Wait, 1 times 8 equals 8. So it's 120 dollars.

627
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,012
No. You said we were six people.

628
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:09,051
- Yes, there are 6 of us.
- It's 18 dollars.

629
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,381
- And six people.
- I can't do math in my head.

630
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:13,452
- Write it on paper.
- Let's say it's 20 dollars times 6.

631
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:15,791
- And take out four dollars.
- Gosh.

632
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:16,922
Why four dollars?

633
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,722
- We should take out 6 dollars.
- Yes, it's 6 dollars.

634
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,962
- We have to take out 12 dollars.
- Right.

635
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,191
But 20 dollars minus 12 dollars equals 8 dollars.

636
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,691
Two dollars times six equals...

637
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,731
- Two times six is twelve.
- Right. It's twelve dollars.

638
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:28,961
- How much is it?
- So from those 12 dollars...

639
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,971
(They're not giving up, even when facing such a huge challenge.)

640
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:32,031
- Minus how much?
- I don't remember.

641
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,172
(Mental overload)

642
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:37,041
I think it's 14 dollars. No, 104 dollars.

643
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,841
- It's 104 dollars?
- I guess it’s around that much.

644
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:40,041
(Wait, no.)

645
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,182
No, it's 108 dollars.

646
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,282
(What's wrong with me?)

647
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,352
Ask me again.

648
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:48,052
Edit that part out.

649
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,192
I'll act naturally.

650
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:52,152
How much is 18 dollars times 6?

651
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:54,122
Roughly 108 dollars, I think.

652
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:57,032
- He's so good at math. He's smart.
- He's smart.

653
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:01,562
Seriously.

654
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:03,502
He just didn't study hard.

655
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:06,841
- If he had, he would've succeeded.
- If he had, he would've been great.

656
00:26:06,842 --> 00:26:07,941
Gosh, that's right.

657
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,672
From now on, the math...

658
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:11,472
Don't ever mention math to us.

659
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,442
- So 500g.
- Yes, 500g.

660
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:16,651
If we work hard, we'll get to earn 100 dollars.

661
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,952
(They have to earn 108 dollars to go zip-lining.)

662
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:21,521
(Let's do this.)

663
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:23,792
(Let's go zip-lining.)

664
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,292
All right.

665
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:29,592
(There are mountains of oysters.)

666
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:32,062
They're so tightly closed shut.

667
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:35,132
(Forcing it open)

668
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,332
(As they shuck them one by one,)

669
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:43,042
(they're filling up their baskets.)

670
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,172
Let's shuck all of these.

671
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:46,881
Let's shuck everything here.

672
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:48,512
Hurry. We have to shuck more.

673
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:51,811
(Let's earn at least an extra 0.1 dollars.)

674
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:52,952
All right.

675
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:01,662
Nice.

676
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:04,332
We probably have more than 500g now.

677
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,061
Let's weigh what we have so far.

678
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,301
We have to drain out the water before we weigh them.

679
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:11,832
Let's be fair and square.

680
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,841
- Let's put everything together.
- Do it.

681
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,342
(I'll just finish shucking this one.)

682
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,072
I'm not sure about this.

683
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:22,511
(They're combining the shucked oysters into one basket.)

684
00:27:22,512 --> 00:27:25,581
Jae Wook, let's put the water here.

685
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,252
I'm not sure if that will weigh 500g.

686
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,592
- It will weigh more than 500g.
- You think?

687
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:31,851
Let's put this one in there too.

688
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:33,191
(They add everything they have.)

689
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,392
You do it so neatly.

690
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:36,991
(They did fill up a big basket.)

691
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:38,662
We did shuck a lot of oysters.

692
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,362
Weigh it before more water is drained out.

693
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:43,501
- Weigh it right now?
- Quickly.

694
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:44,931
We do need some water.

695
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,972
We should do this fair and square.

696
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:50,112
(Full of anticipation, they rush toward the scale.)

697
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:53,882
(Let's see.)

698
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:58,212
(How much will the oysters shucked by the Fresh members weigh?)

699
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,882
- It's 3.3kg.
- It's 3.3kg.

700
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:04,022
- It's 3.3kg.
- It's 3.3kg.

701
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,762
(For two hours,)

702
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,261
(they shucked oyster after oyster.)

703
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:11,361
(They're finally done for the day.)

704
00:28:11,362 --> 00:28:12,701
Wait, then we have to do the math again.

705
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:13,762
It's 66 dollars.

706
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,631
- It is? You're smart.
- It's 66 dollars for 3.3kg.

707
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:17,671
(His brain suddenly works fast when it comes to getting paid.)

708
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:18,771
(Proud)

709
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,442
- Did you shuck a lot of oysters?
- Yes.

710
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:21,942
We shucked a whole lot of oysters.

711
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,572
Since you all worked so hard,

712
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:26,812
I set your snack table with the black sea bream...

713
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:28,842
we caught earlier. So you should go eat.

714
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:31,782
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you so much.

715
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,351
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

716
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:34,721
(Let's go enjoy snack time.)

717
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:37,691
- Gosh, nice moves.
- You're full of swag.

718
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:38,951
(Jung Ah is full of swag at the news of their snack time.)

719
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:40,121
Play the beat.

720
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,421
- Something's boiling.
- Over here.

721
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,592
(They're especially looking forward to the black sea bream.)

722
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:46,202
- This looks so good.
- What is this?

723
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:50,402
(Today’s snack to fill up the hungry members after a hard day of work)

724
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:53,642
(The captain himself cleaned the black sea bream they caught.)

725
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,942
- We get to make raw fish bibimbap.
- This is the black sea bream.

726
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,242
The one we caught earlier?

727
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:01,012
He made sashimi with that already?

728
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:02,852
He sliced it for us.

729
00:29:04,082 --> 00:29:07,122
(Grilling an entire black sea bream)

730
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,591
We have to hold it and tear it apart.

731
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:10,992
(Grilled black sea bream with crispy outside and juicy inside)

732
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,621
(They even have spicy black sea bream stew.)

733
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:14,692
It's spicy fish stew.

734
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:20,132
(The captain prepared these 3 dishes himself.)

735
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:22,602
There's a variety of dishes.

736
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,632
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

737
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,612
Hey, Jung Kyung Ho. No, I mean Yoon Kyung Ho.

738
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,642
Yes, Park Sang Myun.

739
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,742
(Laughing)

740
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,082
(Jung Ah loves their banter.)

741
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:39,881
(Impressed)

742
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:41,251
Gosh, that's so funny.

743
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:42,382
(Did you just call me Park Sang Myun?)

744
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:45,822
She keeps calling me Jung Kyung Ho.

745
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:49,022
- I'm Yoon Kyung Ho.
- Don't ever call me that again.

746
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:53,401
I was trying to say that Kyung Ho should be on soup-serving duty.

747
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:54,502
- All right.
- Yes.

748
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,572
How should I serve this?

749
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,701
Kyung Ho, do you want me to do it? You must be exhausted.

750
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,042
- I'm not exhausted.
- Just split the fish...

751
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:08,442
- Gosh, that looks so good.
- Kyung Ho, can you move your butt?

752
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:12,212
(Laughing)

753
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,382
(Too much)

754
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,222
Kyung Ho, just sit down.

755
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,961
Just take a seat and be comfortable.

756
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,462
(Laughing)

757
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,531
- Enjoy the food.
- Thank you for the food.

758
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,732
Thank you for the food.

759
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:28,932
(First, they try the spicy black sea bream stew.)

760
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,302
- It's so good.
- Gosh, that's refreshing.

761
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:34,901
(Jung Ah takes a huge bite too.)

762
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,472
(This is great.)

763
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,042
(Jae Wook drinks the soup straight from his bowl.)

764
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:41,812
(Gosh)

765
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:44,111
(Park Jun Myun and Yoon Kyung Ho both take bites too.)

766
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:45,882
(Gosh)

767
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:47,382
The broth is amazing.

768
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,091
Eating right in front of the sea with the sea breeze gently blowing.

769
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:54,822
(The stew tastes especially good as the sea breeze blow around them.)

770
00:30:58,432 --> 00:30:59,432
(Amazed)

771
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:02,701
(Jae Hwa can't stop drinking the broth.)

772
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:03,702
(Shaking her head in awe)

773
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,801
(Kyung Ho follows Jae Hwa's lead and drinks straight from the bowl.)

774
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:07,042
It's warming up my body.

775
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,771
Who wants to start making their raw fish bibimbap?

776
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:11,941
Me.

777
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,382
(It's now time to try the black sea bream sashimi.)

778
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:18,012
(Kyung Ho takes a chewy piece of black sea bream sashimi.)

779
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,781
- Gosh, did you try this?
- Isn't it great?

780
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:22,822
Did you try it with soy sauce?

781
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:27,821
(Jae Hwa tries a piece with chojang.)

782
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:28,921
The sashimi is perfectly chewy.

783
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,962
(She opens her eyes wide at how fresh the sashimi is.)

784
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:34,932
(Ji Yeon tries it with vegetables.)

785
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:38,102
(It's so tasty.)

786
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:41,541
- The spicy fish stew is so good.
- The sashimi is exquisite.

787
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,772
(They get to eat fresh sashimi at a place with such an amazing view.)

788
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:43,972
I love it here.

789
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,511
(The black sea breams were caught earlier, so they're very fresh.)

790
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:48,842
The sashimi is amazing.

791
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:51,052
I can't stop eating.

792
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:53,382
You guys get to do this regularly, right?

793
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:55,922
(Glancing over)

794
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:59,092
(Jae Wook starts assembling his raw fish bibimbap.)

795
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:01,322
(Starting off with some spicy and sour chojang,)

796
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:03,992
(he puts in a lot of crispy vegetables.)

797
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:07,102
(Then, he adds a drizzle of sesame oil.)

798
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:11,272
(It doesn't take long for Jae Wook to make his raw fish bibimbap.)

799
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:17,542
(He takes a bite of it.)

800
00:32:17,712 --> 00:32:19,742
(I want some too.)

801
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:23,452
(You should try it too.)

802
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:27,422
(This is insanely good.)

803
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,452
(Kyung Ho also hurriedly takes a huge bite.)

804
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:35,692
(The raw fish bibimbap is so good...)

805
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:38,492
(that his mouth is closed shut.)

806
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:41,132
(He's enjoying the food.)

807
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:43,532
(Standing up)

808
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,202
(Come to think of it)

809
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,472
Actually,

810
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:49,642
you do this and...

811
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:51,772
- Jae Hwa, that looks good.
- Jun Myun.

812
00:32:52,412 --> 00:32:55,682
(Separating the flesh from the bone)

813
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:58,111
(A huge bite of flesh)

814
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,752
- Here.
- It's okay.

815
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:03,052
(Goodness)

816
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:04,591
- Is it good?
- It must be really good.

817
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:06,322
(Jung Ah feels proud watching Jae Hwa enjoy the food.)

818
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:08,892
(I don't get to eat this every day.)

819
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,762
(Thick flesh)

820
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:14,302
Tell us if you've ever had a meal like this.

821
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,561
- No, right?
- No.

822
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,131
We've never eaten anything like this.

823
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:18,371
Never.

824
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,201
(The grilled black sea bream's rich flavour is a new experience.)

825
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:21,472
That's going to be very good.

826
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:23,841
(He tears another huge piece off the grilled black sea bream.)

827
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:25,212
That fish is huge.

828
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:26,642
Here.

829
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:29,112
(Good food is meant to be shared.)

830
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:32,152
(Good food is meant to be shared.)

831
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:33,921
It's nicely seasoned.

832
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,722
(Jung Ah loves it.)

833
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,052
(What about me?)

834
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:40,222
You haven't tried this, right?

835
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:42,362
- Give it to me then.
- Okay.

836
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:43,892
(Go ahead and give me some.)

837
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:45,562
Remove the bones.

838
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:48,362
(Holding out her bowl)

839
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:49,932
That's fine,

840
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:51,202
Yoon Kyung Ho.

841
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,702
Here you go, my dear Park Jun Myun.

842
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:54,902
Thank you.

843
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:56,102
Is this good?

844
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,212
- It's nicely seasoned.
- Yes.

845
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,252
(Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside)

846
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:06,882
Kyung Ho loves food.

847
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:08,821
I can tell he's really enjoying the food.

848
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,952
(Now it’s time for the real eating to begin.)

849
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:15,792
(He's having a full-blown feast during snack time.)

850
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:18,661
Gosh, this black sea bream is amazing.

851
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:20,202
(The black sea bream is a joy to catch and even better to eat.)

852
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,432
Gosh, I didn't know fish could taste like this.

853
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,972
(The meal is so tasty...)

854
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:28,601
(that they can't help but dance.)

855
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:29,671
- Eat.
- Okay.

856
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:30,812
(that they can't help but dance.)

857
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,182
- Long time no see.
- It's been a while, Jae Hwa.

858
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,681
- Are you done eating?
- Thank you so much for the food.

859
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:38,552
Right, it was so good.

860
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:42,252
You all did a great job with the oysters today.

861
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,122
Here's the payment for your labour.

862
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,922
(Payment time is always exciting.)

863
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,932
Gosh, it's quite a lot.

864
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,892
- Nineteen, twenty, - Nineteen, twenty,

865
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,862
- twenty-one, twenty-two, - twenty-one, twenty-two,

866
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:56,101
- twenty-three.
- twenty-three.

867
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:57,202
Twenty-eight,

868
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:58,401
twenty-nine,

869
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,642
thirty.

870
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,201
(It's the highest payment they've earned so far: 306 dollars)

871
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,442
That's the most we've ever made.

872
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:04,112
- That's a lot of money.
- Thank you.

873
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:05,971
We made a lot of money.

874
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,042
(The hard work paid off with a hefty allowance.)

875
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:09,612
- Goodness, you all...
- Gosh.

876
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,311
worked so hard today.

877
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:13,922
We couldn't let you leave without a parting gift.

878
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:16,221
- Gosh.
- Look at those oysters.

879
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:17,252
(They got the best snack break ever, but these gifts are next-level too!)

880
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:20,021
These are hijiki, a local specialty of Sinji Island.

881
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:21,092
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

882
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,391
- These are...
- Oysters!

883
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:23,461
(The oysters that the Fresh members harvested and cleaned themselves)

884
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:24,592
Look at those oysters!

885
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,262
These are seaweed that we got from the fishing ground.

886
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:28,602
- Right.
- The seaweed.

887
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:29,801
And this one is...

888
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:32,202
(Lastly)

889
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:33,801
- Black sea bream.
- Black sea bream.

890
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:34,901
Here.

891
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:37,472
(The ever-so-precious black sea bream)

892
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:38,671
We truly appreciate your hard work.

893
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,541
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

894
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,412
(Their hearts are filled with warmth as they leave Sinji Island.)

895
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,452
(Today, they harvested oysters from the ocean's treasure chest.)

896
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:53,522
(After being thoroughly cleaned,)

897
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,432
(they were shipped fresh...)

898
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,732
(to destinations all across the country.)

899
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,942
(It's now time to go grocery shopping.)

900
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,172
So,

901
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,472
you and I...

902
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,642
Jun Myun's birthday is right around the corner.

903
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:18,982
(Jun Myun's birthday is actually in 4 days.)

904
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:20,951
(So the Fresh members wanted to celebrate it.)

905
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:23,292
(Whispering)

906
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:24,592
(Jun Myun is...)

907
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,592
(fast asleep.)

908
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:30,492
(They've been planning a secret birthday party behind her back.)

909
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:32,091
(Even during the day)

910
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:33,132
(Tapping on Ji Yeon)

911
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:35,102
(What are we going to do about Jun Myun's party?)

912
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:37,302
(Walking into the room)

913
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,972
(Ji Yeon suddenly starts rambling.)

914
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:44,372
(Trying to see if Jun Myun caught them)

915
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:45,472
(That's how Operation Birthday Party began.)

916
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,581
Tomorrow, I'll just...

917
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:49,311
make seaweed soup during the day.

918
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,181
- And we'll use pancake mix...
- Okay.

919
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:54,221
- to make the birthday cake.
- Sounds good.

920
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:55,651
So you have to take Jun Myun out of the house.

921
00:36:55,652 --> 00:36:56,891
(I see.)

922
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:58,022
- Go somewhere with her.
- Okay.

923
00:36:58,422 --> 00:36:59,822
You can take Kyung Ho with you too.

924
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:03,192
(Thinking)

925
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:06,701
We should get Jun Myun out of the house.

926
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,101
(Jung Ah is worried about grocery shopping without Jun Myun knowing.)

927
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,261
Knowing Jun Myun,

928
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:12,602
she'll be like, "Jung Ah, come with us."

929
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:14,901
- I have to say, "I don't want to." - Then I'll say...

930
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:18,212
Then I'll say, "Let's just go, Jun Myun."

931
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:19,742
All right.

932
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:21,081
- This is so funny.
- This is funny.

933
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:22,542
(They've arrived at the store while making plans.)

934
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:25,352
(Looking over at Jae Wook)

935
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,951
- Bread?
- We'll...

936
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:29,082
use pancake mix to...

937
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,409
(Looking over at Jae Wook)

938
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:34,309
(The plan is in motion.)

939
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:35,839
They don't have it?

940
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,409
Behind you.

941
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:40,847
(Jun Myun keeps on following them.)

942
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:42,646
She keeps following us.

943
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:44,477
(She has to buy pancake mix without Jun Myun finding out.)

944
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:46,446
- Tomorrow, are we...
- We need zucchini.

945
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,046
- Where's our cart?
- Zucchini? How many?

946
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:49,116
Are you making spicy kalguksu tomorrow?

947
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:50,216
- Or...
- Yes, spicy kalguksu.

948
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,986
(While the star of the party went to get some zucchini)

949
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,326
- And...
- We have to hurry.

950
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:55,556
- Where's the...
- Wait.

951
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:56,856
- Pancake mix.
- Pancake mix.

952
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,957
We have to get pancake mix.

953
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:59,327
Hurry!

954
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:03,537
(Jung Ah, I got the zucchini.)

955
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:05,336
- I found it.
- Get that and...

956
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:07,166
We need diced beef for soup.

957
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,237
- Diced beef for soup?
- Yes.

958
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,436
(Where are you, Jung Ah?)

959
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:12,537
Where did she go?

960
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,046
I'll grab two of these.

961
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,206
Will one be enough?

962
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,847
One is more than enough.

963
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,477
Jung Ah, I grabbed four zucchini.

964
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:23,517
- Will four be enough?
- Yes.

965
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:25,987
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

966
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:29,227
(Terrified)

967
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:31,427
I almost got caught.

968
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:34,367
I'll just eat whatever is left out of the things you bought.

969
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,597
(Sneaking it into the cart)

970
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:38,336
(Covering it)

971
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:39,437
Do you like this one?

972
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,137
Yes, I love it.

973
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:44,106
(They're moving faster than ever.)

974
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:45,407
(Running)

975
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:48,547
Jung Ah, is there space in the trunk of your car?

976
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,247
- There should be nothing there.
- Let me go load this up in there.

977
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,017
Will this fit?

978
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:56,647
Hey, the trunk is very big.

979
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:58,157
This is more than enough space.

980
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,686
- The trunk is very big.
- Hey, you and I...

981
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,356
could both sit in here.

982
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:02,487
Right.

983
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:09,527
- Where should I put this?
- In here.

984
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:12,036
- Look. Yes.
- This is the cup holder?

985
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:13,196
Like this.

986
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,367
It comes out when I push this.

987
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,507
It’s convenient that the cup holder can slide in and out.

988
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,207
Gosh, that's amazing.

989
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:20,747
It's so nice.

990
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:24,717
I just keep endlessly crying

991
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:27,086
I keep endlessly getting sad

992
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,387
What's the title of that song?

993
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,687
I don't know.

994
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:33,387
You disappeared

995
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:35,156
I call out to you but you don't answer

996
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,457
- Is this not the song?
- That's not the song.

997
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:37,827
What is that?

998
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:39,896
(The song Kyung Ho thought of is...)

999
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,627
("Memories of Summer Days" by Lee Jeong Suk.)

1000
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,366
I thought this was that song.

1001
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,067
- I just keep endlessly crying - Endlessly crying

1002
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,206
(With the "Aftermath" of working at a fishing operation,)

1003
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,737
(they drive along the coastal road.)

1004
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:53,107
(Soon, they've entered the seaside path.)

1005
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:56,247
This view is amazing.

1006
00:39:57,017 --> 00:40:00,247
(A boat greets them outside.)

1007
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:03,557
- This location is great.
- Yes.

1008
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,686
- There's nothing nearby either, - I see.

1009
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:08,057
so we can sing as loudly as we want.

1010
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:11,396
- This is so nice.
- I know.

1011
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,127
(They continue their drive with excitement.)

1012
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:15,766
(Jae Hwa is in the car ahead of them.)

1013
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:18,297
I can't believe there's a house here.

1014
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:20,107
It's so pretty.

1015
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:21,836
It's a seaside village.

1016
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,306
(We've arrived at our village where the sea breeze gently blows.)

1017
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:25,837
This is so beautiful.

1018
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:29,577
(They all have their hands full.)

1019
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:31,277
Goodness.

1020
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,546
Jun Myun.

1021
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:34,616
(Is it raining?)

1022
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:35,717
Jun Myun, you...

1023
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:38,656
- What is it?
- You tilting the box...

1024
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,487
is making the box leak water.

1025
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:42,226
(It's raining water infused with fresh seaweed from Wando.)

1026
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:43,256
Gosh, whatever.

1027
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,527
(It's raining water infused with fresh seaweed from Wando.)

1028
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:46,327
Jae Wook's coming.

1029
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:47,727
Jae Wook.

1030
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:49,896
- Be careful, it's leaking.
- It's leaking.

1031
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:50,967
Gosh, that was funny.

1032
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:52,337
Gosh.

1033
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:55,437
(Ji Yeon is here to help Jae Hwa too.)

1034
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,977
Gosh, this place is really beautiful.

1035
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:00,907
This is it.

1036
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,146
Gosh, Jun Myun.

1037
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,517
Isn't it so pretty?

1038
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,347
Our house is so pretty.

1039
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:09,647
(When Jae Hwa turns around,)

1040
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:13,417
(she catches the scent of the salty sea breeze.)

1041
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,096
(Seagulls are welcoming them.)

1042
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,427
Listen to the seagulls.

1043
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:22,196
Welcome to our house, Ms. Kim Jae Hwa.

1044
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:24,636
- Thanks, Ms. Park Jun Myun.
- Please come on in.

1045
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,197
(Welcome to Fresh House.)

1046
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,966
(Someone is breathing heavily.)

1047
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:29,967
It's too heavy, isn't it?

1048
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:33,306
- Why are you carrying the big one?
- I'm fine.

1049
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,107
(Carrying a lot of groceries that they bought)

1050
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,247
- I do Pilates.
- I see.

1051
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,617
- It's heavy.
- Okay.

1052
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:41,947
My gosh.

1053
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,016
- Put Kyung Ho's suitcase here.
- I feel dizzy.

1054
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:45,156
Be careful, Kyung Ho.

1055
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:46,257
My gosh.

1056
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,956
The house is so beautiful.

1057
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:49,987
It's so cool.

1058
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:53,967
Jae Wook. Which room are we staying in?

1059
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,266
- Which room is yours?
- My room?

1060
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:57,396
I think we need to use the room over there.

1061
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:58,397
Is that so?

1062
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:01,836
Is there anything you need to take out of your suitcase?

1063
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,207
- What?
- Do you need to check it out?

1064
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:04,777
(Cute annex of Fresh House)

1065
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:05,837
Please go in.

1066
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:10,277
(Jae Wook, taller than the door, enters first.)

1067
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:12,716
(At the end of a hallway, like a rabbit hole)

1068
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:14,947
(A small, refreshing living room)

1069
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:18,417
(A cosy bedroom for a guest)

1070
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:20,356
- Can I sleep here with you?
- Of course.

1071
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:22,527
(A space for Jae Wook and Kyung Ho to spend cosy time)

1072
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:25,326
The house is so cute.

1073
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,857
(They unpacked their suitcases at the annex.)

1074
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,496
- This is nice.
- It is, isn't it?

1075
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:29,497
Yes.

1076
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,136
(Shall we indulge in some sweet, relaxing time?)

1077
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:32,366
- The rice.
- Hurry.

1078
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,397
I need to cook rice.

1079
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:35,737
I need to cook rice now.

1080
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,377
I need to cook a lot of rice for sikhye.

1081
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:40,407
(Sikhye like a bolt out of the blue)

1082
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:44,477
I'm going to make kabocha sikhye for the elderly in the village.

1083
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:47,086
It feels so rewarding.

1084
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:48,546
(She's going to bring her sikhye to the senior community center.)

1085
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,986
I'm going to make sikhye today.

1086
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,086
And here comes my best pupil.

1087
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:53,187
(When she planned to make sikhye, her best pupil came just in time.)

1088
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:55,856
I'm going to make kabocha sikhye today.

1089
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:56,996
- Kabocha sikhye?
- Yes.

1090
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:58,127
(To make a large amount of sikhye)

1091
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:00,057
Wait a moment.

1092
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:01,467
(There's no time for a break.)

1093
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:04,737
(Leader Yum takes out a big rice cooker for 50 servings.)

1094
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:07,137
(Washing her hands)

1095
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:10,837
(Preparing rice for sikhye)

1096
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:12,476
(Her best pupil comes after unpacking his suitcase.)

1097
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,047
It's been a while since I made sikhye.

1098
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:17,847
Jung Ah, can I do something now? Is the rice cooking?

1099
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:21,317
Then, I'll get water. Hot water...

1100
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:24,357
Sure. Let's boil water.

1101
00:43:24,857 --> 00:43:26,487
Boil water now.

1102
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,356
(After an enigmatic talk with Jung Ah)

1103
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,187
(Pouring water)

1104
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:34,426
(Starting to boil a pot of water)

1105
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:35,427
It's here.

1106
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:37,737
(Finding malt)

1107
00:43:38,397 --> 00:43:40,137
Okay. A funnel is here.

1108
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,137
I don't think this is big enough.

1109
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:46,606
I need a bigger one.

1110
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,277
What are you doing?

1111
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:51,016
When I noticed the rice was cooking,

1112
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:52,847
I began to work automatically.

1113
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:56,417
(The reason he's in a hurry)

1114
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:58,817
(What is sikhye?)

1115
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,986
(Cooking rice)

1116
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:02,986
(Preparing malt)

1117
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:04,026
(Adding raw sugar)

1118
00:44:04,027 --> 00:44:05,096
(Fermenting rice)

1119
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:06,097
(Boiling it)

1120
00:44:06,098 --> 00:44:07,227
(Letting it cool)

1121
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:11,467
(Cooking sikhye will take over 7 hours.)

1122
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:15,907
(But it'll take even longer to make kabocha sikhye.)

1123
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:19,737
(Kyung Ho has done it before.)

1124
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:21,776
(So he prepared everything quickly.)

1125
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:23,547
Including that one, we have 12 bottles.

1126
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:26,117
How much sikhye are you going to make?

1127
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,516
About a dozen two-liter bottles.

1128
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,217
(Making 13 2-liter bottles)

1129
00:44:32,617 --> 00:44:34,256
It's like a sikhye factory.

1130
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:36,227
(I'll make more than enough for the elderly in the village.)

1131
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,697
Master.

1132
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:40,127
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

1133
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,997
I can't believe I'm making sikhye with my pupil.

1134
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:46,167
- Just half?
- Yes.

1135
00:44:46,637 --> 00:44:48,866
It doesn't have to be exactly half, does it?

1136
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,977
Just about half. Okay. That's good.

1137
00:44:51,337 --> 00:44:53,136
- Should I pour water?
- Yes.

1138
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:55,206
(How to make Jung Ah's kabocha sikhye)

1139
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:59,647
(Wrap the malt in cheesecloth and add warm water.)

1140
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,517
Raw sugar is here.

1141
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:04,116
- I'll take it out, then.
- Sure. Take it out.

1142
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:05,786
(Getting ready for the next step)

1143
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,426
Look at Kyung Ho. Since he has done it,

1144
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:10,757
he knows what to do.

1145
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:13,356
Let's wear one glove.

1146
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:15,296
- Are you doing it with 2 hands?
- Do we wear only 1?

1147
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,897
Yes. Because I'm still a pupil.

1148
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,067
(Chuckling)

1149
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,636
I don't know how to do it with one hand.

1150
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:22,367
(I haven't mastered advanced skills.)

1151
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,507
(The master is doing it with one hand.)

1152
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:30,247
(Malt enzymes break rice starch, creating subtle sweetness.)

1153
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:32,646
Look at this. Mine turned milky colour.

1154
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,316
- Yes.
- You need to do it more.

1155
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:35,917
(Rubbing it until it turns milky colour)

1156
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:38,856
We need to finish this quickly.

1157
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:39,857
You're right.

1158
00:45:39,858 --> 00:45:42,427
We can boil it before going to bed.

1159
00:45:43,797 --> 00:45:47,396
(Jae Hwa is coming after taking a break.)

1160
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:49,797
- I want to help.
- Okay.

1161
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:51,996
- Do you want to help us?
- Yes.

1162
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:52,997
Then...

1163
00:45:55,237 --> 00:45:56,407
Is the rice already cooked?

1164
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:57,906
The rice cooker is good.

1165
00:45:57,907 --> 00:45:58,907
(Nicely cooked rice for sikhye)

1166
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:02,777
Add nine cups of sugar to the rice.

1167
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,716
The best thing about your sikhye is...

1168
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:07,076
- that it's not sweet.
- It's not too sweet.

1169
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,517
- That's right.
- It's not sweet.

1170
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:10,886
- It's for the elderly, - Right.

1171
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:12,386
so it'll be better to make it less sweet for their health.

1172
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:13,416
(Making healthy sikhye for the elderly)

1173
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,287
- It's cupful, isn't it?
- Yes, it's cupful.

1174
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:16,527
It's one cup.

1175
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:19,827
- We're not good at math.
- It's two cups.

1176
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:20,927
- I see.
- We have to count it carefully.

1177
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:22,697
It's three cups.

1178
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:24,666
If you keep doing it like that...

1179
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,797
- Like this.
- Yes.

1180
00:46:27,837 --> 00:46:28,837
- If you keep doing it like that, - Don't talk to me.

1181
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:30,737
- don't do it.
- I added three cups.

1182
00:46:31,337 --> 00:46:32,706
- That's 5 cups.
- It's 6.

1183
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,547
It's 6 cups. It's 6.

1184
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:37,477
- It's six, so the next is...
- You're confusing me.

1185
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:39,447
Kyung Ho.

1186
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:41,246
- Seven.
- It's seven.

1187
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:42,946
- It's 7 cups.
- You need to add 2 more cups.

1188
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:44,016
- You need 2 more cups.
- What is 7 times 7?

1189
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:45,087
It's 49.

1190
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,986
It's eight. Eight times eight.

1191
00:46:46,987 --> 00:46:49,227
(Covering raw sugar on the rice)

1192
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:52,057
(Milky colour malt)

1193
00:46:52,457 --> 00:46:55,667
(Pouring it into the rice cooker)

1194
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:57,766
- Do you want me to stir it?
- A little of this.

1195
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:59,267
- Yes, stir it.
- With this?

1196
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:00,507
- Stir it well.
- Yes.

1197
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:03,667
Stir it well so that there are no lumps.

1198
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:07,607
(Being strict with a newbie)

1199
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:09,276
Rice needs to be fermented well.

1200
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:10,406
(The best pupil's tip)

1201
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:12,317
(Stir it thoroughly to remove lumps so the rice ferments properly.)

1202
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,246
It's going well today.

1203
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:15,687
- It looks perfect.
- It's perfect.

1204
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:18,286
(Carefully)

1205
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:19,287
It's perfect.

1206
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:24,226
Okay. We can check it in 4 to 5 hours.

1207
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:25,326
(Ferment in warm mode for 4 to 5 hours.)

1208
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:27,197
Let's clean up. Cover this one.

1209
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:30,097
(It looks like it's done, but not quite yet.)

1210
00:47:30,637 --> 00:47:31,996
So, kabocha.

1211
00:47:31,997 --> 00:47:33,167
(Today’s highlight is kabocha.)

1212
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:37,067
Cutting kabocha isn't easy.

1213
00:47:38,837 --> 00:47:40,407
- Look at that.
- Kabocha.

1214
00:47:40,977 --> 00:47:42,306
- Yes. I'll get ready to steam it.
- You're doing it well.

1215
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,376
(Kabocha with yellow flesh)

1216
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:44,377
I got a steam pot.

1217
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:46,116
We remove all the seeds.

1218
00:47:46,117 --> 00:47:47,987
- Yes, then use a blender.
- Remove seeds and peel.

1219
00:47:48,187 --> 00:47:49,187
We don't grind it yet.

1220
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:51,186
- We'll grind it after steaming it.
- Okay.

1221
00:47:51,187 --> 00:47:52,387
(Jung Ah's kabocha sikhye: Remove seeds and steam kabocha.)

1222
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:56,857
(Ji Yeon and Jae Wook are preparing kabocha.)

1223
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,856
Remove all the seeds and peel the kabocha.

1224
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:00,867
(Removing seeds)

1225
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:03,996
Everyone is working so hard.

1226
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,167
(Everyone is helping with making sikhye.)

1227
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,636
We were just trying to make sikhye.

1228
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,767
We tried to do it during break time.

1229
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:13,736
Kyung Ho works really hard.

1230
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:16,206
- So it makes us work.
- Do I make you uncomfortable?

1231
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:18,377
It makes all of us work really hard.

1232
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:19,846
- It did somehow.
- No.

1233
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:20,917
Just have a seat.

1234
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:24,257
(While kabocha is being steamed)

1235
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:27,987
(The sun is setting.)

1236
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:30,126
Let's listen to one of these tonight.

1237
00:48:30,127 --> 00:48:31,556
- This one?
- Let's listen to it tonight.

1238
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:32,857
Let's play one tonight.

1239
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,027
"Let it be?" "Get back?"

1240
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:38,836
"Get back" is good. I like this one too. "Something."

1241
00:48:38,837 --> 00:48:39,837
(The little girl, Jae Hwa, liked The Beatles back then.)

1242
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:40,837
- "Something?" - Yes.

1243
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,606
(Fresh Vinyl Bar is open.)

1244
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:43,667
This is "Something."

1245
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:48,406
(When the requested song plays,)

1246
00:48:48,407 --> 00:48:51,077
(they dance to the music.)

1247
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:52,946
(We came to watch you.)

1248
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:55,117
This is good.

1249
00:48:55,217 --> 00:48:57,857
(Amazing performance)

1250
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:01,057
(Look at them.)

1251
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:03,457
Jun Myun, you're enjoying it more when you're with Jae Hwa.

1252
00:49:04,197 --> 00:49:05,197
Come on in.

1253
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:09,567
(Richer and deeper performance)

1254
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,536
Let's just have fun like this all night, listening to music.

1255
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:13,766
- I'd love that.
- There are so many great vinyls.

1256
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:14,936
There is karaoke, too.

1257
00:49:14,937 --> 00:49:16,037
(Okay. I like that.)

1258
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:17,906
(Browsing)

1259
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:20,336
I can't help it. First of all...

1260
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:21,346
(We can't just sit here like this.)

1261
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:23,846
- "Step by step?" - Play "Step by step" first.

1262
00:49:23,847 --> 00:49:26,146
- Step by step - This is the last.

1263
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:29,617
(Preparing more kabocha)

1264
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:32,556
They are distracting me. It makes me want to dance.

1265
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:33,886
(Stop distracting me!)

1266
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,386
Stop it.

1267
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:38,327
- Stop making me dance.
- Come on.

1268
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:40,127
- Come on.
- Yoon Kyung Ho, go!

1269
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:43,266
No. I have to work.

1270
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:44,267
(He's saying no, but his feet are dancing.)

1271
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:46,466
(Step four!)

1272
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,707
(They used to dance a lot.)

1273
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:49,466
(Watching from the VIP seat)

1274
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,467
(Five!)

1275
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:52,577
The last one.

1276
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:57,616
(Watching them working)

1277
00:49:57,617 --> 00:49:58,617
They're working.

1278
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:01,017
(Laughing)

1279
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:04,557
Jun Myun. Let's try this.

1280
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:08,487
Dance as if you're in the tightest space.

1281
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,186
(What is that?)

1282
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:11,357
One, two, three, four.

1283
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,567
- Jae Hwa is doing it.
- Look at her.

1284
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,667
It's too tight, but I want to dance.

1285
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:18,637
Like this?

1286
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,606
(No one forced them to do that.)

1287
00:50:22,607 --> 00:50:23,907
Look at them.

1288
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:27,277
They're so funny.

1289
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:30,177
Look at him.

1290
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:35,686
His dancing is awesome.

1291
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:36,687
(After sharing some laughs,)

1292
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:38,886
(Fresh Vinyl Bar closes.)

1293
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,187
See you tomorrow.

1294
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:42,526
- We had fun.
- Yes, we did.

1295
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:44,497
- Yes, it was fun.
- Thanks, Jun Myun.

1296
00:50:44,597 --> 00:50:46,296
You must want more.

1297
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:48,296
- You must've lost weight.
- Yes.

1298
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:49,297
You should eat a lot.

1299
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:50,297
(With heated air,)

1300
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:53,337
(kabocha is cooked well.)

1301
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,767
(Putting only flesh ones in a blender)

1302
00:50:59,707 --> 00:51:02,747
Spinning and spinning Kabocha is spinning

1303
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,216
Grinding and grinding

1304
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:07,647
(Please grind it smooth like soup.)

1305
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,956
(Nutty and sweet kabocha)

1306
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,057
It has been ground well.

1307
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:16,787
It's so rich.

1308
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:20,127
(Tasting)

1309
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,026
All right.

1310
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:23,226
It's tasty. I only got a taste...

1311
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:25,097
- like this, but it's tasty.
- It's tasty. It's insane.

1312
00:51:25,737 --> 00:51:26,867
(Licking)

1313
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:30,206
It's tasty even when it's diluted with water.

1314
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:31,207
(He's excited about Jung Ah's kabocha sikhye.)

1315
00:51:31,677 --> 00:51:34,606
(The ground kabocha gets covered.)

1316
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:35,976
Let's keep it somewhere.

1317
00:51:35,977 --> 00:51:37,677
(It needs to wait until the rice for sikhye cools down.)

1318
00:51:38,217 --> 00:51:41,717
(While the Fresh members focus on sikhye,)

1319
00:51:42,487 --> 00:51:46,217
(darkness envelopes the Yeongpung Village.)

1320
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,987
(It's time for families to sit at the dinner table.)

1321
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:55,027
(Which seasonal dishes will the neighbours make today?)

1322
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:59,296
(The house of the fishing village chief...)

1323
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:01,167
(at the Yeongpung Village)

1324
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:04,307
These oysters have been salted.

1325
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:06,977
That's why there's the fermented taste.

1326
00:52:09,477 --> 00:52:10,606
You need to add a lot of chilli powder.

1327
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,446
It doesn't taste good without chilli powder.

1328
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,487
(Use a generous amount of chilli powder)

1329
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:18,987
(Mix the ingredients to make a spicy dish.)

1330
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:21,286
The spicy side dish is perfect with rice.

1331
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:22,457
(The salty side dish that makes you crave for rice, eoriguljeot)

1332
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,657
When you make the Manila clam soup,

1333
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:27,567
you don't add any salt.

1334
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:30,496
You adjust the saltiness with water.

1335
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,137
(Boil the soup without salt for the natural taste of the clams.)

1336
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:36,807
(Decorating with sliced scallions)

1337
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:39,106
It has the refreshing taste of Manila clams.

1338
00:52:39,107 --> 00:52:41,047
(Manila clam soup with the taste of the sea)

1339
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,116
(She slices the winter specialty, Japanese Spanish mackerel sashimi.)

1340
00:52:45,117 --> 00:52:46,676
Japanese Spanish mackerel is a meaty fish...

1341
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:48,287
without an unpleasant smell.

1342
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:50,686
Instead of wasabi,

1343
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:52,187
you can eat it with soy sauce.

1344
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:56,987
(The table contains the tastes from the sea of Wando.)

1345
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,896
(Grilled black sea bream, Japanese Spanish mackerel sashimi,)

1346
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:00,926
(eoriguljeot, dried laver, and Manila clam soup...)

1347
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:01,927
(make up the dinner table of seasonal ingredients.)

1348
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:06,267
(How will be the Fresh members' dinner on their 2nd day in Wando?)

1349
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:07,866
(A luxurious dish on the table)

1350
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:10,007
Will we deep-fry a black sea bream?

1351
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:11,577
What a luxury.

1352
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:13,637
On the barbecue grill...

1353
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:14,977
We'll cook oysters and abalones.

1354
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:19,277
(Then there's the highlight of the day.)

1355
00:53:19,577 --> 00:53:21,917
And Jung Ah will make oyster rice soup on top of that.

1356
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,687
I'll make oyster rice soup on top of that.

1357
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:28,927
(They'll be the busiest for dinner at Wando.)

1358
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:33,827
(It's time to set the table together.)

1359
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,927
Their evening began that way.

1360
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:38,466
I can set up the bricks the same way.

1361
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,696
Really? Go ahead then.

1362
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:40,906
Let's pile up the bricks together.

1363
00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:41,937
(They need a total of 3 braziers today.)

1364
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:45,336
(They pile up the fireproof bricks to build a brazier.)

1365
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:48,076
(After putting down the bricks,)

1366
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:50,077
(he checks the number.)

1367
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:54,387
(He puts down the bricks...)

1368
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:57,416
(and copies Jae Wook for no reason.)

1369
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,987
(When Kyung Ho leaves,)

1370
00:53:59,357 --> 00:54:00,386
We need about 50.

1371
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:01,857
(Jae Wook comes.)

1372
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:05,557
This will take forever.

1373
00:54:06,797 --> 00:54:07,867
This will take forever.

1374
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:12,737
(The bricks are quite heavy.)

1375
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:15,637
I'll carry the bricks from now on, so pile them up.

1376
00:54:15,937 --> 00:54:16,937
Okay.

1377
00:54:16,937 --> 00:54:17,937
(However,)

1378
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:24,517
(he spots something.)

1379
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:27,617
(It's a handcart.)

1380
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,217
There's a handcart.

1381
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:36,387
(He only laughs.)

1382
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:37,856
See? There's a handcart.

1383
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,396
(He feels so victimized.)

1384
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:40,627
Shall we put the bricks back and start over?

1385
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:41,926
(A person should use a tool.)

1386
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:43,097
We need many bricks.

1387
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,167
We need many more bricks.

1388
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,137
You should sit down.

1389
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,766
Hurry up. Your back hurts, right?

1390
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:50,337
(The youngest one's back hurts.)

1391
00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:54,207
We're doing hard work together. Call me "Big brother."

1392
00:54:56,977 --> 00:54:58,616
We'll only use them once today.

1393
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:00,517
(They bond over braziers.)

1394
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,717
- Let's go together.
- It looks like we need about...

1395
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:04,986
We need two more rows.

1396
00:55:04,987 --> 00:55:06,286
- Two more rows?
- Yes.

1397
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:07,887
Then how many do we need?

1398
00:55:09,587 --> 00:55:10,587
Let's go.

1399
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:13,556
Will 12 bricks suffice?

1400
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:15,626
- No. I think we'll need many more.
- How about 15?

1401
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:16,627
Fifteen?

1402
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:19,536
- My goodness.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1403
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:20,567
Okay.

1404
00:55:21,507 --> 00:55:23,137
- Shall I put it here?
- Yes.

1405
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,877
Okay.

1406
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:26,276
We built them with bricks.

1407
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:27,277
(The 3 braziers are ready.)

1408
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:29,107
- You guys did well.
- We built them with bricks.

1409
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:32,677
(They're ready to cook.)

1410
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:36,647
(Jae Wook brings out a sashimi knife.)

1411
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,927
(He goes through the boxes to look for something.)

1412
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:45,757
(It's a black sea bream, a gift from Captain Lee Sung Yoon.)

1413
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:47,096
(He brings the precious fish to the faucet.)

1414
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:49,627
(Scrubbing)

1415
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:53,137
(He scrubs the inside mercilessly.)

1416
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:56,167
(He takes the rinsed black sea bream.)

1417
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:59,237
(He scores the fish before seasoning it.)

1418
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:05,077
(Now, he's a fish master.)

1419
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:06,847
(Fascinated)

1420
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:07,847
You're a master.

1421
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:13,087
(After scoring the precious fish)

1422
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,986
(Cheongju)

1423
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:16,886
(Salt)

1424
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:19,297
(Pepper)

1425
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:21,726
(He removes the fishy smell while seasoning the fish...)

1426
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,197
(with cheongju, salt, and pepper.)

1427
00:56:25,537 --> 00:56:29,107
(Every inch of the black sea bream gets seasoned.)

1428
00:56:29,837 --> 00:56:32,837
(It gets left alone so that the seasoning can seep in.)

1429
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:38,346
- The oysters we received...
- The oysters?

1430
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:39,647
- The oysters.
- We need to rinse them.

1431
00:56:40,517 --> 00:56:42,787
(She opens the box.)

1432
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,616
(Jae Hwa decides to rinse the oysters.)

1433
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:47,286
- You need salt water. To water, - Yes.

1434
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:49,857
add some coarse salt.

1435
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:51,726
(Jae Hwa gets ready to rinse the oysters...)

1436
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:53,227
(for the oyster rice soup.)

1437
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,597
Do you need help?

1438
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:58,096
- I need salt.
- Salt?

1439
00:56:58,097 --> 00:56:59,337
Do you need coarse salt?

1440
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:00,867
I do.

1441
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:03,167
- We don't know where it is.
- It's here.

1442
00:57:03,537 --> 00:57:04,637
Is it coarse salt?

1443
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:06,906
It's bay salt. It's coarse salt.

1444
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:07,947
Okay.

1445
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:09,177
I'll sprinkle it.

1446
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:12,317
(Sprinkling coarse salt)

1447
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,817
(To remove impurities, rinse the oysters gently with bay salt.)

1448
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:19,357
Why am I so hungry?

1449
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:20,586
- You?
- Yes.

1450
00:57:20,587 --> 00:57:21,686
Are you hungry?

1451
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:23,556
- Ever since I came here, - Do you get hungry all the time?

1452
00:57:23,557 --> 00:57:26,126
I began eating more. So I'm hungry all the time.

1453
00:57:26,127 --> 00:57:28,067
What am I, a teenager?

1454
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,927
That's so cute, Jung Ah.

1455
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,536
(The one who's going through her 2nd teenage years,)

1456
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:33,937
(Jung Ah prepares the ingredients for the oyster rice soup.)

1457
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:36,737
(Green onions for sweetness)

1458
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:39,977
(Radish for the refreshing taste and crunchy texture)

1459
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:42,707
(Cheongyang pepper for the spicy and piquant taste)

1460
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:45,417
(Chives for nutrition)

1461
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,446
(My goodness)

1462
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:51,286
- This is so much fun.
- Is it fun?

1463
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:53,316
- We're cooking together.
- That's right.

1464
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:55,456
We worked, shopped for groceries, and began cooking.

1465
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:56,787
- Doesn't it feel like a party?
- Yes, it does.

1466
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:58,497
We have a party every day.

1467
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:02,367
(The woman with good cheer at the party)

1468
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:05,137
- I need an egg wash.
- How many eggs do you need?

1469
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:07,937
I don't need a lot.

1470
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:09,237
- About six?
- okay.

1471
00:58:10,307 --> 00:58:12,776
(The number of eggs for the oyster rice soup: 1, 2)

1472
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:14,946
(The number of eggs for the oyster rice soup: 3, 4)

1473
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:17,807
(The number of eggs for the oyster rice soup: 5, 6)

1474
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:20,377
We have many eggs left, right?

1475
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:22,547
- Yes, we do.
- Even if we use them tomorrow...

1476
00:58:23,347 --> 00:58:24,387
I'll use a lot.

1477
00:58:24,757 --> 00:58:27,387
(You can't stop the generous cook.)

1478
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:30,987
(She adds 3 more eggs.)

1479
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:34,797
I don't know why the amount of food I cook keeps increasing.

1480
00:58:35,397 --> 00:58:36,497
- The amount?
- Yes.

1481
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:41,536
But there are a lot of people today, right?

1482
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:42,936
We do need to make a generous amount of food.

1483
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:47,437
(You've watched Chef Yum justify herself.)

1484
00:58:48,677 --> 00:58:51,107
(She beats eggs for the oyster rice soup.)

1485
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:54,546
(Shall I take out the ingredients that'll go to the yard?)

1486
00:58:54,547 --> 00:58:55,587
Radish.

1487
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:58,157
Korean style soy sauce, salted shrimp...

1488
00:58:58,557 --> 00:58:59,986
(The ingredients...)

1489
00:58:59,987 --> 00:59:01,287
(pile up.)

1490
00:59:01,857 --> 00:59:05,497
(Until when will she bring the ingredients?)

1491
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,326
(There are a lot.)

1492
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:10,466
I moved all the ingredients.

1493
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,937
The ingredients are ready.

1494
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,467
(The ingredients come out to the yard one at a time.)

1495
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:20,137
Hold on. My goodness, seaweed.

1496
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:23,347
(Jung Ah, is there another ingredient?)

1497
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:26,116
- Seaweed.
- Isn't it this one?

1498
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:27,917
- This is it.
- How should we prepare it?

1499
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:30,416
We need to rinse it. We need to rinse it and cut it.

1500
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:31,457
(Precious)

1501
00:59:32,317 --> 00:59:35,057
(Jun Myun will be in charge of preparing the seaweed!)

1502
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:39,427
(It'll deepen the flavours of the oyster rice soup.)

1503
00:59:41,497 --> 00:59:44,527
(Jae Hwa is preparing garlic.)

1504
00:59:44,697 --> 00:59:47,496
- Jae Hwa, I'll go and grind them.
- It's because of the amount.

1505
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:48,767
Go out and grind them.

1506
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:50,107
Do it on the bench.

1507
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:51,507
The bench?

1508
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:54,177
That's the spot for grinding the garlic cloves.

1509
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:55,946
That's the rule.

1510
00:59:55,947 --> 00:59:57,176
(Team Garlic yesterday)

1511
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,617
(It's a rule at the Fresh House.)

1512
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:02,616
(She goes to the bench outside to grind the garlic cloves.)

1513
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:03,747
Ji Yeon, what are you doing?

1514
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:05,817
- Your hands must be cold.
- I'm scrubbing abalones.

1515
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:10,527
(She's scrubbing the abalones that'll go on the grill.)

1516
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:12,257
Jun Myun...

1517
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,197
told me to grind the garlic cloves here.

1518
01:00:15,897 --> 01:00:17,866
(Grinding the garlic cloves...)

1519
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,367
(is a job that should be done on the bench.)

1520
01:00:19,637 --> 01:00:21,306
(Grinding)

1521
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:23,237
(Scrubbing)

1522
01:00:25,377 --> 01:00:26,736
(For each abalone,)

1523
01:00:26,737 --> 01:00:29,907
(she scrubs about 100 times.)

1524
01:00:31,577 --> 01:00:34,917
(The experienced worker brushes the abalones expertly.)

1525
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:37,547
Go easy on them.

1526
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:40,387
I can't do that when precious guests have come.

1527
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,957
(They're moved.)

1528
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,356
You can't eat such abalones anywhere else.

1529
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:47,857
Look at this abalone. Do you see how big it is?

1530
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:49,927
Isn't it so big and meaty?

1531
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:52,837
It's a precious ingredient.

1532
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:56,107
(These abalones are for the precious guests,)

1533
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:59,737
(so she cleans them with care.)

1534
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:01,746
(In the yard, the master of fire is building a fire.)

1535
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:02,977
(Glancing over)

1536
01:01:03,347 --> 01:01:05,177
Six people should eat this much.

1537
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,387
(I see.)

1538
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:12,056
- What will you make here?
- Rice soup.

1539
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:13,387
(The huge-sized pot appeared for the oyster rice soup.)

1540
01:01:13,687 --> 01:01:14,956
Then... The water...

1541
01:01:14,957 --> 01:01:16,927
It'll contain the entire rice soup.

1542
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,297
(I see that Kyung Ho is surprised.)

1543
01:01:19,997 --> 01:01:22,897
(They begin adding water to the pot.)

1544
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:25,297
Kyung Ho, can you bring them here?

1545
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:27,196
All of these bottles?

1546
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,307
(Each bottle holds 2l of water.)

1547
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:30,367
(Chuckling)

1548
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:33,207
Hey, how can you say that when you've seen the pot?

1549
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:36,046
- Jung Ah, should I add more water?
- Yes. Can you help me?

1550
01:01:36,047 --> 01:01:37,107
(Of course.)

1551
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:41,887
(Bring all the water bottles in the Fresh House.)

1552
01:01:43,517 --> 01:01:46,056
(2l of water)

1553
01:01:46,057 --> 01:01:47,157
There you go.

1554
01:01:48,557 --> 01:01:49,727
How many more bottles should I pour in?

1555
01:01:50,287 --> 01:01:52,127
Just keep pouring for now.

1556
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,257
- More.
- We're nowhere there yet.

1557
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:59,067
(How many 2l water bottles will be emptied into the pot?)

1558
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,866
Four water bottles have been emptied.

1559
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:03,506
(4 2l water bottle)

1560
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:04,707
Was it five?

1561
01:02:05,107 --> 01:02:06,377
It was five.

1562
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:11,277
Hey, we have the stock pack that contains dried pollack.

1563
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:15,747
(Adding radish)

1564
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:21,057
(Boil until the broth becomes flavourful.)

1565
01:02:21,187 --> 01:02:22,857
- Make the fire stronger.
- I'll do that.

1566
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,426
The fire should remain strong for this dish.

1567
01:02:25,427 --> 01:02:26,657
(The broth needs to boil for the oyster rice soup.)

1568
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:28,026
I need to make the fire stronger.

1569
01:02:28,027 --> 01:02:30,596
(To make the fire stronger,)

1570
01:02:30,597 --> 01:02:33,597
(Kyung Ho will use a technique.)

1571
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:36,567
(He uses wicker trays as fans.)

1572
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:41,577
(Fire, burn up.)

1573
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:44,917
(While Kyung Ho is in charge of the fire)

1574
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:46,916
Laver. Hey, what happened to the laver?

1575
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:48,417
Laver? I'll go and check.

1576
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:50,446
(This morning)

1577
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:53,016
(They dried the water laver themselves.)

1578
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:54,787
(Did it dry well?)

1579
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:57,786
(What?)

1580
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:58,957
The laver...

1581
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:02,627
(What about the laver?)

1582
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:04,667
Is it ready?

1583
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:08,166
I don't think it's ready yet.

1584
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:10,306
(Ji Yeon goes over to check on the laver.)

1585
01:03:10,307 --> 01:03:12,037
I don't think this one is ready.

1586
01:03:13,907 --> 01:03:15,047
Is it ready?

1587
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:20,777
(She's unsure even when she touches it.)

1588
01:03:22,217 --> 01:03:24,546
This is... Hey, Jae Wook.

1589
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,587
No.

1590
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:27,286
- Jae Wook.
- I said no.

1591
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:28,586
It isn't like that.

1592
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:31,357
I think some laver sheets are ready while others aren't.

1593
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:33,857
Then we should eat the ones that are ready.

1594
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:35,096
In that case,

1595
01:03:35,097 --> 01:03:37,767
I'll take the ones that look dry.

1596
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:39,297
There are many sheets.

1597
01:03:40,297 --> 01:03:44,336
(Studying the laver sheets)

1598
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:45,507
This one.

1599
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:50,847
(I'll take the dry laver sheets and grill them.)

1600
01:03:51,877 --> 01:03:53,747
I think this one is totally dry.

1601
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:55,517
(Impressed)

1602
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:58,857
(She handpicks the crispiest ones.)

1603
01:04:00,157 --> 01:04:02,157
Jung Ah, we have this much.

1604
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:03,857
(Giggling)

1605
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:05,596
(Laughing)

1606
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:08,057
- So that's what they look like.
- They look ugly.

1607
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:09,427
So that's what they look like.

1608
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:11,697
Do you know why dried laver is called "Gim" in Korean?

1609
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:13,967
It's because of a king.

1610
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:15,707
Why is dried laver called "Gim" in Korean?

1611
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:18,607
One king had dried laver for the first time ever.

1612
01:04:19,277 --> 01:04:20,707
"What's this?"

1613
01:04:20,977 --> 01:04:22,346
"It doesn't have a name, Your Majesty."

1614
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:24,977
"What's the name of the person who brought this?"

1615
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:26,547
"He's from the Gim Family."

1616
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:28,986
- That was how it became "Gim." - Outstanding.

1617
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:30,887
- Are you serious?
- Yes! I heard the story.

1618
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:33,217
- Is that why it's called "Gim?" - Yes.

1619
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:35,186
I think it's true.

1620
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,187
Maybe not.

1621
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:38,426
Let's roast it.

1622
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:41,397
(In any case, Ms. Kim roasts dried laver.)

1623
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:46,537
(How does the roasted laver taste?)

1624
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:49,167
(Curious)

1625
01:04:49,707 --> 01:04:51,337
I think we should roast it more. Try this.

1626
01:04:53,907 --> 01:04:56,047
- It's so precious.
- Right?

1627
01:04:56,947 --> 01:04:58,007
Well done.

1628
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:00,116
Don't mention it.

1629
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:01,476
(The Fresh members worked hard on this dried laver,)

1630
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:02,886
(so I'll roast it further to make it crispy.)

1631
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:03,917
All done.

1632
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,587
- Try it.
- It's crispier.

1633
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:15,797
- It's good, right? Try it.
- Gosh.

1634
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:18,266
For how many years did you sell dried laver?

1635
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:21,166
- I started the business recently.
- I see.

1636
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,637
It's quite popular.

1637
01:05:22,937 --> 01:05:25,536
I sell it as a snack for people who are on a diet.

1638
01:05:25,537 --> 01:05:27,406
- I see.
- That's how healthy it is.

1639
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:28,646
Is there a discount for a celebrity?

1640
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:29,847
Of course.

1641
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,117
Since you're Lady Tae Yeong,

1642
01:05:32,747 --> 01:05:33,817
I'll give you a 70 percent discount.

1643
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,017
A 70 percent discount?

1644
01:05:35,347 --> 01:05:37,847
I'll do that for you. I won't make any profits.

1645
01:05:37,987 --> 01:05:39,786
Shouldn't we do that?

1646
01:05:39,787 --> 01:05:40,987
Shouldn't we sprinkle perilla oil?

1647
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:43,456
- Sesame oil.
- We'll roast it as it is...

1648
01:05:43,457 --> 01:05:44,626
and dip it in the wild chive sauce.

1649
01:05:44,627 --> 01:05:46,457
- Then we can skip that step.
- Yes.

1650
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,597
(She's in charge of the wild chive sauce.)

1651
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:51,367
(Soy sauce is the base.)

1652
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:54,197
(Sesame seeds, tuna fish sauce)

1653
01:05:54,967 --> 01:05:57,837
(She adds chilli powder.)

1654
01:05:58,377 --> 01:05:59,637
(Sesame oil)

1655
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:01,607
(Sugar)

1656
01:06:01,777 --> 01:06:03,507
(Water)

1657
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:06,177
(Wrap up with the key ingredient of the wild chive sauce.)

1658
01:06:07,147 --> 01:06:09,347
(Adding chopped wild chives)

1659
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:12,817
(The wild chive sauce is ready.)

1660
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,056
Is it coming along?

1661
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,527
- Jae Hwa, - Yes?

1662
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:18,556
would you cut the roasted laver into smaller pieces as well?

1663
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,327
Jun Myun, that's included in the process.

1664
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:22,166
You're the best.

1665
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,167
(What a good worker.)

1666
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,827
(Crispy)

1667
01:06:26,697 --> 01:06:29,866
The sizes are different, but please be understanding.

1668
01:06:29,867 --> 01:06:30,867
(She cuts roasted laver and plates the pieces.)

1669
01:06:32,037 --> 01:06:34,037
(What's going on in the yard?)

1670
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,347
(Gosh!)

1671
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:38,447
(Kyung Ho's fanning skill impresses even the master of fire.)

1672
01:06:38,517 --> 01:06:40,076
The fire is strong in this brazier as well.

1673
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:41,276
(Burning strongly)

1674
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:42,317
Nice.

1675
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:44,617
The fire is perfect.

1676
01:06:45,687 --> 01:06:46,986
I can make it so strong that you can't even approach it.

1677
01:06:46,987 --> 01:06:49,657
It's okay. I need to approach it. I need to cook.

1678
01:06:50,827 --> 01:06:53,997
(He becomes flustered.)

1679
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:55,327
Shall I add oil?

1680
01:06:55,567 --> 01:06:57,127
Yes. Why don't you add oil?

1681
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:02,407
(He begins to add oil for the sweet and sour sea bream.)

1682
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:06,806
(The seasoned black sea bream...)

1683
01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:09,647
(gets coated in starch.)

1684
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:13,676
(They begin cooking in earnest.)

1685
01:07:13,677 --> 01:07:15,817
(She takes out the stock pack.)

1686
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:19,156
Don't you need longer chopsticks? Will you be okay?

1687
01:07:19,157 --> 01:07:20,616
- It'll be hot.
- I think I'll be okay.

1688
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:22,927
The fire isn't too strong.

1689
01:07:23,657 --> 01:07:25,227
- It'll be hard to hold it.
- What an idea.

1690
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:26,927
He's smart.

1691
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:28,897
Shall I give it a go?

1692
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:30,796
Go ahead and deep-fry it.

1693
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,697
(Let's deep-fry the black sea bream.)

1694
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:42,147
(He fries it carefully by pouring oil over the surface.)

1695
01:07:45,647 --> 01:07:47,746
(It's a technique in Chinese cuisine...)

1696
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:49,847
(for cooking the outside and inside evenly.)

1697
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:53,517
(Impressed)

1698
01:07:56,257 --> 01:07:57,556
(The appetizing scene captivates Ji Yeon's attention.)

1699
01:07:57,557 --> 01:07:58,756
This is insane.

1700
01:07:58,757 --> 01:08:00,127
(The appetizing scene captivates Ji Yeon's attention.)

1701
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:04,367
What's cooking in the other pot?

1702
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:07,096
- Rice soup.
- Rice soup.

1703
01:08:07,097 --> 01:08:08,367
(I'm seaweed that'll go into the oyster rice soup.)

1704
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:11,977
(She adds the bean sprouts for the refreshing taste.)

1705
01:08:13,337 --> 01:08:16,147
(Now comes the main ingredient of the oyster rice soup.)

1706
01:08:18,347 --> 01:08:20,276
(Here come the oysters.)

1707
01:08:20,277 --> 01:08:22,247
(A lot of oysters!)

1708
01:08:22,987 --> 01:08:26,857
(Cook them thoroughly for the soup with deep tastes.)

1709
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,087
I'll put them on the grill now.

1710
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:34,427
(The oysters appear.)

1711
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:40,067
(They go over the fire.)

1712
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:48,846
(The ingredients that contain the smell of the sea of Wando...)

1713
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:52,747
(are getting cooked today.)

1714
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:56,387
Hold on. Please hold this.

1715
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,417
Thank you.

1716
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:58,447
(They're focused on cooking.)

1717
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,527
I feel like we're having a cooking competition.

1718
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:04,357
No, this is...

1719
01:09:05,027 --> 01:09:07,497
(In that case)

1720
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:08,767
What's this?

1721
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:11,766
- The oysters are getting...
- Okay.

1722
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,797
His voice resembles that of Chef Anh Sung Jae.

1723
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,566
(Watch out for the fake Anh Sung Jae.)

1724
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:16,907
You're cooking them evenly.

1725
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:20,936
You sound so similar.

1726
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:22,647
(He moves on to the next contestant after saying a catchphrase.)

1727
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,277
What's this fish?

1728
01:09:25,847 --> 01:09:27,977
It's a black sea bream I caught today.

1729
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:31,047
What's the name of the dish?

1730
01:09:32,987 --> 01:09:35,657
(Why is he getting nervous when it isn't a real competition?)

1731
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:37,357
Sentimental Black Sea Bream.

1732
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:38,797
Sentimental Black Sea Bream.

1733
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:40,326
It's sentimental.

1734
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:41,996
(They get the name of the dish while doing a skit.)

1735
01:09:41,997 --> 01:09:43,597
(It's Sentimental Black Sea Bream.)

1736
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:47,366
(The third contestant...)

1737
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:49,167
(is Wando Taste Mafia.)

1738
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:53,307
(The judge walks over to Wando Taste Mafia.)

1739
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:55,745
Which dish are you making?

1740
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,374
Oyster rice soup!

1741
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,685
- Oyster rice soup?
- Yes.

1742
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:01,755
(This contestant isn't easy.)

1743
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:03,114
My back hurts.

1744
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:06,025
(The skit ends because the contestant is scarier.)

1745
01:10:06,525 --> 01:10:08,055
Salted shrimp.

1746
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,325
Salted shrimp.

1747
01:10:10,495 --> 01:10:13,394
(She adds salted shrimp.)

1748
01:10:13,395 --> 01:10:15,734
(Then she adds soy sauce.)

1749
01:10:15,735 --> 01:10:18,535
(Then she adds salt.)

1750
01:10:20,305 --> 01:10:24,635
(She stirs the soup to mix the ingredients.)

1751
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:28,345
(Shall I taste it?)

1752
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:30,275
(Slurping)

1753
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,544
(It's good.)

1754
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:33,745
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1755
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:37,255
(How about Jae Wook's sweet and sour sea bream?)

1756
01:10:37,815 --> 01:10:38,854
(Sucking in his breath)

1757
01:10:38,855 --> 01:10:40,185
(Sighing)

1758
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,225
(What is it?)

1759
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,364
I guess the temperature was too low.

1760
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:47,925
The meat is coming off.

1761
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,039
(The skin came off.)

1762
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,040
(The meat is coming off.)

1763
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,240
It's okay. It's just for us.

1764
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,980
(Dejected)

1765
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,850
It doesn't look like a fried dish.

1766
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,480
I don't know what it is.

1767
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:03,950
This is...

1768
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:07,089
I guess the oil wasn't hot enough.

1769
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,120
Oh, no.

1770
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,290
I think it'll break if I try to lift it up.

1771
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,659
(Ruined)

1772
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:17,630
If you cook it longer over high heat,

1773
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:20,930
I think you can save it. Cook it until it turns golden brown.

1774
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:26,540
(Getting ready to save the sweet and sour sea bream)

1775
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:30,655
(Switching to a gas burner for heat control)

1776
01:11:31,611 --> 01:11:34,381
(Jae Wook is heating oil once more.)

1777
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,220
It burns quickly.

1778
01:11:36,221 --> 01:11:38,851
- Once it burns, it opens.
- I see.

1779
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,391
I think it's enough.

1780
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:45,491
(If it opens, then it's cooked.)

1781
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:46,961
This is really big.

1782
01:11:49,731 --> 01:11:51,971
(Grilling abalones)

1783
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:59,541
(Fresh abalone flesh)

1784
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:04,941
(Wriggling)

1785
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:08,751
(Delicate heat control)

1786
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:12,151
(Jung Ah's oyster rice soup is almost ready.)

1787
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:16,061
(Adding a generous scoop of rice to the pot)

1788
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:20,131
(Adding two bigger scoops of rice)

1789
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,131
(Putting all the rice into the pot)

1790
01:12:25,431 --> 01:12:27,871
(Putting it all without any leftover rice)

1791
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:32,640
(Adding eggs)

1792
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:37,081
(Boiling it after adding chives)

1793
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:40,851
It looks delicious.

1794
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:46,491
(Abalones are being cooked nicely.)

1795
01:12:49,361 --> 01:12:52,891
(They absorbed a smoky aroma.)

1796
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,831
(Licking his lips)

1797
01:12:55,761 --> 01:12:58,871
(Looking at them makes him lick his lips.)

1798
01:12:59,271 --> 01:13:00,601
I'll taste it to see if it's cooked well.

1799
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:06,371
(Amazing)

1800
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:11,911
(One more?)

1801
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:17,651
(It's not a taste but more of a meal.)

1802
01:13:18,381 --> 01:13:19,391
(Coughing)

1803
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:23,391
(He ate 2 abalones in a second because they're so good.)

1804
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:24,921
Kyung Ho, something like this one?

1805
01:13:25,761 --> 01:13:26,961
- Yes.
- Is it good enough?

1806
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:29,330
- Good.
- We don't have a bigger plate.

1807
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:30,360
What are you eating now?

1808
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:32,401
- Just to see if it's cooked.
- Is that so?

1809
01:13:34,271 --> 01:13:36,040
It's so good since they're fresh ones.

1810
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,101
(Being in awe)

1811
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:38,371
They are really big.

1812
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:42,381
(Nicely grilled abalone)

1813
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,951
(Jun Myun starts to make sauce for sweet and sour sea bream.)

1814
01:13:46,451 --> 01:13:49,551
(Soy sauce, dark soy sauce, chicken stock, oyster sauce)

1815
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:51,250
It smells so good.

1816
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:52,251
(Making green onion oil)

1817
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:53,920
(Adding the sauce)

1818
01:13:53,921 --> 01:13:55,720
After adding this, it becomes like a sweet and sour sauce.

1819
01:13:55,721 --> 01:13:56,791
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1820
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,891
(Adding black pepper)

1821
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:02,261
(Sauce for sweet and sour sea bream is almost done.)

1822
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:04,400
(Could he save sweet and sour sea bream?)

1823
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:06,500
Please come on. Please.

1824
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:08,271
Be careful. It could fall apart.

1825
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:10,801
It looks much better.

1826
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:12,911
It didn't fall apart, at least.

1827
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:20,981
(It became golden brown over high heat.)

1828
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:31,821
So, heat is really important.

1829
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:33,791
- It's not easy to cook on the fire.
- It's not.

1830
01:14:35,361 --> 01:14:36,431
Thanks a lot, Jung Ah.

1831
01:14:37,701 --> 01:14:38,731
Thanks for helping me.

1832
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:42,271
We made it anyway.

1833
01:14:42,971 --> 01:14:46,010
Where is the nicest and biggest plate?

1834
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:47,171
- For the fish.
- The nicest plate?

1835
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:50,510
- I'll put the fish on this.
- I see. So you put this first.

1836
01:14:50,511 --> 01:14:51,841
(On the big plate for sweet and sour sea bream)

1837
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:57,081
(Plating shredded green onions)

1838
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:05,931
(Jung Ah's oyster rice soup is done after boiling for a long time.)

1839
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:10,261
It looks so good.

1840
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:12,371
- It has to be delicious.
- Yes.

1841
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:15,430
- What is this, Jun Myun?
- It's oyster rice soup.

1842
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:16,440
(1 ttukbaegi of the hot soup per person)

1843
01:15:16,441 --> 01:15:17,601
This is awesome.

1844
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:21,441
(Placing it on the table)

1845
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:24,281
(Steaming hot)

1846
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:28,281
- Jun Myun. This is so good.
- Yes.

1847
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:30,551
- Bring it to the table.
- Yes.

1848
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:34,750
I'm sorry. Can you drizzle a little sesame oil?

1849
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:35,920
- Sesame oil?
- Sesame oil. Okay.

1850
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:37,261
- I'm sorry.
- Put it all back in the pot.

1851
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:38,991
I see. Okay.

1852
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,130
- Put it back.
- Okay.

1853
01:15:40,131 --> 01:15:41,360
- Bring sesame oil.
- Yes, sesame oil.

1854
01:15:41,361 --> 01:15:42,800
- We need to put it back.
- Are you adding sesame oil here?

1855
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:44,831
- Yes.
- Drizzle a little sesame oil.

1856
01:15:45,231 --> 01:15:47,100
- Okay. That ttukbaegi.
- Here is sesame oil.

1857
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:49,571
Can you give me that ttukbaegi?

1858
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:51,701
Thanks.

1859
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:54,440
(To oyster rice soup)

1860
01:15:54,441 --> 01:15:56,580
(Adding a nutty flavour)

1861
01:15:56,581 --> 01:15:57,581
It's nice.

1862
01:15:58,311 --> 01:16:00,781
- We handed it over.
- Why? Oh, okay.

1863
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:06,721
(Putting it in a ttukbaegi again)

1864
01:16:07,221 --> 01:16:09,491
Next, Jae Hwa. Come on. Hurry.

1865
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:12,531
(Running)

1866
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:15,391
(Relay race for oyster rice soup)

1867
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:16,401
Come on.

1868
01:16:17,901 --> 01:16:18,901
Come on, Jae Hwa.

1869
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:22,030
Yes.

1870
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:23,070
(After putting one scoop)

1871
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:25,070
Get ready. You'd better get ready.

1872
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:26,771
Ready. Get ready.

1873
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:30,141
We keep going back and forth, bringing only one bowl each time.

1874
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:32,140
- Okay.
- Hurry.

1875
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:33,951
This is somehow...

1876
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:37,980
- Ready.
- I'm not sure why it feels unfair.

1877
01:16:37,981 --> 01:16:39,820
No, this is really good.

1878
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,251
(After running the relay race for oyster rice soup)

1879
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:42,790
The oil might splash.

1880
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,791
(It's time to plate the sweet and sour sea bream.)

1881
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:51,331
(Placing fried black sea bream on the shredded green onions)

1882
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:55,030
Look at this.

1883
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:59,171
(Drizzling sweet and sour sauce on top)

1884
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:05,511
(Glazing)

1885
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:11,080
(Sprinkling sesame seeds)

1886
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:13,021
(It's done.)

1887
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:15,420
- Jun Myun. You're amazing.
- Why?

1888
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:16,920
- You were awesome.
- You were like a maestro.

1889
01:17:16,921 --> 01:17:18,260
- It was nothing.
- You were like a great maestro.

1890
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:19,261
- Jun Myun.
- Yes?

1891
01:17:19,262 --> 01:17:20,490
You looked relaxed and luxurious.

1892
01:17:20,491 --> 01:17:22,331
That's not true. It's always like a battle.

1893
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,960
- This was a lot.
- It's always like this.

1894
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,601
(Let's enjoy the food.)

1895
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:27,331
You did a good job.

1896
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:29,070
It looks so delicious.

1897
01:17:29,071 --> 01:17:30,641
(Excited even more for dinner today because of the effort they put in)

1898
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:33,940
(Jae Wook smells the oyster rice soup first.)

1899
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,741
Jung Ah, it smells like oyster spicy noodle soup.

1900
01:17:37,211 --> 01:17:38,441
(Is that so?)

1901
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,351
(Jung Ah smells the oyster rice soup, too.)

1902
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,180
(Kyung Ho and Ji Yeon smell the oyster rice soup.)

1903
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:44,181
(Good)

1904
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:47,791
(Jung Ah's oyster rice soup with seaweed and ocean scent)

1905
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:52,021
(Crispy roasted laver that they collected and dried themselves)

1906
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:55,661
(Wild chive sauce that goes well with roasted laver)

1907
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:58,300
(Abalones from Wando that were grilled over fire)

1908
01:17:58,301 --> 01:18:00,771
(And grilled oysters)

1909
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:05,471
(Crunchy, sweet, and sour sea bream)

1910
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:10,011
(Today's seasonal dinner, filled with the spring of Wando)

1911
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,380
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

1912
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:14,051
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

1913
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:17,321
(Jae Wook fell for the smell of oyster rice soup.)

1914
01:18:19,451 --> 01:18:21,421
(Slurping)

1915
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:23,191
(So good)

1916
01:18:23,221 --> 01:18:25,661
(Its flavour makes him smile.)

1917
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,431
(One more spoon right away)

1918
01:18:30,661 --> 01:18:33,601
(Jun Myun tries it.)

1919
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:35,701
It's so good, Jung Ah.

1920
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:37,901
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1921
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:41,271
(Jae Hwa is blowing on it to cool it down.)

1922
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:42,410
(Eating it)

1923
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:45,081
- So good.
- This is really good.

1924
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:47,051
It's good.

1925
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:49,320
- I like that it has many oysters.
- Yes.

1926
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:50,321
It tastes great.

1927
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:52,250
It's tasty, and it also has a lot of nutrients.

1928
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:53,251
(Rich flavour with a lot of oysters from Wando)

1929
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:01,961
(Kyung Ho is eating it with seaweed and bean sprouts.)

1930
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:07,200
(Impressed)

1931
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,201
Jung Ah, you really are...

1932
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:10,441
the best cook.

1933
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:13,471
(Being proud)

1934
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:15,841
(Kyung Ho fell for Jung Ah's food.)

1935
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:19,681
(Slurping the oyster rice soup)

1936
01:19:31,961 --> 01:19:35,361
(While eating the oyster rice soup)

1937
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:38,700
(Becoming the judge again)

1938
01:19:38,701 --> 01:19:41,071
- Because you added bean sprouts, - Yes.

1939
01:19:41,171 --> 01:19:44,070
the soup had more texture, which I like.

1940
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,240
- Radishes made it taste clean.
- Yes.

1941
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:47,271
Yes.

1942
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:50,141
The oysters and seaweed are good.

1943
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:55,881
I've never seen any place with soup that has so many ingredients.

1944
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:58,281
I've never had something like this.

1945
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:01,121
I think we could sell it.

1946
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:05,361
We can't find this high quality anywhere.

1947
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:09,760
(I should eat more.)

1948
01:20:09,761 --> 01:20:11,631
- I'll send you the recipe.
- Thanks.

1949
01:20:11,861 --> 01:20:13,301
(I'd love that!)

1950
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:15,470
This is so good.

1951
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:16,471
(Jun Myun tastes the laver she dried herself.)

1952
01:20:16,472 --> 01:20:18,241
(Folding the roasted laver)

1953
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:20,771
(Dipping it in wild chive sauce)

1954
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:22,271
(Eating it)

1955
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:24,241
(Crunchy)

1956
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:27,781
(savouring it)

1957
01:20:27,881 --> 01:20:29,951
(I can't believe its flavour.)

1958
01:20:30,021 --> 01:20:31,520
I can't believe how the laver tastes.

1959
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:32,821
Yes, it's so good.

1960
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,621
We made this.

1961
01:20:34,951 --> 01:20:35,961
You're amazing.

1962
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:39,361
(Jae Wook tastes one, too.)

1963
01:20:41,991 --> 01:20:44,200
This is so good.

1964
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:46,671
(We made this!)

1965
01:20:47,631 --> 01:20:49,900
(Jung Ah is eating it with wild chive sauce.)

1966
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:50,901
(Good)

1967
01:20:50,902 --> 01:20:53,641
(Nodding with satisfaction)

1968
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:56,040
It's so interesting that it turned out like this.

1969
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,241
It has a rich flavour.

1970
01:20:58,211 --> 01:20:59,580
It tastes good because it's thick.

1971
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,551
(The laver is more crispy and savoury because it's thick.)

1972
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:04,550
It tastes so good with wild chive sauce.

1973
01:21:04,551 --> 01:21:05,851
(Seasoning Park's wild chive sauce is perfect with the laver.)

1974
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:08,520
(Eating it)

1975
01:21:08,521 --> 01:21:10,420
(Eating it more)

1976
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:15,831
(She keeps eating it.)

1977
01:21:18,731 --> 01:21:20,171
How many pieces of roasted laver have you eaten?

1978
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:22,771
I think you've eaten about 50.

1979
01:21:23,441 --> 01:21:26,140
(Jun Myun loves the roasted laver she made herself.)

1980
01:21:26,141 --> 01:21:27,141
The roasted laver is so tasty.

1981
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,311
(Meanwhile, Kyung Ho is obsessed with the oyster rice soup.)

1982
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:33,051
(He drinks it from the ttukbaegi.)

1983
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,981
(My goodness)

1984
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:37,781
It's so tasty.

1985
01:21:37,782 --> 01:21:38,821
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1986
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,591
(Clean)

1987
01:21:41,891 --> 01:21:44,790
(After finishing the soup, Kyung Ho spots something.)

1988
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:46,090
Abalones are very tasty too.

1989
01:21:46,091 --> 01:21:47,391
(Abalones)

1990
01:21:47,561 --> 01:21:48,790
But other dishes are so tasty.

1991
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:50,561
(How do the abalones Kyung Ho grilled with care taste?)

1992
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:52,670
(I'll try the dish.)

1993
01:21:52,671 --> 01:21:54,931
- I'll try the abalones.
- Shall I eat one?

1994
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:58,841
- It's quite meaty.
- It's big.

1995
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,870
(The abalones of Wando are so meaty...)

1996
01:22:01,871 --> 01:22:03,681
(that you can't put the whole thing in your mouth.)

1997
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:05,981
(Chewy)

1998
01:22:06,711 --> 01:22:08,281
(Impressed)

1999
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:12,081
(The grilled abalones have a smoky flavour, thanks to the fire.)

2000
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:18,461
(The king-sized abalones are tender because they've been cooked evenly.)

2001
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:21,161
(Sucking)

2002
01:22:21,431 --> 01:22:23,661
(He can taste the sea of Wando in his mouth.)

2003
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:25,831
(Proud)

2004
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:28,700
(Kyung Ho's next target is...)

2005
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:29,741
(the sweet and sour sea bream.)

2006
01:22:31,901 --> 01:22:33,410
(He takes a bite of the sweet and sour sea bream...)

2007
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:36,141
(and shredded green onions.)

2008
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:40,381
(The fish master becomes nervous.)

2009
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:43,451
The sweet and sour sea bream...

2010
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:45,651
is a proper dish.

2011
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:49,091
(I'm so glad that I saved it.)

2012
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:51,191
- How tasty is it?
- Jae Wook...

2013
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,390
- It's amazing.
- Yes.

2014
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,660
It's really tasty with the sauce...

2015
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,461
and shredded green onions.

2016
01:22:59,001 --> 01:23:00,271
The flavours fill your mouth.

2017
01:23:02,031 --> 01:23:03,240
I don't know how to describe it.

2018
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:05,971
(The meeting of the crispy coating and sweet and sour sauce)

2019
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:08,940
(The aroma of the shredded green onions...)

2020
01:23:08,941 --> 01:23:10,311
(completes the dish.)

2021
01:23:15,681 --> 01:23:16,751
It's so tasty.

2022
01:23:16,881 --> 01:23:17,951
Is it tasty?

2023
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:21,650
(Eating shredded green onions as if they're noodles.)

2024
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:23,461
(Slurping)

2025
01:23:26,161 --> 01:23:28,260
(The chef behind the dish, Jae Wook also tries a bite.)

2026
01:23:28,261 --> 01:23:30,031
(Satisfied)

2027
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:34,801
(Ji Yeon rolls up her sleeves to eat in earnest.)

2028
01:23:35,631 --> 01:23:39,041
(The tasty dish makes you reach for more.)

2029
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:45,341
(This time, she brings a big piece with the bones attached.)

2030
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:48,581
(Then she gnaws on it.)

2031
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:50,880
(Deboning a black sea bream)

2032
01:23:50,881 --> 01:23:53,121
(Clean)

2033
01:23:53,691 --> 01:23:56,591
(Upon seeing that, Jae Wook reaches for the fish.)

2034
01:23:57,221 --> 01:24:01,431
(Pulling)

2035
01:24:03,361 --> 01:24:04,930
- Really?
- Yes. The colour is pretty.

2036
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:06,130
It's the meat.

2037
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:07,431
(The chef gives them a show of removing the main bone.)

2038
01:24:07,701 --> 01:24:10,801
(Ji Yeon eats comfortably thanks to Jae Wook.)

2039
01:24:11,871 --> 01:24:12,871
It's tasty, right?

2040
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:14,841
This fish is so tasty.

2041
01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:17,280
The fish is no joke.

2042
01:24:17,281 --> 01:24:19,850
- The meat.
- The meat is no joke.

2043
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:21,150
There aren't many bones. It's easy to remove them.

2044
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:23,821
And this sauce is perfect.

2045
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,951
(Ji Yeon is totally charmed by the black sea bream dish.)

2046
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:33,491
(Savouring the sauce)

2047
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:37,801
(She approves of it.)

2048
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:39,801
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

2049
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:43,840
(She eats the very last piece.)

2050
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:44,941
You eat with gusto.

2051
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:47,871
- It suits your taste.
- Yes.

2052
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:49,641
I see.

2053
01:24:50,811 --> 01:24:52,211
It's so tasty.

2054
01:24:52,381 --> 01:24:53,810
It totally suits my taste.

2055
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:54,811
(Ji Yeon fell in love with the black sea bream dish.)

2056
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:55,850
(Ji Yeon, the sea bream enthusiast)

2057
01:24:55,851 --> 01:24:58,051
(Jun Myun, the laver enthusiast)

2058
01:24:58,951 --> 01:25:01,250
The ingredients we caught...

2059
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,961
- The ingredients we harvested.
- The ingredients we harvested...

2060
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:04,720
are really tasty.

2061
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:05,961
They're fresh off the sea.

2062
01:25:06,091 --> 01:25:07,291
Seriously.

2063
01:25:08,031 --> 01:25:10,101
(The plentiful dinner gets wrapped up.)

2064
01:25:14,131 --> 01:25:15,771
Jung Ah, after dinner,

2065
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:18,100
let's decide on who'll do the dishes.

2066
01:25:18,101 --> 01:25:19,440
Yes. Let's do something.

2067
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:20,571
- Let's play a game.
- Yes.

2068
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,441
Who will do the dishes?

2069
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:23,780
One person will be picked.

2070
01:25:23,781 --> 01:25:24,781
(Only one person will be it!)

2071
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:25,840
All right.

2072
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:27,311
The table reminds me of this.

2073
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:30,950
- The water bottle has a cap, right?
- Shall we see who can send it far?

2074
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:33,651
Let's flick it from the end. If it goes out, you lose.

2075
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:36,121
Let's see who can put it closest to the edge.

2076
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:37,560
Let's see who can send it the furthest.

2077
01:25:37,561 --> 01:25:38,720
- It'll be like alkkagi.
- Yes.

2078
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:39,760
- Let's play.
- Okay.

2079
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:41,091
Gosh, I'll do the dishes again.

2080
01:25:41,361 --> 01:25:42,531
I'm bad at such games.

2081
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:44,761
Shall I be your black knight?

2082
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:46,231
Will you play in her stead?

2083
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:47,531
Are you that good at the game?

2084
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,170
- I mean...
- Who are you to do it?

2085
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:52,040
- I mean...
- Who are you to be my black knight?

2086
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,540
I won't play in your stead.

2087
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,170
- No matter what...
- She'll take on the outcome.

2088
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:56,710
To make a game fun...

2089
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:57,880
(They made...)

2090
01:25:57,881 --> 01:25:59,340
(the most number of dishes.)

2091
01:25:59,341 --> 01:26:00,480
(The purgatory of dirty dishes)

2092
01:26:00,481 --> 01:26:01,750
It won't be easy.

2093
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:03,050
There are so many dirty dishes today.

2094
01:26:03,051 --> 01:26:04,051
(The pit of dirty dishes, Season 2)

2095
01:26:04,052 --> 01:26:05,351
Everyone is thinking,

2096
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:07,750
"There are six people. It can't be me."

2097
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,021
- Yes.
- Everyone is thinking that, right?

2098
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:11,645
(It'll be good...)

2099
01:26:11,646 --> 01:26:13,745
(as long as it isn't...)

2100
01:26:13,746 --> 01:26:15,976
(me.)

2101
01:26:17,446 --> 01:26:18,686
(What will be the result?)

2102
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:20,685
(Who will fall...)

2103
01:26:20,686 --> 01:26:23,086
(into the pit of dirty dishes?)

2104
01:26:23,148 --> 01:26:24,607
(A way to escape the pit of dirty dishes)

2105
01:26:24,608 --> 01:26:26,277
(Don't go over the line.)

2106
01:26:26,278 --> 01:26:27,878
(Stage 1: Suspicion)

2107
01:26:28,678 --> 01:26:31,018
(Stage 2: Diversion)

2108
01:26:31,588 --> 01:26:33,087
(Stage 3:)

2109
01:26:33,088 --> 01:26:34,758
(Attack)

2110
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:37,258
(The game of chaos, shock, and devastation will unfold.)

2111
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,628
(What will be their fate?)

2112
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:41,528
(After the pit of dirty dishes comes the paradise of birthday.)

2113
01:26:42,528 --> 01:26:44,228
(Fool Jun Myun! Operation Birthday Party)

2114
01:26:44,768 --> 01:26:46,537
(Whenever they try to have a strategic meeting,)

2115
01:26:46,538 --> 01:26:48,138
(the birthday girl appears.)

2116
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:50,467
(No matter where they hide,)

2117
01:26:50,468 --> 01:26:52,137
(and no matter where they hide the ingredient,)

2118
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:53,377
(they face the danger of getting caught.)

2119
01:26:53,378 --> 01:26:54,907
(Why did you buy the pancake mix?)

2120
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:58,178
(They must avoid Jun Myun's radar...)

2121
01:26:58,608 --> 01:27:01,217
(and carry out Operation Birthday Party.)

2122
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:02,717
(In danger...)

2123
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,048
(of getting caught)

2124
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:08,758
(Will they succeed in throwing her a surprise birthday party?)

2125
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:12,088
(They visit a place in spring, the season of cherry blossoms.)

2126
01:27:12,688 --> 01:27:14,027
(The third location,)

2127
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,728
(Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province)

2128
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,567
(The first springtime ingredient the Fresh members will work on)

2129
01:27:17,568 --> 01:27:20,268
(Scallion)

2130
01:27:21,268 --> 01:27:24,738
(Their first work in the field goes smoothly...)

2131
01:27:25,338 --> 01:27:27,007
(or so they thought.)

2132
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,137
(They sit on the scallions.)

2133
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:31,577
(They break the scallions.)

2134
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:36,048
(The chaotic scallion harvest will begin.)
