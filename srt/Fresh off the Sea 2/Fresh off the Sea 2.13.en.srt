1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:03,332
(Shall we prepare the vegetables for the snail gangdoenjang?)

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:06,832
(Cutting Cheongyang peppers for spiciness)

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:09,172
(Slicing green onions)

4
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:11,641
(Mushroom, onion, potato, and zucchini)

5
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:14,402
(Dicing the ingredients into small pieces for texture.)

6
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,112
I like the relaxing atmosphere.

7
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,181
(She feels comfortable about making breakfast in a relaxed way.)

8
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:23,352
How many sea snails will they catch?

9
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,422
(They finished preparing the ingredients during the wait.)

10
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:31,892
(I'm back, Jung Ah.)

11
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:35,192
We drove the sea snails to extinction.

12
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:37,761
- Did you catch all of them? - We drove them to extinction.

13
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,701
- Well done. - There are no sea snails now.

14
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:40,832
(Proud)

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,802
You don't disappoint.

16
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,441
Ji Yeon caught about five.

17
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:47,371
I caught about two-thirds of them,

18
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,972
- and they caught the rest. - What are you talking about?

19
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,611
Do we take out the meat with a toothpick?

20
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,042
A small fork works as well.

21
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,612
(Firstly, )

22
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:59,352
(he rinses the sea snails with water many times.)

23
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,191
(Step 2. He uses saltwater...)

24
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:06,292
(to boil the sea snails.)

25
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:10,861
(To take out the meat easily, )

26
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,201
(the sea snails get boiled in saltwater.)

27
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,402
(This process sterilizes the sea snails too.)

28
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,402
(Step 3. The boiled sea snails get rinsed for the 2nd time.)

29
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:27,242
(What is he making with a fork during the wait?)

30
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,281
(To take out the sea snail meat, )

31
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,011
I'm making tools.

32
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,352
(the high-technology hook fork is made.)

33
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,021
Let's go.

34
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:36,252
(Dex, let's go.)

35
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,892
(Shall we take out the sea snail meat?)

36
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:44,562
(He takes out the meat with Dex's high-technology tool.)

37
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,072
(Taking out)

38
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,172
It works well.

39
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,502
It feels nice when it comes out well.

40
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,811
The quantity will be bigger than we expected.

41
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:56,911
- There's so much meat. - Yes.

42
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,511
It's my first time seeing such big sea snails.

43
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,011
They're quite meaty.

44
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:05,352
(Plump sea snail meat is hidden inside the small shell.)

45
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:06,522
It's big.

46
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:10,152
(Plump)

47
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,822
Is it coming along?

48
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:14,521
They're quite meaty, Jung Ah.

49
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:15,562
(Impressed)

50
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,402
(Ji Yeon joins them.)

51
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,671
How do you do it?

52
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:22,972
- Use the tool... - Okay.

53
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,302
To do this.

54
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,002
(Impressed)

55
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,571
It's meatier than I expected.

56
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,012
- Right? - Yes.

57
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:32,441
It's surprising.

58
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,882
(Ji Yeon pulls out the meat.)

59
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,812
It's meatier than I expected.

60
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:38,582
It has the smell of...

61
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:40,881
- The smell of the sea. - It has the smell of the sea...

62
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,022
despite being tiny.

63
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,591
Maybe we should've caught more.

64
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,062
What we have should be enough, right?

65
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:53,202
(They'll be enough since they're meaty.)

66
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:59,502
(Every meat she pulls out is plump.)

67
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:02,072
(It's meaty, right?)

68
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:05,981
(The three sea snail siblings catch and clean the seafood.)

69
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:08,011
All done.

70
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,552
(They're done cleaning the sea snails.)

71
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:14,452
(As Leader Yum ordered, they got a fistful of sea snails.)

72
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,052
It's all done.

73
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:23,162
(Steamed cabbage is ready for snail gangdoenjang.)

74
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,632
We'll cool it down and eat it.

75
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:31,331
- We'll spread gangdoenjang on it. - Yes.

76
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,442
(We'll spread gangdoenjang on the cabbage.)

77
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:33,941
This is it.

78
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,671
(The big cabbage has been steamed to perfection.)

79
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,142
We just need to cool it down.

80
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,112
(Impressed)

81
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:42,511
- I like cabbage so much. - Do you like cabbage?

82
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,882
I love the sea breeze mugwort caramel.

83
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:47,121
It's totally my style.

84
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:49,822
You should like cabbage, Jin Young.

85
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,691
- Take it. There are many things... - I'll get all of them...

86
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:52,922
you should take home later.

87
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,632
I'll get all of them when I go home later.

88
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,361
Jung Ah, will you cook gangdoenjang now?

89
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,302
- I plan to cook gangdoenjang. - Now?

90
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,802
(Now!)

91
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,472
(Shall we begin making snail gangdoenjang?)

92
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:11,742
(Stir-fry the diced onions first.)

93
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,982
- You're caramelizing it. - Yes, I'm caramelizing it.

94
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,652
You're very knowledgeable.

95
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,981
Caramelizing is basic knowledge...

96
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:22,222
for someone who cooks.

97
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,691
Do you know what caramelizing is?

98
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,121
(Do you know what caramelizing is?)

99
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:28,232
I only know about Yeosu's sea breeze mugwort caramel.

100
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,432
(Stir-fry the onion as if you're caramelizing it.)

101
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:36,072
(Minced garlic gets added.)

102
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:40,802
(Stir-fry the remaining vegetables as well.)

103
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:44,311
Let's add the sea snails.

104
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,481
(The sea snails get added.)

105
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,542
Stir-fry them.

106
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,922
(Shall I stir-fry them in earnest?)

107
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:58,292
(The former youngest member works the wok with strength.)

108
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,062
Your skills have improved.

109
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,132
You're good.

110
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,832
I didn't have the skills to work on the wok before.

111
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:13,972
Back then, I was busy building a fire.

112
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,441
I used to be Kim Stove.

113
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,011
(Dex, the man who only built a fire in the past, )

114
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:20,312
(has changed.)

115
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,452
(Encore)

116
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:29,951
Stir-fry the ingredients. Then we'll add water and doenjang.

117
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:30,952
Okay.

118
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,522
(Water gets added to the stir-fried snails and vegetables.)

119
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,332
(Sugar)

120
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:39,701
(Doenjang)

121
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,262
(2 big spoonfuls)

122
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:44,031
(Chili powder)

123
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,102
Let's make the fire stronger.

124
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:50,171
Cook it until it becomes thick.

125
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:51,742
- I need to reduce it, right? - Yes.

126
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,042
It smells good.

127
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,481
(Jun Myun is making a side dish that goes well with rice.)

128
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,651
The water is boiling. I need to boil these eggs.

129
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,651
(Why does she need eggs?)

130
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,552
(Why does she need boiled eggs?)

131
00:06:05,592 --> 00:06:07,892
(Boiling the eggs)

132
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,961
(Once the eggs are boiled, )

133
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,272
(Ji Yeon peels them.)

134
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,472
What are those for?

135
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,612
- It's for eating. - That wasn't what I asked.

136
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:26,611
Of course, they're for eating. They won't be cow fodder.

137
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,242
(Ji Yeon laughs when Dex is incredulous.)

138
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:29,712
Can you do this?

139
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:31,852
(Fancy)

140
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,722
You can't, right?

141
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,991
Hey, I'm Pancake Im. That's a basic skill.

142
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:39,162
Right.

143
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,732
(Pancake Im exaggerated her skills.)

144
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:45,632
Ji Yeon calls herself Pancake Im.

145
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,471
Isn't it cute that she's proud of herself?

146
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:49,472
Yes, it's cute.

147
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:53,602
(The childish Ji Yeon and Dex are cute.)

148
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:56,441
Jun Myun, I peeled all the eggs.

149
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:58,311
You did a great job. Ji Yeon,

150
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,341
would you peel some garlic bulbs?

151
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:01,342
Okay.

152
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:06,152
(Seasoning Park's side dish contains eggs and garlic.)

153
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:09,992
(The younger members sit together and peel garlic.)

154
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:13,862
What?

155
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:15,992
It's rotten.

156
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:17,862
It's rotten, right?

157
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:21,062
It's rotten. I grabbed a rotten one.

158
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,932
Okay then.

159
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:25,142
"It's rotten."

160
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,402
"It's rotten."

161
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,912
(Punishing)

162
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:35,651
- Are you an elementary schooler? - Work fast.

163
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:39,122
- Peel the garlic fast. Gosh. - For goodness' sake.

164
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,022
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

165
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,122
We aren't playing house. For goodness' sake.

166
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,892
(Chuckling)

167
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:49,362
(Obedient)

168
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,262
(They focus on peeling the garlic once more.)

169
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:54,132
(Meanwhile, Jun Myun makes the seasoning for the side dish.)

170
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,672
(What will she make with eggs to go alongside the rice?)

171
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:58,972
(Jin soy sauce)

172
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,001
(She adds condiments for umami.)

173
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,142
(Tuna fish sauce, cooking wine)

174
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:05,482
(Oligosaccharide)

175
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:09,152
(She adds whole chili peppers as well.)

176
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,352
(The main ingredient goes in.)

177
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:18,222
(The eggs and shiitake mushrooms get a soy sauce shower.)

178
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:23,692
(She adds the whole garlic cloves Ji Yeon and Jae Wook peeled.)

179
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:29,232
(Jun Myun's side dish for rice, egg and shiitake mushroom jangjorim)

180
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:35,242
(Boil it until all the ingredients are braised in soy sauce.)

181
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:36,872
It smells delicious.

182
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,112
It looks tasty.

183
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:41,882
I need to taste it.

184
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:45,322
(Interim check)

185
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,252
(Slurping)

186
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,291
(How is the taste of the soy sauce seasoning?)

187
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,362
It's sweet.

188
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:54,962
(Oh, my)

189
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,132
- It's tasty. - It's like that.

190
00:08:57,462 --> 00:09:00,732
Gosh, I could eat five bowls of rice with this.

191
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,431
I could eat five bowls of rice with the sauce.

192
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:04,432
- Gosh. - Just the sauce.

193
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,701
- We have all the dishes... - Shall we try one?

194
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,942
That go well with rice.

195
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:10,572
Let's get some sauce.

196
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:16,112
(He takes a bite of an egg that has been braised in the sauce.)

197
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:18,922
(No words are needed.)

198
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,452
How did you make it so tasty?

199
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,822
(One more bite)

200
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,461
It's a work of art. We could take this sauce home...

201
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:30,991
and add quail eggs.

202
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:32,731
- Of course. - It could be boiled again.

203
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,932
- Yes. - Yes.

204
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,671
It's amazing.

205
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,742
(Egg and shiitake mushroom jangjorim is coming along.)

206
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,472
(Shall we wrap up the snail gangdoenjang?)

207
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,042
(She adds oligosaccharide to bump up the sweetness.)

208
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,912
(Lastly, she makes a circle with sesame oil.)

209
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,552
Set the table.

210
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:56,022
(Today's first menu to go alongside the rice)

211
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:01,022
(She scoops out an ample amount of the snail gangdoenjang.)

212
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,392
It looks tasty.

213
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:10,272
(The second menu to go alongside the rice)

214
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:15,811
(He also scoops out an ample amount...)

215
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:18,682
(of egg and shiitake mushroom jangjorim.)

216
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,582
(He moves his hands carefully so that he won't miss a drop.)

217
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,322
(2 menus to go alongside the rice are set on the table.)

218
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,392
Ji Yeon, give me the soup bowls.

219
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,161
(The tofu and salted shrimp soup is for Dex, the tofu lover.)

220
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,801
It looks tasty.

221
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,732
(The tofu and salted shrimp soup is for Dex, the tofu lover.)

222
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:48,842
(Tofu and soup fill up the bowl.)

223
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,171
- Please give me a lot of tofu. - Okay.

224
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,612
I'll give you a lot of tofu.

225
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,712
A lot of tofu for Ji Yeon.

226
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:57,152
- A lot of tofu. - A lot of tofu.

227
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:01,051
I'm sorry, but this is mine.

228
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,892
(It has a double portion of tofu.)

229
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,822
- Fine. - Did you close it?

230
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:08,061
It contains a lot of tofu.

231
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,332
- Watch your hands. It's mine. - Whose is it?

232
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:13,862
(Dex enters the kitchen.)

233
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:16,601
(He gets more rice before eating.)

234
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:18,572
(A big bowl of rice)

235
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:21,402
(Oh, my)

236
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:24,211
I can't help it because of your jangjorim.

237
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,272
It looks so good.

238
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,841
How did you guys cook so quickly?

239
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,882
It's always like that.

240
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,252
It just hit me.

241
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,022
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

242
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,051
- Let's eat. - Enjoy the food.

243
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:36,322
Thank you for the food.

244
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:40,991
(The tofu lover, Dex, tries the tofu and salted shrimp soup.)

245
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,792
I can't get this taste in Seoul.

246
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:45,331
I can't get this taste at a restaurant.

247
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,402
It's a home-cooked meal.

248
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,702
Enjoy it while you're here. You can't eat much in Seoul.

249
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:53,902
(Jung Ah's home-cooked food)

250
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:57,711
(The 2nd tofu lover, Ji Yeon eats a big spoonful of tofu.)

251
00:11:57,712 --> 00:11:59,142
The soup is refreshing.

252
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,642
- I seasoned it with salted shrimp. - Yes.

253
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,651
It's like a hangover soup.

254
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,452
(It stimulates their appetite with a refreshing and clean taste.)

255
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,392
(The cabbage killer gets to work!)

256
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,262
(She picks up a big piece of cabbage...)

257
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:15,222
(and adds a bit of the snail gangdoenjang.)

258
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:19,331
(She bites into it.)

259
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,602
It's snail gangdoenjang.

260
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,931
(She enjoys the cabbage wrap...)

261
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,572
(that's dipped in the snail gangdoenjang.)

262
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,042
I can feel the sea snail.

263
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,042
(They can chew the chewy sea snail meat.)

264
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:30,412
Right?

265
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,212
We put a lot of work into it.

266
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:34,882
(Oh, my)

267
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,612
Jung Ah, the snail gangdoenjang is so tasty.

268
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,422
- You can bite into it, right? - Yes.

269
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:43,552
(Meanwhile, the cabbage killer, Jun Myun)

270
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,222
(She eats...)

271
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:48,392
(and eats.)

272
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,432
(Then she eats some more.)

273
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,761
(The cabbage is sweet.)

274
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,902
Jung Ah, it's so tasty.

275
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:59,841
(Jung Ah enjoys it as well.)

276
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:02,572
Jae Wook cleaned them for a while.

277
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:05,711
The crunchy cabbage is nice.

278
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:06,782
Yes, it's nice.

279
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:10,352
(Dex tries the second side dish, egg and shiitake mushroom jangjorim.)

280
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,221
It looks tasty.

281
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:13,681
(He cuts the egg in half.)

282
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:16,592
I'll get some sauce as well. It goes well with rice.

283
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:20,521
(He eats it all in one bite.)

284
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:21,522
(Gosh)

285
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,332
Jun Myun, the jangjorim is so tasty.

286
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:26,862
Do you want to take some home?

287
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,302
I scooped out everything.

288
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,001
- Did you scoop out everything? - Yes.

289
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,302
(Do you know why?)

290
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:38,172
(I'll eat everything now.)

291
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,112
(1 egg)

292
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,512
(2 eggs)

293
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,452
(Even after that, )

294
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,122
(he takes another egg with the last one still in his mouth.)
(His cheeks are full.)

295
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,252
(Eating)

296
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,222
(Dex, will you eat another egg?)

297
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:56,692
(Dex's egg-eating show doesn't end.)

298
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,692
You eat more than I expected.

299
00:13:58,802 --> 00:13:59,931
He eats well.

300
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,972
(Ji Yeon agrees that Dex is a man who eats well.)

301
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,631
Coming here brings my appetite back.

302
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:05,742
It stimulates your appetite.

303
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:10,572
(On this day, Dex ate 6 out of the 15 eggs.)

304
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:13,242
(He had a mountain of rice.)

305
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,052
(Empty)

306
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:18,682
What will you make for dinner today?

307
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:22,151
- Grey mullet. - Grey mullet.

308
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,492
We'll make sashimi and fish cutlets with grey mullets.

309
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,222
Gosh, that sounds delicious.

310
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:32,232
It's too bad. Dex has to leave before trying Jae Wook's sashimi.

311
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:33,532
I know.

312
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,262
Don't go.

313
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,397
It's too bad. Dex has to leave before trying Jae Wook's sashimi.

314
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:40,827
I know.

315
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:42,597
Don't go.

316
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,636
(Dex has to leave for Seoul due to his schedule.)

317
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,167
Let's just work together...

318
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:49,937
so that we can get closer.

319
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,236
I think we've gotten close enough.

320
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:55,876
- No. We need to get even closer. - Let's keep some distance...

321
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:56,906
I want to keep some distance.

322
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,516
- Later you'll be like... - As if it were the first time.

323
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:01,076
- "Hello." - I'll be like, "Hello."

324
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,617
His clean breaks are part of his charm.

325
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:07,357
I'm really good at holding on to people who reject me.

326
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,086
Can you show us up until Dex has to leave?

327
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,326
- Yes, I will until he has to leave. - Seriously?

328
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,697
I will do it to the point of being unbearable.

329
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,067
(Just wait and see, Kim Dex.)

330
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,796
The sky's perfectly clear today.

331
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,537
(Suddenly changing the subject)

332
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,037
(That's true.)

333
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,447
The weather is amazing. The sky feels endless.

334
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,047
Right.

335
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,617
It's such a perfect day to work.

336
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:35,646
Exactly.

337
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:36,817
(Stay and work.)

338
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,087
Okay. No.

339
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,257
You're not giving me a break.

340
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,896
- It's perfect weather for work. - You are so sharp.

341
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:47,457
(This was just the beginning...)

342
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:49,767
What is today's target amount?

343
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,497
You seem to have a lot of questions.

344
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,636
Then stay and work together.

345
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:55,866
- No. - Isn't this enough reason to do it?

346
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,366
Isn't this enough reason to do it?

347
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,407
Why? Are you interested?

348
00:15:58,637 --> 00:15:59,977
No, I'm not interested.

349
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:02,106
You can come along if you're curious.

350
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,107
(Persistent)

351
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,177
(Just laughing)

352
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,647
Shall we hide his suitcase first?

353
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,917
If you join in on this, it'll be too much for me.

354
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,287
I'll have to buy a new one.

355
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,587
Yes, it's time for you to throw that away now.

356
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,227
Yes, it's time for you to throw that away now.

357
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,667
Their conversations are hard for me to follow.

358
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,736
Is that so? I actually really liked it just now.

359
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:28,196
I was thinking the same. It really is time to throw it out.

360
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,637
(This is a conversation flow that the thinkers find satisfying.)

361
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,807
- What was wrong with what I said? - It's time to buy a new one.

362
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,107
So, we're now...

363
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,746
- It's not about the suitcase. - We're not talking about that.

364
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:37,547
We're still talking about whether to hold on or not.

365
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,176
But you're like, "Throw the suitcase away."

366
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:40,777
"I also thought it was time to throw it away."

367
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,187
I even thought about which model to buy.

368
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,417
(The feeler finds it impossible to understand.)
No way.

369
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,256
Is it tough for you, Jae Wook? I'm sorry.

370
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,326
It's fine.

371
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,527
(While they are eating, laughing, and chatting...)

372
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,157
I'm leaving completely recharged.

373
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:55,496
All right. We'll let you go.

374
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:58,127
I guess it's just time to go.

375
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,037
Go. Just go, and we'll meet in Seoul.

376
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,506
- Let me join in now. - I'll add you to the group chat.

377
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,537
Okay.

378
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,446
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

379
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,677
Thank you for the meal.

380
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,346
Jung Ah. Get ready to work.

381
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,647
- I'll clean up. - I should get ready to work...

382
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:18,387
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon get ready to fish for grey mullet.)

383
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:20,617
Gosh.

384
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:21,887
(Dex places his belongings on the floor.)

385
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,157
Oh, right.

386
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,357
(Seeing that, )

387
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:28,856
I want to pack him some victory onions.

388
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:29,866
What?

389
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,527
I packed the victory onion yesterday.

390
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:36,067
(She takes out the pickled victory onion she set aside yesterday.)

391
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,577
(And she gently places it next to Dex's luggage.)

392
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,707
(This is the caring heart of an older sister.)

393
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,276
We're parting just as we've grown close.

394
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:45,277
(Lingering regret)

395
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:47,617
Ji Yeon.

396
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,047
Jin Yeon? No, Yeon Jin?

397
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:52,287
Ji Yeon?

398
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,487
- It's Ji Yeon. Why? - Right.

399
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,857
Did you just forget my name?

400
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,256
(Scolding)

401
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:00,257
Hey.

402
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,766
I keep rambling nonsense to the very end.

403
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:03,767
(Kim Dex has grown attached but still gets the name wrong.)

404
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:07,197
(Dex is passing by.)

405
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:11,237
Jin Young.

406
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,477
I've thought about it, and I can't let you go.

407
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,547
What?

408
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,807
Jung Ah.

409
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,546
I can't let you go.

410
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,787
(Jung Ah feels unsettled as he prepares to leave.)

411
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,217
Jung Ah, what are you saying?

412
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,387
How could I ever let you go?

413
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:31,526
I'll leave someday anyway.

414
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,897
- Right. You have to leave someday. - That's right.

415
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,796
You caught on right away because you are a thinker.

416
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,267
- Someday... - You'll have to go.

417
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,297
I'm glad you were able to get close to the others so soon.

418
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:43,506
We have to take a picture. It's Jin Young's last day.

419
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:44,507
(Let's take a picture of the five siblings.)

420
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,807
- Ji Yeon. - Ji Yeon, are you in?

421
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:50,047
Take care, Dex. Goodbye.

422
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,776
(In May 2025, the 5 siblings were here at the protected tree house.)

423
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:57,216
As I go about my busy days, it comes to mind all of a sudden.

424
00:18:57,217 --> 00:19:00,217
Those moments we work hard to afford what we want.

425
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,087
Because it's left as such a cherished memory,

426
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,487
I find myself wanting to come back again.

427
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:07,856
There's one left.

428
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:11,967
(It was a long-awaited day for Dex as well.)

429
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:16,767
It feels like I've been back at my family home after a long time.

430
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:21,737
Jung Ah, Jun Myun, Yeon Jin, and Jae Wook.

431
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,376
I had such a wonderful time.

432
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,247
It's not Yeon Jin. It's Ji Yeon.

433
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,917
Gosh.

434
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:37,727
(The Fresh House felt even more vibrant with Dex around.)

435
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,197
(Leaving behind a bittersweet farewell...)

436
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,826
Which boat are we taking? That must be it.

437
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:44,897
(Which boat will Jung Ah and Ji Yeon take?)

438
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:47,166
(Our house, and our boat)

439
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,637
(We're departing from the dock right in front of our house.)

440
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:52,977
Hello.

441
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,336
- Hello. - Hi. Is this the boat we take?

442
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:56,347
Yes.

443
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,477
Okay.

444
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,817
- Bye, Jung Ah. - Don't worry. I'll do my best.

445
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,017
Bye, Ji Yeon.
(And as for today's fishing...)

446
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:07,457
(Grey mullet)

447
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,926
(The savory and fatty grey mullet)

448
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,627
The meat is incredibly chewy. This texture...

449
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,427
(The sea of Yeosu, unfolding before their home, )

450
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,897
(with Namhae's mild temperatures, )

451
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:25,307
(is a true bounty of grey mullet.)

452
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,777
(It doesn't end here.)

453
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:31,046
(Cuttlefish)

454
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:34,446
(Prawn)

455
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,447
(Giant red sea bream)

456
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,657
(Including the expensive striped beakfish)

457
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:45,627
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon set out...)

458
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:50,967
(for a rich and untouched fishing ground.)

459
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:01,337
(Carried on the fierce sea breeze, what awaits the grey mullet team?)

460
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,806
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

461
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,007
- What's that? - Look.

462
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,576
Doesn't it look like a net?

463
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,717
(A massive net spread across the sea)

464
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,216
Are the grey mullet caught in this net?

465
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,217
Yes.

466
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,457
This fishing method is called two-angle netting.

467
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,357
The angles are shaped like a cone.

468
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:22,526
It closes in from both sides to trap the fish inside.

469
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:23,567
(A net with two horns)

470
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:30,137
(Built for easy entry and hard exit, )

471
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:35,007
(it primarily traps schooling fish.)

472
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,576
I'm excited. This should be fun.

473
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:38,776
(How many are caught in the net?)

474
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:41,177
Gosh, a grey mullet is already jumping.

475
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,686
There it is.

476
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:43,747
- It's over there. - Have a look at this.

477
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,587
Look how big that one is.

478
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,316
- Is that a grey mullet? - It's huge.

479
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:49,457
- Yes. - That big one.

480
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,587
- The grey mullet. - Gosh.

481
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,387
(This forearm-sized fish is the grey mullet.)

482
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,797
I think there are other fish besides grey mullet.

483
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:58,297
- Oh, my. What's that? - That is red sea bream.

484
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,696
(The precious catch in the net is...)

485
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:04,307
That's the red sea bream, the queen of the sea. Look how pretty it is.

486
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:05,737
I knew it.

487
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,637
We're quite lucky when it comes to fishing.

488
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,477
(Step 1: Folding up the guiding net)

489
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:16,347
(Folding up the long guiding net section by section)

490
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:19,316
You can just place it exactly as it is.

491
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,557
- Put it down. - Place it down.

492
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:22,457
Gosh, this is heavy.

493
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,787
(Struggling with the hefty weight of the net)

494
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,556
(Pulling hard against the heavy net)

495
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:27,557
Okay.

496
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,597
(As they keep folding...)

497
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,236
Oh, my. Look at all these here.

498
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:40,277
(The net's end is packed with fish.)

499
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,406
It looks like they're pulling it up like that.

500
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,647
(Using machinery to pull it onto the boat)

501
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:50,217
(Shaking the net to empty it out)

502
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:57,957
(Here is today's first catch.)

503
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:01,757
Okay. The grey mullet goes over here.

504
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,267
The grey mullet goes this way.

505
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,527
Over here are the red sea bream and sea bass.

506
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,067
The red sea bream and sea bass?

507
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,907
(The grey mullet, which is mostly caught in the net, )

508
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,307
(looks like this.)

509
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,036
(A grey back, spotted, )

510
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:15,507
(and a white belly)

511
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:20,377
(The features of the grey mullet found off the coast of Yeosu)

512
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:27,817
(It's about the size of a forearm.)

513
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:35,057
(Its power matches its size.)

514
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,827
I've never caught a fish that big before.

515
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,296
Can I catch it?

516
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:41,967
(Among the fish that poured out in a cascade...)

517
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,737
- The red sea bream. - Where should I put it?

518
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,506
Right here.

519
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:47,977
(Jung Ah grabs it quickly.)

520
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,007
(Screaming)

521
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,507
Oh, my.

522
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:53,947
It's huge.

523
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:58,247
(Walking on two legs)

524
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,316
This is too big.

525
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:01,356
(Horror)

526
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,727
(Level 99: Catch it barehanded.)

527
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:09,527
(Both of them are stiff from the very beginning.)

528
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,096
You stay here for a bit.

529
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,567
(Putting aside the daunting red sea bream for now)

530
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:15,536
- Gosh. - Good job.

531
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,537
(Starting the sorting properly)

532
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,736
Like this.

533
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:18,967
Wait a moment. I can't catch it.

534
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:24,907
(Fumbling helplessly at empty air)

535
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,177
(This side is almost like a water bomb.)

536
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:30,386
- How do I catch it? - Oh, my.

537
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,486
What kind of fish is that...

538
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:32,546
(Salty blast)

539
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,557
How do I catch it?

540
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:38,256
(Although they're experienced in sea work...)

541
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:39,357
Okay.

542
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,157
Gosh. It's no joke.

543
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,597
All right.

544
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,967
Hold on.

545
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:46,967
When catching this,

546
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,837
press it like this.

547
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:51,137
Like this.

548
00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:53,707
(You have to cover the fish's eyes.)

549
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:55,976
If you cover its eyes, it stays calm.

550
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:57,807
- Okay. I understand. - Yes.

551
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:01,016
(Jung Ah receives the valuable advice.)

552
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,146
(The grey mullet goes in.)

553
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:04,186
(Another one goes in.)

554
00:25:04,187 --> 00:25:05,347
Well done.

555
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:07,386
Oh, my. Good job.

556
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:09,657
(Going in without pause)

557
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,456
Their strength, seriously...

558
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:13,657
(Leader Yum powerfully handles the grey mullet.)

559
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:18,027
(Ji Yeon also holds back her fear.)

560
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:20,936
(Trembling, she catches the fish.)

561
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,667
That's right. Cover its eyes.

562
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,367
(Gritting her teeth, she catches one more.)

563
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,607
Okay.

564
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:27,576
- Like this? - The tail and the head.

565
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:28,677
- Yes. - Yes.

566
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,207
- Grab the tail and hold here. - Yes.

567
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:32,607
Okay. This one too.

568
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:34,346
(An amberjack is added.)

569
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:35,446
Well done.

570
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:36,617
(Increasing speed gradually)

571
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,986
(Jung Ah finishes sorting the grey mullet.)

572
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,586
So this is a cuttlefish.

573
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:42,687
That's cuttlefish.

574
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,886
- This is cuttlefish. - Cuttlefish.

575
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:45,887
It's a cuttlefish.

576
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:46,956
- Look at the back. - It's a cuttlefish.

577
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:50,227
There's something hard on the back of this.

578
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,667
I want to eat cuttlefish sashimi.

579
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:55,737
(A premium performance)

580
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:57,537
Now is when it tastes the best.

581
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,337
- Now? Cuttlefish? - Cuttlefish?

582
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,037
They spawn when the tide comes in.

583
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,576
It tastes extremely sweet.

584
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:06,147
(It's filled with sweetness.)

585
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:10,947
(Things are coming to a close.)

586
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,716
You little rascal...

587
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:15,017
(But for them, there is still...)

588
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:16,557
Jung Ah, what should we do with this?

589
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,186
I really can't stand it because of this one.

590
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,497
- I'm too scared to touch it. - I can't touch it.

591
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:22,297
The eyes are this big.

592
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:26,197
(Will they be able to catch it this time?)

593
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:28,096
We should cover its eyes, right?

594
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:29,506
(A ping pong ball-sized eye)

595
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:31,636
- Is it okay to cover it so nicely? - Okay.

596
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:32,666
I caught it.

597
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,677
(Screaming)

598
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:37,247
(Amidst the screams, the red sea bream dives into the water.)

599
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,376
Undo it the other way, please.

600
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:41,777
(After many twists and turns, the first net is cleared.)

601
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:43,686
This is kind of scary.

602
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,186
I usually catch them easily.

603
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,556
Why are its eyes so big?

604
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:47,856
(With the horror still lingering, )

605
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:51,157
(they arrive at the second point.)

606
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,526
I'm going to catch it this time.

607
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:57,127
(Getting ready again)

608
00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:58,627
Come over here, Ji Yeon.

609
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,867
Yes.

610
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,097
(They are now skilled enough to do it without being told.)

611
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,207
Okay.

612
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:09,177
(Folding and raising the guiding net)

613
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,917
(Their working speed has leveled up after trying it once.)

614
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:19,247
(The fish are gathered at the end of the net.)

615
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:24,587
(The second net enters.)

616
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:28,496
(Among the wriggling fish...)

617
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:29,967
- That's good. - Oh, my. Look at this.

618
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:36,197
(At a glance, this one looks different.)

619
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:38,666
(The Fresh members are familiar with the black sea bream.)

620
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,737
(Featuring in Wando)

621
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,647
The black sea bream is released back into the water.

622
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,616
This is the closed season starting from May.

623
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:48,776
(The black sea bream's closed season lasts for the month of May.)

624
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:50,687
Since it's the closed season for black sea bream.

625
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:53,187
(Releasing the black sea bream back into the sea)

626
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:56,087
Hold the tail and cover the eyes.

627
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,056
Hold the tail and cover the eyes...

628
00:27:58,057 --> 00:27:59,057
Grey mullet.

629
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,766
(The second try is much better.)

630
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,927
Grey mullet.

631
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,296
Grey mullet.

632
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:09,707
(The speed has picked up compared to before.)

633
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,606
- Hold its tail and eyes, - "Hold its tail..."

634
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,806
and bend it!

635
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:13,937
(Hold its tail and eyes, and bend it!)

636
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:15,237
Bend it slightly like this.

637
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,547
- Okay. - Bend it? Oh, I see.

638
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:22,876
(Captain Joo Jin Su's advice)

639
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,887
(Bending the fish's body prevents it from struggling.)

640
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,616
- Okay. - Like this?

641
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:30,026
(Finally, she is getting the hang of it.)

642
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:32,357
I'm getting the hang of it.

643
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:33,457
(Adding a grey mullet)

644
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,566
(The grey mullet is lining up and entering.)

645
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,136
Okay. Hold the eyes like this.

646
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,166
- That's right. - Like this.

647
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,066
- Hold it tight. - That's it.

648
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,966
- Good job. - Hold the eyes.

649
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,236
- Nice. - In you go.

650
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:47,737
Okay, so hold the eyes.

651
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,076
Like this.

652
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,047
Hold the eyes like this.

653
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,617
Grey mullet.

654
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:04,927
Grey mullet.

655
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,967
(As they continue catching the fish, )

656
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,497
(the fish storage fills up quickly.)

657
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:16,967
We're almost done.

658
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:18,867
Look at this.

659
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,907
Look.

660
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,007
(Embarrassed)

661
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:27,247
(I'll just focus on work.)

662
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,447
Stay still.

663
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:29,747
Don't move.

664
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,147
(Jung Ah is watching fondly.)

665
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,186
What? Is it a shrimp?

666
00:29:34,187 --> 00:29:35,557
Yes. There are shrimp, too.

667
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:36,656
The shrimp are amazing.

668
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:38,187
The shrimp looks really unusual.

669
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,097
- It's this big. - Gosh.

670
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:42,097
- The shrimp are fascinating, right? - Oh, my.

671
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,767
(The prawn is bigger than Leader Yum's face.)

672
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:47,196
(Even after the unexpected discovery...)

673
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:49,166
- This is fascinating. - It tastes delicious.

674
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,436
It looks delicious.

675
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:51,706
This is a striped beakfish.

676
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,106
- Is it a striped beakfish? - Striped beakfish?

677
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:54,177
(That's a good catch.)

678
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:55,936
(The striped beakfish is known as the emperor of the sea.)

679
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:57,407
I caught it.

680
00:29:58,107 --> 00:29:59,676
(It is characterized by its black and white stripes.)

681
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:02,176
This one has a refined pattern.

682
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,886
- It looks a bit elegant. - Right.

683
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,616
- It's classy. - It's definitely classy.

684
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,187
(It has the highest value among the sea breams.)

685
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,816
This is a very rare one, right?

686
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:09,887
(Nodding)

687
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,326
It has a high market value.

688
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:12,386
- Market value? - Gosh.

689
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:13,556
You go into the water.

690
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,396
- Be careful. - Take good care of your body.

691
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,996
Be careful. Go in carefully.

692
00:30:16,997 --> 00:30:18,067
(Carefully guiding the precious catch to avoid any harm)

693
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,097
Everything that wasn't caught is being caught.

694
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,137
The guests did well.

695
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:24,666
- Sea bass. - Just put in the sea bass...

696
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,037
and the cuttlefish here.

697
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:28,577
Cuttlefish.

698
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:31,047
Oh, my. It squirted ink.

699
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,576
(She found a cuttlefish covered in ink.)

700
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:36,417
(Dripping ink)

701
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:37,787
Gosh.

702
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:42,257
(Squirting ink)

703
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:48,657
(Showered in cuttlefish ink)

704
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,726
Cuttlefish, you really...

705
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,067
(Though she lost some style at the end...)

706
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,497
It's done.

707
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,266
You did well.

708
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:58,737
(With the cuttlefish in, the catch is complete.)

709
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:00,806
Thank you all for your hard work.

710
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,347
- You've worked hard. - Thank you.

711
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:07,147
It's kind of disappointing because there weren't many fish.

712
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:12,787
The current needs to flow for the fish to gather.

713
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:14,587
But today is low tide...

714
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:18,527
At times like this, the current flows less.

715
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:21,757
(On normal days, when the tide is not low...)

716
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:26,097
(This is the usual amount.)

717
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:29,636
We'll catch more starting tomorrow.

718
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,936
(Unfortunately, the tide timing didn't match.)

719
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:32,266
- Since it's 1pm... - That's too bad.

720
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,407
It's too bad.

721
00:31:33,507 --> 00:31:36,006
But we caught all the valuable fish today.

722
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:37,207
(We caught all the valuable fish.)

723
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:41,347
(Even the captain was surprised.)

724
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,386
(Just realizing how Leader Yum looks)

725
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,017
Jung Ah, what happened?

726
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:49,687
I had a pretty tough fight...

727
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:52,156
with one fish.

728
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,797
(Wearing a smile, not tears)

729
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:58,067
(Now, it's time to head back home.)

730
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,466
Jung Ah, I'm starting to get used to the boat now.

731
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:03,537
(Jung Ah, I'm starting to get used to the boat now.)

732
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,206
In life, we don't get a lot of chances...

733
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:09,276
to board the boats of fishermen.

734
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,847
- Right. - And...

735
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:15,047
When else would I get a chance to catch fish by hand?

736
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,587
You slowly overcome the fear, right?

737
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,416
- The more you do it... - I'm completely overcoming it.

738
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,587
(While they are chatting away, )

739
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:24,026
(the boat stops in an unfamiliar place.)

740
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,187
This place is beautiful.

741
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:26,556
Look at the rocks.

742
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:29,226
- The Dragon King called and said... - Yes.

743
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:31,327
That the crocodile and the seal are fighting.

744
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:34,767
(What is the captain talking about?)

745
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,266
Really? What should we do?

746
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,906
Look over there. The crocodile and the seal...

747
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,406
(Following the captain's fingertip...)

748
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:42,936
- The crocodile and... - There, the crocodile.

749
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:44,106
The crocodile and the seal.

750
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,247
(They are not a real crocodile or a seal.)

751
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:49,117
(Do I look like a seal?)

752
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,357
(Do I look like a crocodile?)

753
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:55,416
- It's beautiful. - This place looks really amazing.

754
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:56,787
- It's truly a magnificent sight. - Yes.

755
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,786
It's so beautiful.

756
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:02,697
(This is the pride of Seongdu Village's coastal waters.)

757
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:06,297
(It was a pleasure meeting you.)

758
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:09,636
- We're the only ones seeing it. - Right.

759
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,306
- This really feels like... - Others should have seen it, too.

760
00:33:11,307 --> 00:33:13,737
- a paid tourist attraction. - Exactly.

761
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:18,707
We arrived just as the seasickness was starting.

762
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,876
That's a relief.

763
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:21,676
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon have arrived at the pier.)

764
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:23,616
This is the catch from today.

765
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,847
I hope you cook a hearty meal with this.

766
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:30,586
(They received seasonal cuttlefish, )

767
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,597
(prawns, )

768
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:37,266
(extra-large grey mullets, )

769
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,767
(and even the rare striped beakfish.)

770
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:42,366
Thank you for your hard work.

771
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,407
- Thank you. - We'll enjoy the meal.

772
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:48,037
(The mullet caught by the Fresh members today...)

773
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:52,477
(was carefully loaded onto the truck...)

774
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:56,217
(for Yeosu Fisheries Marketplace.)

775
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:59,417
(Passing through the lively Yeosu Fisheries Marketplace, )

776
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:04,787
(it's directly delivered to our dining table.)

777
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,157
(Taking a moment to relax after work)

778
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:12,697
I have something to talk about, so please come to the room a bit later.

779
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,497
- Us? Okay. - Yes. Everyone.

780
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:16,637
She's calling us to gather.

781
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,207
Jung Ah said to gather, and it felt a bit intimidating.

782
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,037
(Speechless)

783
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,777
(Jae Wook comes into the room quietly.)

784
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:27,417
(Keeping his distance)

785
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:30,317
We're upset with you now.

786
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,517
(Serious)

787
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:35,017
Did I do something wrong?

788
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:38,387
I'm getting upset just trying to say it.

789
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:40,593
Did I do something wrong?

790
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:44,003
I'm getting upset just trying to say it.

791
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:46,332
I feel really hot.

792
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,333
(I'll just turn on the air conditioner.)

793
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:49,432
(Jung Ah...)

794
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:51,043
That's not an air conditioner.

795
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:52,803
(Turning on the humidifier)

796
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:54,742
- That's a humidifier. - Let me put my face in.

797
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,673
(Cooling herself down)

798
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,943
I have something to tell you, Jae Wook.

799
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:01,983
- Me? - Yes.

800
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,353
(The sisters are serious.)

801
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,423
(What's going on?)

802
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:13,093
Why didn't you tell us?

803
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,363
(About what?)

804
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:19,233
Why didn't you tell us your birthday is in two days?

805
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,203
- My birthday? - Yes.

806
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,402
(Your birthday is the day after tomorrow.)

807
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:27,412
I actually feel uncomfortable.

808
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:28,813
- Do you feel uncomfortable? - Yes.

809
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,283
If we're having a birthday party,

810
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:34,653
we can just meet up later and keep it casual.

811
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:36,553
Anyway, it's your birthday.

812
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:40,423
Let's have a birthday lunch tomorrow.

813
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:42,552
I want to make a lot of food,

814
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:44,392
- and we'll share it with the staff. - That's a good idea, Jung Ah.

815
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,862
- It's the last day. - You're right.

816
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:48,492
- It will be like a party. - Yes. I'll make lots of japchae.

817
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,732
- We'll make a lot of food... - It's to celebrate the last day...

818
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,003
- and your birthday. - because it's Jae Wook's birthday.

819
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:53,603
(His last birthday before enlisting in the military)

820
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,802
- I love it. - You make a cake.

821
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:57,402
- Use pancake mix, as I told you. - Why don't we make it together?

822
00:35:57,403 --> 00:35:58,502
- You should take it with you. - Let's make it together.

823
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:01,843
Spread some whipped cream and put the fruits on top. Make it pretty.

824
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:04,483
Are we buying fruit, then?

825
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,843
How about tanghulu?

826
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,453
(Ignoring her)

827
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:10,012
Come on!

828
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,283
(Tanghulu comes to mind again before it fades.)

829
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,552
You might miss my tanghulu later.

830
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:15,753
I won't ever forget her tanghulu.

831
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:18,722
- I was just asking. - I almost lost my tooth filling.

832
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:19,823
Just in case you thought of it.

833
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:21,893
(That's right.)

834
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,463
(Jung Ah also prepared something else.)

835
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:29,603
(For Ji Yeon and Jae Wook, who have wanted to go zip-lining)

836
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:33,943
If you book it online, it's a third off.

837
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,942
Jung Ah, can we go zip-lining?

838
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,643
Yes, we're going zip-lining now.

839
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,283
Will you do it as well?

840
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,583
We'll just watch you.

841
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:45,053
(Going zip-lining for Ji Yeon and Jae Wook)

842
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:48,293
(Driving up the hill)

843
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,823
- I think we're almost there. - Is it here?

844
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:52,723
(A tall building comes into view for the four siblings.)

845
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,592
A zip line is probably here.

846
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:56,663
It's interesting.

847
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:00,032
Unbelievable. It's incredible.

848
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:01,233
It's really high.

849
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:03,702
It looks like a real thrill.

850
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,273
Are we going down while hanging onto this cable?

851
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:06,543
It makes me dizzy.

852
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:08,973
(A giddy experience you can feel only in Yeosu)

853
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:11,713
Where is it?

854
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:14,152
Where are the start and end points? Do you ride it there?

855
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:15,412
(Staring)

856
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,923
Is that it? That's it.

857
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:19,783
This cable. Am I right?

858
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,823
- That's an electric cable. - Is it an electric cable?

859
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:24,493
(That cable could shock you.)

860
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,492
You can't ride it if you weigh over 120kg.

861
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:27,493
Can we go in?

862
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:30,063
- Hello. - Hello.

863
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:31,633
It's exciting.

864
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,162
(Wearing the equipment right away)

865
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,403
(Filming followed safety guidelines.)

866
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,732
- Jung Ah, I'll enjoy it. - Okay.

867
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:37,743
(Unlike relaxed Ji Yeon)

868
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,273
I'm a little scared.

869
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,812
I told you. It's scary, isn't it?

870
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:43,682
Looking outside makes me a bit scared.

871
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:44,683
(He really wanted to try the zip line, )

872
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:47,853
(but seeing it made his head spin.)

873
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,883
Jae Wook, don't be scared. I'll protect you.

874
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:52,382
How can you protect me if I fall?

875
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:53,483
(Laughing)

876
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,653
We can see everything from here.

877
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:58,923
Is this the longest lip line in Korea?

878
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,593
It's a zip line.

879
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:04,663
"Lip line?" That's the line on your lips.

880
00:38:04,763 --> 00:38:05,833
Jung Ah.

881
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,373
I look so funny on this camera.

882
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,473
(Jae Wook is a bit nervous.)

883
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,143
Bye.

884
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:16,743
Let's begin the ride now.

885
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,383
I'll push you slightly.

886
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,713
Let's go.

887
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:26,423
(Go!)

888
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:27,923
(Excited)

889
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:30,493
(Worried)

890
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:35,493
(Gliding down with a shout)

891
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:39,703
(A speed never experienced before)

892
00:38:42,673 --> 00:38:46,403
(A refreshing feeling, as if her heart is opening up)

893

905
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,612

- It was the best. - Honestly?

919
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,752
- Really? - It was a bit scary at first,

920
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:06,753
but it went away right away.

921
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,152
(That's weird.)

922
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,223

(Ji Yeon, who makes a big serving, takes after someone.)

1071
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:10,573
(Using almost an entire tube of mayonnaise)

1072
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:14,353
- Trust your feelings when you cook. - With your feelings...

1073
00:47:14,813 --> 00:47:15,912
That's good.

1074
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:18,753
(Mustard, vinegar, allulose syrup, black pepper)

1075
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,153
Add the onions.

1076
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:22,353
Add the pickles.

1077
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:25,592
I'll add more lemon juice.

1078
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,963
(Adding lemon juice generously in the end)

1079
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,762
(Interim tasting)

1080
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:33,603
(Tasting)

1081
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:36,133
(What?)

1082
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,403
It's pretty good.

1083
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:41,813
(A large batch of Ji Yeon's tartar sauce)

1084
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,443
(Jung Ah is preparing the seasoning for the steamed spicy cuttlefish.)

1085
00:47:44,913 --> 00:47:47,883
(Half a bowl of chili powder)

1086
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:50,452
(A generous amount of soy sauce and a little bit of ginger syrup)

1087
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:51,822
(A spoonful of minced garlic)

1088
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:52,882
(Two spoonfuls of minced garlic)

1089
00:47:52,883 --> 00:47:55,523
(Three, four, and five spoonfuls of minced garlic)

1090
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:57,452
(Adding tuna fish sauce)

1091
00:47:57,453 --> 00:47:59,792
(Generously)

1092
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,232
(And...)

1093
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,993
(A big bowl of seasoning is complete.)

1094
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:07,733
(Seasoning with plenty of garlic is finished.)

1095
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:11,103
(Preparing a big pot for a large batch of seasoning)

1096
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:13,902
(Putting in the skinned cuttlefish...)

1097
00:48:13,903 --> 00:48:14,912
(as a whole.)

1098
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:16,713
I'll put them in without cutting it...

1099
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:19,342
and steam it with bean sprouts.

1100
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:20,683
Then, I'll cut them later while cooking...

1101
00:48:21,253 --> 00:48:22,483
with scissors.

1102
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:27,023
(With 7 cuttlefish)

1103
00:48:27,483 --> 00:48:30,193
(Adding 2kg of bean sprouts)

1104
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:31,562
Is it too much?

1105
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:33,863
(Embarrassed)

1106
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:38,003
(Adding water to steam them)

1107
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:42,003
(Now, let's close the lid and wait.)

1108
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,433
And now...

1109
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:45,172
- Fried grey mullet. - Fried grey mullet.

1110
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,343
(It's time for the fried grey mullet.)

1111
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:48,742
(Pouring in the oil)

1112
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:50,773
(Pouring)

1113
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:55,053
(Coating the thick-sliced grey mullet with flour first)

1114
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,023
(In an extremely uncomfortable posture)

1115
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,822
Jung Ah, can I help you with that?

1116
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:02,622
- Dip it in here. - Yes.

1117
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:03,623
(Dipping the flour-coated grey mullet in eggs)

1118
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,023
Coat it with breadcrumbs, and put it in here.

1119
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,832
- Then, I'll fry it from there. - Okay.

1120
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:11,263
(Doing it as she was told)

1121
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:13,003
Coat it thoroughly.

1122
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:15,072
(Ji Yeon is coating the grey mullet thoroughly to fry it.)

1123
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:16,303
These are ready.

1124
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:17,843
Let me put one in.

1125
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:20,703
That's it.

1126
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:25,183
(Adding the rest of the grey mullet)

1127
00:49:27,443 --> 00:49:28,553
It's cooked pretty quickly.

1128
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:31,323
That looks good.

1129
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:33,223
It looks so delicious.

1130
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,152
- It's fried nicely. - Yes.

1131
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:36,923
(Crunchy)

1132
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:39,323
(Shaking off the oil)

1133
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,033
That looks good.

1134
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:44,833
(Looking thick and crunchy with a nice color)

1135
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:49,732
(While the fried grey mullet is cooked...)

1136
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:53,473
(How is the steamed spicy cuttlefish with bean sprouts coming along?)

1137
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:56,273
(Open)

1138
00:49:56,813 --> 00:49:59,413
(The cuttlefish is nicely steamed.)

1139
00:49:59,983 --> 00:50:02,853
(Cutting them into bite-sized pieces)

1140
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:05,453
I could've cut them before cooking.

1141
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:08,593
But cooking it this way is more appealing.

1142
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:09,693
That's why.

1143
00:50:10,693 --> 00:50:12,223
The cuttlefish is so fat.

1144
00:50:12,463 --> 00:50:14,322
- Indeed. - It's really thick.

1145
00:50:14,323 --> 00:50:16,533
It's incredible.

1146
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:20,233
How could it be this thick?

1147
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,903
The cuttlefish felt different when I caught it.

1148
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,342
(Cutting the cuttlefish)

1149
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:35,912
I still have a lot to cut.

1150
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:36,953
Do you still have more to do?

1151
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:41,593
(Adding a bowl of seasoning)

1152
00:50:44,323 --> 00:50:47,263
(Stir-fry it so that the seasoning is absorbed well.)

1153
00:50:55,503 --> 00:50:57,133
Since it's a lot,

1154
00:50:57,603 --> 00:51:00,842
even though I added a lot of seasoning,

1155
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:02,142
it still seems like it's not enough.

1156
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,913
(Why does it look bland?)

1157
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:06,843
(Adding red flavor to it)

1158
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:10,953
(Adding chili powder generously for a spicy flavor)

1159
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:12,153
It looks great.

1160
00:51:13,523 --> 00:51:15,923
(Mouthwatering red color)

1161
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:19,193
(Chef Yum is satisfied.)

1162
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:21,833
This looks awesome.

1163
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,602
(But...)

1164
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:28,373
Who said the bean sprouts would shrink?

1165
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,572
- I did. - This is a lot.

1166
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:31,603
I did.

1167
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:35,043
(We'll eat it all.)

1168
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:36,873
The sesame oil smells so good.

1169
00:51:37,243 --> 00:51:38,442
I just need to add some starch slurry.

1170
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:39,943
(Adding starch slurry to thicken it)

1171
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:42,453
(The final touch)

1172
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,883
(Sprinkling lots of sesame seeds)

1173
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:50,853
It's done. We can set up the table to eat.

1174
00:51:51,363 --> 00:51:52,523
It's all done.

1175
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:55,492
Perilla leaves and lemon.

1176
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:56,833
(Ji Yeon is preparing drinks to pair with the spicy food.)

1177
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,633
That's right. Jae Wook. You need to slice this.

1178
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:02,972
(Serious)

1179
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:04,873
- I'll slice it now. - Now?

1180
00:52:05,243 --> 00:52:06,443
Why are you so serious?

1181
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:07,873
I thought you forgot about this.

1182
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:13,813
(I didn't forget.)

1183
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:15,613
(Slicing it thick)

1184
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,722
(The striped beakfish sashimi is getting ready.)

1185
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:19,723
It looks chewy.

1186
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:21,593
It's bream.

1187
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:25,162
(The hard-earned striped beakfish sashimi...)

1188
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:27,863
(is made all the more valuable by the effort that went into it.)

1189
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,203
(Jae Wook is preparing the striped beakfish sashimi.)

1190
00:52:32,603 --> 00:52:34,002
Cut it in half.

1191
00:52:34,003 --> 00:52:35,173
(Ji Yeon is preparing drinks to pair with the food.)

1192
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:36,803
It's a perilla leaves mojito.

1193
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:42,543
(Squeezing fresh lemon first)

1194
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:44,012
Slice it first.

1195
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:45,013
(Slicing the remaining lemon and adding it.)

1196
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:46,243
(Adding one slice)

1197
00:52:46,683 --> 00:52:47,713
(Adding two slices)

1198
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:51,323
And add two perilla leaves.

1199
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,993
(Pouring alcohol until it covers the perilla leaves and lemon)

1200
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:58,263
And the most important thing is...

1201
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:01,832
(Adding soda for a refreshing taste)

1202
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,363
It tastes good as a drink,

1203
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,763
but it also works well in cooking.

1204
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,733
I made a perilla leaves mojito.

1205
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:12,703
It looks tasty.

1206
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:17,113
(How will Bartender Im's new perilla leaves mojito taste?)

1207
00:53:17,743 --> 00:53:19,783
(Surprised)

1208
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:21,683
It's delicious.

1209
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:23,082
Is it really good?

1210
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,183
(Rushing to taste it)

1211
00:53:26,723 --> 00:53:28,422
- It's a mojito. - This is so good.

1212
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:29,553
It's really good.

1213
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:31,422
Jun Myun.

1214
00:53:31,423 --> 00:53:33,422
- The mojito is really good. - Really?

1215
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:35,093
I'll make it for you all.

1216
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:38,832
(Ji Yeon is making more mojitos.)

1217
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:41,232
(I heard your mojito is so good.)

1218
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:43,473
(Feeling lost)

1219
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:46,543
What should I do now?

1220
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:49,143
I need to set the table. Jae Wook.

1221
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:53,183
(Unfolding the table to save the sisters the trouble)

1222
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:56,283
(Placing all the dishes made with care)

1223
00:53:58,123 --> 00:54:01,182
(Steamed spicy cuttlefish with bean sprouts)

1224
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:04,993
(It fills the whole plate.)

1225
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:06,993
That's a lot.

1226
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:11,363
(You can eat as much as you want.)

1227
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:14,062
Please try some.

1228
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:15,333
- Thanks. - Sure.

1229
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,103
It's a mojito party tonight.

1230
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:21,613
Tartar sauce.

1231
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:24,243
- Please take this. - Great.

1232
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:25,443
But,

1233
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,013
compared to the fried grey mullet we made,

1234
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:30,882
there is way too much sauce.

1235
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:31,922
Why do we have it so much?

1236
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:34,322
Someone has to eat it in spoonfuls.

1237
00:54:34,323 --> 00:54:35,353
(A large amount of sauce, enough to eat with a spoon)

1238
00:54:35,623 --> 00:54:38,593
(It's good to eat a lot.)

1239
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:41,432
(Hearty seasonal dinner with tastes of Yeosu)

1240
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,393
- We made it all pretty quickly. - Yes.

1241
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:45,732
(Chef Yum's steamed spicy cuttlefish with bean sprouts)

1242
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:46,963
It looks delicious, Jung Ah.

1243
00:54:48,573 --> 00:54:50,632
The dinner table feels different today.

1244
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:51,672
It looks pretty.

1245
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:53,342
(Crunchy fried grey mullet)

1246
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:55,012
(Ji Yeon's homemade tartar sauce)

1247
00:54:55,013 --> 00:54:57,542
(The dinner table is filled with the moments of everyone's day.)

1248
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:59,243
- Let's toast. - Sure.

1249
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:01,282
- You did a good job. - Great job.

1250
00:55:01,283 --> 00:55:02,652
You did a great job.

1251
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:04,552
(Let's enjoy!)

1252
00:55:04,553 --> 00:55:09,093
(Starting with Ji Yeon's aperitif)

1253
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:11,663
It's so good.

1254
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:13,863
How is it?

1255
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,033
It's good.

1256
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:17,592
It's like a mojito.

1257
00:55:17,593 --> 00:55:19,762
(Ji Yeon has been coming up with great ones lately.)

1258
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:22,403
(Let's try the steamed spicy cuttlefish with bean sprouts.)

1259
00:55:22,773 --> 00:55:24,672
(Picking up a thick piece of cuttlefish)

1260
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:26,473
(Eating it in one bite)

1261
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:28,743
(Eating it)

1262
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:30,343
(Satisfied)

1263
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:32,743
(This is so good.)

1264
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:34,412
(Do you like it?)

1265
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,552
(It hit the spot.)

1266
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:37,352
Whenever you cook seafood,

1267
00:55:37,353 --> 00:55:38,923
- I lose my mind. - Really?

1268
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:41,053
(The master of fried seafood)

1269
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:42,352
It's just so good.

1270
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:44,152
(After praising her cooking, )

1271
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:45,893
(he digs in again.)

1272
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,733
(Chef Yum also tries a piece of cuttlefish.)

1273
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:51,732
The cuttlefish is really good.

1274
00:55:51,733 --> 00:55:53,433
- They're really fat, Jung Ah. - Yes.

1275
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:55,632
It's different from squid.

1276
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:57,102
(Cuttlefish with a firm texture)

1277
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,502
(Thick and big cuttlefish)

1278
00:56:00,503 --> 00:56:02,212
(Wrapping it with bean sprouts)

1279
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:04,143
(Eating it in one bite)

1280
00:56:05,383 --> 00:56:06,942
(It's so delicious.)

1281
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:08,553
(You're eating it well.)

1282
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,083
It's so good.

1283
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:13,953
(Slurping)

1284
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:16,293
(This is it.)

1285
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,493
I love bean sprouts the most in this type of steamed dish.

1286
00:56:19,823 --> 00:56:20,993
So do I.

1287
00:56:21,063 --> 00:56:22,462
I eat it for the bean sprouts.

1288
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,063
(It was a great idea to put 2kg of bean sprouts.)

1289
00:56:24,493 --> 00:56:29,033
(Adding a bit of crunch to the chewy cuttlefish)

1290
00:56:29,503 --> 00:56:30,603
This is crazy.

1291
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:33,072
It's so delicious.

1292
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:35,143
(So happy)

1293
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,343
(Spicy)

1294
00:56:38,073 --> 00:56:41,853
(He can't stop eating, even though it's spicy.)

1295
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:44,283
(Is it too spicy for Jae Wook?)

1296
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:46,822
If it's spicy, try some tartar sauce.

1297
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:47,853
(Laughing)

1298
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:51,352
We have a lot to eat, including tartar sauce.

1299
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:53,222
(It's time to try the fried grey mullet.)

1300
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:55,962
(With Ji Yeon's sauce)

1301
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:57,732
(Crunchy, thick fried grey mullet)

1302
00:56:57,733 --> 00:56:59,163
Please take one piece each.

1303
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:00,632
- Is it one for each? - Yes.

1304
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:02,833
(One fried grey mullet for each person)

1305
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:05,872
(To get the full flavor of it)

1306
00:57:05,873 --> 00:57:07,203
It's only this big.

1307
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:09,973
(Tasting it without sauce first)

1308
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,242
The grey mullet tastes so good when it's fried.

1309
00:57:12,243 --> 00:57:13,842
- It's good. - It is.

1310
00:57:13,843 --> 00:57:15,613
- It's so tasty because we made it. - Yes.

1311
00:57:15,713 --> 00:57:18,252
(A large piece of chewy grey mullet)

1312
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:20,482
(Coming from all around)

1313
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:23,053
(The crunchy sound)

1314
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:26,362
(After tasting it without the sauce)

1315
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,363
(Trying it with sauce this time)

1316
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:31,293
(Impressed)

1317
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:33,902
It's so good.

1318
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:35,272
- Do you like it? - It tastes like store-bought.

1319
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:36,303
(That's a relief.)

1320
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:38,603
(Having a bite)

1321
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:41,842
(You made it well.)

1322
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:43,773
You did it well, Im Ji Yeon.

1323
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,842
- You made the sauce really well. - Is it good?

1324
00:57:45,843 --> 00:57:47,042
It tastes store-bought.

1325
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:48,182
(It suits Chef Yum's taste.)

1326
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:49,652
You're good, Ji Yeon.

1327
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:52,723
(After many compliments, happy Ji Yeon finally tastes it.)

1328
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:57,793
(Satisfied)

1329
00:57:58,323 --> 00:58:00,662
- It's better than store-bought. - It's different.

1330
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:03,633
(Crunchy, savory fried grey mullet with a sauce of onions and pickles)

1331
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:05,462
Everything Ji Yeon has made lately tastes good.

1332
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:06,733
Yes, she's good.

1333
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,372
I've been doing pretty well, haven't I?

1334
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:09,502
You have. You made everything well.

1335
00:58:09,503 --> 00:58:10,673
Except for your tanghulu.

1336
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:12,772
The tanghulu was really...

1337
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:14,172
(Embarrassed)

1338
00:58:14,173 --> 00:58:17,413
(Tasting the striped beakfish sashimi that Jae Wook has sliced)

1339
00:58:17,973 --> 00:58:20,842
(What does it taste like?)

1340
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:22,253
(Impressed)

1341
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:23,712
It's indeed expensive fish.

1342
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:25,253
- It tastes so good. - Yes.

1343
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:26,723
It's nicely chewy.

1344
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:29,723
(Dipping it in chojang)

1345
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:32,592
(Impressed)

1346
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:33,893
- It's so good. - It's indeed expensive fish.

1347
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:35,793
It's nicely chewy.

1348
00:58:36,163 --> 00:58:37,332
The sashimi is so good.

1349
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:39,533
- The sashimi is really good. - It's chewy.

1350
00:58:41,673 --> 00:58:44,402
(Ji Yeon, who loves sashimi, )

1351
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:46,273
(is also tasting a piece of it.)

1352
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:49,773
(This is really delicious.)

1353
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,682
You really did a great job.

1354
00:58:51,683 --> 00:58:54,512
(Complimenting him for a change)

1355
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:55,713
(Having another piece)

1356
00:58:57,313 --> 00:58:59,553
(Dipping it in chojang)

1357
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:02,252
We have more bean sprouts.

1358
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:03,253
(She can't stop eating striped beakfish sashimi.)

1359
00:59:03,254 --> 00:59:04,352
I'm eating a lot.

1360
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:05,663
(Almost empty)

1361
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:08,332
She's eating really well.

1362
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,862
(Feeling rewarded for preparing sashimi)

1363
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:12,162
- I feel like I'm eating it all. - You can eat it all.

1364
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:13,962
(It's good to eat well.)

1365
00:59:13,963 --> 00:59:15,372
(Then, I won't say no.)

1366
00:59:15,373 --> 00:59:17,073
The sashimi is really good.

1367
00:59:17,173 --> 00:59:19,872
(Falling in love with the striped beakfish sashimi)

1368
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,873
Ji Yeon ate almost all the sashimi.

1369
00:59:22,013 --> 00:59:24,843
(Empty)

1370
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:26,943
(The best quality of striped beakfish sashimi.)

1371
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,983
(The steamed spicy cuttlefish with bean sprouts is almost gone.)

1372
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:31,412
- If we have cuttlefish left, - Yes, we have.

1373
00:59:31,413 --> 00:59:33,353
- let's eat it. - We have more.

1374
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:34,952
- I want more. - We have more.

1375
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:36,222
It's behind you.

1376
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:37,653
(Refilling it)

1377
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:41,833
(A generous amount of cuttlefish as much as they want)

1378
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:44,563
- Look at that. - It's like a new dish.

1379
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,532
(A full plate like it is newly served)

1380
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:50,033
(Eating it again with a fresh mind)

1381
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:54,003
(It's more delicious because I've already had it.)

1382
00:59:54,343 --> 00:59:56,343
Who comes to mind first when you eat something delicious?

1383
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,343
What?

1384
00:59:58,783 --> 00:59:59,812
(Suddenly?)

1385
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:01,282
When you eat something delicious like this,

1386
01:00:01,283 --> 01:00:02,953
who do you think of first?

1387
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:04,882
(Jung Ah's unexpected sentimental question)

1388
01:00:04,883 --> 01:00:08,053
(Just looking up at the sky)

1389
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:09,892
- Who do you think of first? - Who do I think of?

1390
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:11,192
- My husband. - Your husband?

1391
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:12,462
(Jung Ah's exemplary answer)

1392
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:14,723
(Another person with a husband becomes silent.)

1393
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:16,362
Didn't you think of your husband?

1394
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,963
I didn't think of my husband.

1395
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,802
- That could happen. - I might be in trouble.

1396
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:22,233
(Jun Myun. Oh, no.)

1397
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,002
Who do you think of first?

1398
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:25,503
I don't think of anyone.

1399
01:00:26,143 --> 01:00:27,772
How many times do I have to tell you?

1400
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:28,812
(No lying on the show)

1401
01:00:28,813 --> 01:00:30,673
I just enjoy it by myself when I eat something good.

1402
01:00:30,813 --> 01:00:32,642
(Okay)

1403
01:00:32,643 --> 01:00:34,843
(I'm sorry, honey.)

1404
01:00:35,553 --> 01:00:36,813
I really enjoyed the food.

1405
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:38,923
I ate so much without thinking of anything

1406
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:41,152
I'm so happy.

1407
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:42,223
(Finished all the food.)

1408
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:44,022
It was a great dinner.

1409
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:46,423
- We'll clean up now. - This is the wrong place.

1410
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,593
(After cleaning up...)

1411
01:00:49,433 --> 01:00:50,662
It's been a while.

1412
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:52,062
(The Fresh members gather, sensing something is missing.)

1413
01:00:52,063 --> 01:00:54,762
- Aren't you drinking this? - I'll mix and drink it.

1414
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:56,033
(We don't have snacks to go with the drinks.)

1415
01:00:56,373 --> 01:00:58,643
I'll make spicy noodles.

1416
01:00:58,803 --> 01:01:00,143
I'll make it really good.

1417
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:01,542
Are you making spicy noodles?

1418
01:01:01,543 --> 01:01:02,613
Look forward to it.

1419
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:04,272
You'd better make it good.

1420
01:01:04,273 --> 01:01:05,942
Im Ji Yeon's spicy noodles.

1421
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:07,843
(Spicy noodles for the Fresh members who love late-night snacks)

1422
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,213
I'm going to make sure I don't break the noodles.

1423
01:01:09,353 --> 01:01:10,812
I'll put it in now.

1424
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:12,623
(Putting it more)

1425
01:01:12,823 --> 01:01:14,552
(It's so interesting that some people only eat one bag.)

1426
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:16,393
One bag is only this much.

1427
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:18,093
It's not a lot.

1428
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:22,933
(It is a lot.)

1429
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:26,133
The noodles are cooked.

1430
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,432
Rinse it with very cold water.

1431
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,033
(Rinsing the noodles with very cold water)

1432
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:31,532
I need to get rid of the excess water.

1433
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:32,672
(Firm texture)

1434
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:33,942
It looks so delicious.

1435
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,213
(It looks so delicious.)

1436
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:39,912
Cut the cucumber nicely.

1437
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:43,612
(Cutting the cucumber nicely in the end)

1438
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,352
My mouth is watering.

1439
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:46,522
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

1440
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:47,752
(Mouthwatering Ji Yeon's spicy noodles)

1441
01:01:47,753 --> 01:01:48,822
Look at that.

1442
01:01:48,823 --> 01:01:51,023
Let me see if you made it well. Im Ji Yeon.

1443
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:55,393
(Slurping)

1444
01:01:55,733 --> 01:01:57,363
Is it good? Can I eat it?

1445
01:01:57,493 --> 01:01:58,733
It's sour and spicy.

1446
01:01:58,863 --> 01:01:59,933
It's really good.

1447
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:05,243
The spicy sauce suits my taste.

1448
01:02:05,673 --> 01:02:06,742
- It suits your taste. - It tastes clean.

1449
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:08,513
Then, it's absolutely good.

1450
01:02:08,913 --> 01:02:10,113
Do you like it?

1451
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:12,442
The noodles taste different.

1452
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:13,813
It has a clean taste.

1453
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:15,952
It's really good.

1454
01:02:15,953 --> 01:02:17,353
(It's so good.)

1455
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:22,452
(Seasoning Park tastes quietly once again.)

1456
01:02:22,453 --> 01:02:23,623
I think I did a good job.

1457
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,123
(Tonight's late-night snack chef is feeling proud.)

1458
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:29,292
- You did a good job. - Good job.

1459
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:31,493
(To Ji Yeon, who cooked a late-night snack alone)

1460
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,133
- It really comes to an end. - Yes.

1461
01:02:35,203 --> 01:02:37,133
Doesn't it feel bittersweet?

1462
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:38,943
Of course, it does.

1463
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:42,313
I feel so lonely when I go back home.

1464
01:02:43,113 --> 01:02:45,442
I found it interesting.

1465
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:48,483
I found this relationship so interesting.

1466
01:02:48,653 --> 01:02:50,452
We all gather...

1467
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:53,322
and spend all day together for 24 hours.

1468
01:02:53,323 --> 01:02:54,482
No one goes home.

1469
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,623
We all sleep here. It's so funny.

1470
01:02:57,153 --> 01:02:59,162
- There's something different. - I know.

1471
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:02,092
- Eating and sleeping together. - It feels...

1472
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:03,293
(We became a family who shares meals together.)

1473
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:07,033
When we first met, Jae Wook was wearing a long coat...

1474
01:03:07,303 --> 01:03:09,872
and had gifts for us in both hands.

1475
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,873
I remember that.

1476
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:13,542
(Jae Wook has been sweet to them since their first meeting.)

1477
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:15,543
(Shy)

1478
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:17,213
When do you enlist?

1479
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:19,412
Why don't we visit him one day?

1480
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:20,482
Yes.

1481
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:21,953
Let's bring fried chicken.

1482
01:03:22,283 --> 01:03:24,053
Gosh, it'll be so nice.

1483
01:03:25,253 --> 01:03:28,653
How cute! Aren't Jae Wook's eyes so cute?

1484
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,193
- He and I have big irises. - Yes.

1485
01:03:34,093 --> 01:03:35,632
Why do you guys resemble each other so much?

1486
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:37,693
It gives you guys a hard time.

1487
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:39,203
We resemble each other.

1488
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:40,863
(They're even sitting similarly.)

1489
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:42,003
We really do.

1490
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:45,403
- Do you really think so? - Yes.

1491
01:03:45,943 --> 01:03:48,172
- What time is it? - It's close to 3am.

1492
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:51,073
I'm so sad about parting ways with them.

1493
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,143
What will I do? What will I do if I cry?

1494
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:58,082
- Why would you cry? - You might cry.

1495
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,283
Don't cry. Seriously.

1496
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:01,853
I might cry by myself.

1497
01:04:01,953 --> 01:04:02,953
But...

1498
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:04,952
(Don't shed any tears!)

1499
01:04:04,953 --> 01:04:07,962
- Gosh. - Jung Ah might end up crying.

1500
01:04:07,963 --> 01:04:09,163
Jung Ah won't cry.

1501
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,932
(Behind their yawning sounds, )

1502
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:13,032
I guess it happens.

1503
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,332
I think it's raining.

1504
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,872
- It began raining at 1am. - Has it begun already?

1505
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:16,902
I didn't know.

1506
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:18,073
(Behind their yawning sounds, raindrops drip in Dolsand Island.)

1507
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:20,643
- Shall we go to bed? - Yes, let's go to bed.

1508
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:23,012
- The sun will rise tomorrow. - Let's take it slow.

1509
01:04:23,013 --> 01:04:24,443
- Yes. - Jun Myun said that.

1510
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,913
I'll stick close to Jung Ah tonight.

1511
01:04:28,753 --> 01:04:30,383
Don't push me away.

1512
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:34,822
Don't push me away. Let's stick close to each other.

1513
01:04:34,823 --> 01:04:36,393
Sure. Let's do that.

1514
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:37,893
I want to do that.

1515
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:40,062
(Otherwise, you can stick close to the wall.)

1516
01:04:40,063 --> 01:04:41,723
Ji Yeon is so funny.

1517
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,002
Jae Wook, come to our room if you're too scared.

1518
01:04:46,003 --> 01:04:47,032
If I feel like a ghost will come out?

1519
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,203
Yes. Then come to our room.

1520
01:04:48,903 --> 01:04:50,002
- I'll scream like this. - Come to our room.

1521
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:52,272
(With the sound of the spring rain, )

1522
01:04:52,273 --> 01:04:53,643
(the Fresh members fall asleep.)

1523
01:04:53,673 --> 01:04:56,113
(It's raining!)

1524
01:04:57,443 --> 01:04:59,612
(The rain falls all night long.)

1525
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:01,983
(Then the morning comes.)

1526
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:08,653
(The spring rain continues to wet the Seongdu Village.)

1527
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:11,093
How could I sleep until 9am?

1528
01:05:12,693 --> 01:05:13,762
(Jung Ah overslept.)

1529
01:05:13,763 --> 01:05:15,393
Are you okay? Did you sleep well?

1530
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,663
(Laughing)

1531
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,502
(She gets up from the spot between the younger members...)

1532
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,133
(who are fast asleep.)

1533
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,802
(She sits still and watches the younger members.)

1534
01:05:25,803 --> 01:05:27,103
Gosh, Jung Ah.

1535
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:29,843
What?

1536
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:33,243
(She laughs once more thanks to the cute second sibling.)

1537
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:37,383
(As always, she washes up before anyone does.)

1538
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:39,182
(The second sibling gets up and looks outside the house.)

1539
01:05:39,183 --> 01:05:40,852
What should we do? The outside is a mess, right?

1540
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,123
It's a mess right now.

1541
01:05:43,623 --> 01:05:44,652
It's so windy.

1542
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:47,022
It's windy and rainy.

1543
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:48,223
It's a mess.

1544
01:05:49,693 --> 01:05:50,693
(In the heavy rain, the Fresh members are...)

1545
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:51,793
I'm hungry.

1546
01:05:52,503 --> 01:05:53,932
Let's hurry up and eat breakfast.

1547
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:54,933
That's a good idea.

1548
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:58,672
(Since they're hungry, they will make a quick breakfast.)

1549
01:05:58,673 --> 01:06:01,243
Later, we'll make a birthday meal for Jae Wook.

1550
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:02,742
(They will have a simple meal.)

1551
01:06:02,743 --> 01:06:04,443
We'll have a simple meal for breakfast.

1552
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:06,843
- I can fry eggs in no time. - Yes.

1553
01:06:07,183 --> 01:06:08,282
- You won't be taking long, right? - Could you get the bread...

1554
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:09,353
No, I won't take long.

1555
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:12,583
(He adds the eggs to the heated frying pan.)

1556
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:15,793
(While Jae Wook carefully prepares the fried eggs, )

1557
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,392
(Jun Myun...)

1558
01:06:17,393 --> 01:06:19,222
(is in charge of toasting the bread.)

1559
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:22,763
(She toasts the morning rolls evenly using an air fryer.)

1560
01:06:22,963 --> 01:06:24,492
(Ji Yeon...)

1561
01:06:24,493 --> 01:06:26,403
(is in charge of the salad dressing.)

1562
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,933
I can't believe I'm using mayonnaise.

1563
01:06:30,103 --> 01:06:31,702
(Jung Ah...)

1564
01:06:31,703 --> 01:06:32,703
(is in charge of preparing the vegetables.)

1565
01:06:32,704 --> 01:06:35,513
Let's make and eat a simple salad.

1566
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:40,943
(They set up the table in no time.)

1567
01:06:41,643 --> 01:06:45,583
(They'll put tuna with sesame oil and mayonnaise on the bread.)

1568
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:48,992
(It's a simple breakfast that is full of nutrition.)

1569
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:51,222
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1570
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:52,662
Let's take a can of tuna each.

1571
01:06:52,663 --> 01:06:53,762
That's a good idea.

1572
01:06:53,763 --> 01:06:55,123
(We'll enjoy the meal today as well.)

1573
01:06:55,323 --> 01:06:56,893
Put it on the bread like this.

1574
01:06:58,263 --> 01:07:01,263
(Put tuna mayonnaise on the bread.)

1575
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,173
- Do I add the tuna 1st? - Yes, add the tuna 1st.

1576
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,403
Then add a single slice of cucumber.

1577
01:07:08,173 --> 01:07:09,513
It'll be very tasty.

1578
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:13,243
It'll be tasty.

1579
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,613
- Add cucumber. - Add cucumber.

1580
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:19,123
We had them with rice last time, right? Today, it's bread.

1581
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:23,093
(Impressed)

1582
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:26,793
(She eats it like Jung Ah.)

1583
01:07:27,393 --> 01:07:30,193
(How is the taste of the tuna sandwich?)

1584
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,733
(The screen didn't freeze.)

1585
01:07:35,903 --> 01:07:36,972
It's good.

1586
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:37,973
(What's...)

1587
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:39,473
(this taste?)

1588
01:07:39,573 --> 01:07:40,843
It's so tasty.

1589
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:43,743
I didn't expect it to go well together. It's so tasty.

1590
01:07:44,513 --> 01:07:45,582
It's so tasty.

1591
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,583
(The recipe is simple, but the taste isn't.)

1592
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:48,543
The seasoning...

1593
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:50,753
is to die for.

1594
01:07:51,253 --> 01:07:53,022
- It's incredibly tasty. - Yes.

1595
01:07:53,023 --> 01:07:55,222
It'll be really nice to eat this with the family.

1596
01:07:55,223 --> 01:07:56,993
Right. It's healthy too.

1597
01:07:57,523 --> 01:08:00,822
That's right. It's healthy too. It's tuna.

1598
01:08:00,823 --> 01:08:01,863
You're exactly right.

1599
01:08:02,633 --> 01:08:05,093
- You just need cucumber slices. - Yes.

1600
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,832
(The cucumber is the kick.)

1601
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,103
It's tasty.

1602
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:13,672
(They can't stop eating the savory tuna sandwich.)

1603
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,913
(She's absorbed in the taste.)

1604
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,472
I love cabbage.

1605
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:18,813
(She eats a cucumber slice when she wants more texture.)

1606
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,342
(Let's see.)

1607
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,483
Yum.

1608
01:08:21,683 --> 01:08:23,413
(Jun Myun is satisfied.)

1609
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,623
(There's also a fried egg that has been cooked well.)

1610
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:29,753
(Eating)

1611
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:32,763
(This is it.)

1612
01:08:32,923 --> 01:08:35,733
(After eating the egg, )

1613
01:08:38,163 --> 01:08:40,803
(they cleanse their palate with iced Americano.)

1614
01:08:41,303 --> 01:08:43,803
(They enjoy drinking coffee and eating delicious food.)

1615
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:47,243
(The plates have emptied.)

1616
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:51,373
Oh, my.

1617
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:53,583
(The refreshing spring rain falls in the Seongdu Village.)

1618
01:08:55,983 --> 01:08:58,752
(When the rain falls)

1619
01:08:58,753 --> 01:09:01,483
(And the music flows)

1620
01:09:01,853 --> 01:09:05,123
Let's marinate bulgogi

1621
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:07,362
It's for Jae Wook's birthday.

1622
01:09:07,363 --> 01:09:10,963
(The youngest member's birthday party)

1623
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,502
(Will there be a birthday party?)

1624
01:09:13,503 --> 01:09:14,933
(However)

1625
01:09:15,263 --> 01:09:17,373
He'll make his own birthday meal.

1626
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:20,472
The birthday meal will have beef bulgogi...

1627
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:22,242
(Beef bulgogi is a must for a birthday meal.)

1628
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:25,272
(The birthday boy will stir-fry it.)

1629
01:09:25,273 --> 01:09:27,643
- Japchae. - That sounds amazing.

1630
01:09:28,443 --> 01:09:31,383
(Japchae is a must for a feast!)

1631
01:09:31,683 --> 01:09:33,152
There will also be the seaweed soup, of course.

1632
01:09:33,153 --> 01:09:34,682
The soup is milky already.

1633
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:35,693
(Dried pollack and seaweed soup for a birthday meal)

1634
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:38,893
(The queen of baking, Im Tak Gu will even make a birthday cake.)

1635
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:41,522
(For the youngest member who will enter the military soon, )

1636
01:09:41,523 --> 01:09:43,293
(the four siblings will have the last birthday meal.)

1637
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:47,103
(In tears)

1638
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,272
Why am I getting teary?

1639
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:52,743
(The four siblings' tearful birthday party)

1640
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:56,842
(Here's what Jung Ah will do first.)

1641
01:09:56,843 --> 01:09:58,742
I'll marinate the meat.

1642
01:09:58,743 --> 01:10:00,343
(Marinate the beef bulgogi first.)

1643
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,813
(She starts with 6 big spoonfuls of soy sauce.)

1644
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:04,053
Minced garlic.

1645
01:10:04,054 --> 01:10:07,383
(She scrapes the container to add the remaining minced garlic.)

1646
01:10:08,053 --> 01:10:11,393
(Where was it?)

1647
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:14,823
(Pineapple?)

1648
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:16,533
I need a blender.

1649
01:10:18,963 --> 01:10:20,202
(Jung Ah's kick for the bulgogi seasoning!)

1650
01:10:20,203 --> 01:10:21,902
(If you add pineapple, an ingredient that tenderizes the meat, )

1651
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:23,733
(the bulgogi will have a sweetness that's soft and natural.)

1652
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,073
(She adds some juice so that it'll get blended well.)

1653
01:10:26,173 --> 01:10:28,273
(Onion and soju to eliminate any odors)

1654
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:33,313
(It's time to blend the ingredients until they become soft!)

1655
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:38,053
(She pours the mixture into the soy sauce and minced garlic.)

1656
01:10:38,453 --> 01:10:41,453
(Jung Ah's secret beef bulgogi seasoning is complete!)

1657
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,292
- Is that the bulgogi seasoning? - Yes.

1658
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,153
It'll be really tasty. I can't wait to eat it.

1659
01:10:46,023 --> 01:10:49,762
(Pour a generous amount of seasoning into the beef.)

1660
01:10:49,763 --> 01:10:50,893
Slice some green onions.

1661
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:55,103
(He quickly slices the green onions diagonally.)

1662
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:56,902
Add them here.

1663
01:10:56,903 --> 01:10:57,933
(Here are the green onions.)

1664
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:00,043
I'll marinate the meat with green onions.

1665
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:07,143
(Let's marinate the meat for a while so that it absorbs the flavors.)

1666
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,313
Jung Ah, shall I get started right away?

1667
01:11:11,753 --> 01:11:13,482
- The cake? - Yes. Shall I make it later?

1668
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:14,883
- Shall I make it now? - It'll take an hour...

1669
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:16,653
if you use the steam function.

1670
01:11:16,853 --> 01:11:18,623
Mix the eggs and milk.

1671
01:11:19,223 --> 01:11:20,262
(Measurements are important in baking.)

1672
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:21,862
(Checking the rice cooker)

1673
01:11:21,863 --> 01:11:24,793
(Checking the recipe)

1674
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:27,963
Jun Myun, how many milliliters do you think this is?

1675
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:32,302
I need to get exactly 160ml.

1676
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:33,772
(She needs to measure 160ml of milk.)

1677
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:36,843
Pour in a 500ml water bottle.

1678
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:41,542
If I pour in a 500ml water bottle,

1679
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:43,483
will I know how many milliliters this cup can hold?

1680
01:11:44,353 --> 01:11:47,183
If half of the bottle goes in, it means it can hold about 250ml.

1681
01:11:49,153 --> 01:11:51,123
(She brings a water bottle as Jae Wook suggested.)

1682
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:52,792
(She pours it into the cup.)

1683
01:11:52,793 --> 01:11:54,363
Did you bring a new one?

1684
01:11:54,463 --> 01:11:55,663
An opened one.

1685
01:11:56,863 --> 01:12:00,033
Then how will you measure it? You need 500ml of water.

1686
01:12:02,673 --> 01:12:05,433
(I poured out the water because I wanted a drink, okay?)

1687
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:07,843
(Is there a problem?)

1688
01:12:08,343 --> 01:12:10,012
(She's ridiculous.)

1689
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:12,113
Jung Ah, how many milliliters does this cup hold?

1690
01:12:12,483 --> 01:12:13,613
About 250ml.

1691
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:17,053
- About 250ml. Will this be enough? - Let's add it.

1692
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:18,983
(Ji Yeon's rice cooker cake recipe)

1693
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:20,382
(3 eggs, 160ml of milk, )

1694
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:21,783
(10g of butter, and 300g of pancake mix)

1695
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:25,023
(She beats the eggs and milk.)

1696
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:27,423
Here's 10g of butter.

1697
01:12:29,593 --> 01:12:34,163
(She whisks the ingredients until the butter melts.)

1698
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:41,543
(It's time to measure the pancake mix.)

1699
01:12:42,143 --> 01:12:43,712
This is 500g.

1700
01:12:43,713 --> 01:12:44,713
(She needs to add 300g.)

1701
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:46,482
(How will I measure 300g?)

1702
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:48,713
I want to eat a tasty cake.

1703
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:53,382
Why did it have to be his birthday?

1704
01:12:53,383 --> 01:12:56,492
It's such a hassle. It's raining too.

1705
01:12:56,493 --> 01:12:59,122
- Why did it have to be today? - Seriously.

1706
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:00,192
It's so tiresome.

1707
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:02,363
(She says that it's tiresome, but her hands continue to be busy.)

1708
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,563
Ji Yeon, look up how to measure with a paper cup.

1709
01:13:05,493 --> 01:13:06,733
How to measure with a paper cup?

1710
01:13:07,603 --> 01:13:12,033
Look up how many grams of powder goes into a paper cup.

1711
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:15,502
(How to measure with a paper cup)

1712
01:13:15,503 --> 01:13:17,412
You get the exact measurement, right? It's how you measure flour.

1713
01:13:17,413 --> 01:13:20,012
A paper cup holds 110g to 120g.

1714
01:13:20,013 --> 01:13:22,383
So you need three cups and a half.

1715
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:25,582
No. I need 300g.

1716
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,823
(3 cups and a half will give her about 385g.)

1717
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:29,422
What a fool.

1718
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:30,423
(My sweet younger brother doesn't disappoint!)

1719
01:13:30,424 --> 01:13:33,963
(She brings a paper cup as Jae Wook suggested...)

1720
01:13:34,363 --> 01:13:36,593
(and begins to measure the pancake mix!)

1721
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:38,592
(Ji Yeon's rice cooker cake recipe)

1722
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:39,902
(3 eggs, 160ml of milk, 10g of butter, and 300g of pancake mix)

1723
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:40,903
A hundred grams.

1724
01:13:41,203 --> 01:13:43,503
Two hundred grams. If it's 300g...

1725
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,003
About two and a half.

1726
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:48,343
Mix them well so that there are no air bubbles.

1727
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:51,443
Don't worry, Jung Ah. It's coming along perfectly.

1728
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:55,183
(She becomes the human whisk and whisks the ingredients.)

1729
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:58,612
Once I cook this for 40 minutes in the rice cooker's steam mode,

1730
01:13:58,613 --> 01:13:59,623
it'll be done.

1731
01:14:02,153 --> 01:14:03,153
(This is fun!)

1732
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:04,393
Jung Ah, it's done.

1733
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:09,063
(Finally, the rice cooker enters.)

1734
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:11,663
(She pours in the cooking oil first.)

1735
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:13,962
(Patissier Im's baking tip)

1736
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:16,073
(When you oil the inside, the cake comes off in good shape.)

1737
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:19,843
(She swirls it so that it coats the inside evenly.)

1738
01:14:20,343 --> 01:14:22,172
(Singing)

1739
01:14:22,173 --> 01:14:23,913
Adding it in.

1740
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:27,613
(The batter looks pretty good visually.)

1741
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:31,913
(Will it get cooked well in the rice cooker?)

1742
01:14:32,753 --> 01:14:34,152
(With high expectations, she turns on the steam mode!)

1743
01:14:34,153 --> 01:14:36,723
The steam mode, cook.

1744
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:41,692
This is for japchae.

1745
01:14:41,693 --> 01:14:42,732
(Jung Ah is seasoning the meat for japchae.)

1746
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:44,762
(Soy sauce, )

1747
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:46,633
(cooking wine, )

1748
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,462
(minced garlic, )

1749
01:14:48,463 --> 01:14:49,902
(sugar, )

1750
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:51,533
(and pepper get added.)

1751
01:14:52,173 --> 01:14:53,842
It's ready.

1752
01:14:53,843 --> 01:14:55,802
(Once you mix the ingredients, the seasoning is complete.)

1753
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:57,873
I'll stir-fry the japchae.

1754
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:00,413
(Gosh!)

1755
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:02,383
(It's time to stir-fry the julienned vegetables.)

1756
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:06,353
(The carrot gets stir-fried first since it's hard.)

1757
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:08,753
(Then the rest of the vegetables go in!)

1758
01:15:10,393 --> 01:15:13,793
(They become glossy after a moment in the wok.)

1759
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:15,162
- Salt. - Salt.

1760
01:15:15,163 --> 01:15:16,733
(She adds a bit of salt to the vegetables.)

1761
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,403
We'll add spinach to this and stir-fry it.

1762
01:15:20,903 --> 01:15:23,333
(Here comes the spinach.)

1763
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,632
(Is it a spinach field?)

1764
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:27,173
Stir-frying this... It's...

1765
01:15:28,073 --> 01:15:29,243
How do I stir-fry it?

1766
01:15:29,573 --> 01:15:31,473
(Do it well!)

1767
01:15:31,843 --> 01:15:32,912
We need a lot of spinach.

1768
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:33,982
(He tries to mix it in, )

1769
01:15:33,983 --> 01:15:36,783
(but it doesn't work.)

1770
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:40,153
(This won't do. I'll crank up the heat.)

1771
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,182
Once the spinach wilts...

1772
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:44,323
(He stir-fries endlessly until the spinach wilts!)

1773
01:15:48,223 --> 01:15:53,002
(Jung Ah stir-fries the vegetables at the same time.)

1774
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:54,003
You can do it.

1775
01:15:55,903 --> 01:15:58,002
Pour them in here. I'll remove the excess water.

1776
01:15:58,003 --> 01:16:00,273
(Put the stir-fried vegetables on the sieve to remove the water.)

1777
01:16:01,803 --> 01:16:03,773
(You don't need to stir-fry the ingredients separately.)

1778
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:07,383
(It's Jung Ah's simple tip for japchae!)

1779
01:16:07,513 --> 01:16:09,143
The water will come out.

1780
01:16:09,283 --> 01:16:10,413
There shouldn't be any excess water.

1781
01:16:11,653 --> 01:16:14,223
(He adds the meat right away.)

1782
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:18,653
(Once the seasoned meat is somewhat cooked)

1783
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:23,192
Add the shiitake mushroom and season it with soy sauce.

1784
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:24,992
Stir-fry it until there's no water, and it becomes thick.

1785
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:28,303
(Make the mushroom absorb the seasoning of the meat.)

1786
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:33,773
(He removes the excess water with his fancy wok skills.)

1787
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:38,373
(The seasoned meat and mushroom are ready as well.)

1788
01:16:39,243 --> 01:16:40,843
(Let's move the meat and mushroom.)

1789
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,112
(Here comes the glass noodle pot.)

1790
01:16:42,113 --> 01:16:43,253
We need to boil the glass noodles.

1791
01:16:45,853 --> 01:16:46,952
Shall I add one packet, Jung Ah?

1792
01:16:46,953 --> 01:16:48,483
No. Add both of them.

1793
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:50,293
(My goodness)

1794
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,793
(Jung Ah!)

1795
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,593
(What?)

1796
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:57,132
(One packet yields...)

1797
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:58,733
(40 servings.)

1798
01:16:59,163 --> 01:17:02,403
(2 packets yield 80 servings.)

1799
01:17:02,973 --> 01:17:05,872
- Forty servings. 2 packs. - No.

1800
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:07,642
The four of us will be able to eat it.

1801
01:17:07,643 --> 01:17:09,543
(I'm sure it's 4 servings.)

1802
01:17:09,743 --> 01:17:11,272
- No. It's like that... - Two packets.

1803
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:14,143
When you only eat a small plate of japchae.

1804
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,712
A small bit of food on a small plate.

1805
01:17:16,713 --> 01:17:17,812
(1 serving of japchae is 1 plate.)

1806
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:18,913
(It's Chef Yum's personal opinion.)

1807
01:17:19,113 --> 01:17:20,923
Hey, it's your birthday!

1808
01:17:22,483 --> 01:17:23,522
Shall I add them now?

1809
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:25,052
(I'll follow Chef Yum's order!)

1810
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:26,163
(80 servings)

1811
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:29,593
It isn't much.

1812
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:31,863
(Excuse me?)

1813
01:17:32,803 --> 01:17:34,862
Boil them over high heat for eight minutes.

1814
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,603
- Eight minutes once it boils. - Yes.

1815
01:17:36,873 --> 01:17:38,733
I'm starting to get scared.

1816
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,913
(After all, boiled glass noodles...)

1817
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:44,872
Gosh, this is...

1818
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:46,683
(get bloated.)

1819
01:17:47,813 --> 01:17:50,083
(Heave-ho)

1820
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,453
(The cooked glass noodles get sieved.)

1821
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:58,122
Rinse them in cold water.

1822
01:17:58,123 --> 01:18:00,523
(Rinse them in cold water to remove the starch.)

1823
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:02,963
(Then they get transferred to the pot again.)

1824
01:18:03,393 --> 01:18:05,633
I only added salt to the vegetables.

1825
01:18:05,993 --> 01:18:07,702
(Oyster sauce)

1826
01:18:07,703 --> 01:18:08,803
Let's stir-fry them over high heat.

1827
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:10,603
Okay.

1828
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:11,903
(Sugar)

1829
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:13,973
(Stir-fry the glass noodles with seasoning.)

1830
01:18:13,974 --> 01:18:15,043
Glass noodles.

1831
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:17,173
I think they look nice. Pour them in here now.

1832
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:20,612
It's time to mix them. You're going to look amazing.

1833
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:21,613
(They're ready to mix the japchae!)

1834
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:27,583
(It's a waterfall of glass noodles.)

1835
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,752
(Shall I mix them now?)

1836
01:18:29,753 --> 01:18:30,753
Two, three.

1837
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:33,493
(It's heavy even for two people.)

1838
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:35,223
(Mixing it without hesitation.)

1839
01:18:35,224 --> 01:18:36,363
Sesame oil.

1840
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:38,732
(They add an ample amount of the nutty sesame oil.)

1841
01:18:38,733 --> 01:18:39,833
It smells so good.

1842
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:42,132
The smell is insane, Jung Ah.

1843
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:44,533
(The smell of japchae spreads with its glossiness.)

1844
01:18:46,273 --> 01:18:47,303
This is incredible.

1845
01:18:47,673 --> 01:18:49,203
- Japchae is a must for a party. - Yes.

1846
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:52,013
- Gosh, it's going to be incredible. - I know, right?

1847
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:57,112
- Sesame seeds. - It needs a lot of sesame seeds.

1848
01:18:57,113 --> 01:18:58,583
(The sesame seeds get sprinkled as a finishing touch.)

1849
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:02,322
This is incredible.

1850
01:19:02,323 --> 01:19:05,293
(It's the lovely appearance of japchae.)

1851
01:19:05,753 --> 01:19:07,222
- Goodness. - It is a lot.

1852
01:19:07,223 --> 01:19:08,763
Hold on. Let me taste it.

1853
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:11,733
The birthday boy should taste it.

1854
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:15,363
It looks tasty.

1855
01:19:16,433 --> 01:19:17,503
This is incredible.

1856
01:19:21,443 --> 01:19:22,973
- Doesn't it need adjustments? - No.

1857
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:25,143
(So tasty)

1858
01:19:26,443 --> 01:19:29,183
(Ji Yeon, who waited eagerly, takes a bite.)

1859
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:33,053
Is it good?

1860
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:34,883
(Impressed)

1861
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:37,993
Okay. Let's give some to our neighbors.

1862
01:19:38,093 --> 01:19:39,393
- Okay. - Two plates?

1863
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:45,593
(They'll share the party food with the neighbors.)

1864
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:47,263
Let's cover them since it's raining.

1865
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:54,002
(They put a plastic wrap over them so that the rain doesn't get in.)

1866
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:55,173
- Let's go. - Okay.

1867
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,473
I'm thinking about giving this whole thing. What do you think?

1868
01:19:59,213 --> 01:20:01,513
This is more than enough for us.

1869
01:20:03,113 --> 01:20:04,352
We'll share it.

1870
01:20:04,353 --> 01:20:06,552
- Okay. Share it. - Thank you.

1871
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:07,553
(She shares warm food today as well.)

1872
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:13,263
(Thanks to Jung Ah's bulk cooking, everyone enjoys the party food.)

1873
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:17,993
(The bulk japchae disappears.)

1874
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:19,433
Is it tasty?

1875
01:20:19,933 --> 01:20:21,332
Is it very tasty?

1876
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,463
(Proud)

1877
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:27,872
(Thanks to Jae Wook's birthday, they have a party in the village.)

1878
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:29,173
Let's go.

1879
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:30,943
Gosh, it's raining a lot.

1880
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:33,483
(Jun Myun and Jae Wook will deliver japchae.)

1881
01:20:33,543 --> 01:20:35,282
I hope they'll enjoy it.

1882
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:36,653
It's so tasty, Jun Myun.

1883
01:20:36,913 --> 01:20:39,013
I shouldn't worry since Jung Ah has the cooking skills.

1884
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:43,693
(They arrive at the first house with Jung Ah's japchae.)

1885
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,053
- What brings you here? - Hello.

1886
01:20:46,523 --> 01:20:47,593
My goodness. Hold on.

1887
01:20:47,863 --> 01:20:48,892
(Ms. Kim Gyeong Sim, )

1888
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:50,862
(the supermarket in front of the Fresh House)

1889
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:53,103
- It's my birthday tomorrow. - Okay.

1890
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:54,502
- We made japchae. - We made japchae.

1891
01:20:54,503 --> 01:20:56,302
- Gosh, thank you. - It's for you.

1892
01:20:56,303 --> 01:20:57,972
- So... - I'll enjoy it.

1893
01:20:57,973 --> 01:21:01,142
Beautiful people made tasty food.

1894
01:21:01,143 --> 01:21:03,842
- You should eat it now. - Okay. I'll enjoy it.

1895
01:21:03,843 --> 01:21:05,242
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1896
01:21:05,243 --> 01:21:06,343
- Okay. - We'll get going.

1897
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,182
Is anyone home?

1898
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:09,753
(Who is the second neighbor?)

1899
01:21:09,913 --> 01:21:11,413
- Hello. - Ma'am.

1900
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,983
(Ms. Kang Jae Rim, house across from the Fresh House)

1901
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:16,892
- We brought some japchae... - Okay.

1902
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:19,123
- that we made. - Come on in.

1903
01:21:19,993 --> 01:21:21,692
Please enjoy it. It's freshly made.

1904
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:23,033
Drink a cup of tea before you go.

1905
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:25,832
- We'll bring back the tray. - Okay.

1906
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,232
- Thank you. We'll enjoy the tea. - Okay.

1907
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:28,602
- Thank you. - Okay.

1908
01:21:28,603 --> 01:21:30,172
- We'll enjoy the tea. - We'll enjoy the tea.

1909
01:21:30,173 --> 01:21:32,572
We had a nice stay. We'll be leaving soon.

1910
01:21:32,573 --> 01:21:33,972
- Have a safe trip home. - Bye.

1911
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,073
Thank you.

1912
01:21:35,143 --> 01:21:36,242
(They head home with warmth in their hearts.)

1913
01:21:36,243 --> 01:21:38,312
- Now... - We must protect the citrus tea.

1914
01:21:38,313 --> 01:21:40,943
Now, let's eat Jae Wook's birthday meal...

1915
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:42,813
on a day of rain and wind.

1916
01:21:43,613 --> 01:21:47,523
(After delivering love, it's time to get back to cooking.)

1917
01:21:47,823 --> 01:21:49,892
She gave us citrus tea. She said she made it herself.

1918
01:21:49,893 --> 01:21:51,093
My goodness.

1919
01:21:51,223 --> 01:21:53,623
(We'll enjoy the hot citrus tea.)

1920
01:21:54,523 --> 01:21:56,393
Is my cake coming along nicely?

1921
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:01,203
Oh, no. I'm begging you.

1922
01:22:02,533 --> 01:22:04,102
- Should I take the water out? - One minute.

1923
01:22:04,103 --> 01:22:06,803
(The remaining time is 1 minute.)

1924
01:22:06,943 --> 01:22:09,302
I followed the recipe exactly.

1925
01:22:09,303 --> 01:22:11,713
(She pats the rice cooker since she's nervous.)

1926
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:16,313
(Finally)

1927
01:22:16,913 --> 01:22:19,283
(Please!)

1928
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:22,882
(With desperation in her heart, )

1929
01:22:22,883 --> 01:22:25,723
(she opens the rice cooker.)

1930
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:31,233
(How does the cake look?)

1931
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,402
(How...)

1932
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,673
(did it turn out?)

1933
01:22:43,513 --> 01:22:45,573
I don't know if it's done or not.

1934
01:22:47,983 --> 01:22:52,253
(Is it cooked in the middle?)

1935
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:55,683
I think it's done.

1936
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:56,693
(There's no batter on the chopstick!)

1937
01:22:57,193 --> 01:22:58,593
- I think it's done. - Is it done?

1938
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:00,223
- Is it done? - Yes.

1939
01:23:01,593 --> 01:23:04,063
(She just needs to take it out well now.)

1940
01:23:07,003 --> 01:23:08,133
It's done.

1941
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:09,633
It's done.

1942
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:10,703
(She succeeded in it perfectly.)

1943
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:12,433
- It's done. It's perfect. - It's done.

1944
01:23:13,873 --> 01:23:15,873
(Well done, Ji Yeon!)

1945
01:23:16,543 --> 01:23:19,143
(She carefully slices the cake in half.)

1946
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:22,483
(She divides it into two cake sheets!)

1947
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:24,982
Will you add the whipped cream now?

1948
01:23:24,983 --> 01:23:26,183
(Will you add the whipped cream now?)

1949
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:27,623
Here comes the cream.

1950
01:23:29,153 --> 01:23:32,493
(Squeezing out)

1951
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:35,193
(The birthday boy is satisfied.)

1952
01:23:35,923 --> 01:23:37,733
A cake needs a lot of whipped cream.

1953
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:39,903
Let's add an ample amount.

1954
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:44,573
(An ample amount)

1955
01:23:45,173 --> 01:23:47,973
(The patissier has gone crazy.)

1956
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:52,613
(She makes it flat with careful touches.)

1957
01:23:52,913 --> 01:23:56,683
(It's time to put some fruits on top!)

1958
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:59,183
(Plenty of strawberries)

1959
01:23:59,683 --> 01:24:01,122
(Let's use the fruits to make a luxurious birthday cake.)

1960
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:02,383
Let's decorate it now.

1961
01:24:03,523 --> 01:24:05,693
(I'll decorate the cake prettily.)

1962
01:24:06,093 --> 01:24:08,923
(She makes a circle with the strawberries.)

1963
01:24:09,523 --> 01:24:12,633
(Banana slices go in between!)

1964
01:24:12,793 --> 01:24:14,702
- You'll add more cream, right? - She's doing well.

1965
01:24:14,703 --> 01:24:16,003
(She squeezes out more cream over the fruits.)

1966
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:18,273
(Then she covers it with the top sheet!)

1967
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:20,373
(I can't believe I made this!)

1968
01:24:21,043 --> 01:24:24,973
(The top layer becomes a bit fancier.)

1969
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:30,153
(A banana flower has bloomed.)

1970
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:33,753
(She puts the last strawberry on top.)

1971
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:37,323
(She doesn't forget to add the birthday candle.)

1972
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:40,323
(Proud)

1973
01:24:40,423 --> 01:24:42,423
Why don't you put blueberries in between?

1974
01:24:43,593 --> 01:24:48,033
(She adds the blueberries as the birthday boy requested.)

1975
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:49,633
The cake is pretty.

1976
01:24:50,103 --> 01:24:51,473
I did my best.

1977
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:53,302
(The birthday cake has been made successfully.)

1978
01:24:53,303 --> 01:24:55,703
Now, let's set the table.

1979
01:24:58,813 --> 01:24:59,842
This is incredible.

1980
01:24:59,843 --> 01:25:01,183
Gosh, it looks tasty.

1981
01:25:01,483 --> 01:25:02,612
I'll scoop out the soup.

1982
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:04,753
(The birthday boy is excited.)

1983
01:25:06,113 --> 01:25:07,582
It looks so tasty.

1984
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:10,293
(As Jae Wook scoops out the dried pollack and seaweed soup, )

1985
01:25:10,353 --> 01:25:11,622
Beef bulgogi is tasty.

1986
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:16,423
(the main dish, beef bulgogi, gets stir-fried in a tasty way.)

1987
01:25:16,593 --> 01:25:18,433
It'll be better to put it in one big bowl, right?

1988
01:25:19,463 --> 01:25:21,202
(She fills the bowl with beef bulgogi.)

1989
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:22,503
It looks so tasty.

1990
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,073
We're so rich.

1991
01:25:29,273 --> 01:25:31,073
Birthdays are the best.

1992
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:33,043
It's a proper birthday meal.

1993
01:25:35,013 --> 01:25:38,713
(There's beef bulgogi, a must for a birthday meal.)

1994
01:25:39,013 --> 01:25:40,982
There are the birthday soup, the dried pollack and seaweed soup,

1995
01:25:40,983 --> 01:25:43,552
and a huge amount of japchae.

1996
01:25:43,553 --> 01:25:44,593
(Chef Yum's 80-serving japchae for the village feast)

1997
01:25:44,923 --> 01:25:47,363
This is the cake Ji Yeon made.

1998
01:25:47,763 --> 01:25:50,263
(She can even bake now! It's Ji Yeon's home-made cake.)

1999
01:25:50,293 --> 01:25:52,032
There are the stir-fried bracken...

2000
01:25:52,033 --> 01:25:53,933
and Seasoning Park's fresh kimchi.

2001
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:55,762
No words are needed!

2002
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,003
(No words are needed!)

2003
01:25:58,603 --> 01:26:00,602
(For the youngest one's birthday, )

2004
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:02,673
(the sisters made the fanciest meal.)

2005
01:26:03,813 --> 01:26:05,013
Where did they go?

2006
01:26:06,013 --> 01:26:07,043
(Empty)

2007
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:12,283
(The sisters disappeared after making a feast.)

2008
01:26:12,313 --> 01:26:13,752
He might come in.

2009
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:15,923
(He might come in!)

2010
01:26:16,153 --> 01:26:17,892
Jun Myun, here.

2011
01:26:17,893 --> 01:26:20,693
(They're busy behind closed doors.)

2012
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:22,823
All right.

2013
01:26:22,993 --> 01:26:24,592
You wanted to do something.

2014
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:25,993
- Dried Pollack Jae Wook. - What?

2015
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:30,003
(They wear matching hairbands that look rather suspicious.)

2016
01:26:30,733 --> 01:26:34,073
(What are they preparing?)

2017
01:26:34,203 --> 01:26:36,542
Jae Wook has no idea about this.

2018
01:26:36,543 --> 01:26:37,743
(Jae Wook has no idea about this.)

2019
01:26:38,113 --> 01:26:39,872
(Going back to the 1st night in Boryeong)

2020
01:26:39,873 --> 01:26:41,713
We need to practice the song for Jae Wook.

2021
01:26:42,813 --> 01:26:44,382
Let's decide on one.

2022
01:26:44,383 --> 01:26:45,853
(They planned to sing a birthday song.)

2023
01:26:46,153 --> 01:26:48,953
It might be a bit lacking if we only sing.

2024
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:51,292
(Thus, )

2025
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:54,162
(the dance instructor appeared.)

2026
01:26:54,163 --> 01:26:55,223
Something like this?

2027
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:59,063
(How about something like this?)

2028
01:26:59,633 --> 01:27:02,462
(The students are highly satisfied.)

2029
01:27:02,463 --> 01:27:05,502
(Overflowing passion for the choreography)

2030
01:27:05,503 --> 01:27:07,172
(This is "Street Sister Fighter...")

2031
01:27:07,173 --> 01:27:09,943
(with the members who are overly excited.)

2032
01:27:10,343 --> 01:27:14,013
(Having no idea about the ruckus, Jae Wook slept soundly.)

2033
01:27:14,383 --> 01:27:16,683
- We should meet up and practice. - We should do that.

2034
01:27:17,253 --> 01:27:19,152
- We wish you a happy birthday - We wish you a happy birthday

2035
01:27:19,153 --> 01:27:21,123
(Thus, they even rented a practice room.)

2036
01:27:21,423 --> 01:27:23,892
(They changed the lyrics and divided up the parts.)

2037
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:25,523
I'll change this part.

2038
01:27:25,793 --> 01:27:30,163
(Practicing the dance)

2039
01:27:30,593 --> 01:27:34,663
(The three sisters practiced nonstop to give the perfect performance.)

2040
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:37,473
(It continued on in Yeosu as well.)

2041
01:27:37,933 --> 01:27:40,272
(Day...)

2042
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:41,902
(and night)

2043
01:27:41,903 --> 01:27:44,073
(At the sea)

2044
01:27:44,543 --> 01:27:48,812
(They practiced hard whenever Jae Wook wasn't around.)

2045
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:51,553
(The day of the birthday party has arrived.)

2046
01:27:52,453 --> 01:27:55,853
(What remains is...)

2047
01:27:57,823 --> 01:28:03,263
(They hid in the room without Jae Wook's knowledge.)

2048
01:28:03,593 --> 01:28:05,392
We'll film an insert.

2049
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:06,493
Okay.

2050
01:28:07,863 --> 01:28:09,862
(Now is the time!)

2051
01:28:09,863 --> 01:28:11,373
(Hurried)

2052
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:14,843
(It's time for the performance.)

2053
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:17,673
(They have a last-minute dance practice.)

2054
01:28:18,343 --> 01:28:20,483
(Meanwhile, Jae Wook...)

2055
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,712
(Where are they?)

2056
01:28:23,713 --> 01:28:26,583
(He begins to look for the older members.)

2057
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:28,653
We can't get caught now.

2058
01:28:28,823 --> 01:28:31,323
Let's lower the volume as much as possible.

2059
01:28:32,693 --> 01:28:33,823
Where are the members?

2060
01:28:35,163 --> 01:28:36,363
Where are the members?

2061
01:28:36,863 --> 01:28:37,863
Oh, no.

2062
01:28:37,864 --> 01:28:39,393
- Let's go out now. - Hey.

2063
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:41,103
- Let's go out now. - Did you lock the door?

2064
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,402
I'm nervous!

2065
01:28:42,403 --> 01:28:43,403
(I'm nervous!)

2066
01:28:43,673 --> 01:28:45,773
(The members are in the room.)

2067
01:28:47,003 --> 01:28:48,073
Shall we go out?

2068
01:28:49,603 --> 01:28:52,113
(At that moment)

2069
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:01,322
(A surprise entrance)

2070
01:29:01,323 --> 01:29:02,423
Ta-da.

2071
01:29:02,483 --> 01:29:05,092
- Happy birthday, Jae Wook. - Where did you get them?

2072
01:29:05,093 --> 01:29:06,323
(Happy birthday, Jae Wook.)

2073
01:29:06,723 --> 01:29:08,293
Where did you get them?

2074
01:29:10,093 --> 01:29:11,432
They're so cute.

2075
01:29:11,433 --> 01:29:12,632
(The sisters' surprise)

2076
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:13,633
(How do we look?)

2077
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:16,562
For goodness' sake. It says, "Dried Pollack Jae Wook."

2078
01:29:16,563 --> 01:29:17,873
(Somewhere between a present and mockery)

2079
01:29:17,933 --> 01:29:21,003
To celebrate Jae Wook's birthday,

2080
01:29:21,103 --> 01:29:24,473
- we prepared a special performance. - Come on.

2081
01:29:24,773 --> 01:29:26,643
(Surprised)

2082
01:29:26,713 --> 01:29:28,682
- For you, - We prepared something.

2083
01:29:28,683 --> 01:29:30,313
We prepared a birthday message.

2084
01:29:30,753 --> 01:29:32,482
- Please take a seat. - Sit here.

2085
01:29:32,483 --> 01:29:34,283
(He sits down right away.)

2086
01:29:34,753 --> 01:29:37,523
(They become a bit embarrassed in front of Jae Wook.)

2087
01:29:37,693 --> 01:29:38,892
It's nothing. Here we go.

2088
01:29:38,893 --> 01:29:40,663
- I think it'll be really fun. - It's nothing.

2089
01:29:40,763 --> 01:29:41,792
I'm so excited.

2090
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:42,793
(Full of expectations)

2091
01:29:43,563 --> 01:29:45,162
(Music, cue.)

2092
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:46,163
What will we do?

2093
01:29:49,663 --> 01:29:52,002
("Sorrow," music by Yun Il Sang and lyrics by Lee Seung Ho)

2094
01:29:52,003 --> 01:29:54,243
(Lyrical changes and choreography by the Fresh members)

2095
01:30:02,443 --> 01:30:06,883
(For Jae Wook who will begin his military service, )

2096
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:12,453
(the sisters have prepared a performance for a long time.)

2097
01:30:12,893 --> 01:30:14,693
- Jae Wook - Jae Wook

2098
01:30:14,823 --> 01:30:17,033
- Meeting you - Meeting you

2099
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:20,803
- Made us happy and joyous - Made us happy and joyous

2100
01:30:21,163 --> 01:30:23,032
- We wish you a happy birthday - We wish you a happy birthday

2101
01:30:23,033 --> 01:30:25,202
- A very happy birthday - A very happy birthday

2102
01:30:25,203 --> 01:30:28,502
- Listen to what we have to say - Listen to what we have to say

2103
01:30:28,503 --> 01:30:32,372
Jae Wook said that he didn't get seasick

2104
01:30:32,373 --> 01:30:34,682
He trusted us and showed his clumsy side

2105
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:35,843
I think I'm going to cry.

2106
01:30:36,243 --> 01:30:40,552
- Jae Wook needs time for labor - Jae Wook needs time for labor

2107
01:30:40,553 --> 01:30:43,853
So that he can get over seasickness

2108
01:30:44,593 --> 01:30:48,093
Have you always been good at building a fire?

2109
01:30:48,463 --> 01:30:51,993
You made sashimi with ease no matter the kind of fish

2110
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:56,132
Lee Jae Wook turned every place into a runway

2111
01:30:56,133 --> 01:30:59,103
He wore the work clothes like a model

2112
01:30:59,233 --> 01:31:03,102
We enjoyed being on Fresh off the Sea with him

2113
01:31:03,103 --> 01:31:06,912
Thinking about sending him off to the military

2114
01:31:06,913 --> 01:31:11,282
I already feel dizzy and my heart aches

2115
01:31:11,283 --> 01:31:14,653
Don't make me cry

2116
01:31:15,223 --> 01:31:18,693
He was my best partner in cooking

2117
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:20,152
No words are needed

2118
01:31:20,153 --> 01:31:22,393
The golden youngest, Lee Jae Wook

2119
01:31:22,963 --> 01:31:26,433
He could do many tasks at once

2120
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:28,932
Without a problem, fire

2121
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:29,963
- Fire - Fire

2122
01:31:30,003 --> 01:31:31,573
- We're happy - We're happy

2123
01:31:31,873 --> 01:31:33,872
- That we can celebrate - That we can celebrate

2124
01:31:33,873 --> 01:31:37,572
- Jae Wook's birthday - Jae Wook's birthday

2125
01:31:37,573 --> 01:31:39,842
- Jae Wook, happy birthday - Jae Wook, happy birthday

2126
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:42,042
- You're our 1 and only youngest - You're our 1 and only youngest

2127
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:45,082
- Thank you so much for being born - Thank you so much for being born

2128
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,112
Im Ji Yeon!

2129
01:31:46,113 --> 01:31:47,852
In my eyes, Jae Wook is young

2130
01:31:47,853 --> 01:31:49,752
I tried different ways to teach him a lesson

2131
01:31:49,753 --> 01:31:51,622
Jae Wook keeps looking down on me

2132
01:31:51,623 --> 01:31:53,662
He doesn't listen to me

2133
01:31:53,663 --> 01:31:55,722
We bicker all the time

2134
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:57,432
But I'm a strong sister who seizes control

2135
01:31:57,433 --> 01:31:59,362
Listen to me and do as I say

2136
01:31:59,363 --> 01:32:00,962
- The youngest member - Im Jae Wook

2137
01:32:00,963 --> 01:32:02,433
- We're lucky girls - We're lucky girls

2138
01:32:02,803 --> 01:32:04,732
- Because we can celebrate - Because we can celebrate

2139
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:08,542
- Jae Wook's birthday - Jae Wook's birthday

2140
01:32:08,543 --> 01:32:10,742
- We wish you a happy birthday - We wish you a happy birthday

2141
01:32:10,743 --> 01:32:12,773
- You're today's main character - You're today's main character

2142
01:32:12,913 --> 01:32:16,183
- We'll make your birthday happy - We'll make your birthday happy

2143
01:32:16,683 --> 01:32:21,152
- Please - Please

2144
01:32:21,153 --> 01:32:23,253
(The confetti gives the performance the perfect finale.)

2145
01:32:23,693 --> 01:32:25,322
Why am I in tears?

2146
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:27,823
(Why am I in tears?)

2147
01:32:28,263 --> 01:32:29,292
How cute.

2148
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,332
(The youngest one becomes thoughtful after the surprise performance.)

2149
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:34,333
- That was the best. - It was so much fun.

2150
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:36,362
I had to suppress the tears...

2151
01:32:36,363 --> 01:32:37,602
- in the beginning. - Seriously.

2152
01:32:37,603 --> 01:32:40,203
I almost cried because you were teary-eyed.

2153
01:32:40,303 --> 01:32:42,673
(The strong eldest member, Jung Ah, )

2154
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:46,713
(saw the youngest member, Jae Wook, get teary-eyed.)

2155
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:52,152
(She showed tears for the first time.)

2156
01:32:52,153 --> 01:32:55,683
(Jun Myun was crying the whole time.)

2157
01:32:56,123 --> 01:32:57,823
Why do I keep tearing up?

2158
01:32:57,893 --> 01:32:59,323
- I don't know. - I keep welling up.

2159
01:32:59,353 --> 01:33:01,423
When did you write the lyrics?

2160
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:04,263
- We prepared it for a long time. - Really?

2161
01:33:06,493 --> 01:33:08,532
(He blows out the birthday candle.)

2162
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:09,562
(Happy Jae Wook)

2163
01:33:09,563 --> 01:33:12,403
(The second sibling becomes emotional again.)

2164
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:14,472
Jun Myun is about to cry.

2165
01:33:14,473 --> 01:33:15,602
(Laughing)

2166
01:33:15,603 --> 01:33:18,212
(Unhappy Jun Myun)

2167
01:33:18,213 --> 01:33:21,883
It's not that. It was just so touching.

2168
01:33:23,013 --> 01:33:24,682
It was so touching.

2169
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,153
(I also thought that it was touching.)

2170
01:33:26,553 --> 01:33:28,723
(Me too.)

2171
01:33:29,353 --> 01:33:32,422
(Jae Wook's birthday meal has both tears and laughter.)

2172
01:33:32,423 --> 01:33:35,223
A moment like this is so touching. Seriously.

2173
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,192
- Why do I keep tearing up? - Unbelievable.

2174
01:33:37,193 --> 01:33:38,632
- Jung Ah, give me tissue paper. - Without reservation...

2175
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:41,433
How did you prepare everything? Shall we hurry up and eat?

2176
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,363
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2177
01:33:45,403 --> 01:33:48,673
(It's his last birthday seaweed soup before joining the military.)

2178
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:51,173
(Eating)

2179
01:33:51,373 --> 01:33:52,373
(Sucking)

2180
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:54,513
It's so tasty.

2181
01:33:55,413 --> 01:33:58,313
(They feel proud since the birthday boy enjoys it.)

2182
01:33:58,783 --> 01:34:03,082
(The birthday meal contains heartwarming memories.)

2183
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,192
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2184
01:34:05,193 --> 01:34:06,652
It was very touching.

2185
01:34:06,653 --> 01:34:07,663
(The youngest one's birthday party ends.)

2186
01:34:12,933 --> 01:34:16,003
(She spots the photos.)

2187
01:34:18,173 --> 01:34:23,003
(The photos contain their memories from February to May.)

2188
01:34:26,873 --> 01:34:30,083
(Jung Ah studies them for a while.)

2189
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:34,683
(She decides to leave a message that she cannot speak.)

2190
01:34:35,283 --> 01:34:38,192
We said this often when we were by ourselves.

2191
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:41,162
We stayed together for 2 nights and 3 days at a time.

2192
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:45,132
Such special connections can't be made anywhere else.

2193
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:46,893
We really are a family.

2194
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:51,032
I wasn't sad after Season One. I'm not sad now.

2195
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:53,173
After all, we'll keep in touch and meet up again.

2196
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:55,373
Jung Ah, just say that you're sad.

2197
01:34:56,543 --> 01:34:58,073
- Aren't you sad? - No.

2198
01:34:59,543 --> 01:35:02,343
I lost. It's the feeler who always gets hurt.

2199
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:04,982
I wanted to wrap up the shoot in a good mood,

2200
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:06,413
but my heart aches so much.

2201
01:35:07,183 --> 01:35:08,283
I guess I'm sad.

2202
01:35:08,723 --> 01:35:10,852
Why do I feel like I'm going to cry? I feel like I'm going to cry.

2203
01:35:10,853 --> 01:35:12,253
- Really? - Yes.

2204
01:35:12,353 --> 01:35:13,893
The weather was cold,

2205
01:35:14,363 --> 01:35:17,763
but I didn't feel cold very often.

2206
01:35:18,363 --> 01:35:20,603
The time I spent with the members...

2207
01:35:20,933 --> 01:35:23,832
gave me very good memories.

2208
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:27,943
So when I look back on those days, I don't feel cold. I feel warm.

2209
01:35:28,543 --> 01:35:29,973
The work wasn't very hard.

2210
01:35:30,773 --> 01:35:33,673
It was very nice. I met some very nice people.

2211
01:35:34,213 --> 01:35:38,652
In my life, Fresh off the Sea is a good carry-on suitcase...

2212
01:35:38,653 --> 01:35:40,553
- Well... - A carry-on suitcase?

2213
01:35:40,683 --> 01:35:42,723
A carry-on suitcase. Get Jun Myun's carry-on suitcase.

2214
01:35:42,823 --> 01:35:45,193
- Gosh. She's ready to go. - Get Jun Myun's carry-on suitcase.

2215
01:35:45,293 --> 01:35:47,193
- Get it. - Hey, a carry-on suitcase?

2216
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:48,323
Jung Ah.

2217
01:35:49,663 --> 01:35:53,593
In my life, it's a very dazzling moment.

2218
01:35:54,563 --> 01:35:58,903
Jung Ah, thank you so much.

2219
01:35:59,533 --> 01:36:00,842
(Emotional)

2220
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:02,173
- What? - Oh, no.

2221
01:36:02,773 --> 01:36:03,813
Hold on.

2222
01:36:04,173 --> 01:36:06,143
(What's going on?)

2223
01:36:06,773 --> 01:36:08,183
Thank you so much.

2224
01:36:08,283 --> 01:36:09,382
(Sobbing)

2225
01:36:09,383 --> 01:36:10,883
(Her tear ducts are malfunctioning again.)

2226
01:36:10,983 --> 01:36:13,653
(The interview had to be stopped because she cried so much.)

2227
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:16,023
The members were like...

2228
01:36:17,323 --> 01:36:19,353
vitamins to me.

2229
01:36:20,723 --> 01:36:22,793
They were like high-end health supplements.

2230
01:36:27,233 --> 01:36:28,363
(Blowing her nose)

2231
01:36:30,303 --> 01:36:31,703
(Blowing her nose)

2232
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:34,573
I hope I see them often.

2233
01:36:34,773 --> 01:36:37,712
When I go through a rough patch in my life,

2234
01:36:37,713 --> 01:36:39,742
I'll think of Jung Ah and Jun Myun a lot.

2235
01:36:39,743 --> 01:36:41,413
I'll think of Jae Wook a lot.

2236
01:36:41,813 --> 01:36:46,213
I'll live my life without forgetting the things I've learned here.

2237
01:36:46,313 --> 01:36:48,853
Thank you. Here's a heart.

2238
01:36:48,953 --> 01:36:51,093
(Blowing her nose)

2239
01:36:51,393 --> 01:36:52,792
Jun Myun keeps crying.

2240
01:36:52,793 --> 01:36:55,663
- For goodness' sake. - No, Jung Ah. Seriously.

2241
01:36:56,223 --> 01:36:58,032
We didn't leave anything behind, right?

2242
01:36:58,033 --> 01:36:59,033
No, we didn't.

2243
01:37:00,063 --> 01:37:01,662
Let's take the last photo in Yeosu.

2244
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:02,832
Do you want to take it?

2245
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:04,532
What? You should do it.

2246
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:06,033
(Bumping)

2247
01:37:06,973 --> 01:37:08,773
- Until the very end... - Until the very end...

2248
01:37:09,673 --> 01:37:11,173
He'll forget all of his lines.

2249
01:37:12,643 --> 01:37:13,643
- One, two. - Two.

2250
01:37:13,644 --> 01:37:15,482
- Yeosu, bye. - Bye.

2251
01:37:15,483 --> 01:37:17,582
Fresh off the Sea 2, bye.

2252
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:20,183
- Bye. - Bye.

2253
01:37:20,623 --> 01:37:22,552
(You've watched Yum Jung Ah, )

2254
01:37:22,553 --> 01:37:24,352
(Park Jun Myun, )

2255
01:37:24,353 --> 01:37:26,122
(Im Ji Yeon, )

2256
01:37:26,123 --> 01:37:28,023
(and Lee Jae Wook.)

2257
01:37:28,363 --> 01:37:31,163
(The four siblings' last story is coming soon.)

2258
01:37:32,099 --> 01:37:33,868
(From February...)

2259
01:37:33,869 --> 01:37:36,039
(to May, )

2260
01:37:37,709 --> 01:37:41,609
(they went on a journey to find the seasonal ingredients.)

2261
01:37:43,179 --> 01:37:44,308
(Boryeong's webfoot octopus)

2262
01:37:44,309 --> 01:37:45,478
(Goseong's stationary net fishery)

2263
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:46,479
(Daegwallyeong's dried pollack)
(Soan Island's laver)

2264
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:48,479
(Sinji Island's oyster)
(Ungcheon's scallion)

2265
01:37:49,479 --> 01:37:50,479
(Dolsan Island's mustard green)

2266
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,619
(Yeosu's grey mullet)

2267
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:55,818
(At times, the labor was extremely exhausting.)

2268
01:37:55,819 --> 01:37:58,189
- You won't get paid at this rate. - You won't get paid at this rate.

2269
01:37:58,589 --> 01:38:00,959
(Since the labor was hard, )

2270
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:05,029
(they cherished the ingredients.)

2271
01:38:05,369 --> 01:38:08,239
(And there were precious guests who traveled a long way.)

2272
01:38:09,169 --> 01:38:12,268
(We thank them for coming without a moment of hesitation.)

2273
01:38:12,269 --> 01:38:14,709
- She's thorough. - She doesn't disappoint.

2274
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:17,449
- Jin Young! - Jung Ah!

2275
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:19,908
We're in Wando.

2276
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:23,018
We don't know where we'll be dragged to today.

2277
01:38:23,019 --> 01:38:25,749
Let's go. It's your turn now.

2278
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,919
(We'll come back in a new season.)
