1
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,273
(The spring breeze blows gently in April.)

2
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:21,743
(The Fresh members meet again by the West Sea.)

3
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:25,683
(The place has a mudflat that's the gift of nature.)

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,183
(The place where the green field stretches out)

5
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:33,593
(Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province)

6
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,593
(You've heard of the Boryeong mud, right?)

7
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,232
(The clean mudflat in the sea...)

8
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:44,833
(is full of various seafood.)

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,903
(Fresh crops grow in the rich soil.)

10
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:56,443
(The fields and the sea of Boryeong)

11
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,482
(To get the seasonal ingredients that are the freshest, )

12
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,583
(they travel around Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province.)

13
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,953
(Will the intense labor make them go on strike?)

14
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:06,852
(For the four siblings who are exhausted from working, )

15
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,692
(a guest comes secretly.)

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,493
(Peeking)

17
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:14,233
(Hye Yoon will come.)

18
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,932
(The place that'll be filled with the members' groans, )

19
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,203
(Boryeong)

20
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:25,843
(Muchangpo Beach is quiet in the morning.)

21
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:29,573
The sea is nice and calm.

22
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:30,782
Right?

23
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:32,613
- Webfoot octopus. - It looks like a good restaurant.

24
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,883
I know what we'll work on today.

25
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,522
Webfoot octopus.

26
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,053
I bet we'll catch webfoot octopuses today.

27
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:41,323
- It must be the webfoot octopus. - It must be the webfoot octopus.

28
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,292
They must be full of roe these days.

29
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:45,493
Webfoot octopus roe is really tasty.

30
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:49,262
Do many fishers come here? Every shop is related to fishing.

31
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,762
Can you catch webfoot octopuses by fishing?

32
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,933
(A small restaurant that's located between the fishing shops)

33
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:56,473
- Which way is it? - What? Are we eating jjajangmyeon?

34
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:59,203
Is this the place?

35
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:00,973
Is this the place?

36
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:02,672
There are no other places.

37
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:03,713
(Why is there a Chinese restaurant?)

38
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:06,413
What's this?

39
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,852
Hello.

40
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:10,182
I don't think this is the right restaurant.

41
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,382
(They can't believe the menu.)

42
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,593
- What's this? - I didn't imagine Chinese food.

43
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,593
I'm the best at eating jjajangmyeon.

44
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:18,792
(Ji Yeon ate jjajangmyeon in "Lies Hidden in My Garden.")

45
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:21,133
Ji Yeon, you should have another jjajangmyeon eating show.

46
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:24,162
(The Death Set she ate after her abusive husband died...)

47
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:26,363
(became the talk of the town.)

48
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,833
(Her acting was so realistic.)

49
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,242
I can't say no to Chinese food.

50
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,403
If it weren't for the shoot,

51
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,443
I would've had Kaoliang liquor...

52
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:37,383
to chase down the food...

53
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,683
and eliminate the grease.

54
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:43,923
(Thinking about it makes them happy.)

55
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,753
- It's a bit scary. Why is it scary? - What's up with this place?

56
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:51,962
I'm scared.

57
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,333
(What will they make us do today?)

58
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:57,962
What could it be?

59
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:00,633
(Why did they call us all the way here?)

60
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:04,072
(Holding hands)

61
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,573
- No one is here. - What?

62
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:09,813
(Chinese food)

63
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,612
- Will they do something scary? - No way! Stop it.

64
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,052
- Stop it. - It's a puppy.

65
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,313
You startled me.

66
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:19,123
- Why am I scared? - I'm scared too.

67
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,322
- There are people. - What? I was right.

68
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,692
- That startled me. - Why are you so...

69
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:24,793
That really startled me.

70
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,593
This place is no joke.

71
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,862
Isn't a Chinese restaurant a surprise?

72
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:29,863
Seriously.

73
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:32,003
What are we supposed to have for breakfast?

74
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,703
I'll have jjajangmyeon.

75
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:35,803
I'll have seafood jjajangmyeon.

76
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:38,142
I'll order jjamppong. Let's share the dishes.

77
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:41,643
- That's a good idea. Two of each. - Let's order two of each.

78
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,443
Who wants Sprite?

79
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,112
- Sprite. - Me!

80
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:48,583
Sir, do you have Sprite? Do you have Sprite Zero?

81
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,682
Good restaurants have Sprite.

82
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:52,222
- Thank you for the food. - This is a good restaurant.

83
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,352
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

84
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,493
Give us Sprite.

85
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,893
Let's work energetically today.

86
00:03:58,223 --> 00:03:59,463
- Let's go. - Let's go.

87
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,393
(Drinking)

88
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,533
(For an energetic day, )

89
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,333
(they enjoy a refreshing drink.)

90
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:12,343
My stomach opened when I entered the Chinese restaurant.

91
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:14,513
As soon as I saw the menu...

92
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:15,913
I became excited.

93
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,343
- The food must be coming. - It's coming.

94
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:19,843
(Impressed)

95
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,453
(My goodness)

96
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,352
(Exclaiming)

97
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:24,782
My goodness, the main dishes.

98
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,123
- Isn't that chili japchae? - My goodness.

99
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,723
My goodness.

100
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:29,692
- What's this dish? - It's the eight treasures stir-fry.

101
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,023
The eight treasures stir-fry. That's right.

102
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:32,962
(Eight treasures stir-fry)

103
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:34,033
Seafood.

104
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,133
(Eight ingredients were stir-fried in a savory sauce.)

105
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,962
(Shrimp, abalone, squid, webfoot octopus, )

106
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,003
(bamboo shoot, bell pepper, carrot, and onion)

107
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:45,403
(They get stir-fried to take on the smoky flavor.)

108
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:50,243
(Eight treasures stir-fry that's full of seafood)

109
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,143
(A dish that's a must in Chinese cuisine)

110
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,252
(Old-fashioned tangsuyuk with the crispy coating)

111
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,183
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

112
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,822
(She takes a bite of tangsuyuk, a popular Chinese dish.)

113
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:03,862
It's tasty.

114
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:05,062
(Impressed)

115
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:06,862
(Crispy outside, chewy inside)

116
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:08,363
It's cool that we're eating webfoot octopuses.

117
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,262
It's a nice restaurant.

118
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:12,302
(What's up with this restaurant?)

119
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,332
It's tasty, Jung Ah.

120
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,333
(Tangsuyuk is enough to make them feel the skills.)

121
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,433
It's tasty.

122
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,903
- Webfoot octopus. - It looks tasty.

123
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,843
It looks so tasty.

124
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:22,743
(Staring intently)

125
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,283
Jun Myun.

126
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,152
Wait. Wait for your turn.

127
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,483
(Jae Wook, I want the eight treasures stir-fry too.)

128
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,253
Give it to me. Hurry up and give it to me.

129
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,653
I'll give you a lot of vegetables.

130
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,592
(He only scoops out the vegetables.)

131
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:38,623
(Here you go.)

132
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:39,962
(Here you go.)

133
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,693
(Don't joke around with food.)

134
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,803
(Joking)

135
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,233
(Full)

136
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,302
It won't be easy to catch them.

137
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:49,603
(Expectant)

138
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,413
Gosh, it's tender.

139
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,443
(Tender)

140
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,053
(Impressed)

141
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,053
It's a nice restaurant.

142
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,623
Jung Ah, these webfoot octopuses...

143
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:07,493
- are plump and tasty. - They're much bigger.

144
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,223
(This webfoot octopus is something else.)

145
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,722
I like that this webfoot octopus is tender.

146
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,092
It's tender.

147
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:15,732
(The taste of the webfoot octopus stands out the most...)

148
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,363
(among the 8 ingredients.)

149
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,463
The food is here.

150
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:21,332
What should we do with this?

151
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,672
- All right. - Thank you.

152
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,803
(Oh, my. What?)

153
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:28,272
(Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong look hearty.)

154
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,043
- Take one each. - What's this?

155
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:31,942
This is incredible.

156
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:33,243
(They look incredible.)

157
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,153
Gosh, they look tasty.

158
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:40,353
(A generous amount of seafood in the spicy soup)

159
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:44,593
(The chili powder and smoky flavor make the soup refreshing.)

160
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:48,162
(The refreshing soup with a lot of seafood...)

161
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,863
(is the best in the seafood jjamppong.)

162
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,473
(A variety of seafood has been fried in the savory jjajang sauce.)

163
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:00,303
(The seafood jjajangmyeon is glossy.)

164
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:04,643
My goodness. It'll take a while...

165
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,482
to find the noodles.

166
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,083
(The jjamppong noodles are buried in seafood.)

167
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:10,152
How can the head of a webfoot octopus be so big?

168
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:11,923
(A webfoot octopus with the XXL-sized head)

169
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,552
- It looks tasty. - It looks tasty.

170
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:14,623
- A webfoot octopus head... - Eat this.

171
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:17,463
(Happy)

172
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,733
(She eats the webfoot octopus head before inhaling the noodles.)

173
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,003
(The webfoot octopus fills both of her cheeks.)

174
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:27,573
(It's so chewy.)

175
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,433
(He mixes the jjajang sauce and the noodles well.)

176
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:32,403
It's so tasty.

177
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,342
(The old-fashioned jjajangmyeon tastes clean and savory.)

178
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,742
It's tasty.

179
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:40,043
(The old-fashioned jjajangmyeon tastes clean and savory.)

180
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,983
(Impressed)

181
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,483
(She can't say no to jjajangmyeon.)

182
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,593
(It's so tasty!)

183
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:52,263
(Ji Yeon is the best at eating jjajangmyeon.)

184
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,733
(Slurping)

185
00:07:57,063 --> 00:08:00,673
(The Fresh Set rivals the Death Set.)

186
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,503
(My goodness)

187
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,843
(Impressed)

188
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,683
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

189
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,113
The taste is mild.

190
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:16,812
(The seafood jjajangmyeon tastes mild, but savory.)

191
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:17,983
There's so much to eat.

192
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:19,722
It's tasty.

193
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,693
(It's time for the spicy soup.)

194
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,723
(Drinking)

195
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:29,133
(Her eyes go wide.)

196
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:32,933
(Drinking the refreshing and spicy soup...)

197
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,673
(resets the stomach.)

198
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:41,443
(Slurping)

199
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,513
It contains a lot of green onions.

200
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:49,113
(Being a vegetable enthusiast, Jung Ah gets a lot of vegetables.)

201
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:53,023
(Slurping)

202
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:56,222
(Thus began...)

203
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:59,193
(the slurping party.)

204
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,033
There's more.

205
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,463
- So many webfoot octopuses. - They added so many.

206
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,673
(She loves webfoot octopus.)

207
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,873
(Another webfoot octopus head)

208
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:18,213
My dad goes webfoot octopus fishing every year.

209
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:19,983
Thus,

210
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,812
we always cook webfoot octopuses around this season.

211
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,383
- Does your dad catch them? - Yes.

212
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,352
When you catch webfoot octopuses,

213
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:29,052
there's roe in their heads.

214
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,693
It's so tasty. My dad catches them.

215
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,262
(The ingredient of the day must be...)

216
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,433
Webfoot octopus.

217
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,293
Webfoot octopus.

218
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,933
Webfoot octopus must be one of them.

219
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,033
Another ingredient must be in this meal.

220
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:45,002
(Which one could it be?)

221
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,472
(Which ingredient will they get today?)

222
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,612
Squid?

223
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:49,743
Onion.

224
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:51,083
Abalone.

225
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:53,683
Shrimp? Shrimp.

226
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,152
(Shrimp, onion, bell pepper, squid, abalone, )

227
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:56,782
(webfoot octopus)

228
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:59,553
(There are too many candidates.)

229
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,023
So what are we doing today?

230
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:03,453
What do you think it is?

231
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:04,923
Webfoot octopus.

232
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:07,493
Webfoot octopus is correct, but...

233
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,163
(Webfoot octopus is correct?)

234
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,262
You don't have a clue about the second one.

235
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,863
- We didn't even mention it? - We don't have a clue?

236
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,233
- We didn't even mention it? - We don't have a clue?

237
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:21,343
(What could it be?)

238
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,212
- There are abalones inside. - Maybe...

239
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,883
we'll go to a flour factory and make noodles.

240
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:27,482
It'll be fun.

241
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,813
- It'll be fun. - What could it be?

242
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,083
What is it?

243
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:35,092
The seasonal ingredient you'll work on today...

244
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,793
here in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province is...

245
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,563
(What's the other one?)

246
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,263
scallion.

247
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,962
Oh, my.

248
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,162
(Scallion?)

249
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,903
It's no wonder the dishes contained so many scallions.

250
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,873
Do you mean the scallion that was the jjajangmyeon topping?

251
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:52,143
(For goodness' sake)

252
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:55,772
Ungcheon is well-known for its scallion.

253
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,882
The scallion field where you'll harvest scallion...

254
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,612
is 3,300m² big.

255
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,512
(3,300m²)

256
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,112
(How is a scallion field 3,300m² big?)

257
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,383
(The first seasonal ingredient of Boryeong)

258
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,323
(The pride of Boryeong, scallion)

259
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,393
(The scallion of Ungcheon, Boryeong is in season.)

260
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:16,133
It's the very best scallion in the nation.

261
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:20,233
They're farmed in the sandy soil,

262
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:24,742
so they're fresh and fragrant.

263
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,873
(Sandy soil is good for drainage, which makes the roots healthy.)

264
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:29,443
(The green scallion field awaits the Fresh members.)

265
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,883
I'm so glad that it isn't cold.

266
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,282
When I woke up in the morning,

267
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,113
it wasn't so cold.

268
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,782
(Jung Ah spots something.)

269
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:39,883
Oh, my!

270
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,452
Aren't these cherry blossoms?

271
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:42,652
(Oh, my! Aren't these cherry blossoms?)

272
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,423
(My goodness)

273
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:48,193
It's insane. They're cherry blossoms.

274
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,063
Look at these cherry blossoms.

275
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,003
I can't believe it. They're cherry blossoms.

276
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,272
- Isn't the color so pretty? - Look at the petals fall.

277
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:58,573
How pretty.

278
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:02,173
All of them are cherry blossom trees.

279
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,842
My goodness.

280
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,883
(The cherry blossoms outside make their eyes go wide.)

281
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,212
(Their hearts sway...)

282
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,253
(like the spring breeze.)

283
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,183
They have the Cherry Blossom Festival.

284
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,523
This road is so long.

285
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,322
It's 6.3km long.

286
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,562
(The 6.3km-long pink carpet)

287
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,692
(It's the Jusan Cherry Blossom Road in Boryeong.)

288
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:22,993
- The spring breeze - It's so pretty.

289
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,533
Jung Ah, it's amazing.

290
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,462
(My goodness)

291
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:27,633
(Jung Ah, it's amazing.)

292
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,802
When I had my first work on the show,

293
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:32,973
- I never expected flowers to bloom. - I know.

294
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,912
Hanging the dried pollacks seems just like yesterday.

295
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:37,982
- It was so cold. - Yes.

296
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,242
Doesn't it feel like a recent event?

297
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:40,313
I know.

298
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,512
- Exactly. - It was so cold that day.

299
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,552
- It was so cold. - The drying yard was cold.

300
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:45,652
Now, the flowers have bloomed.

301
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,152
We had a runny nose.

302
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,453
(They share the memories of their work in winter.)

303
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:51,262
I'm afraid that spring will be short-lived.

304
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:52,322
- I don't think it'll last long. - Then...

305
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:53,792
we'll move on to summer right away.

306
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:54,993
I don't think it'll last long.

307
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:58,833
It's incredible that we came here.

308
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,032
It's hard to come to such a place.

309
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,972
That's right. Had we stayed in Seoul...

310
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:05,272
- and focused on work... - We usually focus on work.

311
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,772
I love that we're spending the season together.

312
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:09,842
You're romantic, Jae Wook.

313
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,313
He's romantic.

314
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,083
You're my season.

315
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,382
What?

316
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,952
(Ji Yeon in spring.)

317
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,183
Our season.

318
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,593
- Spring has come. - Spring has come.

319
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,693
I'm looking forward to the house.

320
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,133
- I bet it'll be pretty. - Yes.

321
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,373
It's like my grandma's old place.

322
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,803
Where did your grandma live?

323
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,142
- There were huge fields. - Really?

324
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,072
She lived in the only house that stood in the area.

325
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:43,243
(This place reminds her of her grandma's place.)

326
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,383
There are many fields.

327
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,912
(It's full of homely scenery.)

328
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:49,113
It's no joke.

329
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:51,452
"The twins' mom,"

330
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,952
"come and eat lunch."

331
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,052
That's right.

332
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:55,253
(Hapyeong Village, Ungcheon-eup, Boryeong-si)

333
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,522
- I think those are scallions. - Where?

334
00:13:58,523 --> 00:13:59,792
- Where? - Aren't those scallions?

335
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:00,963
- My goodness. - Those are scallions.

336
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,932
There they are. Aren't those scallions?

337
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,033
(You can see scallions anywhere in the Hapyeong Village!)

338
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,532
Aren't those scallions?

339
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,902
(You can see the small and big scallion fields.)

340
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:08,673
There they are. Those are scallions.

341
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,102
- They must be scallion fields. - They're so big.

342
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,403
(They must be scallion fields.)

343
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:18,013
(There are green scallion fields here and there.)

344
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:22,413
(Scallion farmers live here.)

345
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,983
What? Is our house here?

346
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,052
We're here. It must be one of these houses.

347
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,623
It's over there.

348
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:31,892
The roof is blue.

349
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:34,492
My grandma's house had a blue roof as well.

350
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,563
Really?

351
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:37,592
We're here.

352
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,332
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

353
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,733
There's a parking lot.

354
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,332
This time, we can see the fields.

355
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,442
You're right.

356
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:45,843
(The view of the vast fields unfolds before their eyes.)

357
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,572
How cute!

358
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:48,743
The bicycles are so cute.

359
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,113
How cute!

360
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,412
Jung Ah.

361
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:52,413
(The bicycles that make them happy and the Fresh members' doorplate)

362
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:54,282
It's a picturesque house.

363
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,012
(They go inside the green gate that calls for the members.)

364
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,422
The weather is so nice.

365
00:14:58,423 --> 00:14:59,483
It's nice.

366
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:03,493
Gosh, what a pretty house!

367
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,722
It's so pretty.

368
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:07,862
- Right? - Yes.

369
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:08,963
(Right?)

370
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,202
(It resembles the scallions of Ungcheon.)

371
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,302
- It's so pretty. - It's so pretty. My goodness.

372
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:15,833
(It's the Green Gate House of Boryeong.)

373
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,172
Gosh, it has been painted well.

374
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,743
(What does Jung Ah like about the house?)

375
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,872
(The shiny bench that'll give them cool space)

376
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,783
- I can't believe it. - My goodness.

377
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:27,852
Look.

378
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:29,712
What's this place?

379
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,123
(Looking inside)

380
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:32,822
How is the house so nice?

381
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,553
- The house is nice. - My goodness.

382
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:36,993
We need to get changed and leave for work.

383
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,863
Let's wear the flower pants together.

384
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,063
How cute.

385
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,132
I have a good feeling about today.

386
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,163
(He feels spring with his entire body.)

387
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:44,803
Let me see your apron.

388
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:46,833
Let's switch our aprons.

389
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,033
No.

390
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:50,833
I want to wear a good one!

391
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,443
- Hey. - No.

392
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,572
Gosh, why are you so...

393
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,912
Give me your apron! I want to wear it!

394
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,883
Hurry up and give it to me!

395
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:00,942
- Let's switch our aprons. - Not even my niece does that.

396
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,512
That apron doesn't suit you.

397
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:05,383
That apron suits my pants.

398
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,552
Jun Myun. She keeps trying to take it from me.

399
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,052
- Jun Myun, Jung Ah. - What's going on?

400
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,162
She gave it to me, okay?

401
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:12,362
- She said it looked good on me. - The apron?

402
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,622
- Yes. - I want to wear this apron.

403
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:14,933
But he won't give it to me.

404
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,163
Jun Myun. Jung Ah.

405
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,903
Give it to me, now.

406
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,932
Hey, take mine.

407
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,873
- I want to wear that. - Just take mine.

408
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:28,913
(The big sister switches it to Ji Yeon's favorite big flower.)

409
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,282
(Laughing)

410
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,513
What's wrong with her, seriously?

411
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:37,613
(She finds it funny too.)

412
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:41,252
It really feels like I'm working with my little cousin.

413
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,852
(Beaming in her big-flowered apron)

414
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:43,853
Let's go.

415
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,522
(Shall we head out on a bike today?)

416
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,633
The sun's not that strong, right?

417
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,133
The sun isn't too strong.

418
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,463
Are we going to harvest scallions?

419
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:54,972
Should we just follow the path?

420
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,973
(The workplace is the scallion field in front of the house.)

421
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:58,202
It's been a while since you rode a bike, right?

422
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,473
(Let's ride and feel the spring sunshine.)

423
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:02,013
I'm heading off. Are you okay there?

424
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,443
I feel good.

425
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,043
This is so funny.

426
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,013
They look so cute riding like that.

427
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,612
Wearing matching outfits...

428
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,682
- looks really cute, really. - Right.

429
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:13,923
(Wearing matching outfits and riding the same bike to the scallion field)

430
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,992
I love riding bikes.

431
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:17,993
Is that so?

432
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:20,623
I've started going out for bike rides lately.

433
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,492
(Riding along the bumpy field path)

434
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,033
- It feels so good. - Yes.

435
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:26,933
I think we're almost there.

436
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,932
- This must be the place. - They're working over there.

437
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,003
- Hello. - Gosh.

438
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,402
- Hi. - Hello.

439
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,473
- Hi - Hi.

440
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,773
(Exclaiming)

441
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,412
- Hello. - Hi.

442
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,042
- Hi. - Please come this way.

443
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:42,053
Okay.

444
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,383
(Boryeong's pride)

445
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:50,923
(Scallions)

446
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:53,892
Our village has sandy soil,

447
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,593
which makes it perfect for growing scallions.

448
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:01,603
(Thick and aromatic scallions from Ungcheon)

449
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,072
We believe our scallions are far better than any others.

450
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:07,002
We're proud of that.

451
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,213
(The first fieldwork of the season for the Fresh members)

452
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,413
(Scallions from Ungcheon)

453
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,113
When our scallions reach the Garak Market,

454
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:16,413
their aroma starts to spread everywhere.

455
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:18,753
These are such fragrant scallions.

456
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,453
(Putting on the farming cushion first)

457
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:23,952
(The youngest members' first time with farming cushions)

458
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,763
(Confused)

459
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,122
(Glancing)

460
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,993
Okay, the narrow part... That's not it.

461
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,332
- Isn't the narrow part the front? - It's the other way. Try it.

462
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,332
- This narrow part... - This part goes in front.

463
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,403
- Is this the front? - Yes.

464
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,443
- Is this right? - Yes, just like that.

465
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,503
All right.

466
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,672
(The youngest members are all set for their first fieldwork.)

467
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:42,673
- This is hilarious. - That's right.
Gosh, this is awkward.

468
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,243
Oh, my. It is awkward.

469
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:46,713
This works. It makes it easier.

470
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,913
This is so cute. I totally love it.

471
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,653
- Look at this. - This makes you really comfortable.

472
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,153
(She's excited like a puppy over a cushion.)

473
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:58,363
(Patting)

474
00:18:58,693 --> 00:18:59,693
Now...
(How do we harvest scallions?)

475
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:04,763
You pull it out like this and trim it little by little.

476
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:06,832
- The scallions... - Shake it off.

477
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,503
(Shaking dirt off the roots)

478
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:10,872
(Placing the trimmed scallions on the tray)

479
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:11,903
Place it like this.

480
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:15,512
Once you fill one like this, it's almost a whole kilo.

481
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:16,942
Do we tie them up, too?

482
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:17,943
- Yes, even the tying. - We do?

483
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:19,942
You tie them right here on the spot?

484
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:20,943
(Tying up one 1kg bunch to finish)

485
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,583
(Let's get to work.)

486
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,253
One at a time...
(Struggling)

487
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,422
- Okay, so this... - Yes.

488
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:30,793
Why is this so hard to pull out?

489
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,592
- I'll show you. - She's pulling them out so easily.

490
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,592
Make sure to grip it tightly like this.

491
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:35,733
(Gripping the root end tightly before pulling)

492
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,493
- Like this. - I see.

493
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:39,663
Okay, I got it.

494
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,603
You know, with the scallions...

495
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,503
- When making scallion kimchi... - Yes.

496
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,813
The short ones like this are sweet and really tasty.

497
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,472
These are really good scallions.

498
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,583
(Seasoning Park approves of the Boryeong Ungcheon scallions.)

499
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,782
This would make such delicious kimchi.

500
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:55,783
Then...

501
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,353
So this is how scallions are harvested.

502
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:01,653
- All these weeds... - You have to get rid of them.

503
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,823
(Doing their best to keep up with the experienced members)

504
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:07,723
This one is almost done.

505
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,692
As expected, Jung Ah is quick.

506
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:11,263
(One bunch is almost done.)

507
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,363
Even when sitting down, you are so quick.

508
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,133
(Packing up 1kg of scallions in no time)

509
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:21,073
(Tying it tightly with a string)

510
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:25,142
(One bunch of scallions is ready.)

511
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:28,482
One bunch of scallions weighs 1kg.

512
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,853
- Okay. - And we'll count each bunch...

513
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:32,853
as three dollars.

514
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,793
Do you mean three dollars per bunch?

515
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,393
I haven't even made three dollars yet.

516
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:40,863
This is unfair.

517
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,162
So I didn't even make three dollars yet. Gosh.

518
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,303
I expect you to give it your all.

519
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,533
Isn't there anything fun to do in Boryeong?

520
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,773
There's the thing over there.

521
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,842
- What? - A zip-line.

522
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:54,173
Yes.

523
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:55,913
(Panicking slightly)

524
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,043
Where? In Boryeong?

525
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,143
(Why is Jung Ah so flustered?)

526
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:02,413
(From this high up, )

527
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:07,753
(you ride the zip-line, flying fast down the wire.)

528
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:09,452
That brat.

529
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:10,752
(Jung Ah is even scared of Ferris wheels.)

530
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,492
(How is she supposed to go zip-lining?)

531
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:14,363
Jung Ah, I want to go zip-lining.

532
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,863
(Fidgeting with scallions for no reason)

533
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,503
(Glancing)

534
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,572
Why isn't she answering?

535
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,573
(Jung Ah?)

536
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,632
Why are you pretending not to hear?

537
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,243
I think the zip-line will be frightening.

538
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,843
- It's scary. - I'll just hold the bags and watch.

539
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,472
- No way. - But I feel afraid as well.

540
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,943
- I'm also afraid of the zip-line. - Let's ride it together.

541
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:34,953
The zip-line?

542
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:36,952
(Okay, let's see.)

543
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,683
It does take a bit more money than expected.

544
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:44,093
(Today's goal is to earn over 120 dollars for the zip-line.)

545
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:50,033
(Harvesting over 40 bunches of scallions is necessary.)

546
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,333
(Experienced Fresh members are...)

547
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:56,003
(pulling scallions like they've mastered it.)

548
00:21:56,473 --> 00:22:00,773
(Pulling)

549
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,343
I wanted to try farm work.

550
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:04,242
- Yes, for real. - Finally, it's happening.

551
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,182
Really? Is this your first time doing farm work?

552
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:08,752
I've only done hanging dried pollack.

553
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,052
- Is that so? - I see.

554
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,353
Yes, I was only by the sea.

555
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,893
(Taking in a lot of earthy smells today)

556
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,433
(With practiced hands, )

557
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,463
(the piles of scallions are quickly growing.)

558
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,872
- I love it. - The weather's amazing.

559
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:30,873
Right.

560
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:33,043
(Today's weather is perfect for farm work.)

561
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,313
(All hands are busy with the scallions.)

562
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:39,643
Oh, my.

563
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:42,416
- Oh, my. - Are you okay?

564
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:43,916
(Tumbling)

565
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,185
- Are you okay? - Yes.

566
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:46,886
- Jun Myun. - Why? What's going on?

567
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:48,725
The cushion just slipped.

568
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,225
(Sir, did you see what happened?)

569
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,355
- Good. - Why does this always happen...

570
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:52,366
only to Jun Myun?

571
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,065
(Embarrassed)

572
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:57,866
Jun Myun is naturally gifted at...

573
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,966
(She is gifted with a natural talent for humor.)

574
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,505
Nothing is ever easy.

575
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,506
Well, that's just how it is.

576
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,645
- Mr. Hong? - Mr. Hwang.

577
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:09,716
- Mr. Hwang? - Yes.

578
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,816
(Laughing)

579
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,486
I wonder what kind of chatter is going on.

580
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:17,355
I heard them talking about Mr. Hwang earlier.

581
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,386
Oh, Mr. Hwang?

582
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:20,455
She asked, "Mr. Hong?" And then she said, "Mr. Hwang."

583
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:22,256
Again, she asked, "Mr. Hong?" Then she's like, "Mr. Hwang."

584
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:26,296
How is the dialect of Chungcheong Province spoken?

585
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,196
The Chungcheong dialect?

586
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:32,136
Doing this so late, when will we eat?

587
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:35,276
Hey, you...

588
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:39,005
- This dialect... - Seriously...

589
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:40,805
You really don't look cool doing it like that.

590
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,576
You sound so flippant.

591
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:44,175
- Was it really that uncool? - You are so funny.

592
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,816
- You're good at looking uncool. - Such a city boy.

593
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:48,756
You should put on a Saemaul Movement cap.

594
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,656
Becoming the youth president, right?

595
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,555
It perfectly matched my taste.

596
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,556
(Fresh members' youth president)

597
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,796
This is embarrassing. I'm not going anywhere.

598
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:00,696
Jung Ah, look at him.

599
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:04,195
Jae Wook, seriously...

600
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,435
Would you like me to perform the dialect again?

601
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,436
One more time, please.

602
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:08,135
- He's cute. - This completely hits...

603
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,136
your taste perfectly, right?

604
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,336
Yes, this is hitting my taste perfectly right now.

605
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:14,146
Ji Yeon is really good at the Busan dialect.

606
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,916
- Really? - Go ahead and try.

607
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,816
I was Mi Poong, remember?

608
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,416
Give it a try. Mi Poong.

609
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:23,556
Well, my name is...

610
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,786
Kim Mi Poong.

611
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:28,726
Is that really the Busan dialect?

612
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:32,366
No, this is not the dialect...

613
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,826
This is an accident.

614
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:36,536
(Laughing)

615
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:38,366
Have we done a lot?

616
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,276
I think we've done quite a lot.

617
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:44,836
Okay.

618
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:46,446
(One by one, the scallions get done.)

619
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:47,845
Could you handle this, too?

620
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:51,516
(Stacking neatly to one side)

621
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:55,016
(The youth president is picking up the pace as well.)

622
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:58,416
It feels really good to see it piling up like this.

623
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:00,655
I think we've done quite a bit.

624
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:02,656
(The scallions are steadily piling up with diligent effort.)

625
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,126
How many bunches have you done?

626
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,525
I'm on my fourth bunch.

627
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:06,726
(Exclaiming)

628
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:08,995
How is he working so fast?

629
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:10,796
(He's on his fourth bunch already?)

630
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:13,105
(That doesn't seem right.)

631
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:14,466
You're not being thorough, are you?

632
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:17,035
You're not being thorough, are you?

633
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,176
Why are you so jealous?

634
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,506
Jealous of what?

635
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:22,375
She's jealous that Jae Wook got a lot of work done.

636
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:23,445
(An older sister's biggest rival is always her younger brother.)

637
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:24,846
Are you keeping him in check because he did more work?

638
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,755
No, Jun Myun. It's just that he's not doing a thorough job.

639
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:29,915
I was just scolding him about it.

640
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,455
If we're too thorough about these,

641
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,955
there'll be nothing left to eat.

642
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:35,026
He sounded like a grandmother.

643
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:37,925
- I like that voice. - No, you should meticulously...

644
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,765
- check all of these. - That's not being meticulous.

645
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:41,395
- If you slack off like that... - A lot of hard work went into...

646
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:42,995
- growing these. We can't remove it. - just to be quick,

647
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:45,405
they won't be good for anything.

648
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:47,206
- These are... - Our dialect skills are awful.

649
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:48,735
We are definitely from Seoul.

650
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:50,775
(Born and raised in Seoul)

651
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,246
- Something's not right. - My gosh.

652
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:53,806
Jun Myun.

653
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:56,146
Jun Myun, you're...

654
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,345
- What? Did I do something again? - You're...

655
00:25:58,346 --> 00:25:59,416
(Is something wrong with Jun Myun?)

656
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,315
- You sat on the scallions. - Gosh, honey.

657
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,115
Why would you sit on the scallions?

658
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,116
(Scallions: Save us.)

659
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:06,155
Goodness. What do I do?

660
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:07,486
(Flustered)

661
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,896
- Jun Myun. - Goodness, what should I do?

662
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:12,096
(Glancing around)

663
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,996
I'll handle it.

664
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:15,266
Goodness.

665
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,695
- It's okay. - Unbelievable.

666
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,165
- I fixed it. - You did?

667
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,235
I saved the scallions.

668
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,805
I didn't see those there.

669
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:21,975
Can you pull this out?

670
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,136
- I'm having trouble with it. - I can try.

671
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:25,446
- It's not coming off. - You're stronger than I am.

672
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:26,876
- My goodness. - It's not budging, is it?

673
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:28,916
Gosh, Jun Myun.

674
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:30,745
It's not budging, is it?

675
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,486
(A loud ripping sound)

676
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:34,816
Goodness.

677
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,255
You tore those into pieces.

678
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:38,216
(Hiding the evidence)

679
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:40,985
(Glancing around once again)

680
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:42,056
Jun Myun.

681
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:45,196
(Why is this happening to me?)

682
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,096
We'll just chop that up when we cook later.

683
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:49,835
Right. We won't sell that.

684
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:51,796
- Put it aside for us to take. - Of course, we can't.

685
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,806
What just happened, though?

686
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,645
The roots didn't budge and I was afraid that would happen,

687
00:26:58,646 --> 00:26:59,646
- so I didn't try pulling it harder. - This is...

688
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,146
You have to pull at it in a specific direction.

689
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:03,545
But this is...

690
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:05,216
- It's not... - This is...

691
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,045
It's way too deeply...

692
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:09,116
(There seems to be another problem.)

693
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:11,315
What is that sound you're making?

694
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:12,386
This is...

695
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:15,296
- What is that sound you're making? - This is...

696
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:16,856
The roots are so deeply...

697
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:18,695
(Grunting)

698
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,096
- Jun Myun. - Where do the roots end?

699
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:23,536
- What's wrong with her? - She's too funny.

700
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:25,606
I can't pull it out.

701
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,165
Hey, try pulling this out.

702
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,805
What's going on with this? I'm not even exaggerating.

703
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,746
- If it doesn't come out this way... - It won't come out.

704
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:35,615
- See? - I told you.

705
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:37,216
I told you it wouldn't come out.

706
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:39,285
- How many times... - This one's different.

707
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:41,615
I told you it wouldn't come out.

708
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,455
- The roots are as long as a tree's. - Totally.

709
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,486
These things are very deeply rooted.

710
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:47,025
I told you it wouldn't come out.

711
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:48,026
(Deeply rooted things)

712
00:27:48,456 --> 00:27:50,295
Goodness. I sat on all of these.

713
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:52,426
(Jun Myun feels apologetic toward the village head and the women.)

714
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,596
(So she holds up a bunch of scallions and...)

715
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:58,706
Scallions are a specialty of Ungsan, Boryeong.

716
00:27:58,766 --> 00:27:59,866
It's Ungcheon.

717
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,736
It's Ungcheon?

718
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:04,306
Let's do another take.

719
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,646
- Scallions are... Hey. - Was this not inside?

720
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,115
I'm sorry.

721
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,446
I'm filming.

722
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:13,485
- Please be quiet. - All right. My bad.

723
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:14,486
(Clearing throat)

724
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:15,585
Scallions are...

725
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:17,386
(Jung Ah also grabs a bunch of scallions.)

726
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:20,826
You can get the best scallions in Korea from Ungcheon, Boryeong.

727
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:23,456
You nailed it.

728
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:25,395
That was great.

729
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:26,826
(The women and the village head are pleased.)

730
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,766
(That's how you do it.)

731
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:34,036
(Led by the ambassador for Ungcheon scallions)

732
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:38,336
I didn't know Boryeong was famous for good scallions.

733
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:40,306
- Right. - We learned something new.

734
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:44,145
I think we each got...

735
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,986
at least ten bunches, right?

736
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:48,786
Eat some snacks before you continue.

737
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:50,155
- Goodness. - Take a break.

738
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,756
(The best thing to hear at work)

739
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,756
Goodness, I've been craving something cold.

740
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:55,456
My back hurts.

741
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,356
(They stretch their backs for the first time in a while.)

742
00:28:58,396 --> 00:28:59,866
Gosh, you got a lot of work done.

743
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,626
- We tried. - I can see that.

744
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,835
- Would you say this is a lot? - Yes, this is a lot.

745
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:05,905
(Proud)

746
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:07,036
Should we eat here?

747
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:09,405
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

748
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:10,506
Thank you for the food.

749
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,505
- Goodness. Yes. - Shall we see what's underneath?

750
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:14,145
(What will they be eating on the scallion field?)

751
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:15,146
(In awe)

752
00:29:16,116 --> 00:29:17,345
I'm thirsty.

753
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,446
That container brings back old memories.

754
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:20,985
- Is that omija? - Omija?

755
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:22,255
(It's vibrant omija tea.)

756
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,685
- That looks nice and cold with ice. - It looks nice and cold with ice.

757
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:25,686
(Ice floating on top.)

758
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:27,955
What kinds of rice cakes are these?

759
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,155
(To fill their empty stomachs up, )

760
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:30,195
I think it's mugwort.

761
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,466
(the villagers served them mugwort beomuri and injeolmi.)

762
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,525
(Let's try the omija tea first.)

763
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:35,565
Thank you.

764
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,395
(Jae Wook feels refreshed from the omija tea.)

765
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,436
(Gosh)

766
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:41,935
(Gosh, that omija tea is good.)

767
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,006
That omija tea is good.

768
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:45,645
(The cold omija tea cools them down.)

769
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:46,676
That's good.

770
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,605
Thank you.

771
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,015
(Ji Yeon tries the cold omija tea too.)

772
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:52,116
(Chugging it down)

773
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:53,485
This is...

774
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:55,556
(While everyone is obsessing over the omija tea, )

775
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,555
(Jun Myun takes a bite of injeolmi.)

776
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,656
(Chewy)

777
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,396
This injeolmi is incredible.

778
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:07,665
- It's really soft. - This is seriously good.

779
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,695
It's soft.

780
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:11,096
(Eating during their break from work makes it taste even better.)

781
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:13,905
(Try it, Jung Ah.)

782
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:15,606
(I'm tasting the mugwort beomuri first.)

783
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,435
(Yum)

784
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:18,846
(Nodding in appreciation)

785
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:21,976
- Is it good? - Yes. It's aromatic.

786
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,545
Is it mugwort?

787
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,785
Is it baekseolgi with mugwort?

788
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:27,986
This is mugwort beomuri?

789
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:30,615
(There are pieces of seasonal mugwort in the rice cake.)

790
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,586
We just talked about mugwort earlier and now we're eating it.

791
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,396
(Let me try mugwort beomuri too.)

792
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:38,795
Gosh, this is good.

793
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,496
(This rice cake is tasty.)

794
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:44,236
I needed that.

795
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:49,806
(She keeps reaching for another piece of injeolmi.)

796
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:51,975
(Following Jun Myun's lead, )

797
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,646
(Ji Yeon grabs another piece too.)

798
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,176
(Watching carefully)

799
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:58,216
These two really love food.

800
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:01,316
- Isn't so nice to see? - It's great!

801
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:03,856
(Gosh)

802
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:06,056
I can't believe myself. I ate so much food earlier.

803
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,686
- You ate a lot earlier? - Yes.

804
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:11,355
I love that you're here.

805
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:12,465
Why?

806
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,166
Because she doesn't want to be the only one who's eating.

807
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,466
Eating together makes the experience better.

808
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:19,566
(Trusty eating buddies)

809
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,905
(By the way)

810
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:24,075
Wearing rain boots is a must when doing farm work.

811
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,076
(How much work did we get done?)

812
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,175
Let me go do a progress check.

813
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,546
(I should go and do a progress check.)

814
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:31,816
(Workaholic)

815
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,946
The injeolmi is exquisite.

816
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:35,986
(Carb-aholic)

817
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,285
Eat some rice cake.

818
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,686
(Where are you going?)

819
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,856
(Laughing)

820
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:45,725
Are they done? Are we the only ones who are still eating?

821
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:48,066
(The two grasshoppers have been left behind.)

822
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,566
- Why aren't they eating? - Why aren't they eating?

823
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:54,206
(Whispering to each other because they feel self-conscious)

824
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,036
- Did we do all of these? - I did. Me and Jun Myun.

825
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:02,476
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

826
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:04,546
ten, eleven,

827
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:07,416
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

828
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:11,515
(There are 15 bunches on this side. That's 45 dollars.)

829
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,986
I feel like we did more than that. Where are the others?

830
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:15,725
We should include these.

831
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,656
(That's a total of 23 bunches, which is 69 dollars.)

832
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,395
I don't think so.

833
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,725
- Jun Myun and I did this much. - Right, this doesn't make sense.

834
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,236
(They have a long way to go to reach their goal of 40 bunches.)

835
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,495
Ji Yeon, I told you to work harder.

836
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:28,065
I did.

837
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,635
(Startled)

838
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:31,106
(Even a grasshopper will stand up for herself when pushed too far.)

839
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:34,076
We can fill up the 20 if we work a bit more.

840
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:35,206
(Choking on rice cake)

841
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:37,916
- Should I stop eating? - No, keep going.

842
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:39,785
I'm going to stop. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

843
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:40,916
(Jun Myun puts down her chopsticks.)

844
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:44,255
Just keep eating if you want.

845
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,415
- Keep eating. - No.

846
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,955
No one will give you a hard time for eating injeolmi.

847
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:48,995
I'm going to keep eating.

848
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,026
(All of Ji Yeon's emotions hit her while eating rice cake.)

849
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,725
I'll say something if someone stops you from eating injeolmi.

850
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:53,325
These injeolmi are extraordinary.

851
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:54,625
You should try one.

852
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,866
(The injeolmi warriors are more serious than ever.)

853
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,066
(Feeling a presence)

854
00:32:58,536 --> 00:32:59,865
(Standing over them.)

855
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,165
- Goodness. - You can keep eating.

856
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,576
- I'm just stretching my back. - You're scary.

857
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,005
- Jung Ah. - Gosh, my back.

858
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:07,045
(Standing in the scallion field)

859
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:09,116
I feel too pressured to keep eating injeolmi.

860
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:14,046
- Right. - She's standing right next to me.

861
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,485
No one said you had to stop eating.

862
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:17,515
Make sure to chew thoroughly. Rice cakes are hard to digest.

863
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:18,586
(Make sure to chew thoroughly.)

864
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:20,685
Keep eating. Go ahead.

865
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:22,185
(How can we?)

866
00:33:22,186 --> 00:33:24,195
(When you're standing over us?)

867
00:33:24,196 --> 00:33:25,356
Jung Ah.

868
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,525
(Ji Yeon, let's stop here.)

869
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:28,596
Let's stop here.

870
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:32,266
- That's your last piece. - No, you can keep eating.

871
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:34,036
That's your last piece.

872
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:37,236
- I think we did these too. - Right, are the scallions...

873
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:39,246
you pulled the ones that are on the ground here?

874
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:42,245
(Are they giving us space?)

875
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:43,345
(Then let me just have one more.)

876
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:46,586
(You are unbelievable.)

877
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:48,915
We will stop here.

878
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,015
(They keep eating until they're full.)

879
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,216
This will be our last piece.

880
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:56,226
(They suddenly stand up...)

881
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:57,856
(and start doing exercises to warm up.)

882
00:33:57,857 --> 00:33:58,996
Do it twice.

883
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:02,565
(They portray perfect chemistry as they do their digestion dance.)

884
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,566
That's right.

885
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:08,536
(Now it's time to get back to pulling out scallions.)

886
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:10,275
Let's go.

887
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:12,646
(Let's meet our 40-bunch goal! We have 17 bunches left.)

888
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:17,146
(We'll finish this up quickly and go on our outing.)

889
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:20,246
(The youth president is good with his hands.)

890
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,956
(He has adapted to farm work perfectly.)

891
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:28,126
(A butterfly flies over to cheer for Jun Myun, who works hard today.)

892
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:30,996
(The cheer keeps her going.)

893
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,566
(Leader Yum adjusts her posture...)

894
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:39,366
(and starts pulling out scallions like a machine.)

895
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:45,406
I keep moving faster.

896
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,876
- Me too. - You're doing so well.

897
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:53,686
(Leader Yum is on a roll.)

898
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,585
(She pulls out a bunch of scallions...)

899
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,786
(and pulls off a boot.)

900
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:04,356
(She ties up the scallions.)

901
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,426
(Everything is going smoothly.)

902
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:10,096
(Even Jun Myun, who's had her fair share of struggles, )

903
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:14,566
(is now neatly packing the scallions with her small hands.)

904
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:16,906
I think I have a knack for farm work.

905
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:18,476
You're quite good at this.

906
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:20,475
It can't be easy to squat like that.

907
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,045
I feel like you've been squatting too much.

908
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,116
- Are you okay? - Right now? I feel great.

909
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:26,415
- Are you sure? - I'm almost glued to the ground.

910
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,816
(Jae Wook is stuck to the ground.)

911
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:30,086
Jae Woo's body is folded like a flip phone.

912
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,016
His seated height is shorter than mine.

913
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,526
How is someone as tall as him squatting that low?

914
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,495
It must be uncomfortable.

915
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:38,926
(He looks so comfortable.)

916
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:42,325
I love this cool breeze. The air feels crisp.

917
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:44,296
- The wind feels so nice. - Right?

918
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,166
The wind is blowing

919
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:50,975
- There's more than I expected. - Yes.

920
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,206
We did all of that.

921
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:54,106
We did quite a lot of work.

922
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:55,775
- We did. - Yes.

923
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,776
(Piles of scallions built up over the last 2 hours.)

924
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:59,046
- Should we count as we box them up? - Yes, let's box them up.

925
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:02,216
Lay them in alternating directions. One.

926
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,056
Six.

927
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,026
Two. Seven.

928
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:12,496
(Finally, they seal the boxes by taping them securely.)

929
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,395
All done.

930
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,596
We're done.

931
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:18,565
This side did 22 bunches...

932
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,366
- and this side did 21. - We did 21 bunches.

933
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:22,735
That's a total of 43 bunches.

934
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:23,806
(They worked on a total of 43 bunches of scallions.)

935
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:25,845
- One, two, three, four... - One, two, three, four...

936
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:27,875
(They count the money right away.)

937
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:30,216
- That's 10, 11, 12... - And then...

938
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:32,586
- It should be 200 dollars. - It's 129 dollars.

939
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:34,145
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

940
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:35,716
- Thank you. - We harvested these.

941
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:38,055
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the hard work.

942
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,656
- Thank you. - Thank you.

943
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:44,526
(The scallions harvested by the Fresh members today...)

944
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,236
(have been prepped to leave the field.)

945
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:54,736
(They now embark on a journey to every corner of the country.)

946
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:58,776
(Garak Market wholesale auction site)

947
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,106
(The scallions from Ungcheon have arrived.)

948
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:06,316
(The scallions and their strong aroma are brought to consumers.)

949
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:08,586
- We're done. - We should drink...

950
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:09,956
We're done.

951
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:13,286
Good job today.

952
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:19,095
- Honey. - Gosh, honey.

953
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:21,195
- You did great today. - It was nothing.

954
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:23,466
Gosh. Anyway...

955
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,605
We had a good scallion harvest this season.

956
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:28,605
I know. The aroma was amazing.

957
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:31,936
They smelled so sweet.

958
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:34,045
This reminds me of my grandmother.

959
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,376
I can imagine.

960
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:36,676
- When I was little, - Yes.

961
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:40,846
My grandmother lived at the end of the farm road,

962
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,716
in a house with a blue roof like that one.

963
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:47,026
- The air reminds you of her. - Yes.

964
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:49,355
Working right in front of where we're staying...

965
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:51,255
- and walking home feels great. - Right.

966
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:52,996
(Somehow, today feels more exciting.)

967
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,766
Gosh, this is nice.

968
00:37:57,596 --> 00:37:59,266
This is nice.

969
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:01,205
I love this.

970
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:03,975
(After a hard day's work, )

971
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:07,706
(they get to enjoy their well-earned rest.)

972
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:10,445
(A brief moment of peace...)

973
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:11,645
Goodness.

974
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,546
(along with cries of pain)

975
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:19,686
(Jung Ah is worried.)

976
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,325
I want to go zip-lining.

977
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,896
You should come with us.

978
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:26,926
Which one of you...

979
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,766
brought up zip-lining?

980
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,450
Which one of you...

981
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,250
brought up zip-lining?

982
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,459
Is this the place?

983
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,589
Yes, I think that's it.

984
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,889
- What? - Tell me what you think.

985
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,029
(I can't believe people do this scary thing for fun.)

986
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,400
- By the beach? - Yes.

987
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,799
It's not like we'll be jumping without any safety gear.

988
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Look.

989
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,370
You ride that toward the sea.

990
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,740
Gosh, I can't do this.

991
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,869
I might die. Then I won't be able to make dinner.

992
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,169
- I can't... - What is it?

993
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,269
- I can't do that. - Yes, you can.

994
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,010
- You can decide when we get there. - Hey, look at this.

995
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,550
And there's sky-biking too.

996
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,149
There's another activity called sky-biking.

997
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,250
You ride a bicycle for that.

998
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,319
You're saying that's not scary?

999
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,690
- You just cycle along the sea. - All right.

1000
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,919
The view will be beautiful.

1001
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,190
I'll do this one.

1002
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,990
Then you do...

1003
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,530
- That's the only thing I'm up for. - Yes, of course.

1004
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,799
- Are we leaving? - Let's go.

1005
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,770
(Let's go sky-biking only!)

1006
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,439
(They're all in a good mood as they leave for their spring outing.)

1007
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,240
The weather is so nice.

1008
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,650
(They drive along the farm road where spring is blooming.)

1009
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,780
I see something.

1010
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,989
Gosh, what is that?

1011
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,150
Look over there!

1012
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,219
(Gosh)

1013
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,690
(Sighing)

1014
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,400
(Ji Yeon is excited and Jung Ah is terrified just by the sight.)

1015
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,699
(Following the seaside path of Daecheon Beach...)

1016
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,240
(is the scenic sky-bike track.)

1017
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,609
(The track stretching across the sea makes...)

1018
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,039
(sky-biking at Daecheon Beach even more romantic.)

1019
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,550
(Even this freaks Jung Ah out.)

1020
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,380
(It's obvious that Jung Ah is nervous.)

1021
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,020
This is going to be fun.

1022
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,849
- Bye. - Let's go.

1023
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,490
This show is making me do all sorts of things.

1024
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,389
I'm scared.

1025
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,830
(Even so, let's pedal on toward the horizon.)

1026
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,360
(Once they go through the starting tunnel)

1027
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,900
This is what I'm talking about.

1028
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,939
This is what I'm talking about.

1029
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,310
(The view of the horizon is unveiled.)

1030
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,339
(The sky-bike runs right alongside the sea.)

1031
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,810
This is amazing.

1032
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,280
It's beautiful.

1033
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,380
(In awe)

1034
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,949
Jung Ah, what a breathtaking view.

1035
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,420
(The picturesque scenery gently soothes Jung Ah's heart.)

1036
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,230
- It's indeed stunning. - This is stunning.

1037
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,599
How am I supposed to do 30 minutes of this?

1038
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,200
(That doesn't mean she's not scared, though.)

1039
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,440
- The water is right below us. - Yes.

1040
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,439
(The blue sea is laid out beneath their feet.)

1041
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,979
How did they build this?

1042
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,480
They did such a great job.

1043
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,509
They probably made it by welding steel rails together.

1044
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,750
(I see.)

1045
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,420
Wait, what? I know that.

1046
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,290
What else could they have welded besides steel?

1047
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,929
(By the way...)

1048
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,790
We're going to get a good workout for our legs from this.

1049
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,700
This will be great exercise for our legs.

1050
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,240
Jae Wook, don't shake the bike too much.

1051
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,170
- It's scaring me. - Okay.

1052
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,379
(He attempts to come up with a scheme.)

1053
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,609
(Jung Ah spots him.)

1054
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,580
What are you... Don't!

1055
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,649
Don't do it!

1056
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,879
(Quick-witted Jung Ah)

1057
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,590
I knew you were up to something when I caught you whispering!

1058
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,590
- Watch out. - All right.

1059
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,890
All right.

1060
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,559
(Teasing Jung Ah is so fun.)

1061
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,690
This is so fun.

1062
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,800

1063
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,900
(Time flew by as they were lost in the fun, )

1064
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,169
(and suddenly the sky was painted with the sunset.)

1065
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,239
I feel hungry.

1066
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,279
(The Fresh members have their first dinner...)

1067
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,509
(in the land of scallions.)

1068
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,110
Ji Yeon will be attempting to make seafood scallion pancake.

1069
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,679
And I'll make scallion kimchi.

1070
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,990
(There's no way Seasoning Park's scallion kimchi is not tasty.)

1071
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,619
And we'll make fish cake soup.

1072
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,689
(Soup is a must for dinner, and fish cake soup will warm them up.)

1073
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,620
We need something spicy.

1074
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,829
How about spicy stir-fried chicken?

1075

1077
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,330
We have to start cooking now.

1078
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,439
(Chef Yum walks in with raw chicken.)

1079
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,969
(Yum's spicy stir-fried chicken is getting ready for business.)

1080
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,909
(Cut away the fat from the chicken to get rid of any unpleasant odor.)

1081
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,109

1082

(The three basic seasonings)

1083
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:50,950
Doing this makes all the difference.

1084
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,179
I'll put this over here.

1085
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,719
(She briefly sets it aside to marinate.)

1086
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,389
(Adding carbs is a must...)

1087
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,220

(She opens the box of scallions.)

1094
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,540
Let's see.

1095
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,780
(First thing's first, she checks on the scallions.)

1096
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,210
The scallion kimchi is going to be so good.

1097
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,880
These are high-quality scallions.

1098
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,719
(The ingredients are in great condition.)

1099
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,089
(Next, she starts prepping the scallions.)

1100
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,859
(She cuts off the roots.)

1101
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,190
(Then she uses her hands to remove the outer skins.)

1102
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,329
(With a craftsman's spirit, )

1103
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,830
(she preps the scallions one by one.)

1104

- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1107
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,009
Apparently, there are green onions in the backyard.

1108
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,610
Can you go get some for me?

1109
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,450
(On her way to get green onions)

1110
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,519
(Ji Yeon is now a professional at pulling out vegetables.)

1111
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,750
Where are the green onions?

1112
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,490
(Reflecting on plucking scallions)

1113

1115
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,170
(She plucked the small garden.)

1116
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,300
(I plucked it, so I'll go back.)

1117
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,410
Are these green onions?

Yes, but...

00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,520
(She brought a bunch of green onions with care.)

1121
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,920
(What do we do?)

1122
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,120
(Laughing)

1123
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,329
(Is something wrong?)

1124
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,399
We don't usually pluck and carry them with soil.

1125
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,170
Okay. I should've just brought green onions without the soil.

1126
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,230
Is it like a deeply rooted tree or something?

1127
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,540
Is she going to replant it?

1128
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,080
(Today is the day for planting green onions.)

1129
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,540

1131
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,250
Thank you.

(Taking them over)

1133
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,550
- Can you help me now? - Yes.

1134
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,689
- Assistant Ji Yeon. - Assistant.

1135
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,129
Look at this. So, this white part...

1136
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,659
- This white part... - Please keep in mind...

1137
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,260
that this white part is the top.

If you put it upside down,

1141
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,740
you'll be in big trouble. Okay?

1142
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,209
You could've taught me before warning me.

1143
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,979
Are you warning me first?

- Look at the scallion. - Okay.

1148
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,119
After peeling it, if it's stuck together,

1149
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,319
separate it.

(Separating the root part if it's thick after peeling it.)

1151
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,419
This is too thick...

1152
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,629
and hard to eat. So separate it.

(Laughing)

1154
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,399

- This is such hardcore work. - It is, indeed.

1162
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,249
- This never ends. - We have no choice though.

1163
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,420
Just keep working happily.

- you see older women sitting there. - Yes, you're right.

1167
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,090
They're chatting while trimming scallions.

1168
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:28,829

I wanted to help him out.

1173

- Did she get married? - No, not yet.

That girl doesn't even seem to try.

1180
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,990
Once that darn girl gets married, I'll be happier.

1181
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,559

(Curious Yum, the owner of the spicy stir-fried chicken shop)

She always wants money. She asked for 20,000 dollars last month.

1184
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,010
So I sent her 20,000 dollars. She's a real pain in the neck.

1185
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,110
She looked friendly and pretty, though.

1191

- Their children? - They...

1196
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,240
They're speaking badly about their son and daughter.

1197
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,610
I heard rumors about your children. So what is it?

1198

- It's almost done. - It is. We did two bunches.

1204

That sounds good.

00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,080

00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,620
Yes.

1218
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,159
- Did you even see it? - I saw it.

1219
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,559
Don't answer without seeing it.

1220
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,860
- I saw it. - I'm so disappointed.

1221

I saw it.
(Rushing to see it)

1222

I think two pancakes will be enough.

1223
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,700
- You should make at least two. - Then this should be enough.

- Just in case. - Yes, just in case.

1227
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,110
Okay. I'll take this much more of it.

1228

(Shall I make the batter first?)

1236
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,940
(A measuring cup for an accurate ratio)

1237
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,640
(200g of pan-frying powder, 200g of frying powder)

1238
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,080
(Sprinkling salt)

1239
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,410
(Not even a little error is tolerated.)

1240
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,679
Ji Yeon, I'll cut carrots for you.

1241
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,850
Thank you.

1242
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,890
Ms. Im Ji Yeon is cooking.

1243
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,450
- I know. - I need to help her.

1244
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,020
(Cutting carrots)

1245
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,790
(Cutting red peppers)

1246
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,030
How many pancakes is she going to make?

1247
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,229
She said she'd make two.

1248
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,229
I think she needs to make at least four...

1249
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,700
to have two perfect pancakes.

1250
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,869
You're wrong. I'll make two perfect ones.

1251
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,870
Without failure?

1252
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,639
I like Ji Yeon's attitude like that.

1253
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,939
(Highly motivated)

1254
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,409
I really want to do it successfully.

1255
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,410
(Checking the recipe again)

1256
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:04,080
I want to do it successfully.

1257
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,780
(Coming outside to make the batter)

1258
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,920
(Mixing the batter made by careful measurement)

1259
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,360
(Adding water)

1260
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,390
The batter is already thin.

1261
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,100
- Is it? - Isn't it thin?

1262
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,399
(I measured it all.)

1263
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,540
(Poking)

1264
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,910
(Tasting to see if it's thin)

1265
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,580
I think it's done.

1266
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,380
I think it's too thin.

1267
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,379
- Should I add more powder? - Yes, it's too thin.

1268
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,449
I followed the recipe, but I'll add more.

1269
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,620
(Following her after listening to her advice)

1270
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,460
(No more measuring)

1271
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,760
Does it look enough?

1272
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,430
Yes, I think so. Mix it well.

1273
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,499
Make it thick.

1274
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,870
(The batter became thicker than before.)

1275
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,799
- That looks good. - Because we have only small pans.

1276
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
I like that.
(What is it that Leader Yum likes?)

1277
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,310
(A large electric skillet)

1278
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,910
(Very satisfied)

1279
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,379
Once the pan is heated, I will begin making pancakes.

1280
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,550
Stay tuned.

1281
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,259
I'm ready.

1282
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,290
(Ready to make pancakes)

1283
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,330
(What is Jun Myun doing?)

1284
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,900
(Starting to clean scallions)

1285
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,670
(Piles of scallions)

1286
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,240
Do you need help, Jun Myun?

1287
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,909
They are pretty clean,

1288
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:39,910
so you don't need to do that.

1289
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,580
- Just do it like this? - Yes.

1290
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,679
- You prepared them so cleanly. - What?

1291
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,110
- You prepared them so cleanly. - It was already clean and fresh.

1292
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,779
I believe it's one of the best scallions.

1293
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,550
(Continuing to praise the scallions of Ungcheon)

1294
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,990
- Put the root part to go this way. - Yes.

1295
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,360
Please keep that in mind, Mr. Lee Jae Wook.

1296
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,430
(Keeping it in mind)

1297
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,470
The reason I keep saying to place it this way is...

1298
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,069
that all scallions would be mixed up otherwise.

1299
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,899
- Yes, it gets mixed and tangled. - It'll be a mess.

1300
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,839
That was the most inconvenient thing when eating scallion kimchi.

1301
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Yes. That's why...

1302
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,239
we're doing it this way now, even if it means more work.

1303
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,250
(Seasoning Park even considers convenience when eating it.)

1304
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,680
(Cleaning them carefully)

1305
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,150
- Done. - I'm feeling so good.

1306
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,450
Are you?

1307
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,519
- I'll give you scallions. - Thanks.

1308
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,220
(Giving her scallions for scallion pancakes)

1309
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,660
I'll cut scallions.

1310
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,530
(If I cut them...)
(like this, )

1311
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,160
(it'll be like this.)

1312
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,770
Line them up.

1313
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
(Exhaling)

1314
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,139
Cut them nicely.

1315
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,610
(Carefully cutting scallions)

1316
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,940
(On the heated large pan)

1317
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,579
Place them close together.

1318
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,909
(Putting scallions close together)

1319
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,080
Put scallions in the pan.

1320
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,120
Drizzle...

1321
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,550
the batter on them.

1322
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,660
(Using only a very small amount after making a big batch of batter)

1323
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,090
(Is she doing it well?)

1324
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,300
(I'm cheering for you from the bottom of my heart.)

1325
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,300
(Go, Pancake Im.)

1326
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,340
(It looks like it needs a lot more batter.)

1327
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,540
It's good.

1328
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
The next thing is...

1329
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,609
(Adding crunchy carrots)

1330
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,610
Add carrots.

1331
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:25,910
(Adding spicy red peppers)

1332
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,720
(Adding shrimp for protein)

1333
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,980
(Surprised)

1334
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
(Laughing)

1335
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,960
(Laughing as looking at the pancake)

1336
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,930
(It looks like adding toppings to fresh scallions.)

1337
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,430
Here you go.

1338
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,230
Here you go.

1339
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,540
(Will her scallion pancake turn out well?)

1340
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,509
How can I flip it over?

1341
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,510
(Pancake Im's big challenge: How to flip it over?)

1342
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,280
(To flip this over perfectly, )

1343
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,950
(I need something.)

1344
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:08,160
(I have a good idea.)

1345
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,059
(Holding spatulas in both hands)

1346
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,530
Will it work?

1347
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,469
Please. I really hope it'll work.

1348
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,470
(Hoping for another success)

1349
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,770
Please. Please help me succeed.

1350
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,940
Please.

1351
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,740
(Can I flip it over?)

1352
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,180
I think this is the time.

1353
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,420
It's time to flip it over. What do I do?

1354
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,650
(What do I do?)

1355
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,889
(Finally)

1356
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,929
(Is she flipping it over?)

1357
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,060
Okay.

1358
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,130
(Putting the spatulas in)

1359
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,699
Will she be able to flip it over?

1360
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,499
(Will Pancake Im flip it over successfully?)

1361
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,540
Please.

1362
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,910
(Breathing heavily)

1363
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,550
(She flipped it over successfully.)

1364
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,849
- Did you flip it over? - I flipped it over.

1365
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,050
(Laughing)

1366
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,920
You did it well.

1367
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,759
- Jung Ah, it doesn't look bad. - No.

1368
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,930
(Perfect shape)

1369
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,730
I think she's better than me.

1370
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,999
- Ms. Pancake Im. - Pancake Im.

1371
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,730
(She is Pancake Im.)

1372
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,000
She's good at it. She's indeed Pancake Im.

1373
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,400
She's doing it well.

1374
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,440
I think I have talent.

1375
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,140
(Self-praise)

1376
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,050
I'm so proud of myself.

1377
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,880
Cook it until it becomes golden brown.

1378
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,050
(Flipping it over once again)

1379
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,189
(Torn)

1380
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,520
(Folded)

1381
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,630
(It has failed.)

1382
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,629
(In shock)

1383
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,930
(Failed!)

1384
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,910
(My scallion pancake)

1385
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,370
Did you fail?

1386
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,780
No.

1387
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,250
I saved it.

1388
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,550
I saved it.

1389
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,420
It's good.

1390
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,919
(Thanks for your hard work.)

1391
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,220
Just a moment, Jung Ah. How can I move it to the plate?

1392
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,390
It's done.

1393
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
This is good. It's done.

1394
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,270
(Anyway, one scallion pancake is done.)

1395
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,670
Then,

1396
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,410
how about adding kimchi to the scallion pancake?

1397
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,140
Do you want to create something new? Pancake Im?

1398
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,410
- Do you want to create something? - Adding shrimp to it.

1399
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:45,080
(Laughing)

1400
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,610
I'll try to make kimchi pancakes.

1401
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,090
(Pancake Im's kimchi pancake is coming soon.)

1402
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,920

(Impressed)

1409

(Fish cake skewers are done.)

1410
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,389
Should we boil water?

1411
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,050
- I put water in the pot. - Okay.

1412
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,020
Ta-da.

1413
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,359
Since we don't have time to make the broth, let's use this instead.

1414
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,430
(What are those from her pocket?)

1415
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,030
It'll dissolve in a minute.

1416
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:37,630
(Throwing it)

1417
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,769
(Putting broth tablets in boiling water)

1418
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,900
I always...

1419
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,210
keep them in my pocket to use them when we don't have enough time.

1420
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,780
- How convenient it is. - Yes.

1421
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,879
- I thought it was candies. - I know.

1422
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,910
(So convenient)

1423
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:56,019
(Stirring it with a ladle)

1424
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,190
Look. It's done already.

1425
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,590
(It's time to taste the broth.)

1426
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,730
(Slurping)

1427
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,630
(Satisfied)

1428
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,000
It tastes good.

1429
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,460
It's so convenient.

1430
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,899
(The broth for fish cake soup is done in a minute.)

1431
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,670
It's so convenient. We can make it so fast.

1432
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,870
(Adding radishes and peppers to the boiling broth)

1433
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,510
(Adding a ladleful of soy sauce)

1434
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,810
(Stirring after adding black pepper)

1435
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,480
What should I roast first?

1436
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,550
Roast chicken thighs first with a bit of oil.

1437
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,789
With chicken thighs.

1438
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,459
(Spicy stir-fried chicken on a cauldron lid)

1439
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,230
I think it'll be cooked quickly.

1440
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,790
Chicken thighs should be fully cooked.

1441
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,099
(Spicy stir-fried chicken...)

1442
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,170
(is normally cooked with sauce.)

1443
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:51,239
You should let them sit for a while after seasoning.

1444
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,039
So that it can be seasoned well.

1445
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,540
(Roast after seasoning the chicken to help the seasoning absorb well.)

1446
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Cook them together once the oil is...
- released from the chicken. - Okay.

1447
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,850
- Do I add rice cakes as well? - Yes, rice cakes need to be cooked.

1448
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,220
How many rice cakes should we add?

1449
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,750
(It looks like it's already full.)

1450
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,619
Whatever. I don't know.

1451
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,090
(Adding it all)

1452
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,889
It's tasty when it's roasted.

1453
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,130
(Stir-frying them with the oil from the chicken)

1454
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,530
(Waiting until it's fully cooked)

1455
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,769
I'll put fish cakes in, Jae Wook.

1456
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:22,900
Yes, sure.

1457
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,839
(My gosh.)

00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,720
(She puts more skewers since he made a lot of them.)

1462
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,420
(Boiling)

1463
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,260
(Boil it until the fish cakes absorb the broth.)

1464
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,499
(Checking fish cake soup)

1465
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,859
(Checking spicy stir-fried chicken)

1466

(Yum's spicy stir-fried chicken on a cauldron lid is going well.)

1468
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,499
Look at this.

1469
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,610
(Looking tasty)

1470
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,910
- It already looks so good. - Yes.

1471
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,010
(When the chicken thighs are cooked...)

1472
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,149
Okay. Add cabbage.

1473
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,520
(Adding cabbage)

1474
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,290
(Increasing the sweetness with cabbage)

1475
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:20,700
(Adding onions and chili peppers)

1476
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,360
It looks so tasty.

1477
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,200
(Tasting a piece of chicken that was on the tongs)

1478
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,439
It tastes so good even now.

1479
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,110
(Smiling)

1480
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,640
(Stir-fry until the cabbage is cooked.)

1481
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,510
I need to make sauce.

1482
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,979
(Putting gochujang)

1483
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,219
Minced garlic and doenjang.

1484
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,220
(Doenjang, soy sauce, oyster sauce, minced garlic)

1485
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:47,820
Let's add some ginger extract.

(Sugar, ginger extract)

1487
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,060
(Starch syrup)

1488
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,400
I need mustard.

1489
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,970
(Mustard)

1490

(Sweet and spicy sauce for spicy stir-fried chicken)

1491
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,470

01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,510
(Adding the sauce generously)

1493
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,449

01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:17,850
(Let's make the spicy stir-fried chicken red.)

1495
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,219
It looks so great.

1496
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,319

1497
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,389
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

1498
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,089
- It looks good. - It does.

1499
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,029
- We should cook it a bit longer. - Yes.

1500
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:30,830
(Mouthwatering just from looking at it)

1501
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,639
I'll add curry powder last.

(The second secret of her spicy stir-fried chicken)

1503

(Curry powder)

1504
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,640
I won't add it too much. This will be enough.

1505
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,180
(Curry powder will add flavor to spicy stir-fried chicken.)

1506
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,620
I smell spicy stir-fried chicken suddenly.

1507
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,920
- It's because of the curry powder. - It smells so good.

1508
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,149
The smell is so good.

It smells really good.

1511
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,330
It's probably cooked by now.

1512
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,759
It's almost cooked except for onions.

1513
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,129
(A delicious aroma of spicy stir-fried chicken)

1514
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,000

1516

(Can she do it?)

1520
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,290
(On, no.)

1521
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,390

(Embarrassed)

1523
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,070
(It's impossible to save it.)

1524
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,870
I should've flipped it over a few minutes later.

1525
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,680
(I'm mad at myself for being impatient.)

1526

(Peekaboo)

1529
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:01,390
I cut them into bite-sized pieces.

1530
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,020
Don't make an excuse.

1531
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,329
I really cut them myself. I didn't fail.

1532
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,660

(What a relief.)

1538
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,579
It's tasty, isn't it?

1539
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,150
(Tasting it again)

1540
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,950
(It's still tasty.)

1541
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,049
It's tasty, isn't it?

1542
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,090

- the seasoning? - Okay.

01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:54,260
(Let's meet at the dinner table later.)

1590
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,830
(Nutty sesames are sprinkled on the spicy stir-fried chicken.)

1591
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,540
(The spicy stir-fried chicken on the cauldron lid is complete.)

1592
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:08,610
(Jae Wook warms up the bowl for the older members.)

1593
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,810
(His level of consideration is at 10,000°C.)

1594
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,149
(He transfers the spicy stir-fried chicken...)

1595
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,450
(to a big bowl.)

1596
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,520
(A heap of food)

1597
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,330
(Without holding back, he scoops out spicy stir-fried chicken.)

1598
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,730
(Let's set up the fish cake soup as well.)

1599
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,570
(Plump)

1600
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,709
(Shall we cover them with the refreshing soup...)

1601
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,050
(that has been boiled with radish?)

1602
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,550
(The fish cake soup is ready.)

1603
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,460
(The table is full today as always.)

1604
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,929
I feel so proud...

1605
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,530
about each meal.

1606
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,529
- They look tasty. - They look tasty.

1607
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,499
Will we eat the fish cake skewers?

1608
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,170
I'm looking forward to the scallion kimchi.

1609
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,800
- I'm exhausted. - It was an exhausting day.

1610
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,799
- They must be delicious. - Shall we have a shot each?

1611
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,940
- All right. - Okay.

1612
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,340
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1613
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,309
It smells like fruits, right?

1614
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,409
(The worktime liquor that suits the members' feast...)

1615
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,680
(smells like hardy kiwis.)

1616
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,519
- Shall we clink our glasses? - Thank you for your hard work.

1617
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,450
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1618
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:26,420
Cheers.

1619
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,059
(Jung Ah takes a small sip.)

1620
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,390
(Impressed)

1621
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,630
(Jae Wook finishes the shot.)

1622
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,470
- It's tasty. - It's sour and sweet.

1623
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,000
It smells nice too.

1624
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,769
- It's tasty. - It's sour and sweet.

1625
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:43,770
Seriously.

1626
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:45,439
- It's very sour. - It's refreshing.

1627
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,469
It's tasty.

1628
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,640
- It's tasty. - It smells nice too.

1629
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,450
(The smell of hardy kiwis suits the members' Korean meal.)

1630
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,449
(The spicy stir-fried chicken on a cauldron lid...)

1631
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,490
(has a spicy and sweet sauce.)

1632
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,849
(Jung Ah's fish cake soup featuring Jae Wook...)

1633
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,360
(has a refreshing and clean taste.)

1634
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,260
(Seasoning Park's scallion kimchi doesn't disappoint.)

1635
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,359
(There are also the scallion pancake and kimchi pancake...)

1636
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,460
(Ji Yeon struggled with.)

1637
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:15,339
(The Fresh members' seasonal meal is hearty today as always.)

1638
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,470
- Shall we eat? - Thank you for the food.

1639
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:19,270
I want to try the spicy stir-fried chicken.

1640
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,009
- Eat it with a perilla leaf. - Thank you for the food.

1641
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,050
(He uses a perilla leaf to wrap the spicy stir-fried chicken.)

1642
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,950
(He quickly puts it into his mouth before spilling it.)

1643
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,620
(Chewing)

1644
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,190
(Savoring)

1645
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,590
What's up with this spicy stir-fried chicken?

1646
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:42,800
- I'll try the chicken dish. - That's right.

1647
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,200
- It's potato. - I'll add potato as well.

1648
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,139
(She adds chicken.)

1649
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,900
Let's make a wrap with the spicy stir-fried chicken.

1650
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,740
(Big)

1651
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,880
(The spicy stir-fried chicken wrap goes into her mouth.)

1652
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,990
The spicy stir-fried chicken is so tasty.

1653
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,990
(She's cute.)

1654
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,560
(Jun Myun hurriedly makes a wrap with chicken...)

1655
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:14,760
(and more chicken.)

1656
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,760
(Two pieces of chicken)

1657
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,929
(She wraps them up...)

1658
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,340
(and puts them in her mouth.)

1659
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,440
(The spicy stir-fried chicken is the best as a wrap.)

1660
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,939
- It's tasty with a perilla leaf. - It's so tasty, Jung Ah.

1661
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,009
- Right? - Yes.

1662
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,550
- Perilla leaves are the best. - Yes.

1663
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,749
(She makes a wrap...)

1664
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,120
(and puts it in her mouth!)

1665
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,890
(Delicious food makes her dance.)

1666
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,290
It's perfect.

1667
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:47,230
Seriously. It's perfect.

1668
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,760
Despite the chili peppers, it isn't very spicy.

1669
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,170
I think it's thanks to the chicken fat.

1670
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,599
(Spicy stir-fried chicken...)

1671
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,970
(is perfect with rice.)

1672
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,769
Jung Ah, spicy stir-fried chicken tastes amazing.

1673
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,779
- Really? - It's tasty.

1674
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,110
- It's really tasty. - Yes, it's tasty.

1675
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,010
(The compliments make her feel proud.)

1676
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,020
The spicy stir-fried chicken completes the meal.

1677
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,349
The spicy stir-fried chicken...

1678
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,480
(The spicy stir-fried chicken on a cauldron lid is popular.)

1679
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,250
(She also eats a hot fish cake skewer.)

1680
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,620
(It's tasty.)

1681
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,360
(She blows on it and takes a big bite.)

1682
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,399
My goodness.

1683
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,730
It's so tasty.

1684
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,670
(Slurping the fish cake)

1685
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,940
(My goodness)

1686
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,069
(It's so soft that she swallows it after chewing twice.)

1687
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,239
- Is it tasty? - It's tasty.

1688
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,880
(It's so tasty.)

1689
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,549
(The fish cake is tender since it soaked up the broth.)

1690
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,579
- It's tasty. - Eat it with scallion kimchi.

1691
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,720
(The perfect accompaniment for fish cake)

1692
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,490
(Seasoning Park's scallion kimchi)

1693
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,560
(Hurry up and eat it.)

1694
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,030
(Crunchy)

1695
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,400
Scallion kimchi is so tasty.

1696
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,469
Jung Ah.

1697
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,910
(I'm Seasoning Park.)

1698
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,270
- You know, - It's tasty.

1699
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,709
These scallions are definitely tasty.

1700
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,150
- That's right. - That's right.

1701
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,350
- The scallions did everything. - They're really tasty.

1702
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,619
The scallions aren't as spicy as I thought they would be.

1703
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,219
- The scallions are sweet. - I thought they'd be spicy.

1704
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,319
They aren't spicy.

1705
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,960
Shall we just eat scallion kimchi this time?

1706
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,960
- I could eat it every day. - Seriously.

1707
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,630
We won't meet anyone.

1708
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
- We won't kiss anyone either. - Exactly.

1709
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,730
Stop talking about kissing!

1710
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,169
- I haven't seen anyone talk... - What?

1711
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,869
About kissing so much.

1712
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,210
(Sick and tired of kissing)

1713
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,710
What?

1714
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,380
(Jae Wook notices something.)

1715
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,779
I'll try the kimchi pancake.

1716
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,950
(Bite-sized kimchi pancake)

1717
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,290
(Jae Wook tries a piece.)

1718
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,620
(How is it, Jae Wook?)

1719
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,490
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

1720
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,630
- Is it tasty? - He says that it's tasty.

1721
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,730
(The kimchi pancake makes them happy.)

1722
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,369
It turned out this way since I failed to flip it over.

1723
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,600
It's good as long as it's tasty.

1724
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:11,100
(Jae Wook eats a piece of scallion pancake as well.)

1725
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,710
It's tasty.

1726
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,910
It's crunchy.

1727
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,950
Can you hear the sound?

1728
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,449
It's tasty.

1729
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:22,020
(She feels so proud.)

1730
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,990
(Jung Ah eats the scallion pancake as well.)

1731
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,620
- It's tasty. Yes. - Is it tasty?

1732
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,920
It doesn't need a sauce.

1733
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:35,299
(Her cooking teacher, Jun Myun tastes it.)

1734
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,360
(Impressed)

1735
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,299
- Scallion kimchi is so tasty. - Yes.

1736
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,530
(Ji Yeon's pancake is pretty good.)

1737
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:40,670
You did well.

1738
01:12:40,671 --> 01:12:42,200
- Try it with scallion kimchi. - Really?

1739
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:46,310
(Ji Yeon eats it as well.)

1740
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,909
(I made it, )

1741
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,550
(but it's so tasty.)

1742
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,309
How is it so crispy?

1743
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,880
I keep eating it because it's sweet.

1744
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,950
The combination of the dishes is so nice today.

1745
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,190
Right?

1746
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:02,219
There are soup and spicy dishes.

1747
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,560
(The meal is spicy, sweet, and refreshing.)

1748
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,760
It's like a traditional tavern.

1749
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:07,899
- Yes. - Right?

1750
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,929
The dishes remind me of that.

1751
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,530
- Yes. - Let's make a wrap.

1752
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,369
Right?

1753
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,099
(A regular at the traditional tavern)

1754
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,270
It's tasty.

1755
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,710
(They laugh and talk as they eat food.)

1756
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:22,040
- We finished it. - We finished it.

1757
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,950
(They cleared the plates.)

1758
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,680
- I really enjoyed the meal. - Me too.

1759
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,820
I hope tomorrow will be just like today.

1760
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,249
(By the way)

1761
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,689
We'll catch webfoot octopuses tomorrow.

1762
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,260
(They'll catch webfoot octopuses tomorrow.)

1763
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,759
I forgot about that.

1764
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,859
That'll be our labor tomorrow.

1765
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,860
(They forgot about the work while having dinner.)

1766
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,460
(Relaxed)

1767
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,300
You should go ahead and talk to us.

1768
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,140
Tomorrow, you guys will go and catch webfoot octopuses.

1769
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,770
(Webfoot octopuses will be tasty.)

1770
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,170
You guys will leave the house at 8:40am.

1771
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,480
(At 8:40am? Okay!)

1772
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:59,450
It's 10pm now.

1773
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,350
Once we wash up, it'll be 11pm.

1774
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,720
Shall we go inside?

1775
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,390
("Forever With You" by Lee Moon Sae)

1776
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,490
(Everyone is absorbed in the song.)

1777
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,260
(Glancing over)

1778
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,069
- Why are you so much like... - What?

1779
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,200
A sorceress?

1780
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,070
I had the same thought.

1781
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,010
A sorceress?

1782
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,540
- It's because of this. - I mean...

1783
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,009
Whoopi Goldberg played one back in the day.

1784
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,010
(She looks like someone who knows many things.)

1785
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,950
- If I wear lipstick... - Please give me a tarot reading.

1786
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,420
- I think I saw you in Hongdae. - I know.

1787
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,519
After working there for ten years, I got driven away...

1788
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,590
because the neighborhood became too expensive.

1789
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,459
The monthly rent was about 1,200 dollars.

1790
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,259
They suddenly wanted 2,500 dollars.

1791
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,529
It was so hard.

1792
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,660
Where do you work these days?

1793
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,600
- Now, I work in Mullae-dong. - Mullae-dong?

1794
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,339
(She went to a nice neighborhood.)

1795
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,640
Mullae-dong is popular these days.

1796
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,240
- Mullae-dong. - Mullae-dong.

1797
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,610
- When will you wake up tomorrow? - Why Mullae-dong?

1798
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,310
- At what time? - Around 7:30am?

1799
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,110
- Around 7:30am? - Yes.

1800
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,549
We'll wake up at 7:30am and leave at 8:30am.

1801
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,250
- Yes. At 7:30am... - We'll be in a hurry.

1802
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,290
Where is this smoke coming from?

1803
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,859
- It's a humidifier. - Smoke.

1804
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,860
(Steam comes out.)

1805
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,889
It's like smog.

1806
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,300
(The atmosphere turns moist thanks to the humidifier.)

1807
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,100
You have no idea who the guest will be tomorrow, right?

1808
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,540
Yoon Kyung Ho and Kim Jae Hwa surprised me so much.

1809
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,009
- Right? - It was so nice.

1810
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,540
I hope someone like them will come again.

1811
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,340
Right.

1812
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,550
It was fun and relaxing.

1813
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,080
To be honest, I really didn't want to go to bed that night.

1814
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,750
I wanted to play some more, but I was so tired.

1815
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,550
The day is long whenever we're on this show.

1816
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,159
Is that why?

1817
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,459
(The day is long.)

1818
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,589
It's long but short.

1819
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,890
(But in retrospect, the day seems short.)

1820
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,900
All right.

1821
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:57,160
(For tomorrow that'll be short and leave them wanting for more, )

1822
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:59,329
- I'll brush my teeth first. - Okay.

1823
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:00,330
(they wrap up before it gets too late.)

1824
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,840
Catching webfoot octopuses won't be hard.

1825
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,969
(Laughing)

1826
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,670
I'll do so well.

1827
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,350
(Will Jung Ah's resolution come true?)

1828
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,650
(The night passes in excitement and trepidation.)

1829
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,359
(6:35am)

1830
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,830
(Hapyeong Village, Boryeong)

1831
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,070
(It's still early in the morning.)

1832
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:41,210
(It's quiet in the Fresh House.)

1833
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,480
(Someone is here for them.)

1834
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:47,780
I'm so nervous already.

1835
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,220
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1836
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:56,490
(The guest with a lovely voice)

1837
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,329
- Hello. - Hello.

1838
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:03,360
(Actress Kim Hye Yoon)

1839
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:09,570
(The cheerful female lead from "Lovely Runner," Im Sol)

1840
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,069
(Hye Yoon and Jung Ah met as the mom and daughter...)

1841
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:14,340
(in the 2018 drama, "Sky Castle.")

1842
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:19,510
(The mom and daughter show off their acting skills.)

1843
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,580
I've raised you without hurting your pride!

1844
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,320
(In a drama, "Extraordinary You,")

1845
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:32,229
(she had insane romance with Jae Wook.)

1846
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,230
It looked fun.

1847
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,960
(Do you have a schedule today?)

1848
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,299
(A schedule?)

1849
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,230
(No, I don't. Why do you ask?)

1850
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,770
(Money for labor)

1851
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,870
(I'm asking you to be a guest.)

1852
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,369
(I'm moved.)

1853
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,640
(A lot of money)

1854
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,180
(Hye Yoon has visited Fresh off the Sea.)

1855
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,550
(She heads over to the Fresh House with high expectations.)

1856
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,550
How should I make my entrance?

1857
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,219
What should I do?

1858
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,420
(Being a good student, Hye Yoon wants to appear well.)

1859
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,560
How do guests usually make an entrance?

1860
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,290
(Usually, guests don't arrive at this hour.)

1861
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,789
(She's the first guest to come before the members wake up.)

1862
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,130
I'm under so much pressure.

1863
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,270
I don't know if I should be in the house naturally.

1864
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:18,510
Should I do something? I had that thought.

1865
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,139
What should I do?

1866
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,340
(It seems like she's coming up with a big plan.)

1867
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,350
(Meanwhile, )

1868
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:29,420
(the four siblings have no idea about the situation.)

1869
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,290
(They will wake up 30 minutes later.)

1870
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,619
(As she ponders, Hye Yoon arrives near the house.)

1871
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,659
I'm nervous.

1872
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,289
(She gets out of the van far from the house...)

1873
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,900
(so that the members don't wake up.)

1874
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,260
The house with a blue roof is theirs.

1875
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:45,970
Is it that house?
(She heads over to the house with a blue roof.)

1876
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,540
I'm nervous.

1877
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,340
(She clenches her fists since she's nervous.)

1878
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,680
(She crosses the fields.)

1879
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,820
(She comes near the Fresh House.)

1880
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,719
(Not knowing what will happen soon, Jung Ah is fast asleep.)

1881
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,890
(Steamy)

1882
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:11,830
(Hesitant)

1883
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,630
Should I be quiet now?

1884
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,229
(She takes nervous steps toward the house.)

1885
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,230
Oh, my gosh.

1886
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:21,870
Hello.

1887
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,440
This is the house. No way.

1888
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:27,410
The house is so pretty.

1889
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,010
(The green gate and the doorplate welcome her at the Fresh House.)

1890
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,719
(She keeps her steps quiet...)

1891
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,290
(as she tiptoes to the gate.)

1892
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,620
(She opens the door carefully.)

1893
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,720
(Peeking)

1894
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,530
Hello.

1895
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:47,929
(On her way to the house, )

1896
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,160
(Hye Yoon came up with a plan.)

1897
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,599
(She will sneak into the house...)

1898
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,440
(and wake up the four siblings.)

1899
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:03,110
(Careful)

1900
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,680
(She checks out the atmosphere before infiltrating the house.)

1901
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,920
(It's quiet inside the house.)

1902
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,160
(She carefully steps into the house.)

1903
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,390
(Hitting)

1904
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,930
(Freezing)

1905
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,660
(Tossing)

1906
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,230
(Thankfully, no one wakes up.)

1907
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,370
(She resumes with her mission.)

1908
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,240
(She closes the door carefully.)

1909
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,650
(Is this the room?)

1910
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:49,320
(She checks out the women's room first.)

1911
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,170
(Falling back into deep sleep)

1912
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:12,480
(That was so close.)

1913
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,850
Mom!

1914
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,250
Mom!

1915
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,830
Hello.

1916
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,160
- Hye Yoon. - Yes?

1917
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,930
Hello.

1918
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,770
Hye Yoon, why are you here?

1919
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,099
Hello.

1920
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,670
(She's very startled.)

1921
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,180
What's this? Who is she?

1922
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,979
(Startled, )

1923
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,249
(Ji Yeon hides under the blanket.)

1924
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,449
Hello.

1925
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:50,820
What time is it now?

1926
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:52,950
- I can't believe it. - My goodness.

1927
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:55,490
Hey.

1928
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,720
Hello.

1929
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,360
Don't you know Hye Yoon?

1930
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,060
Of course, I know her.

1931
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,500
Ye Seo, you should be studying. What are you doing here?

1932
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,329
I can't believe it. My Hye Yoon.

1933
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,140
(What's going on?)

1934
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,310
Why did they make you come here so early in the morning?

1935
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,069
Who calls over a guest at 7am in the morning?

1936
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,540
You need to go and catch webfoot octopuses.

1937
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,410
Will we go and catch webfoot octopuses?

1938
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,609
Yes, we will... You don't even know about that.

1939
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:22,649
I don't know anything.

1940
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,179
We'll catch webfoot octopuses today.

1941
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,290
(It's a surprise on both sides.)

1942
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:29,390
(While it gets noisy in the women's room, )

1943
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:37,430
(Jae Wook is still traveling the dreamland.)

1944
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:43,370
(My mission isn't over yet.)

1945
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,569
(He's approached...)

1946
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:51,080
(by a small and black shadow.)

1947
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,220
(Jae Wook, just you wait.)

1948
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:00,150
Jae Wook.

1949
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,990
Jae Wook.

1950
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:11,530
(Jae Wook reacts as if he has seen a ghost.)

1951
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:15,840
(This must be a dream.)

1952
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,840
(Incredulous)

1953
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,369
Sleep tight.

1954
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,380
(He falls back asleep.)

1955
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,979
(Hye Yoon's morning surprise almost made their hearts drop.)

1956
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,280
I can't believe Jae Wook.

1957
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,720
(Ji Yeon comes back in outerwear.)

1958
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,820
Isn't this too much? It's my first time meeting her.

1959
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,390
- Hye Yoon? - Yes.

1960
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,490
Oh, my.

1961
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,329
Isn't it too much to look like this for the first meeting?

1962
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,789
(Looking presentable for the first meeting is too hard)

1963
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,230
This is too much.

1964
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,959
Isn't this too much?

1965
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,169
(Very annoyed)

1966
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,170
I mean...

1967
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,569
Hey, what are you talking about?

1968
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,740
- She'll get used to it. - I feel...

1969
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,539
I feel so humiliated.

1970
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,770
(Ji Yeon feels so humiliated that she doesn't know what to do.)

1971
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,480
I feel so humiliated.

1972
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,980
I can't believe it. I look so shabby for our first meeting.

1973
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,520
What's this?

1974
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,350
- It's all right. - I can't believe it.

1975
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,019
We're meeting for the first time.

1976
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,989
Yes. Hello, I'm Kim Hye Yoon.

1977
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:10,189
- I'm a fan. - Gosh, you're too kind.

1978
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,760
I can't believe you're here.

1979
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,759
- You should lie down. - Okay.

1980
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,760
(I'm startled, but welcome.)

1981
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:16,059
Everyone is telling me to lie down.

1982
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,500
My Ye Seo should be studying.

1983
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:22,539
I came here to catch webfoot octopuses instead.

1984
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,000
(Ye Seo came to catch webfoot octopuses.)

1985
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:27,810
(This time, it's the webfoot octopus!)

1986
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,279
(They pull and pull, )

1987
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,180
(but the work doesn't end.)

1988
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,310
(The cursed webfoot octopus catching)

1989
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,750
(Oh, my!)

1990
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:36,520
(The skilled Hye Yoon enters the scene.)

1991
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:37,579
All right.

1992
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,189
(She pulls out a webfoot octopus...)

1993
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,990
(and runs!)

1994
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,960
(Using the webfoot octopuses they've caught, )

1995
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,190
(they will make the webfoot octopus set meal.)

1996
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,529
(They boil them.)

1997
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:51,560
(They fry them.)

1998
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,869
(They'll eat as many webfoot octopuses as they want.)

1999
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,270
Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

2000
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,100
(A fight suddenly breaks out in the Seasoning family.)

2001
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,569
(I'll teach you a lesson.)

2002
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,640
(How dare a rookie cook do that?)

2003
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:02,909
(The expert is incredulous.)

2004
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:03,940
(I'll side with the winner.)

2005
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,080
(Scoffing)

2006
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,850
(Who will be the winner of the Seasoning family's fight?)
