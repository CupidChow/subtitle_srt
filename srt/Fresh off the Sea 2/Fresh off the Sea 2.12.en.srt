1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:01,866
It's so pretty.

2
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:03,006
(The fourth location, Dolsan Island in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province)

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,936
(At the refreshing sea of the southern region, )

4
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,007
(a familiar voice echoed!)

5
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:09,406
(A special guest in a fisherman's disguise, )

6
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:11,177
(Dex)

7
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,046
(The family he aimed to catch appeared.)

8
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,687
(He put on a passionate performance to surprise the members.)

9
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,346
(To his disappointment, they showed no interest.)

10
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,487
Jung Ah!

11
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,187
It's me, Dex!

12
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:25,657
Jung Ah!

13
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,927
(An enthusiastic welcome)

14
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:32,467
(Their hearts swelled with happiness from seeing each other.)

15
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,066
(The five siblings' story with Dex...)

16
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,167
(starts now!)

17
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:41,637
(One spring day in the South Sea...)

18
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,806
(Seongdu Village, Dolsan Island, Yeosu-si, South Jeolla Province)

19
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:46,316
Still, it was a big success.

20
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:47,776
I was very startled.

21
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,386
- Jae Wook was very startled too. - Did you wonder...

22
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,717
- who was screaming? - Yes.

23
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:54,816
You were startled, right?

24
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:55,956
(He returned in glory.)

25
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,827
From the first day...

26
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,127
It's only our first day.

27
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,526
- He's busy. - He has been busy.

28
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:02,766
Have you two met before?

29
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,127
- Jae Wook, is it your 1st time? - Yes, it's my 1st time.

30
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,997
(Is it his first time meeting Dex?)

31
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:10,237
Lee Jae Wook...

32
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,636
- was born in 1998. He's a baby. - He was born in 1998.

33
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:13,976
- I was born in 1998. - He was born in 1998.

34
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:15,106
(Jae Wook is younger since Dex was born in 1995.)

35
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:16,706
- Ji Yeon is older than you. - I've met him before.

36
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,776
- Yes. - I was born in 1990.

37
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,216
Dex was born in 1995.

38
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:20,617
I'm in your care.

39
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,316
I'm a bit introverted.

40
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,847
(Feeling awkward)

41
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,187
- Shall I go and change? - Yes, you should do that.

42
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,856
Wear something nice.

43
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:29,587
I'll go and change.

44
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,426
(They notice the house after welcoming the guest.)

45
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:33,527
The house is...

46
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,026
The house is so pretty.

47
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,327
- It's cute. - It's so cute.

48
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,336
The house is cute and adorable...

49
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:41,366
- this time, right? - Exactly.

50
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,136
Shall we check out the rooms?

51
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,007
(The house is cute with the low ceiling.)

52
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,776
Look at the details of this house.

53
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,077
(It's full of cute details!)

54
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,716
Is this the room we will be sleeping in?

55
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:53,746
(They can see some of the rafters...)

56
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,846
(and a green tree that covers the roof.)

57
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:57,017
- It's cute. - Very.

58
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:59,587
- It's cute. - It's nice.

59
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:01,457
I think it's here.

60
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,287
Hey, it's right next to...

61
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,696
- This is incredible. - No way.

62
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,956
(Hiding under the protected tree of Seongdu Village, )

63
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,677
(a place where the land and the sea meet, )

64
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:10,466
(they can watch the sea of Dolsan Island.)

65
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,667
The view is insane. It's so pretty.

66
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,266
It's so pretty.

67
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,507
(It's the Protected Tree House in Dolsan Island, Yeosu.)

68
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,136
- You? - It's next to Jae Wook's room.

69
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,677
(The best thing about the house)

70
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,707
- It's totally... - All right.

71
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:27,177
- Have you had a meal? - No, I haven't.

72
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,246
He's a bit shy at first.

73
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,457
(There is Dex, a man who is a bit shy at first.)

74
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:35,956
It won't take long.

75
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,156
He'll relax in no time.

76
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,317
(The introverted man whose MBTI type is ISTP screams.)

77
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:42,096
- He's only like that at 1st. - The very 1st.

78
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:43,297
(The very first)

79
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,296
- You need to change, right? - It's okay.

80
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,597
(The introverted man...)

81
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,336
Yes, it's okay.

82
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,736
(can't take off his hat.)

83
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,807
It's okay.

84
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:55,236
How fascinating! It's Dex!

85
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,747
- It really is fascinating. - It's fascinating.

86
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,076
(Looking outside once and looking at the floor once)

87
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,716
Hello.

88
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,616
(Looking outside once and looking at the floor once)

89
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,097
- Seriously. - Is he here as a guest?

90
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,316
- It's fascinating. - In the end,

91
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:10,926
the 4 siblings became 5 siblings.

92
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,796
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th siblings.

93
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:15,196
- I'm the youngest. - Yes, the youngest.

94
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:16,743
(The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, the youngest)

95
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,136
We need to go and harvest mustard greens.

96
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,697
- "Mustard greens?" - Mustard greens.

97
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:21,766
Let's go and work.

98
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,167
I don't know what to wear.

99
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,677
(The eldest sibling is ruthless.)

100
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:28,277
- Dex. - Yes, Jun Myun?

101
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,447
- Hey, come here. - Didn't you miss me?

102
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,377
Didn't you miss me?

103
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,116
- Didn't you miss me? - You know,

104
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,246
I never imagined you'd be here.

105
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,386
- Really? - I can't believe it.

106
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,646
- You didn't think it'd be today. - Let me see you.

107
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,716
You're looking handsome today.

108
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,317
Stop it.

109
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,456
- It has been a while, - I'm happy to see you.

110
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,756
So you're praising me a lot.

111
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,397
(It's Jun Myun's way of welcoming him.)

112
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,196
It's so...

113
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:49,666
(It's so...)

114
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,027
- embarrassing for some reason. - It's embarrassing, right?

115
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:54,767
So, we're going to harvest crown daisy, right?

116
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:56,766
- Not crown daisy. - What?

117
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,206
- It's not crown daisy? - No, it's not.

118
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:00,007
- Mustard green? - Like mustard green kimchi.

119
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,976
- Is that so? - That's right.

120
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,677
(Dex isn't stupid.)

121
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:06,876
- Jung Ah, shall we change now? - Yes?

122
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:07,877
Yes!

123
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,438
(Let's get ready to work in the field.)

124
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,746
Which color should I pick?

125
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:12,917
(Which color should I pick?)

126
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:16,857
(It seems like she's deep in thought.)

127
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,027
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

128
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,597
Which one is better?

129
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,396
The red one.

130
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,173
(A woman with good taste, Jun Myun chooses the color.)

131
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,866
Jung Ah, please put this on my head.

132
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,236
- Will this do? - The texture is stiff.

133
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,266
It looks pretty...

134
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,137
when the front goes down a bit.

135
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,577
Should it be tighter?

136
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,146
- How pretty. - It's good now, right?

137
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:37,207
(They're cute.)

138
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,316
Jae Wook, look at me.

139
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:41,376
Should I tuck it in or not?

140
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:44,616
(Lastly, she asks Jae Wook about the fit.)

141
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,917
I can't look at you.

142
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,617
Does it look better tucked in or not?

143
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,356
What do you think?

144
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,396
(A peacock)

145
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,227
Let me see you.

146
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:56,977
- Let me see you. - Currently, you have...

147
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,466
too many colors going on.

148
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,937
Jung Ah, I chose the most common colors.

149
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,136
People usually tuck in the top like this.

150
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,266
Aren't all colors too expressive?

151
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,977
(Not common in the slightest)

152
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,806
Why are you putting so much care in fashion?

153
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,307
Fashion is important, Jung Ah.

154
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,516
- This is when I don't tuck it in. - So, where are we going?

155
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,847
- This is when... - Where?

156
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:18,147
So, where are we going?

157
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,886
Where? So, where are we going?

158
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,957
(The Fresh dresser)

159
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,326
- Where? - That's right.

160
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,057
(I'm an experienced worker.)

161
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,527
- Seriously. - I didn't know...

162
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,927
that I'd end up wearing floral pants right away.

163
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,627
I'm an experienced worker.

164
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,096
(His pants show that he's an experienced worker.)

165
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,857
- I know what to do. - Jung Ah, come on out.

166
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,537
Everyone is wearing vibrant colors.

167
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:43,776
(Laughing)

168
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:44,977
Jin Young.

169
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,317
(Ji Yeon only looks ahead.)

170
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:50,716
- Ji Yeon. - May I ask you why...

171
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,887
you can't look me in the eye?

172
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,687
I can feel the awkwardness from inside.

173
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,687
- Seriously. - You're here.

174
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:58,587
- Where have you been? - You're here. Hurry over here.

175
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:01,256
- It's so awkward. - Where have you been?

176
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:02,496
I missed you.

177
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,997
Jung Ah, come here.

178
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,797
Come and sit here.

179
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,807
(You guys feel awkward, right?)

180
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,237
Didn't you guys become close through the other show?

181
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,376
- Well... - I thought we had become close.

182
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,216
I mean, I also thought we had become close.

183
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,476
But I felt the distance between us when I saw her...

184
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:21,717
at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

185
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,117
- I see. - Were you there too?

186
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,416
I saw him for a second.

187
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,186
Jun Myun, could you care about me just a little more?

188
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,786
- I have no interest in you. - Why did you go there? Were you...

189
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,426
Why did you go there? Were you a candidate for an award?

190
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,686
"Why did you go there?"

191
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,256
I was there for a reason.

192
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,257
Were you a candidate?

193
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,267
- It was for an entertainment award. - Right.

194
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,257
Yes. It was for an entertainment award.

195
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,067
Of course, it was. It couldn't have been about acting.

196
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:45,006
While that goes without saying...

197
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,113
(The spicy show of affection really wakes him up.)

198
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,477
Jae Woo, you must've been very good.

199
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,317
They don't even care about me.

200
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,976
- It isn't true. - You guys used to adore me.

201
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,537
(They find Dex cute for being jealous.)

202
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,087
How should I describe this feeling?

203
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:03,157
It's like coming home after the military discharge...

204
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,697
only to find a new member of the family.

205
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,027
There's a new person.

206
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:10,897
There's no space for me.

207
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,367
That's how you feel.

208
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:15,907
(Sad)

209
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,907
Jae Wook looks good in any outfit.

210
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:21,837
My goodness.

211
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:23,847
Are you beginning to flirt with me?

212
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:26,216
No, it isn't like that.

213
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:28,577
Your shoulders are very wide too.

214
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:29,917
Do you work out?

215
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,616
I like to work out.

216
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,717
I see. Your shoulders...

217
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,386
(Although my face is red)

218
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:37,557
I'm not being shy.

219
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:43,166
(He pretends to look for water.)

220
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,896
In real life, your shoulders are very wide.

221
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,466
Can you stand by the door for me?

222
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,136
(Like this?)

223
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,037
Your shoulders are as wide as the door frame.

224
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,837
Jae Wook's shoulders are wide.

225
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,206
(How cute.)

226
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,776
- Why am I being so shy? - There you go again.

227
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,776
(After 1 year, )

228
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,947
(Jun Myun has become shy again.)

229
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,947
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

230
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:08,286
- Jun Myun, don't be like that. - What are you doing?

231
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,657
Why are you being so shy?

232
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,127
All right, Jun Myun.

233
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,866
All right, Jun Myun. Let's take medicine.

234
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,267
- Come on. - My goodness.

235
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,466
- Gosh, you'll bleed from your face. - You're so funny.

236
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,836
- You'll bleed from your face. - I took one already.

237
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,907
Let's take medicine.

238
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,736
(It's a tear-jerking effort to cure shyness.)

239
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,207
- Jun Myun, look at my face. - I'm so embarrassed. Go away.

240
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,176
- Jun Myun, open wide. - You're too funny.

241
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,516
(Dex's treatment to cure Jun Myun's shyness...)

242
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:37,217
(becomes complete.)

243
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,547
That's so funny.

244
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:42,287
"Dex, have a taste."

245
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,427
(Here's the thing, Dex.)

246
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:48,996
We need to make a lot of money today.

247
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:52,227
- Today? - We'll harvest mustard greens.

248
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,236
We can make kimchi with them, but...

249
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,107
We want pork belly as the main dish.

250
00:08:58,307 --> 00:09:00,707
What choice do we have then? We need to make a lot of money.

251
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,647
Jung Ah, just tell me the amount you want.

252
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,547
How much do you need today?

253
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,216
We need the amount to buy meat.

254
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,146
- A lot of meat. - This is what we have left...

255
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:11,147
from the last session.

256
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,786
So we'll work in the field.

257
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,263
(Let's earn the most amount of money today.)

258
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,657
Let's take a group photo and set off.

259
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,547
- Let's take it here. - Okay.

260
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,426
- Get up. - Okay. I'll be the tripod.

261
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,103
(Dex will be the selfie stick for the first time in a while!)

262
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:24,227
Get into the frame.

263
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,997
One, two.

264
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,066
(The five siblings are wearing the fanciest clothes for work.)

265
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,667
I'll need to work hard today.

266
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,407
Let's go.

267
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,837
Fasten your seat belt.

268
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:35,677
Okay.

269
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,307
- You can turn it on. - Okay.

270
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,776
- Shall we go? - Yes.

271
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,393
(Let's head over to the mustard green field!)

272
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,017
- Let's go! - Yes.

273
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,217
- How long will the drive be? - Seven minutes.

274
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,557
- Seven minutes? - It's nearby.

275
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:49,657
("In Summer" by DUEX)

276
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,897
(They warm up with a fun song during the commute.)

277
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,596
(We'll pick mustard greens...)

278
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,797
(like this.)

279
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:02,917
- The sea is so pretty. - The sea is so pretty.

280
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,037
(The sea?)

281
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,176
The road is so pretty.

282
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,746
(They drive along the winding road of the Dolsan Island.)

283
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,776
Aren't you a good singer?

284
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,717
- It's so pretty. - I'm not.

285
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,817
The sea is emerald in color.

286
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:22,687
(The mustard green field is open toward us)

287
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:27,227
(And the Fresh members are by my side)

288
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:31,597
(Both the view and the song are nice.)

289
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,567
Why is my nose so runny today?

290
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,157
- It could be due to your allergy. - Do I have an allergy?

291
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:39,353
- It might be the case. - What kind of an allergy is it?

292
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,777
A Dex allergy?

293
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:42,777
(Laughing)

294
00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:45,176
It's a Dex allergy. You haven't seen him in a while.

295
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,547
(Oh, my)

296
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:49,746
I think these are mustard greens.

297
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:50,987
Are these all mustard greens?

298
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,756
- Mustard greens are ahead of us. - In a field like this...

299
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:57,827
I think those are mustard greens.

300
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,796
- We're here. - Shall we get out?

301
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,603
(They park the car in front of the mustard green field!)

302
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,066
- Let's go. - Let's get out of the car.

303
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,126
(The place where the green field and the blue sea meet)

304
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,237
Where... Let's see.

305
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:09,966
(They take a seat cushion each.)

306
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,006
We need to go all the way to the top.

307
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,776
- That must be the place. - Where?

308
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:16,046
- The field. - All of them are mustard greens.

309
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,046
(Today's labor location is the mustard green field.)

310
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,747
It's reassuring to have Jae Wook.

311
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,947
- It's very reassuring. - Of course.

312
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:24,287
Hello.

313
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,257
They're working already.

314
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,187
Hello.

315
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,226
- Hello. - Hello.

316
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,997
- Hello. - Hello.

317
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,427
Is this what mustard greens look like?

318
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,796
(Oh, my!)

319
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:42,497
The mustard greens look cool. Hello.

320
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,306
Yeosu is famous...

321
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:47,336
- for Dolsan mustard green kimchi. - That's right.

322
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,617
- Mustard green kimchi. - I see.

323
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,476
It's my first time seeing the mustard greens.

324
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:53,546
So, this is what they look like.

325
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,817
(They're fresh before they become kimchi.)

326
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,386
I didn't know that mustard greens were so big.

327
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,317
(Much bigger than a human hand)

328
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,356
(They absorb the sea breeze of the Dolsan Island, Yeosu.)

329
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,797
Yeosu has the mustard greens infused with the sea breeze.

330
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,697
Thanks to the sea breeze,

331
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,197
they have a piquant flavor that is part of their charm.

332
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:20,307
(Yeosu's Dolsan mustard greens)

333
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,146
(However)

334
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,147
(My goodness)

335
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,926
(However)

336
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,567
My goodness, the size of the field...

337
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,597
(Before the five siblings lies...)

338
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:37,107
Gosh, this is...

339
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,268
(a vast mustard green field.)

340
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,306
Gosh, this is...

341
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,217
(It's 3,306m² in size.)

342
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,587
(How will Dex react upon facing an adversary?)

343
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,656
(What's this?)

344
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:50,657
Hello.

345
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,256
Gosh, this is... I should put this on right away.

346
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:56,197
- It doesn't go that way. - No?

347
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,297
It's the other way.

348
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:58,796
I should put this on right away.

349
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,666
(He even forgot how to put on the seat cushion.)

350
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,597
- Pluck out the bad leaves. - Okay.

351
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,896
Harvest them and put them side by side.

352
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:06,967
- Okay. - Okay.

353
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,807
(She gets to work.)

354
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:14,407
Jung Ah does things on her own.

355
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,416
I know. She looks like an expert.

356
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,917
(She looks like an expert farm worker.)

357
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:22,817
- Hello. - Hello.

358
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:26,326
I need to take off the bad leaves, right?

359
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,057
Take them off.

360
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:31,827
(This is how the Great Jung Ah harvest mustard greens.)

361
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,226
(Cut the bottom of the mustard green plant.)

362
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,497
- I don't pull out the root. - Of course not.

363
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,507
Throw away the yellow leaves.

364
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:42,536
They aren't marketable.

365
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:44,253
(Take out the leaves that aren't marketable.)

366
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:46,707
We should remove leaves like these.

367
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,476
Put them down prettily.

368
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,777
(And put them in the basket prettily.)

369
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,887
- You shouldn't cut them like this. - Really?

370
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,557
Then the leaves will become dry fast...

371
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:59,056
and lose their commercial value.

372
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,356
(The leaves will become dry fast and lose their commercial value.)

373
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,226
- I cut the whole stem like this. - That's right.

374
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:04,356
(You need to cut the whole stem.)

375
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,857
That's the best product.

376
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,327
- They need to be one. - Yes.

377
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,567
(A bad example)

378
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,567
It should be like this.

379
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,966
So, I should take off the leaves, and keep the ones that are attached.

380
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,007
Yes, keep them attached.

381
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,347
- Harvest as much as you can. - Okay.

382
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,777
I'll harvest so many mustard greens.

383
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:27,016
Sir, please give us the exact amount for our work.

384
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,017
Okay.

385
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:30,017
We need to eat pork belly today.

386
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,586
- We need to earn a lot of money. - If you work hard...

387
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:33,627
- Yes. - Yes.

388
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:38,126
One bundle of this weighs 22kg.

389
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,127
- It's 22kg. - Yes.

390
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,227
(Stacking the harvested mustard greens)

391
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,237
(Transferring them onto a cart with a scale)

392
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:50,437
(Once they reach 22kg, )

393
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,977
(we tie the bundle with a cloth.)

394
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,676
(That completes one bundle.)

395
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,687
One bundle will be 15 dollars.

396
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,237
- Gosh. - Did you say 15 dollars?

397
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,187
We agreed to buy 150 dollars worth of meat.

398
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,426
(22kg for 15 dollars)

399
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:09,127
(220kg for 150 dollars)

400
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,057
Oh, my.

401
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:12,726
(The goal is over 220kg.)

402
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,397
Let's proceed like this.

403
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,067
I will clear out this entire area today.

404
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,196
(Burning with passion in the mustard green field)

405
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:20,466
- That's great. - Yes.

406
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,666
I like that attitude.

407
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,836
I'll harvest every single mustard green here...

408
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,277
and make a lot of money to eat lots of pork belly.

409
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,077
(Marching toward 220kg)

410
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,987
(Sorting carefully even when in a hurry)

411
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,127
This is easy.

412
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,387
Gosh.

413
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,597
(Even after 8 months off work, he's still confident.)

414
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,217
- Did you figure it out? - I figured it out.

415
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,596
I've definitely figured it out.

416
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,437
- You did figure it out. - Yes.

417
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,867
Do it like this.

418
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,476
Mother, my hometown is Suncheon.

419
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,736
- You're from Suncheon? - Yes.

420
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:01,376
- Dex, can you handle it? - This is just...

421
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,316
- He said this is easy. - It's way too easy, right?

422
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,746
- This is nothing. - It's not even hot,

423
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,987
and the weather is nice.

424
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,256
- This level? I mean, really... - It's so easy, right?

425
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:12,116
It's not just easy. I could go all day.

426
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,257
- All the way over there. - Really?

427
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,157
- We keep going like this, right? - Yes.

428
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:19,926
How much of this do we have to do?

429
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,397
That's the only thing on my mind.

430
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,597
(Just trust me.)

431
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:27,567
Didn't you feel a bit nostalgic watching the show?

432
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,206
I couldn't help but feel a bit jealous.

433
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,107
- I think I'd be jealous. - Were you jealous?

434
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:36,746
Jae Wook got all the attention. You might feel jealous, right?

435
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,846
- That spot was supposed to be mine. - Exactly.

436
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,847
That love once belonged to me.

437
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:45,086
(The house you live in)

438
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,427
(That house should have been mine)

439
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,096
(The car you drive)

440
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,627
(That car should have been mine)

441
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,396
(Laughing)

442
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:55,467
Is that what you felt?

443
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,967
I couldn't help but feel jealous.

444
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,406
But Jae Wook is just so good at what he does.

445
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,567
Yes, Jae Wook is really good.

446
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,276
He's full of charm, too.

447
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,937
(Jae Wook completely filled my spot.)

448
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:07,707
(Dex, burning with competitiveness, )

449
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,847
Let's see.

450
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:13,187
(brings out a differentiation strategy.)

451
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:14,817
I'll take these.

452
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,487
Neatly.

453
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:23,296
I should take charge of tying them up.

454
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,397
I'll go back and forth...

455
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:27,727
Jung Ah did a lot, too.

456
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,226
Of course.

457
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,066
(Making small talk while on the way)

458
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,167
It won't take long.

459
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:33,906
Make sure it weighs 22kg.

460
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,267
Okay, it should be 22kg.

461
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,977
(Lifting and carrying armfuls one after another)

462
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,046
(Reaching the first 22kg)

463
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,117
That was quick.

464
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:50,287
(Wrapping the first bundle tightly)

465
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,326
(22kg bundle)

466
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:55,827
(Lifting it with one hand)

467
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:58,627
(Moving quickly on foot)

468
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,097
(Adding 15 dollars)

469
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,736
I'll take care of the rest. Go ahead, everyone.

470
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:04,737
Okay.

471
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,066
Are you overseeing everything?

472
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,207
- Okay. - Yes.

473
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,207
This is our site supervisor.

474
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,507
Keep pushing forward all the way.

475
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,206
All the way.

476
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:16,206
Jin Young seems like someone who's worked here for a long time.

477
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,927
Yes, it feels like he has always been here.

478
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:21,387
- That's just how he is. - He always works like that.

479
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,386
He seems like the owner of this place.

480
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,747
(He is convincing as the owner of the mustard green field.)

481
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:27,186
The boss of our workplace.

482
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:29,067
(Demonstrating the skills of a seasoned worker)

483
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,697
The boss is quite handsome.

484
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,027
Not at all.

485
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,126
You're handsome, too, young man.

486
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,037
Look at those broad shoulders.

487
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:40,067
Your face is just strikingly handsome.

488
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:41,906
Are you married?

489
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:43,636
I'm still single.

490
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,676
Do you have a girlfriend?

491
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,047
If you know a good lady, please introduce her to me.

492
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,676
What kind of person are you into?

493
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:50,717
Well, you know...

494
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,017
- If she's cute and sexy... - That's me.

495
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,467
Look how fresh the mustard greens are.

496
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:04,457
(Diving into the lush green mustard greens)

497
00:19:04,797 --> 00:19:07,117
(Falling so deep, she turns into a mustard green herself.)

498
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:09,697
(Transforming into a mustard leaf)

499
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,707
(A mustard master with greens on her head)

500
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,306
(Next to her...)

501
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,707
(stands the red peppers master.)

502
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,076
- Jun Myun, is it going well? - Yes.

503
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,077
(It is indeed.)

504
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,398
I'm moving along nice and steady.

505
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,316
(The true master was someone else all along...)

506
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:26,547
You've done so much.

507
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,846
Jae Wook, that's exactly it.

508
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,317
- Please take this. Right here. - Okay. Let me see.

509
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:34,227
This is a whole bundle.

510
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,857
You're doing so well.

511
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,266
Our Jae Wook just keeps working without saying a word.

512
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,697
(A staggering harvest)

513
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,097
Jae Wook is...

514
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:45,097
(Even the owner is surprised.)

515
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:47,566
(Jae Wook harvested...)

516
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,177
(about 5kg all by himself.)

517
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:51,806
Jae Wook harvested a lot again.

518
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,177
Jae Wook, seriously...

519
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,276
He has such a strong work ethic.

520
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,237
(Jae Wook was able to become a master because...)

521
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,317
- You must move your hands quickly. - Okay.

522
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,587
(Yes, sir.)

523
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,687
- Hold it. That's the right way. - Yes.

524
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,926
Is it okay to harvest it even if it's this small?

525
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,407
- Is it okay to pick this? - As long as it's clean, it's fine.

526
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,856
- This should be okay, right? - Yes.

527
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:13,903
(Performing tasks with ease)

528
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,627
You get good at it after just two tries.

529
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:18,167
Good job.

530
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:21,307
- Am I doing well? - You're great for a first try.

531
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,777
You deserve a good pay.

532
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,376
He's truly serious about his work.

533
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:28,776
(The youth leader is fully dedicated to labor.)

534
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,476
Jae Wook must really want to eat a lot of pork belly today.

535
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:31,776
(Sweeping up mustard greens with fierce momentum)

536
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,247
Hey, Jae Wook. This is no joke.

537
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:37,387
(Piling it up in just 2 minutes)

538
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,217
Please, hurry up.

539
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,927
Why is Lee Jae Wook doing it so quickly?

540
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:44,697
It seems like you're doing more than her.

541
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:50,336
He filled a whole bundle by himself.

542
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,267
(Harvesting 6kg in just 2 minutes)

543
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,007
Lee Jae Wook stays silent and just keeps earning money.

544
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,677
He's only thinking about money.

545
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:59,637
All I can think about is making money.

546
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:01,677
Well done.

547
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,117
Two bundles.

548
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:08,046
- We've done two so far? - Two bundles.

549
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,286
- Did you say two? - Yes, two.

550
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,087
You'll be raking in money today.

551
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:12,816
(Laughing)

552
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,157
The pace is good.

553
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,596
- Should we keep going like this? - This is good.

554
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:20,837
If you keep going like this, beef is on the table today.

555
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,696
This sounds good.

556
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:25,696
Everyone, please look ahead. You see that over there, right?

557
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,766
- Yes. - We're going all the way there.

558
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,636
- Yes. - Beef sounds great.

559
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,007
Beef is great.

560
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,107
Okay, let's go.

561
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,047
We're going all the way over there.

562
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:37,677
- Nice one, Dex. - I'll do my best.

563
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:39,947
"I'll do my best."

564
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:42,516
I can feel myself getting into gear, too.

565
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:43,517
- Is that so? - Yes.

566
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,057
Your hands are quick.

567
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,297
(She lives up to her reputation with remarkably quick hands.)

568
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,397
Jun Myun is fast now.

569
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,696
She's not the same Jun Myun as last year.

570
00:21:53,697 --> 00:21:55,996
- Exactly. - These days, her work speed is...

571
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,997
Jun Myun needs Jung Ah by her side.

572
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:00,637
- You shouldn't be left alone. - That's right.

573
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:03,577
Everyone's good at sorting now, too.

574
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,107
This is nice.

575
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,376
The work speed is just...

576
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:09,447
(Faster is even better.)

577
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,047
Thank you, sir.

578
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:12,647
It's a bountiful harvest over here.

579
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:15,316
(Filling up the basket in no time)

580
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:17,757
- I should bring over two baskets. - Thanks.

581
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:21,486
I need to earn my keep.

582
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,627
(Four siblings are fully devoted to mustard greens.)

583
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,126
(Dex's back is bending under the strain.)

584
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:29,027
Three bundles.

585
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:31,266
(Popping up here)

586
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,197
(Popping up there)

587
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,607
(Piling up 1 by 1)

588
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:39,807
- We've already earned 60 dollars. - Really?

589
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:42,507
Money's pouring out of the ground.

590
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:43,977
That's right.

591
00:22:44,717 --> 00:22:45,817
Let's do this.

592
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:47,747
We're feasting tonight.

593
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,186
What's scary about Dex is that...

594
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:54,386
he's shy around strangers, but so good on camera.

595
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:55,487
I'm sorry.

596
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,297
It's because I'm hungry.

597
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:59,126
Hello.

598
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,127
(Daily life)

599
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,696
Let's do this.

600
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,697
(On air)

601
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:04,098
We're going all the way over there.

602
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:06,066
(Feeling awkward)

603
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:08,167
It's because I'm hungry.

604
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:12,677
We are required to engage both our hands and our speech as we work.

605
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,577
He is shy but professionally committed.

606
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,217
Everyone, please get to work.

607
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,747
I suddenly feel really embarrassed.

608
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,346
He's a true professional on screen.

609
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:25,186
(He's a true professional in broadcasting.)

610
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:28,687
Right now, Jung Ah and Jae Wook are nearly...

611
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:30,467
There's a significant gap here.

612
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,497
(Jung Ah and Jae Wook are definitely ahead.)

613
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:34,896
They're pushing forward strongly.

614
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:37,137
(As always, Leader Yum is full of fighting spirit.)

615
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:39,497
I think this kind of simple labor suits me well.

616
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:40,907
It suits you well.

617
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,006
Jae Wook has found his calling.

618
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:44,936
- This kind of labor suits me well. - Yes.

619
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:46,413
(Jae Wook is a natural at steady labor.)

620
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,476
(While he swiftly fills the basket as a professional labor, )

621
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:48,777
- Thank you. - Okay.

622
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,347
(the red peppers master is meticulously selective.)

623
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:55,147
It pains me to waste it.

624
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:56,987
That's why I can't throw it away.

625
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,787
(A clear difference in speed)

626
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:04,897
(Ji Yeon is reluctant to waste the leaves.)

627
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,826
It's not yellow, but is it okay if it's curled?

628
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:08,827
(When in doubt, she asks the professional labor.)

629
00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:10,196
That one's fine. Let me see.

630
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,866
Jae Wook, should this be discarded?

631
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,667
- Yes, that should be discarded. - It should?

632
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,737
They said to discard those without hesitation.

633
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:18,607
Jae Wook, what about this one?

634
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:19,883
(Shall I discard this one as well, without hesitation?)

635
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,046
Jae Wook, what about this one?

636
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,947
(It's yellowish.)

637
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,477
I keep saying to discard those, but you keep bringing them.

638
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:28,587
And you keep asking how those are...

639
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:34,027
Rather than asking, please just throw it away.

640
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,887
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

641
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:38,957
I want to be cautious about what we throw out.

642
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,626
Gosh, come here.

643
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:43,227
Unbelievable. If she works like this...

644
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:45,696
I brought her along for the day, but...

645
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,536
- Who brings an amateur like this? - Be lenient, please.

646
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,607
Didn't you get any training at the temp agency?

647
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:52,677
(Pretending to be frustrated)

648
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,876
(Laughing)

649
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:56,306
(Jun Myun loves his sudden skit.)

650
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,746
Hey, Jae Wook. What was that dialect?

651
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,776
What was that dialect?

652
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:01,217
Gosh, he's adorable.

653
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:03,556
If you're going to be that picky about it,

654
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,517
just take them all home with you once we're done.

655
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,886
(The president of the youth association is on a rampage.)

656
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:08,887
Exactly.

657
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:12,026
She's not the fastest worker,

658
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,326
but she's very hardworking.

659
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:15,367
- She's a good person. - Yes, she is.

660
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,737
(Their enthusiastic response got Jae Wook excited.)

661
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:20,913
If that's how you're going to work, leave the knife and go home.

662
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,036
(Laughing)

663
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,576
I'll harvest two bundles on my own.

664
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:24,607
(Stop it.)

665
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,977
(That was a month's worth of teasing from Jae Wook.)

666
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:30,006
Boss, this one's full.

667
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:31,147
Goodness.

668
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,586
I'm on my way.

669
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,316
Be careful.

670
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,317
(They've currently harvested approximately 100kg.)

671
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:39,356
- Jun Myun stopped talking. - Yes.

672
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,387
Jun Myun.

673
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:45,557
(The master of mustard greens is hard at work.)

674
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:48,867
You harvested a lot.

675
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,437
Okay.

676
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:51,996
Okay.

677
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:53,967
(He busily fills up 22kg of mustard greens.)

678
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,607
- How much did we harvest so far? - Goodness.

679
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,177
- We made 90 dollars so far! - Ninety dollars?

680
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:05,877
(There's still a long way to go until we make 150 dollars.)

681
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,186
Jin Young, how's it going?

682
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:11,187
Good.

683
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,657
Gosh, we've come a long way.

684
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:18,296
- We started right here. - Right?

685
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:20,127
We've come all this way.

686
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:21,997
It's as if we're human threshers.

687
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,596
(They've been harvesting mustard greens for 1.5 hours.)

688
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:27,067
It's all good.

689
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,766
Come have some snacks.

690
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:30,906
Goodness.

691
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:31,977
- Snacks. - Really?

692
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:34,847
What an incredible timing.

693
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,117
(They get to enjoy today's snack on the mustard green field.)

694
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:40,847
- Gimbap! - Gimbap!

695
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,286
We used mustard green kimchi.

696
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,817
It's mustard green tuna gimbap.

697
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,286
We've prepared these because we thought you'd need dessert.

698
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,356
- We used mustard greens in them. - They're buttercream donuts...

699
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,717
- Yes. - made with mustard greens?

700
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,426
(With cold barley tea and coastal-grown mugwort latte)

701
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:53,997
- Gosh. - These look so good.

702
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,997
Gosh, the barley tea looks so good.

703
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,197
They all look really tasty.

704
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,796
- This is nice. - Thank you for the food.

705
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:01,317
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

706
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,337
Gosh, this is amazing. It looks so good.

707
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:10,047
(Jung Ah starts with barley tea to quench her thirst.)

708
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,377
(Gosh)

709
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:16,247
(Ji Yeon is chugging the barely tea.)

710
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:19,487
The barley tea is so good.

711
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,556
- I must have been thirsty. - Barley tea is the best.

712
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,533
(Nothing beats cold barley tea when you're thirsty.)

713
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:27,427
(Jae Wook tries the coastal-grown mugwort latte.)

714
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,637
(This is so good.)

715
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,567
(Cheers)

716
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,966
Not cheers. I meant that it's good.

717
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,706
(I see.)

718
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,176
What's wrong with you?

719
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,707
(It was out of habit.)

720
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,116
This is amazing.

721
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:46,716
These look really good.

722
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:48,023
(Meanwhile, Dex is focused on the gimbap.)

723
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:49,216
(What are the ingredients?)

724
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,357
I'll serve them to you.

725
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,186
Here you go.

726
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,387
(Yum)

727
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:57,407
(How good is it that she's reacting like that?)

728
00:27:57,697 --> 00:27:59,978
(Childish Dex, who has an immature palate, takes a bite.)

729
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:01,996
(Gosh)

730
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:03,496
Let me go get something. I'll be back soon.

731
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:06,067
This is the best snack I've ever tasted.

732
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,237
- Really? - Really?

733
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,607
This is the best snack I've ever tasted too.

734
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:11,606
It's really tasty.

735
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,636
(Dex makes strong eye contact with the gimbap...)

736
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,107
(before putting another piece into his mouth.)

737
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:18,517
This gimbap is insane.

738
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:22,086
I think they used stir-fried kimchi and... What else?

739
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:23,967
- I think it's mayonnaise. - Mayonnaise, right?

740
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:29,157
(The flavor of the kimchi made with Dolsan mustard greens is strong.)

741
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:32,396
(Now that she thinks about it...)

742
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:33,657
This place is beautiful.

743
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,866
We didn't even take a look around the field...

744
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,003
because we were busy working.

745
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:38,096
You're right.

746
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:41,037
(They can now take in the scenery around them.)

747
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:43,136
Gosh.

748
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,237
(Behind them is...)

749
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:50,977
(the wide-open South Sea.)

750
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,946
We're right by the sea.

751
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:54,947
- I just noticed it. - Right.

752
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:56,646
I didn't even get to look around.

753
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:57,816
- We've been... - Right.

754
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:59,857
Too focused on moving forward.

755
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:04,357
The crown daisy was grown in strong sea winds.

756
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,656
- "Crown daisy." - It's not crown daisy?

757
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,857
- It's just mustard greens. - It's just mustard greens.

758
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:12,437
Last season, he couldn't remember "Manila clam."

759
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,706
- I kept saying the wrong thing. - He kept getting it wrong.

760
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:15,907
(Our boy didn't change.)

761
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:18,376
He got Manila clam wrong.

762
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:19,913
(They reminisce on those summer memories.)

763
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:21,407
(Fart sound)

764
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:28,186
- Hey, don't get the wrong idea. - I wasn't laughing because of you.

765
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:31,187
- It was the sound of my boots. - I didn't think otherwise.

766
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:32,986
(We have something to tease her about.)

767
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,356
- You fart in front of us, now? - Did you fart?

768
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,357
No.

769
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,038
- We fart in front of each other. - I see.

770
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:38,626
Gosh, that's different.

771
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,397
- It was my boots. - Did you...

772
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,696
- I didn't fart. I feel so wronged. - When she...

773
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,197
She's farting on the field.

774
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,136
There's no way this is not fun.

775
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:49,137
- Where else would we... - I didn't fart.

776
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,137
See her like this?

777
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:51,276
Let's just say you farted.

778
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:53,637
- I didn't fart. I feel so wronged. - That's no fun.

779
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:55,346
Jae Wook, let's just go with it.

780
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:56,676
- We'll just say she did. - Sounds good to me.

781
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:57,717
Let's just say you farted.

782
00:29:58,177 --> 00:29:59,717
(Glaring)

783
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,187
She can't glare at you, so she keeps glaring at me.

784
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,617
She can't do that to you yet, because you're not that close.

785
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:07,727
It's still...

786
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,057
This is really good.

787
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:11,397
What is this again? Mugwort?

788
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:13,226
Yes, coastal-grown mugwort.

789
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:14,296
- It's mugwort... - It's mugwort-infused milk.

790
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:15,966
- Mugwort-infused milk. - It's mugwort-infused milk?

791
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:16,967
It's mugwort-infused milk?

792
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,413
- Give me a little. - It's really good.

793
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:19,497
That's enough.

794
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:21,467
Jun Myun, do you want to try some?

795
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,007
(Making sound)

796
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:26,176
Why are you saying no like that?

797
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:27,607
- No, I... - There was a bug.

798
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,546
- There was a bug. - This is so good.

799
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:30,793
- I mean, - You thought I was saying no?

800
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,653
- you could have just said no. - This is so good.

801
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,986
- There was a bug. - If we freeze this, it's ice cream.

802
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:36,887
(She pours some barley tea...)

803
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:38,817
(and puts the bottle's lid on her cup.)

804
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,886
(What's wrong with her?)

805
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,727
She's acting weird today.

806
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,757
- What are you up to this time? - All right.

807
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,297
Wait.

808
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:49,027
She had to close the bottle, but she held it like this...

809
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,897
and she was doing this as she was talking.

810
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,907
(Thanks to the younger brothers teasing her, )

811
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,466
That was disappointing.

812
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,736
(Jun Myun does not know what to do.)

813
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,007
(Embarrassed)

814
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:01,747
(Sneeze)

815
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:03,277
Jun Myun's dying!

816
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:04,547
Jun Myun!

817
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:06,917
- Jun Myun's dying. - There she goes again.

818
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,486
Breathe.

819
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,086
- Jun Myun, breathe. Okay? - There she goes again. Goodness.

820
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,986
- Okay? Breathe. - It's starting again. Gosh.

821
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:13,057
Jun Myun.

822
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,527
- She's crying again. - Are you crying again?

823
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,726
- Gosh, it's so funny. - Your face is bleeding.

824
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,447
- She's crying again. - She's crying again.

825
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:20,926
All right.

826
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:21,996
(She was born to laugh.)

827
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:23,097
You're crying.

828
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,766
It feels as if you like Jae Wook too much.

829
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,506
- He's jealous. - It's been a while since I saw you,

830
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:28,966
- and you seem to love him. - Dex is jealous.

831
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,647
(I used to be the one who made you laugh.)

832
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,707
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah is deep in thought.)

833
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:37,207
Jung Ah looks so concerned.

834
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:39,016
- This is so funny. - What are you thinking about?

835
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:41,617
I was worrying about my eye wrinkles.

836
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,286
(Jung Ah, the Thinking type, is built differently.)

837
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,717
I laughed so much that my eyes wrinkled.

838
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:47,557
Gosh, that's funny.

839
00:31:48,187 --> 00:31:50,457
(How the Fresh members maintain their youthful faces)

840
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,127
This was fun.

841
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:55,666
- Now. Yes, we should. - Should we get back to work?

842
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,467
How many sacks did we fill?

843
00:31:57,537 --> 00:31:58,596
How many did we fill?

844
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,373
- I'll see how many we did. - I think it was four sacks.

845
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:02,537
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

846
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:06,877
Seven sacks, so that's 105 dollars.

847
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:09,007
Should we set a specific goal?

848
00:32:09,147 --> 00:32:10,207
How many?

849
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:11,816
Let's fill five more.

850
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:12,976
- Five? - Five.

851
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:14,346
- Let's just do five more. - Five more? Sounds good.

852
00:32:14,347 --> 00:32:15,816
- Let's do a little bit more. - Yes, let's.

853
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:16,847
We got this.

854
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:19,756
All right. Let's do this.

855
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,357
(The second half of the workday begins.)

856
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,557
We have to fill 22kg? That's quite a lot.

857
00:32:23,957 --> 00:32:25,997
(His hands are feeling empty.)

858
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:27,666
Let's pick up the pace.

859
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,967
I end up talking since there's nothing else for me to do.

860
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,566
We'll speed up.

861
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,773
(It's now 45 seconds into work, and there are no baskets to empty.)

862
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:35,967
(I'll give you work.)

863
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,037
Goodness. These are sturdy.

864
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:43,077
(Now, let's cut them off.)

865
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,287
(The baskets are filled in no time.)

866
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,217
We're all working at similar speeds.

867
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,287
We all became experts now.

868
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:57,287
Working really gets my adrenaline going.

869
00:32:57,957 --> 00:33:00,457
(The mustard green field is slowly becoming bare.)

870
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,526
Our goal is to fill 12 sacks.

871
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,497
(Keep going until we fill 12 sacks, which is 264kg.)

872
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:08,906
(They currently have 7 sacks, which is 154kg.)

873
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:11,107
Jae Wook, you have to tell us when to stop.

874
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,277
We have three more to go now.

875
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:16,007
(They currently have 9 sacks, which is 198kg.)

876
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,417
Okay.

877
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:19,216
We're almost there.

878
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,347
(Let's fill up 3 more sacks. That's only 66kg.)

879
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:23,216
(Just then, )

880
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:26,487
(Dex suddenly picks up the pace.)

881
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,687
(Staring)

882
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:31,897
Why are you suddenly going full speed?

883
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:34,596
I found a better method that works for me.

884
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,003
Why are you suddenly going full speed?

885
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:37,866
- I found a better way... - You want to get it over with?

886
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:38,937
No.

887
00:33:39,337 --> 00:33:40,436
I mean,

888
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,843
- it should end sooner than later. - You want to get it over with.

889
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,353
I can tell from your sudden burst of energy.

890
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,707
(What's the method Dex came up with?)

891
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:49,147
(Getting in position)

892
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,317
(He cuts everything without sorting them out.)

893
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:59,457
(One shot, one kill)

894
00:33:59,717 --> 00:34:01,357
(Machine sounds)

895
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,527
(Machine sounds)

896
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:08,897
(He's like a human chainsaw.)

897
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:13,267
(Once there's a huge pile of mustard greens, )

898
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,807
(he quickly sorts through them...)

899
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,837
(and throws them in all at once.)

900
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:22,976
I'm in serious work mode.

901
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,346
I'm full-on working with my mouth shut.

902
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:25,747
(This is Dex in serious work mode.)

903
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:28,987
Dex is like...

904
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:30,817
He's in overdrive.

905
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:32,886
- Right? - Right now,

906
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,686
he's speeding up because he wants to get this over with.

907
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:36,567
(He's in overdrive in the mustard green field.)

908
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:39,097
(There are so many that...)

909
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,167
(he has to move twice to put them away.)

910
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:43,997
I'm having fun right now.

911
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:46,997
I found the way!

912
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:50,836
Having know-how always makes work more fun.

913
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:51,837
That's right.

914
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:54,706
(The downside to being a human chainsaw)

915
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:55,746
Gosh, my back.

916
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:58,447
(Lower back pain)

917
00:34:58,577 --> 00:34:59,577
(Gosh)

918
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:00,846
Is your back pain that bad?

919
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:03,517
- It's... - Dex, you should stop.

920
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,617
You look exhausted.

921
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,057
No, I'm not. I'll show you.

922
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,057
I don't even need this.

923
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:14,627
Removing gear. I don't need you.

924
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:16,496
You're getting in my way.

925
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,667
(Tossing it)

926
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,436
(He's now much lighter...)

927
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,467
(and much stronger as a human chainsaw.)

928
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:26,677
(If Dex is going that hard, )

929
00:35:27,477 --> 00:35:30,207
(I can't just sit back.)

930
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,717
(Motor-hands and the human chainsaw)

931
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,887
Goodness, you got a lot done.

932
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,057
We won't take long. We're almost done.

933
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:41,157
Gosh, we did so much.

934
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:44,317
Soon, we'll be close enough to give the camera a high-five.

935
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:48,227
How many do we have now, Jae Wook?

936
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:54,266
(With 11 sacks filled, they've reached a total of 242kg.)

937
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:57,267
(Their goal is 264kg.)

938
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,776
This is your 13th sack.

939
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:00,336
We have 13 sacks, including this one?

940
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,177
- We need more. - We need more?

941
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,776
Let's finish off by filling up that one.

942
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,153
(They need an extra 7kg to fill the 13th sack.)

943
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:06,217
You guys...

944
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,823
- can rest now. I'll finish it up. - Let's wrap it up.

945
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,547
- Really? - No.

946
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:12,517
Jun Myun can rest.

947
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:14,926
(Happy)

948
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,387
Not you. Sit back down.

949
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,807
I see you've gotten comfortable around me.

950
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:22,807
I still can't meet your eyes, though.

951
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:27,167
(I'll get back to work since I feel embarrassed.)

952
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:29,337
(In a daze)

953
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,637
- He's like a machine. - What's wrong with him?

954
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,476
(Groaning)

955
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,977
He does have a tendency to exaggerate.

956
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:38,977
Gosh, are you seeing this?

957
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,287
(You're doing good, Dex.)

958
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:45,087
(Exaggerating is fine, but...)

959
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:46,886
Who's going to clean these up?

960
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:48,927
My knife broke.

961
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,056
(His field knife broke in half.)

962
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,469
(Exaggerating is fine, but...)

963
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,139
Who's going to clean these up?

964
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,210
My knife broke.

965
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,109
(His field knife broke in half.)

966
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,409
- Is this a sign that I should stop? - You can stop working now.

967
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,956
You can stop working now. I'll clean these up.

968
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,550
(Handing her knife over to Dex)

969
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,620
Your knife broke?

970
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
You just handed yours over to me so casually.

971
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,920
- That was smooth. - Right.

972
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,719
We harvested a lot. Don't you agree?

973
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,860
- We cut off everything here. - We did harvest a lot.

974
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,080
Are we still far from filling it?

975
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,460
We're now at 19kg.

976
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,900
Okay. That won't take long.

977
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,500
(The human chainsaw keeps cutting, )

978
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,340
(while Jung Ah and Jae Wook sort them out and clean up.)

979
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,110
(They're nearing the end of the mustard green harvest.)

980
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,810
- Gosh, you're doing a good job. - I'm doing good, aren't I?

981
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,449
- Goodness, you're good. - Ma'am! How am I doing?

982
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,450
You're doing a good job.

983
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,720
- Ma'am! - He's delivering them to me.

984
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Ma'am!

985
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,520
- Ma'am! - You're doing great.

986
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,289
- You should take a break. - You're the best.

987
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,959
- I'll do all the work for you. - You're doing great.

988
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,030
Ma'am!

989
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,859
- Stop. That's 20kg. - 20kg?

990
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
We got 20kg.

991
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
We have 20kg?

992
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:58,069
(I gave it everything I had.)

993
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,970
- You did it wrong. - What?

994
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,569
You kept encouraging me.

995
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,039
Why would you just now tell me I did it wrong?

996
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,539
(Getting on his knees)

997
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,480
- How would I feel? - I didn't encourage you.

998
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,709
You have to make sure no one else has to clean after you.

999
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,750
You didn't do a clean job.

1000
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,849
(Sighing)

1001
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,020
I'm so sad, I want to go home now.

1002
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,590
The one who packed the sacks did the best job.

1003
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,389
He followed after him to pack the sacks.

1004
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,790
(Falling on his knees)

1005
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,690
Did you just compliment Jae Wook?

1006
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,900
- Ma'am. - What?

1007
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,150
Just because he's better looking than I am,

1008
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,140
- you can't treat us differently. - That's not...

1009
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,869
When I was his age, I was good-looking too,

1010
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,970
at least compared to now.

1011
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,840
- Ma'am! - Yes?

1012
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,610
My face was at its prime four years ago.

1013
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,050
Ma'am, you're making me leave with a broken heart.

1014
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,620
(Pouting)

1015
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,589
Since you did everything, you should finish it off, Jae Wook.

1016
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,666
(Handsome Jae Wook is tying up the final 22kg sack.)

1017
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,890
Show us what you've got, Handsome Jae Wook!

1018
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,130
(Laughing)

1019
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,230
I'm definitely not jealous.

1020
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,929
(The mustard green harvest is over.)

1021
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,900
We're done!

1022
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,409
- We harvested a lot. - Good job, everyone.

1023
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,440
We're done.

1024
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,360
(The field looked like this when they began working.)

1025
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,680
We cut off this much.

1026
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
We filled 13 sacks.

1027
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:18,956
(The empty space is much wider now.)

1028
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,149
Thank you for your hard work.

1029
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,179
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

1030
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,449
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1031
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,266
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1032
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,489
Nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six...

1033
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,889
- 195 dollars. - 195 dollars?

1034
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,890
- That's brilliant. - Thank you. We all did great.

1035
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,199
These are some of the mustard greens you harvested today.

1036
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,299
And the ladies handmade this.

1037
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,529
- It's aged mustard green kimchi. - Thank you so much.

1038
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,829
- Aged kimchi? - Yes, enjoy.

1039
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,899
- Thank you. - You all did such a great job.

1040
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,739
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1041
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,486
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food!

1042
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,510
Thank you!

1043
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,280
Okay.

1044
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,050
(Today, the five Fresh members worked hard and harvested...)

1045
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,850
(a total of 286kg of Yeosu Dolsan mustard greens.)

1046
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,420
(With the freshness of Yeosu's spring sea still lingering on them, )

1047
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,830
(they have been delivered across the whole country.)

1048
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,599
Let's buy the meat, first.

1049
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
(The five members stopped by the butcher shop on their way home.)

1050
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:17,040
Should we buy 1.8kg of meat?

1051
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Did you say 1.8kg?

1052
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,670
- Hello, - Hello.

1053
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:21,069
We're here to buy pork belly.

1054
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,240
Do you need pork belly?

1055
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,910
- Yes, we want to grill it. - Hello.

1056
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,910
How much do you want?

1057
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,620
Five of us will be eating, so maybe 1.8kg?

1058
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,520
No way. I can eat 600g by myself.

1059
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,180
You eat 600g of pork belly by yourself?

1060
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,570
(Jun Myun is hit with a wave of embarrassment.)

1061
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,200
I think we'll need at least 2.4kg.

1062
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,280
- We can put some in the stew. - That's a good idea.

1063
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,899
(The stew?)

1064
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,646
You said you were going to use some of it for the stew.

1065
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,100
Then we need 3kg.

1066
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,310
(Speechless)

1067
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:57,310
- Right. - Just give us everything you got.

1068
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,250
- That's 600g per person. - Right.

1069
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,480
Jun Myun said she could eat it all.

1070
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,079
I usually eat 600g by myself too.

1071
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,419
(A huge pile of pork belly)

1072
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,389
Grilling these on the cauldron lid would be amazing.

1073
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,870
- Of course. That is without saying. - It would be incredible.

1074
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,390
(Now, they head home with the generous amount of meat!)

1075
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:15,230
- I'll drive as fast as I can. - Okay, let's go.

1076
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,829
We bought enough for tomorrow, right?

1077
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,169
We bought enough for the morning. We can make more money tomorrow.

1078
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,240
Nice.

1079
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,039
Jung Ah, isn't this our first time staying this close to the sea?

1080
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
It is.

1081
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,419
(They returned to the Fresh house.)

1082
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,979
- Thank you for driving. - You're welcome.

1083
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,460
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you.

1084
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,790
Leave everything here. I think we'll have to prep them here.

1085
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,090
- Outside. - Okay.

1086
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,489
(Staring)

1087
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,989
(Amazed)

1088
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,559
Jin Young also has a "J" in his name.

1089
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,799
Everyone here has a "J" in their names.

1090
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
- Really? - You're right.

1091
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:51,969
Right, Jin Young has a "J."

1092
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,430
- I have one too. - Yes.

1093
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,969
(Jung Ah, Jun Myun, Ji Yeon, Jae Wook, Jin Young)

1094
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,930
(Jung Ah, Jun Myun, Ji Yeon, Jae Wook, Jin Young)

1095
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,340
(Gosh)

1096
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,610
(Dex must really like them, judging by how quickly he tries them on.)

1097
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,920
(Under the cozy afternoon sun, )

1098
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,860
I can prep and marinate the mustard greens by myself.

1099
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,460
You guys should get some rest.

1100
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,200
(Jung Ah is about to prep the mustard greens they harvested.)

1101
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,800
(Dex watches Jung Ah while she's working.)

1102
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,270
(Staring)

1103
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,240
(He then heads to the shed...)

1104
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,750
(and brings Jung Ah a strainer without her asking.)

1105
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,540
Go lie down.

1106
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,209
That means I should stand here, right?

1107
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,250
No, go lie down.

1108
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,179
I'll feel bad if you keep standing here.

1109
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,449
- You want me to lie face down? - You're the guest.

1110
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,649
You want me to lie here face down,

1111
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,089
- until you're done, right? - No, I don't.

1112
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,036
(It's been a while since Childish Dex teased Jung Ah.)

1113
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,620
Should I go rinse these in the kitchen?

1114
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,329
- Which one? - The scallions?

1115
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,659
- You want to? Go ahead. - Yes.

1116
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,276
(Jung Ah is quick to hand them off to Dex.)

1117
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,530
(Dex washes the scallions thoroughly in the kitchen.)

1118
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,639
- They're nice and clean. - All right.

1119
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,946
(The cleaned scallions are delivered back to Jung Ah.)

1120
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,110
- Thank you so much. - You're welcome.

1121
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,340
(Meanwhile, Ji Yeon quickly washed up.)

1122
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,110
Back in my day, I didn't get to have alone time like that.

1123
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,870
I guess things are different now.

1124
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,250
- What? - Nothing.

1125
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,049
Eun Jin and I used to be on standby like this.

1126
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,436
We had our eyes on you the whole time.

1127
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,860
(Laughing)

1128
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,489
(Speaking of which...)

1129
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,041
Do you prefer the members from Season 1 or Season 2?

1130
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:29,670
(Speaking of which...)

1131
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:32,281
Do you prefer the members from Season 1 or Season 2?

1132
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:36,411
Are you asking me that?

1133
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,881
(Somehow curious)

1134
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:41,791
(Laughing)

1135
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,920
- Which one? - I'll text you.

1136
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,290
- Will you? - It'll be a long story.

1137
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,361
Do you have a lot to say?

1138
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:50,131
It doesn't sound good. I'm nervous.

1139
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:54,001
The members from Season One seem to be less preferable.

1140
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:58,000
I think she became more interested in Jae Wook.

1141
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,271
(Being jealous of Jae Wook)

1142
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,241
- Jun Myun. - Yes.

1143
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,571
Do you prefer the members from Season 1 or Season 2?

1144
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:05,941
You.

1145
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:07,811
(Laughing)

1146
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:09,851
(Jun Myun is the best.)

1147
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:11,981
What's wrong with him?

1148
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:15,151
(Just leave him alone.)

1149
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,821
(After washing off the sweat shed in the mustard greens field)

1150
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,531
(The younger ones gather outside.)

1151
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,931
You can't cook, can you?

1152
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,461
(At a loss for words)

1153
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:26,501
I watched it all. I know you can't cook.

1154
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,501
What did you watch?

1155
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:31,000
I watched you cook in the last season.

1156
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,001
They liked the instant jjajang ramen I cooked, though.

1157
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:35,710
I can cook instant jjajang ramen well.

1158
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,470
Why don't we cook it this evening, then?

1159
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:39,631
Do you have your secret to cook instant jjajang ramen?

1160
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:41,550
- I have. - What is it?

1161
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:42,650
(Do I have to tell her that?)

1162
00:44:42,651 --> 00:44:45,097
The key to cooking it well is controlling the amount of water.

1163
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:48,151
The key to cooking it well is controlling the heat.

1164
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,550
(Water versus Heat)

1165
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:50,721
Goodness.

1166
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:53,921
(I don't want to see it.)

1167
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,131
It's a persimmon tree.

1168
00:44:57,131 --> 00:45:00,230
- Controlling the heat? - Controlling the amount of water...

1169
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,070
is just a basic,

1170
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:04,570
and it's something a beginner would think.

1171
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:07,500
For me, controlling the heat is such a simple thing to do.

1172
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:08,610
(What would it be so hard about that?)

1173
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:10,170
- The amount of water... - Controlling the heat is...

1174
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:11,531
- is in milliliters. - about fire.

1175
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:13,341
- Jae Wook. Can I... - Yes.

1176
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,587
- He doesn't pay attention to us. - Where do I put this?

1177
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:16,810
- Put it here. - Jung Ah.

1178
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:19,380
- Yes. Today? - We'll cook instant jjajang ramen.

1179
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:20,820
Who do you think will cook it better?

1180
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,790
- Dex. - Exactly.

1181
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:24,650
(Disappointed)

1182
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:26,591
She didn't even give it a thought.

1183
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:28,731
You can't.

1184
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:30,060
(Annoyed)

1185
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,260
Then, just try it.

1186
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,830
- She can make a good tteokboki. - Really?

1187
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,470
I'm really good at cooking with instant food.

1188
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,071
(Will they have the Jjajang Battle?)

1189
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,641
What do we have?

1190
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:43,471
- This time... - Music?

1191
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,640
- Do we play a vinyl record? - Sure.

1192
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:46,681
I'd like that.

1193
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,651
After listening to this song, I'll start to work.

1194
00:45:56,651 --> 00:45:58,891
The beautiful weather makes everything feel so peaceful.

1195
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:01,191
Hit it gently.

1196
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:02,531
Gently and smoothly.

1197
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:05,201
That's it. Hit it gently. Smoothly.

1198
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,401
Gently.

1199
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,271
Gently.

1200
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,671
I'm sorry.

1201
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,641
The weather is more beautiful than I expected.

1202
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,880
- I'm hungry. - Jung Ah. He's hungry.

1203
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:21,281
- We should hurry to cook. - Okay.

1204
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:23,511
I'm hungry.

1205
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:26,152
(The sun has set, and it's time for the villagers to cook dinner.)

1206
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:30,620
Just day to day,

1207
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,191
I get vegetables from the garden.

1208
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,731
(Boiling Dolsan mustard greens)

1209
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,130
(Mixing it with homemade seasoned doenjang)

1210
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:38,931
Let it age like this.

1211
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,630
The aroma of mustard green...

1212
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,971
is so appealing.

1213
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:45,471
(Mustard green in seasoned doenjang)

1214
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:48,510
Asian paddle crabs are a specialty here.

1215
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:50,911
(Adding the seasoning generously)

1216
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:52,840
Spread the seasoning on the crabs.

1217
00:46:52,841 --> 00:46:54,921
(Mixing them thoroughly to let the seasoning absorb)

1218
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:56,251
The flesh is still fresh.

1219
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:58,521
Once you start to eat it, you want it more.

1220
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:01,451
Spicy raw Asian paddle crabs.

1221
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:05,360
(Mustard green in seasoned doenjang)

1222
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:06,420
(Spicy raw Asian paddle crabs, Sea bass soup)

1223
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,661
(Kim Yeon Ja's table with dishes from the sea in Yeosu.)

1224
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,931
(The Fresh members' dinner menu is...)

1225
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:14,301
Dinner is grilled pork belly.

1226
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,870
When we grill pork belly,

1227
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:19,640
we'll also grill water parsley, bracken,

1228
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:21,710
and Jun Myun's kimchi.

1229
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:23,187
(With aged kimchi and scallion kimchi)

1230

(Pork belly on a big cauldron lid)

1232
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:29,011
The owner gave us some aged mustard green kimchi.

1233
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:32,781
I'll make kimchi jjigae with it and pork.

1234
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:36,751
(Okay! Let's start.)

1235

(Fully aged mustard green kimchi in deep green color)

1241
00:47:58,411 --> 00:47:59,981
- Do you want to try it? - Can I?

1242
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,440
It's aged kimchi.

1243
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:02,587
(First time trying aged mustard green kimchi)

1244
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,551
(Slurping it)

1245

(Surprising)

1246
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:06,721
How is it?

1247
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:07,780
(Great!)

1248
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:10,721
(Jun Myun is also tasting it.)

1249
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,491
(Surprising)

1250
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,461
This kimchi is so good.

1251
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:17,137
- Oh, my gosh. - The mustard green kimchi.

1252
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:19,437
- That looks so good. - Jung Ah, would you like to try it?

1253
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:20,530
(Heading to taste it without hesitation)

1254
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,000

(Great!)

1260
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:31,881
It'll be really tasty.

1261
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:34,041
Is it good?

1262
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:35,850
- So good. - "So good?"

1263
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:36,851
It's so tasty.

1264
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:40,651
(We never get enough of it when it's so good.)

(It's time for Dex to work.)

1275
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,341
Please cut the pork belly.

1276
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,181
- It's for jjigae. Do you get it? - Yes.

1277
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,181
(Let's cut the pork belly.)

1278
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:14,851
How much do you need?

1279
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:16,991
About three strips?

1280
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:18,721
Three strips? Let's do four strips.

1281
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:19,891
Okay.

1282
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:21,520
(The experienced member who is familiar with large portions)

(Jun Myun with a big handmade tofu)

1284
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,301
Just do it like this.

(Adding it to the jjigae)

1286
00:49:28,701 --> 00:49:30,100

(Putting it in)

1288
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:36,311
(Adding most of the block)

1289
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:42,380
Dex, I don't usually add tofu to the kimchi jjigae.

1290
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:43,411
Really?

1291
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:45,281
I'm adding it for you.

1292
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:48,591
It's a bit different with lots of tofu. For Dex.

1293
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:53,061
(Adding pork as well)

1294
00:49:57,391 --> 00:50:00,631
(Cutting four strips of pork belly nicely.)

1295
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:04,131
(Focusing)

1296
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,840
(The more meat, the better.)

1297
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,540
- Did you cut the pork? - Yes.

1298
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,571
Can you put it into this?

1299
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:10,471
Put them all.

1300
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:11,512
(Pork belly is coming in.)

1301
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,981
(Piles of meat on the piles of tofu)

1302
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:17,810
I'm a bit shocked.

1303
00:50:17,811 --> 00:50:18,971
(A bit shocking amount of it)

1304
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,580
(Adding salted shrimp)

1305
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,621
Just add it.

1306
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,961
(Now, it's to season it. Adding sugar)

1307
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:29,061
(Minced garlic, tuna fish sauce, soy sauce, water)

1308
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:31,961
(Lastly, sprinkling chili powder)

1309
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:33,561
It looks good.

1310
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:35,931
Don't you think you put too much in?

1311
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:37,131
Do you think so?

1312
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:38,901
(We can switch it to a bigger pot.)

1313
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,541
I think we have to move it here.

1314
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,241
Look at that.

1315
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:47,241
It looks amazing.

1316
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:48,750
(How delicious will it be?)

1317
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:50,257
Should the kimchi be placed at the bottom of the pot?

1318
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,881
- It's fine as it'll boil, right? - Yes.

1319
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:54,380
The aroma of mustard green kimchi is good.

1320
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:55,920
Yes, because it's well-aged.

1321
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,460
I like its pungent aroma.

1322
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:59,560
(Aged mustard green kimchi with a pungent aroma)

1323
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:02,261
I've never had mustard green kimchi jjigae.

1324
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,830
It'll be my first time as well.

1325
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:04,960
(How will mustard green kimchi jjigae taste?)

1326
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,101
I wonder how it will taste with that kimchi.

1327
00:51:08,471 --> 00:51:09,600
I just put everything in at once.

1328
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:10,601
(Howling)

1329
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:13,770
What was that sound?

1330
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,371
(I just heard howling.)

1331
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:18,481
- Didn't you just howl? - I just like the smell of kimchi.

1332
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:22,581
This aged kimchi has a wonderful aroma.

1333
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:25,281

1334
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:27,851
This is great.

(Aged kimchi to pair with pork belly on a big cauldron lid)

1336
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,291
This is insane.

1337
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:36,630
Jung Ah, this aged kimchi smells so good.

1338
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:37,890
It smells really tasty.

1339
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:39,437
It'll taste amazing when it's grilled...

1340
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:40,631
in the fat of pork belly.

1341
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:43,930
Scallion kimchi as well.

1342
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,317
(Adding scallion kimchi from Boryeong)

1343
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:48,301
Jung Ah, we have so many different types of kimchi.

1344
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:50,910
- I know. - It's like a kimchi festival.

1345
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,010
- We have a kimchi festival. - We have so much of it.

1346
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,531
- I know. - We happened to save a lot.

1347
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:58,721
(Foodie Ji Yeon won't miss trying it.)

1348
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,021
Scallion kimchi is so good.

1349
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:07,161
We saved a lot of kimchi.

1350
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,760

1355
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:22,371
Pickled victory onion looks really tasty.

1356
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:24,871
(Pickled victory onion)

1357
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:28,311
(Victory onion that they picked in Boryeong)

1358
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,521
(It was pickled with Jung Ah's seasoning.)

1359
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:34,450
I think it aged well.

1360
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,267
(The Fresh members' simple pickled victory onion)

1361
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,720
It looks really tasty.

1362
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,461
(We've waited for today for a month.)

1363
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:43,091
(Putting it on a plate generously)

1364
00:52:44,131 --> 00:52:45,160
(All the side dishes to grill have been prepared.)

1365

Now, it's time for the firewood.

1366
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,300
It's showtime for firewood.

1367

(Dex brings the firewood, and...)

1369
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,841
(Jae Wook brings the bricks.)

1370
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:01,241
(Jae Wook places the bricks near the fire pit.)

1371
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:05,011
(They're going to have dinner around the fire pit.)

1372
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:08,180
(Worrying if the fire might be too hot for the sisters)

1373
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:12,420
(Building the brick wall in a V-shape)

1374
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:14,361
(Delivering the bricks)

1375
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:16,761
- I'll bring them for you. - I can...

1376
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,961
I'll bring them for you.

1377
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:21,971
Could you pile them to block the heat?

1378
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,530
To block the heat?

1379
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:25,700
(Piling bricks as Jae Wook did)

1380
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:29,141
(Feeling pleased as she looks at them working together)

1381
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,551
Wouldn't it be too hot for the person standing here?

1382
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:35,381
(The strong wall that Dex and Jae Wook piled)

1383
00:53:35,981 --> 00:53:37,180
It feels reassuring...

1384
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:40,481
- to watch them pile the bricks. - Indeed.

1385
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,820
(Our brothers are so reliable.)

1386
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:42,951
I feel so reassured.

1387
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:45,820
(Building the wall by the fire pit)

1388
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:46,861
Okay.

1389
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,420
Let's bring the cauldron lid.

1390
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:49,791
(Let's bring the cauldron lid.)

1391
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:52,931
Okay.

1392
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:54,461
Nice.

1393
00:53:55,771 --> 00:53:59,501
(The mustard green kimchi jjigae is boiling next to it.)

1394
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:06,381
(A rich, red flavor packed with hearty ingredients)

1395
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:09,551
The kimchi jjigae looks so good.

1396
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,481
It looks really good.

1397
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:14,920
It must be really good.

1398
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,251
- The jjigae? - Yes.

1399
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,791
What's with that face?

1400
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:21,691
I'm sure it'll be one of the best.

1401
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:23,691
It won't be that good.

1402
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:29,031
It'll be more flavorful as the fat from the pork boils.

1403
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:31,940
- Should I start to grill meat? - Sure.

1404
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:33,841
Put the meat on.

1405
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,371

1409

It's amazing you're coating it.

00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:54,161
(The large cauldron lid glistens with the coating of fat.)

1411
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,561
Let's start it.

1412
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:57,231
- Shall we? - Yes.

1413
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,001

(Time for water parsley and bracken to join)

1422
00:55:33,861 --> 00:55:35,700
We're having a meat party today.

(It's cooking beautifully.)

1429
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:24,711
(Is it meat or art?)

1430
00:56:25,651 --> 00:56:29,721
(The pork belly is nicely cooked to a golden-brown.)

1431
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:32,621
You're really good at grilling.

1432
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:34,021
None of it is burned.

1433
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:38,161

- You're really good at grilling. - He is indeed.

1438
00:56:53,011 --> 00:56:54,411
He's mastery.

1439
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:56,380
He once worked part-time at a Korean BBQ restaurant.

1440
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:57,450
- Did he? - Yes.

1441
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:58,797
(Showing off his skill as a former part-timer)

1442
00:56:58,821 --> 00:57:00,980
We should take out water parsley quickly after cooking slightly.

1443
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:03,301
(Taking out water parsley and bracken before it overcooks)

1444

It feels like it happened in the blink of an eye.

1450
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,370
(Jung Ah is preparing rice to eat together.)

1451
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:24,511
Up to the marked point.

1452
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:27,440

1453
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:31,111

(Everyone is working hard for a delicious dinner.)

1460
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,470
Since it got a bit chilly,

1461
00:57:58,471 --> 00:57:59,880
- this fire pit feels nice. - It feels so good.

1462
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:01,541
- It's so good. - It's perfect.

1463
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,881

(Shattering)

1468
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:11,491
- What's wrong with her? - Excuse me?

1469
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,321
I can't work with her.

1470
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,390
Oh my gosh. What's wrong with her?

1471
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:19,130
I feel like I got one more Jae Wook.

1472
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:20,431
I'm so stressed.

1473
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:22,230
Oh, my gosh.

It's tasty. Do you have a lot of it?

1582
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:31,570
- If there's a leftover... - Take some home.

1583
01:03:31,571 --> 01:03:34,111
- May I take some home? - Pack some for him.

1584
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,127
- Is there a lot? - Jin Young, take some home.

1585
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,881
- Thank you. - Yes.

1586
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,520
(I'm happy...)

1587
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:44,451
(when I make a wrap.)

1588
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,691
(She fills her mouth with a big wrap.)

1589
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:54,561
(It makes her eyes go wide.)

1590
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:57,801
(Happiness level to its max)

1591
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,741
It's tasty.

1592
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:01,171
- It's so tasty. - Yes.

1593
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,840
Jun Myun, the jjigae is so tasty.

1594
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,341
- Is the jjigae tasty? - It's tasty.

1595
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,441
Isn't it spicy?

1596
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:08,680
(The mustard green kimchi jjigae with pork...)

1597
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:10,321
(cuts down the greasiness of pork belly.)

1598
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:12,621
The mustard green kimchi did all the work.

1599
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:14,851
- It's spicy in a tasty way. - Yes.

1600
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,621
(He takes a big chunk of the aged mustard green kimchi.)

1601
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:23,361
(I'll eat the tender meat as well.)

1602
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:26,431
(It's tasty.)

1603
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,701
(Impressed)

1604
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:33,571
(Is the jjigae that tasty?)

1605
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:38,570
(Nodding)

1606
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:40,341
- Goodness. - Eat some more.

1607
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,550
The jjigae is so tasty, Jun Myun.

1608
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:44,087
(Mustard green kimchi and pork belly make it the most flavorful dish.)

1609
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:46,351
(Happy)

1610
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:48,681
(Rice goes down easily with the tasty jjigae.)

1611
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,151
- It's brown rice, right? - Yes.

1612
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,791
For our health, we prepared the 100-percent multigrain rice.

1613
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:58,061
You know,

1614
01:04:58,062 --> 01:04:59,330
(Savoring the rice)

1615
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:01,361
the texture is soft, not rough.

1616
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,630
Multigrain rice fills you up.

1617
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:07,100
I only eat multigrain rice when I look after my health.

1618
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:08,101
That's right.

1619
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:10,611
I like how it tastes more luxurious than plain white rice.

1620
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:17,751
(The soft multigrain rice goes well with pork belly.)

1621
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,550
- This is insane. The rice... - It's so tasty.

1622
01:05:19,551 --> 01:05:20,871
- is so tasty. - Rice and jjigae.

1623
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:25,690
(Drinking the rice)

1624
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:27,420
Look. I'm done already.

1625
01:05:27,421 --> 01:05:29,261
(Did he finish the bowl already?)

1626
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:30,360
Oh, my.

1627
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:32,661
(Dex eats a lot whenever he visits Fresh off the Sea.)

1628
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:35,381
- Thank goodness. - It's outstanding.

1629
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:40,341
(Since everyone is eating well, he refills the meat.)

1630
01:05:41,001 --> 01:05:42,500
(Staring)

1631
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:43,971
Jae Wook, shall I make you a wrap?

1632
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,541
A wrap? It's okay.

1633
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:47,881
I'm a guest. Please take care of me.

1634
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,451
- Excuse me? I'm a guest. - What?

1635
01:05:50,751 --> 01:05:53,051
They say that blood is thicker than water.

1636
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,121
Ahn Eun Jin!

1637
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:58,191
- Ask Eun Jin to make it. - Ahn Eun Jin, where are you?

1638
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:00,691
Ahn Eun Jin, where are you?

1639
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:04,491
(I miss you so much today, Ahn Eun Jin.)

1640
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,431
Eat some rice.

1641
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:11,030
What? Jun Myun, I was asking her to make me a wrap.

1642
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:12,400
Eat some rice.

1643
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,970
I'm on my second bowl. I'm eating so much rice.

1644
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,041
Hurry up and eat meat.

1645
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:18,641
Ahn Eun Jin!

1646
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:22,441
(I want a wrap too.)

1647
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:25,611
(Looking at the grill reminds them of something.)

1648
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:28,181
- Shall we fry some rice? - What?

1649
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:30,021
- Shall we fry some rice? - Shall we?

1650
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:31,827
Shall I bring dried laver flakes?

1651
01:06:31,851 --> 01:06:33,560
That'll be great. Sesame oil will be nice too.

1652
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:34,590
- I'll bring them. - Okay.

1653
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:35,990
(The Fresh members are addicted to fried rice.)

1654
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,131
Fried rice is insane.

1655
01:06:37,491 --> 01:06:38,561
Give me the rice.

1656
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:41,961
(Adding small pork belly pieces as toppings)

1657
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,101
Three should be enough, right?

1658
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:47,241
(Aged kimchi)

1659
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:48,271
It's nice.

1660
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,241
(Scallion kimchi gets added as well.)

1661
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,980
(Then dried laver flakes get sprinkled.)

1662
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:55,511
- A dollop of sesame oil. - Yes.

1663
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:57,151
Gosh, this is...

1664
01:06:57,751 --> 01:06:59,651
- This is insane. - Just a dollop.

1665
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:01,451
This is cheating.

1666
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,090
There is already some oil.

1667
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:04,651
It's bound to be tasty.

1668
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:06,521
This is cheating.

1669
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:10,161
(Working hard)

1670
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:13,760
Jung Ah, shall we add more water parsley?

1671
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:16,471
- What? Water parsley is nice. - That's a good idea.

1672
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:18,901
- It gives off an aroma. - Right.

1673
01:07:19,471 --> 01:07:21,171
(Then we need scissors.)

1674
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,671
- Let's add them. - Where...

1675
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,271
- are the scissors? - Like that?

1676
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:26,811
(Whole water parsley)

1677
01:07:26,812 --> 01:07:28,281
- That's too much. - Scissors.

1678
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:30,980
(Did I make a mistake)

1679
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:32,011
For goodness' sake.

1680
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,180
(She hurriedly saves the water parsley.)

1681
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,181
- I mean... - Scissors.

1682
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:35,780
They aren't much once they get cooked.

1683
01:07:35,781 --> 01:07:37,090
We need scissors.

1684
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:38,751
We usually cut them into smaller pieces.

1685
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:42,991
Gosh, Jun Myun, you startled me so much.

1686
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:48,200
(Embarrassed)

1687
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,601
It was so cute.

1688
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:53,351
- It looks delicious. - It looks delicious.

1689
01:07:53,441 --> 01:07:54,940
- Goodness. Jung Ah. - Yes?

1690
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:56,740
- It looks delicious. - Jung Ah's super strength show.

1691
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:59,087
(The fried rice becomes complete with Jung Ah's super strength show.)

1692
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:01,781
Isn't it done? Let's take it off the heat.

1693
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,710
- Scorched rice? - Yes, it should be a bit scorched.

1694
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:06,831
(The rice has been fried well in the pork belly fat.)

1695
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:09,281
Goodness. Thank you.

1696
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:13,791
- Here. - This is it.

1697
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,321
It looks tasty.

1698
01:08:16,991 --> 01:08:20,431
It looks amazing.

1699
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:25,471
(He finally gets to try it.)

1700
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:27,971
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

1701
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:30,911
Is it tasty?

1702
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,341
- Is it tasty? - It's so tasty.

1703
01:08:34,441 --> 01:08:36,551
(She blows on the rice.)

1704
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:37,911
(Eating)

1705
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:40,221
(The fried rice is hot and freshly made.)

1706
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:41,450
It's tasty.

1707
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,421
(Humming in approval)

1708
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:45,421
Jae Wook, it's tasty.

1709
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:51,731
(They can't stop eating the tasty fried rice.)

1710
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:57,471
(Impressed)

1711
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,440
You couldn't eat much because you were cooking. Thanks.

1712
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:01,641
(It's hot.)

1713
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,611
We would've regretted it if we hadn't made fried rice.

1714
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,241
It's so tasty.

1715
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:09,981
We're eating it without a word.

1716
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:12,110
It's so tasty.

1717
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:13,911
- Is it tasty? - Jae Wook, you should eat it.

1718
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:15,351
It's tasty.

1719
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:17,490
It's so tasty.

1720
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,491
(Fried rice is the perfect way to wrap up a meal.)

1721
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:21,261
What are you doing tomorrow?

1722
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:24,030
- Right. What are we doing tomorrow? - What are we doing tomorrow?

1723
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:25,231
(What are we doing tomorrow?)

1724
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:30,800
You guys were supposed to get divided up into two teams...

1725
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:32,601
for two types of labor.

1726
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:36,941
But because of the condition of the sea,

1727
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:40,011
- one of them got canceled, so... - Yes.

1728
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,350
Only one team will do labor tomorrow.

1729
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:44,351
What?

1730
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:47,221
- That means only two will work. - Yes.

1731
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:51,091
(Only two?)

1732
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,781
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

1733
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:55,091
Let's play a fair game.

1734
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,291
(In that case)

1735
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,561
I'll make something.

1736
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,031
Everyone,

1737
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,170
(Thus began Dex's draw for labor.)

1738
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:05,571
please wait.

1739
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:08,271
The length is important.

1740
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:11,611
Won't you tell us what we'll work on?

1741
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:13,991
It's one of the ingredients we ate today, right?

1742
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,211
It's one of the ingredients you ate today.

1743
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:18,550
(It's one of the ingredients we ate today?)

1744
01:10:18,551 --> 01:10:19,951
- What... - Grey mullet?

1745
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,521
(The delicacy of the Yeosu sea in May)

1746
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:25,151
(Yeosu's grey mullets are known to be strong.)

1747
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:28,490
(Welcome.)

1748
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,260
- Grey mullet? - Grey mullet.

1749
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:31,567
(Tomorrow's labor, grey mullet-catching)

1750
01:10:31,591 --> 01:10:33,561
- Grey mullet. - Grey mullet-catching.

1751
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,401
(Glancing over)

1752
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:40,641
All right. I prepared a bouquet for you guys.

1753
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:49,481
(Dex holds four mustard green stems of different lengths.)

1754
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:53,080
Will the labor go to those with the long terms...

1755
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:55,051
- or the short stems? - Let's decide on it.

1756
01:10:55,121 --> 01:10:57,420
Two people who pick the long stems...

1757
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:59,350
will do the labor. The two longest ones.

1758
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:00,997
(Two people who pick the long stems will do the labor.)

1759
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:02,660
I think it's okay either way,

1760
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:04,260
but I'd prefer skipping the labor.

1761
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,261
As for me...

1762
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:08,131
I want to do it since this is the last chance.

1763
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:09,531
Here it comes.

1764
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,400
(Being flippant)

1765
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,521
- It'd be funny if the we went. - Things like this...

1766
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,641
(What will become of Jung Ah?)

1767
01:11:16,771 --> 01:11:18,340
(It's the moment of decision.)

1768
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:19,341
Give me this one.

1769
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:20,581
(What will it be?)

1770
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:22,380
(Grey mullet...)

1771
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:24,011
(or no?)

1772
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:28,951
Why is it so long?

1773
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,321
You got the labor.

1774
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,821
You got the labor.

1775
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:37,131
(She got the labor.)

1776
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,390
One ticket remains.

1777
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:40,831
(She becomes thoughtful.)

1778
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,501
Jung Ah is...

1779
01:11:43,031 --> 01:11:44,951
- Shall we redo it? - Shall we redo it, Jung Ah?

1780
01:11:45,371 --> 01:11:48,141
No, I'll go. I think it's the longest one.

1781
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:54,811
- All right. Here we go. - Jun Myun.

1782
01:11:55,281 --> 01:11:57,051
If you don't want to go, pick a short one.

1783
01:11:57,581 --> 01:11:59,110
(I won't go.)

1784
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:00,121
All right.

1785
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:04,091
(Who will be the remaining one?)

1786
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:08,561
All right. One long stem remains.

1787
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:10,231
Who will get it? Hold on.

1788
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:11,691
Why is he so excited?

1789
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,261
He's so excited because he isn't going.

1790
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:16,231
He's so annoying.

1791
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:18,847
You guys will pick one at the same time.

1792
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:20,700
- Here. - Ji Yeon, you can pick first.

1793
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,601
- Left or right... - It doesn't matter.

1794
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,911
Should I grab the closest one?

1795
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:26,981
- One, two... - Who wants to go with me?

1796
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:29,950
(The one with the long stem...)

1797
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,251
(will catch grey mullets with Jung Ah.)

1798
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:37,121
(Who will get on the boat to catch the grey mullets?)

1799
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:42,321
- Pull it out. - One, two, three.

1800
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:44,431
Two, three.

1801
01:12:44,432 --> 01:12:45,530
(Short, long)

1802
01:12:45,531 --> 01:12:46,801
- Mine is long! - Come here.

1803
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:49,401
Come here.

1804
01:12:49,402 --> 01:12:50,470
(I forgot that the long one meant labor.)

1805
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:53,571
(Ji Yeon's imagination became a reality.)

1806
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,971
Mine is short indeed.

1807
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:58,210
The two of you got picked.

1808
01:12:58,211 --> 01:12:59,270
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon got picked for grey mullet-catching labor.)

1809
01:12:59,271 --> 01:13:01,681
Congratulations on your last labor.

1810
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,111
Have a nice trip.

1811
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:08,220
- All right. Let's have fun. - Yes, Jung Ah.

1812
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,451
- We can talk among ourselves. - That's right.

1813
01:13:10,991 --> 01:13:12,620
I'm just an innocent guest.

1814
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,421
(They're worried about tomorrow.)

1815
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,630
In any case, thank you for the food today.

1816
01:13:17,631 --> 01:13:19,671
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1817
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,830
(The five siblings' night comes after the pork belly party.)

1818
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:25,201
Do you want instant jjajang ramen?

1819
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,940
- That sounds nice. - Can you eat it?

1820
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:28,341
- Of course. - I'll go and make it.

1821
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,511
(Will they make instant jjajang ramen?)

1822
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,711
I'll get to show my skills in a while.

1823
01:13:36,581 --> 01:13:37,780
Where is the pot?

1824
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:38,957
(How will the jjajang ramen made by the original snack maker turn out?)

1825
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,821
He cooks it well. It was so tasty when he made it last time.

1826
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:44,190
- He cooks it very well. - He's good.

1827
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,431
- I like instant jjajang ramen. - Instant jjajang ramen.

1828
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:49,461
(Dex fills the pot with water in a peaceful manner.)

1829
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:53,131
(Spying on Dex)

1830
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:55,031
Hey, can you do it?

1831
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,271
- What? - Ask me if you're confused.

1832
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,431
I can cook it.

1833
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:02,540
- How many packets should I cook? - Ask me if you're confused.

1834
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,171
I'll teach you how to make it.

1835
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:06,481
Forget it. It's all about adjusting the amount of water.

1836
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:09,811
- Adjusting the heat. - Adjusting the water.

1837
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:13,381
(Fire Ji Yeon versus Water Dex)

1838
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:17,290
(Dex adds the dried flakes in the boiling water first.)

1839
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,720
Did you add the dried flakes first?

1840
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,620
These dried flakes will become soggy.

1841
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:25,331
- No. - Then it won't be tasty. I'm sorry.

1842
01:14:25,431 --> 01:14:27,631
Would you wait in the room? For goodness' sake.

1843
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:30,301
- This is... Jin Young. - Jun Myun, please take her.

1844
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:32,701
(Laughing)

1845
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,240
- We can't do that. - Ji Yeon keeps meddling.

1846
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:36,470
- Jin Young, I'll teach you. - I can't do this.

1847
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:38,411
I can't cook with her.

1848
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,710
- Jin Young. - I can't listen to her go on...

1849
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,910
about how the dried flakes will become soggy.

1850
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,910
Doing this will lessen the flavors of the dried flakes.

1851
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:48,020
- I'm sorry, but... - I'm sorry, but...

1852
01:14:48,021 --> 01:14:50,020
I'm sorry, but please go and take a seat.

1853
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:51,690
For goodness' sake. You're attacking my mentality.

1854
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:53,521
- You want me to fail. - You'll fail.

1855
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:55,391
Go and take a seat. For goodness' sake.

1856
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:57,390
For goodness' sake.

1857
01:14:57,391 --> 01:14:58,391
(Water Dex...)

1858
01:14:58,392 --> 01:15:01,501
(goes on his way.)

1859
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:06,470
- Hey, are you lost? - No! Stay there.

1860
01:15:06,471 --> 01:15:07,941
Please.

1861
01:15:08,741 --> 01:15:09,741
You're so loud.

1862
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:10,870
(She loves picking on Dex.)

1863
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:11,947
Shall I teach you a lesson?

1864
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:14,641
She'll complain so much if I fail to make it well.

1865
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:21,881
(No matter what, I'll make the best instant jjajang ramen.)

1866
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:23,921
Seriously.

1867
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:25,151
Is it done already?

1868
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:28,660
(Laughing)

1869
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:30,161
Don't look at me like that.

1870
01:15:31,891 --> 01:15:33,300
- Thank you for the food. - Jung Ah,

1871
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:35,161
- I can do anything. - Please enjoy the food.

1872
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,530
- Four... - No.

1873
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:40,000
- Are you going to do that? - Yes.

1874
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,801
- As for me... - Try it.

1875
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:44,571
(Slurping)

1876
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:48,911
- Dex. - Yes?

1877
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:51,351
- It's good, right? - It's so tasty.

1878
01:15:52,111 --> 01:15:54,581
- He cooks it well. - He cooks it very well.

1879
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,280
Thank goodness.

1880
01:15:56,281 --> 01:15:57,391
It's tasty.

1881
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:58,991
Shall I try it?

1882
01:15:59,391 --> 01:16:01,021
(Whatever)

1883
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:03,221
- The noodles are firm. - It's so tasty.

1884
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:05,741
I think his mother has the best cooking skills.

1885
01:16:06,231 --> 01:16:07,400
- The mustard green kimchi? - Yes.

1886
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,001
(She tastes it with utmost seriousness.)

1887
01:16:10,801 --> 01:16:12,571
(How is it?)

1888
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:18,471
How is it?

1889
01:16:18,571 --> 01:16:19,640
Well, it isn't bad.

1890
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,981
(Laughing)

1891
01:16:22,081 --> 01:16:25,251
Don't judge it. Enjoy the taste.

1892
01:16:26,151 --> 01:16:27,511
- Do you think they saw it? - Yes.

1893
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:29,021
(Slurping)

1894
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:33,791
(They stop fighting momentarily because it's tasty.)

1895
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:35,991
They aren't at the age to be cute.

1896
01:16:36,361 --> 01:16:38,261
(I don't know why I find them cute.)

1897
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:40,991
A late-night snack is the tastiest when it's eaten together.

1898
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:43,261
A late-night snack should be eaten together.

1899
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:47,270
(I did enjoy it, but...)

1900
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,601
Have you made pancakes before?

1901
01:16:48,841 --> 01:16:50,540
- Of course. - Have you?

1902
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,541
Yes.

1903
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,147
(The 2nd pancake war is about to break out.)

1904
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:55,180
Dex can cook well.

1905
01:16:55,181 --> 01:16:56,441
We're the same, Jung Ah.

1906
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:59,281
Prove it.

1907
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,250
I even put a bowl in the middle...

1908
01:17:01,251 --> 01:17:03,790
- That's right. - to make it crispy.

1909
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,091
What kind of a pancake was it?

1910
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:07,490
- Was it a kimchi pancake? - It contained chives...

1911
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:08,890
- and mussels. - Oh, my.

1912
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:10,630
- Jung Ah, side with her. - What?

1913
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,360
Jung Ah, why are you like that?

1914
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:15,230
- You only side with Jin Young! - Side with her.

1915
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,931
You only praise Jin Young.

1916
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,371
Did I do that?

1917
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:23,841
You only praise Jin Young, not me.

1918
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:26,511
(Did I do that?)

1919
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:28,180
(Crying)

1920
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:31,051
- For goodness' sake. - You only praise Jin Young.

1921
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,980
It isn't like that.

1922
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:36,520
It isn't like that. Jung Ah just doesn't lie.

1923
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,821
Hey, be quiet.

1924
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:38,991
Don't stop me.

1925
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:41,521
(Laughing)

1926
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:44,261
It's hard when there are many young ones.

1927
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:46,281
(The weight of being the head of the house)

1928
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:49,430
- I'll work hard. - Okay.

1929
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,931
(As they laugh and chat, the first night in Yeosu deepens.)

1930
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:56,371
(The sun rises over the roof.)

1931
01:17:57,671 --> 01:18:00,081
(The birds' chirps echo in the Seongdu Village.)

1932
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:03,480
(The elders of the Seongdu Village...)

1933
01:18:03,481 --> 01:18:06,351
(begin the morning with the sea.)

1934
01:18:06,821 --> 01:18:09,551
(A morning stretch!)

1935
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:11,451
(Stretching)

1936
01:18:13,691 --> 01:18:17,660
Where did my sunglasses go?

1937
01:18:17,661 --> 01:18:19,960
Ji Yeon! Dex!

1938
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,137
(Shall we go out for a morning stroll?)

1939
01:18:21,161 --> 01:18:23,301
- Isn't the sea in that direction? - Yes.

1940
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:26,800
(It takes 1 second to go from the house to the sea.)

1941
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,171
This place is so pretty.

1942
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:31,310
The composition is like that of a painting.

1943
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:34,941
(Let's go on a stroll to the sea outside the house.)

1944
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:37,611
(Humming)

1945
01:18:39,911 --> 01:18:42,550
(The sea breeze makes them hum.)

1946
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,651
The sea breeze.

1947
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:45,091
It's cool.

1948
01:18:45,991 --> 01:18:47,221
It's nice and cool.

1949
01:18:47,761 --> 01:18:48,821
It's nice, right?

1950
01:18:49,121 --> 01:18:50,591
Yes. It's cool.

1951
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,400
You were there yesterday, right?

1952
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:55,130
- I was there yesterday. - There.

1953
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,830
- What? Were you there? - There.

1954
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:59,930
- There. - Did you pretend to fish?

1955
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:02,270
I needed to fish, but...

1956
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,740
You pulled up the fishing rod like this.

1957
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:05,171
The fishing line broke.

1958
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,210
(Yesterday, Dex)

1959
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,151
(The fishing line broke.)

1960
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,551
(He acted with his entire body.)

1961
01:19:15,721 --> 01:19:16,950
That's funny. We went,

1962
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:18,951
- "Gosh, he's fishing." - "He's fishing."

1963
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,391
I acted as if I was catching a shark.

1964
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:25,261
It's cool.

1965
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,761
I love it.

1966
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:29,031
Is that a lighthouse?

1967
01:19:29,161 --> 01:19:30,301
It's pretty.

1968
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:32,277
I love the red background behind you guys.

1969
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,641
This place is so pretty.

1970
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:36,741
Jung Ah, let's take a photo here.

1971
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:38,141
- Let's do that. - Yes.

1972
01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:40,410
(Clicking)

1973
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:43,811
(The pretty background makes him take numerous photos.)

1974
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,050
Sit down. I'll take one for you.

1975
01:19:46,051 --> 01:19:47,581
Dex is terrible at taking photos.

1976
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:49,721
- Really? - Believe in me.

1977
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:51,690
I saw the way you did it.

1978
01:19:51,691 --> 01:19:52,721
You did this.

1979
01:19:53,891 --> 01:19:55,961
(Posing)

1980
01:19:56,691 --> 01:20:00,261
(Copying the pose)

1981
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:03,330
The angle is a bit worrisome.

1982
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,401
- What are you capturing? - I mean...

1983
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,601
Dex.

1984
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:08,540
(The terrible photographer is excited.)

1985
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:09,641
Good.

1986
01:20:10,641 --> 01:20:13,371
(Take good photos.)

1987
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:15,581
(How will the results be?)

1988
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:17,550
- Hey. - What?

1989
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,611
- Hey. - What?

1990
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:19,810
(Sighing)

1991
01:20:19,811 --> 01:20:20,821
What?

1992
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,457
- What's this? - Look at the back.

1993
01:20:22,481 --> 01:20:24,001
See? He takes photos in a strange way.

1994
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,161
(You can't tell if it's a lighthouse or a fire extinguisher.)

1995
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,131
(Jae Wook closed his eyes.)

1996
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:33,661
Look ahead.

1997
01:20:36,201 --> 01:20:37,301
Two, three.

1998
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,641
How is Jae Wook so hip?

1999
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,861
He's cute, right? He even dresses in a cute way.

2000
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:46,011
He has a fit body.

2001
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:49,441
- You do too. - Stop with your habitual flirting.

2002
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,380
Some people will misunderstand.

2003
01:20:51,381 --> 01:20:52,741
Why? Why would they misunderstand?

2004
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:55,451
Don't misunderstand. I mean my words, okay?

2005
01:20:56,621 --> 01:20:59,021
I feel invincible since the two of them are here.

2006
01:20:59,451 --> 01:21:01,191
Dex and Jae Wook.

2007
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:03,460
Aren't they dependable?

2008
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:04,531
They're dependable.

2009
01:21:04,661 --> 01:21:05,831
- I know. - Of course.

2010
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:08,861
The village is pretty.

2011
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,100
- We always go to a pretty village. - Yes.

2012
01:21:11,101 --> 01:21:12,270
(A peaceful stroll in the village)

2013
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:14,671
- How is the place so quiet? - I know.

2014
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:17,511
You guys need to catch snails.

2015
01:21:17,741 --> 01:21:18,741
Now?

2016
01:21:18,742 --> 01:21:20,681
Let me see. Can you catch them here?

2017
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:21,941
Yes.

2018
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:24,180
Let's see what they look like.

2019
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:26,341
(Ji Yeon and Jae Wook went down to the sea yesterday.)

2020
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,651
(Hold on. Is this it?)

2021
01:21:30,591 --> 01:21:32,991
(What did he find in the sea?)

2022
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:36,720
(Snails that live in the shallow saltwater)

2023
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:38,761
(Turban snail is its full name.)

2024
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,751
(Jung Ah, can we eat turban snails of this size?)

2025
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,971
(They decided to eat snail gangdoenjang!)

2026
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:49,570
You guys should go down there and catch some turban snails.

2027
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,071
We'll go and prepare breakfast.

2028
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:52,670
Shall we catch them now?

2029
01:21:52,671 --> 01:21:53,840
Yes. We need to eat breakfast.

2030
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:55,440
The water will be a bit cold.

2031
01:21:55,441 --> 01:21:56,951
- It was cold yesterday. - Yes.

2032
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:58,711
Still,

2033
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:01,621
we should get this much flesh.

2034
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,691
Don't worry. It won't take 30 minutes.

2035
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:06,590
- Really? - Go ahead and catch them.

2036
01:22:06,591 --> 01:22:07,621
Okay.

2037
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:09,220
We'll be back.

2038
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:10,661
- Okay. - See you soon.

2039
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,830
The water will be cold.

2040
01:22:12,831 --> 01:22:14,561
(They set out to catch some turban snails.)

2041
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:16,400
Where are they?

2042
01:22:16,401 --> 01:22:17,770
You'll see a lot of them once you go down.

2043
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:19,171
The water level went down a lot.

2044
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:20,571
I know.

2045
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:23,910
The black ones are snails.

2046
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:25,511
Really? These ones?

2047
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,780
You're right. They're baby turban snails.

2048
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,261
(Baby turban snails are on the rock.)

2049
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:33,380
(They need to get a fistful of the flesh.)

2050
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:34,650
I see.

2051
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,151
I think the water will be cold.

2052
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,621
It'll be very cold.

2053
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:39,451
Where are they?

2054
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:40,961
Where are they?

2055
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:43,021
Where are they?

2056
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:44,461
I don't see them.

2057
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:46,131
I see them.

2058
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:47,161
(He spots big ones.)

2059
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:51,371
(Adult turban snails live in the water.)

2060
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:53,431
(Wriggling)

2061
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:54,601
I see them.

2062
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:56,270
- Do you see them? - I see them.

2063
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,311
They're in the water.

2064
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:58,540
Look at them.

2065
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,581
- Those are the snails, right? - They're small.

2066
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,981
It's cold!

2067
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,611
Is the water cold?

2068
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:05,780
It's cold.

2069
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:06,981
(The seawater feels like ice.)

2070
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:08,451
It's cold.

2071
01:23:09,621 --> 01:23:10,851
They are in the water.

2072
01:23:13,491 --> 01:23:15,591
(The first turban snails)

2073
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:18,960
(With his eyes like a hawk, )

2074
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:21,231
(he gets turban snails.)

2075
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:24,130
(Absorbed in catching turban snails)

2076
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:25,701
(How about Ji Yeon?)

2077
01:23:25,971 --> 01:23:27,171
Seashells.

2078
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:31,741
Gather around the seashells

2079
01:23:32,011 --> 01:23:35,311
And put them around her neck

2080
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:39,411
Let's fall back for a second.

2081
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:42,280
- Hold on. My feet hurt. - My feet hurt.

2082
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:44,190
They hurt, right? Gosh, the water is cold.

2083
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:46,791
(The icy seawater makes them fall back.)

2084
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,291
It's a snail, right? Look.

2085
01:23:51,531 --> 01:23:52,961
- I think... - It's a conch.

2086
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:54,630
She thinks it's a snail.

2087
01:23:54,631 --> 01:23:55,760
- What do you think? - What?

2088
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:56,861
Isn't it a snail?

2089
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,801
Go back inside.

2090
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:01,691
If you don't want to work, just say so.

2091
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:03,810
They look so different.

2092
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:05,451
(Conches and snails look very different.)

2093
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:07,210
The long one...

2094
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:08,811
is a fish, right?

2095
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,581
What's wrong with you?

2096
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,051
Am I wrong?

2097
01:24:13,411 --> 01:24:15,681
Jae Wook, she thinks this is a fish.

2098
01:24:16,021 --> 01:24:17,491
I guess she doesn't want to work.

2099
01:24:17,821 --> 01:24:20,521
What's wrong with this lady?

2100
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:22,960
I caught a big one.

2101
01:24:22,961 --> 01:24:24,291
Let me see it. How big is it?

2102
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:25,991
It's this big.

2103
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:28,560
- It's big. - I think it's a good size.

2104
01:24:28,561 --> 01:24:30,471
(He caught a pretty big turban snail.)

2105
01:24:31,101 --> 01:24:32,271
Hey, Jae Wook.

2106
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,501
I should go and put on the boots.

2107
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:35,871
- Go and put them on. - Okay.

2108
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:38,210
Here comes the second round.

2109
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:39,817
(With the boots, here comes the 2nd round of snail-catching.)

2110
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,110
With the boots, we'll be able to go deeper.

2111
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:43,381
(Putting on the boots)

2112
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:45,511
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2113
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,850
- What do you think? - It's nice.

2114
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:49,721
- It's nice. - It's nice.

2115
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,051
- This is it. - It's nice.

2116
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:53,650
Our feet aren't cold now.

2117
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:56,220
(They're wearing boots now.)

2118
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,831
I can't see well when the water is too deep.

2119
01:24:58,931 --> 01:24:59,961
Right?

2120
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:02,701
We need to stay a bit apart.

2121
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:08,641
(Meanwhile, Jae Wook)

2122
01:25:11,311 --> 01:25:14,611
(He catches all the turban snails he sees.)

2123
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,911
They aren't here.

2124
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:18,550
They aren't here.

2125
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:20,351
(They even put on boots.)

2126
01:25:20,851 --> 01:25:22,321
I don't see them.

2127
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,590
Only nice people can see them.

2128
01:25:24,591 --> 01:25:27,521
I see them. They're here.

2129
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:29,260
I see them.

2130
01:25:29,261 --> 01:25:31,390
- Only nice people can see them. - I can suddenly see them well.

2131
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:32,630
You can't see them because you aren't nice.

2132
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:34,630
I can suddenly see them well. There are more here.

2133
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:36,030
(Dex can see them well because he is nice.)

2134
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,400
There we go.

2135
01:25:37,401 --> 01:25:39,121
(Dex can see them well because he is nice.)

2136
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:41,040
I really can't see them.

2137
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,371
(I really can't see them.)

2138
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:44,571
You should've been nice in your daily life.

2139
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:46,611
It's a crab.

2140
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:49,840
Ji Yeon, what are you doing? For goodness' sake.

2141
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:51,850
- Why can't I see them? - What are you doing?

2142
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:53,010
They aren't here.

2143
01:25:53,011 --> 01:25:54,051
(Catch the turban snails.)

2144
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:55,421
Did you catch some?

2145
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:56,781
Yes.

2146
01:25:58,051 --> 01:25:59,751
- You caught a lot. - Really?

2147
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:02,061
Only Ji Yeon needs to do well.

2148
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:03,720
You caught a lot.

2149
01:26:03,721 --> 01:26:06,731
(The two brothers became the masters of catching snails.)

2150
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:09,601
Why can't I see them?

2151
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:13,271
(Anyone can see that she only has a few snails.)

2152
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:14,971
Ji Yeon.

2153
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:17,240
- Ji Yeon. - What?

2154
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:18,571
Go back inside.

2155
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,510
Ji Yeon.

2156
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:22,680
(With such a measly amount, she might as well go home.)

2157
01:26:22,681 --> 01:26:25,710
Go back inside, okay? You did your best.

2158
01:26:25,711 --> 01:26:27,257
(Go back inside. We know that you did your best.)

2159
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:29,681
Why can't I see them?

2160
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:31,790
Ji Yeon, come over here. There are many here.

2161
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:32,821
Where?

2162
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,591
There they are.

2163
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:38,560
- There are many snails here. - Do you see them?

2164
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:40,331
Yes, there are many snails here.

2165
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:42,761
(She catches snails.)

2166
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:46,331
Gosh, there are many snails here.

2167
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:47,600
Are there many snails?

2168
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:48,641
(Walking over)

2169
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:49,771
Don't come closer.

2170
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:50,911
Where?

2171
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:52,010
Where do you see many snails?

2172
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:53,370
Catch snails over there.

2173
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:55,771
- Your region is over there. - Where do you see many snails?

2174
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,351
(The sound of the splashing waves fills the silence.)

2175
01:27:01,781 --> 01:27:06,551
(The three siblings catch snails as they enjoy the morning sunlight.)

2176
01:27:08,221 --> 01:27:10,761
(What caught Jae Wook's eyes as he collected the snails?)

2177
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:12,760
Isn't it cute?

2178
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:14,001
(A cute hermit crab)

2179
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,631
Ji Yeon, I think you'll like it.

2180
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,230
What is it?

2181
01:27:20,231 --> 01:27:21,351
(Is it something I'll like?)

2182
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:22,600
What is it?

2183
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:23,641
(A hermit crab)

2184
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:25,871
Stop!

2185
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:28,741
"Stop!"

2186
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:31,410
Let me see it. Is it a crayfish?

2187
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:33,310
- Is it an insect? - It's a hermit crab.

2188
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:34,881
A hermit crab.

2189
01:27:35,151 --> 01:27:37,150
(She worries about how much turban snails they'll catch.)

2190
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,790
(Jung Ah, we drove them to extinction.)

2191
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:39,851
(Proud)

2192
01:27:39,991 --> 01:27:42,390
(The 2nd round involves the frying pan.)

2193
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:44,390
(Dex works the wok...)

2194
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:45,731
(like crazy.)

2195
01:27:45,931 --> 01:27:47,761
(Snail gangdoenjang looks insanely good.)

2196
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:49,937
(After a meal with the dishes that make you crave rice, )

2197
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:51,200
(it's time to work your muscles.)

2198
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:52,371
(What?)

2199
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:54,370
(They have a sense of presence inside the net.)

2200
01:27:54,371 --> 01:27:56,001
(Yeosu's grey mullet)

2201
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:58,317
(The thrashing fish gives Ji Yeon a mental breakdown.)

2202
01:27:58,341 --> 01:27:59,911
(Is Jung Ah angry?)

2203
01:28:00,011 --> 01:28:01,440
(Ji Yeon, do it like this!)

2204
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:02,610
(Jung Ah, like this?)

2205
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,281
(A sad ending)

2206
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,510
(Why did it have to be his birthday?)

2207
01:28:06,511 --> 01:28:08,021
(Gosh, it's such a hassle.)

2208
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:10,381
(Why are they picking on Jae Wook?)

2209
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:11,720
(It's my birthday.)

2210
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:12,891
(Teary-eyed)

2211
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:14,461
It isn't like that.

2212
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:17,691
(Did the sister burst into tears for real?)

2213
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:19,331
I'm nervous.

2214
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,181
(What will be the story of the suspicious birthday party?)
