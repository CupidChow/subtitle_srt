1
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,588
(On Fresh off the Sea, )

2
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,629
(there is no such thing as easy work.)

3
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,399
(The hidden gem of Boryeong)

4
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,339
(Giant webfoot octopus with roe)

5
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,768
(The one who came to hunt the webfoot octopuses, )

6
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,109
(Kim Hye Yoon)

7
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,009
(Grabbing)

8
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,848
(Skilled hands)

9
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,808
(Keen eyes)

10
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,619
(Impressed)

11
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,319
Here it is!

12
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,419
(When something enters Hye Yoon's hands, )

13
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,289
(she catches it without fail.)

14
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,888
(To catch the webfoot octopuses, )

15
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:03,028
(they had a fierce tug of war!)

16
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,029
All right.

17
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,629
(Even if I can't see, I won't let go of them.)

18
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:10,869
(They stayed persistent and caught every single one.)

19
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,869
(They commanded the webfoot octopuses with roe.)

20
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,808
(They caught 15kg of webfoot octopuses in total!)

21
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,678
(What came afterward was...)

22
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,909
(the tight camaraderie between the Fresh members.)

23
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,179
Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

24
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,778
(Did it crumble down when they began to cook?)

25
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:28,418
(Please call me Seasoning Im.)

26
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,448
(Seasoning Im challenged Seasoning Park.)

27
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,689
(For goodness' sake)

28
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,289
(A match to earn the title of the seasoning master began.)

29
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,359
(The rising cook made...)

30
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,859
(dried squid stir-fry with her special recipe.)

31
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,729
(A bite for the precious guest)

32
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:44,669
(The taste made her eyes sparkle!)

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,369
(I'm Seasoning Im.)

34
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,339
(I'll show you what the original is like.)

35
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,209
(The cucumbers underwent Seasoning Park's touches.)

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,609
(Cucumber kimchi with unrivaled tastes)

37
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,249
(What will be the result of the seasoning master match?)

38
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,918
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen, )

39
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,249
(a game changer is working quietly.)

40
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,459
(Piling up)

41
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,329
(She cleaned the vegetables skillfully.)

42
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,499
(Hye Yoon finished preparing the shabu-shabu ingredients!)

43
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,229
What should I do? I'm so bad at household chores.

44
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,399
I hope my mom doesn't watch this video.

45
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,609
(I see that my friend wants more screen time!)

46
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,809
(She worked hard to get more screen time.)

47
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,509
(Hye Yoon showed her cuteness.)

48
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:33,849
(Now, it's time for the webfoot octopuses' screen time.)

49
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,548
(Through hard work, )

50
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,089
(they earned the fried giant webfoot octopuses.)

51
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,129
(Glossy)

52
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,699
(The dish looked so appetizing that they had to try it.)

53
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,259
(Crunchy)

54
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,969
(The best)

55
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:51,299
(Meanwhile, Ji Yeon began to make tanghulu.)

56
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,538
I don't want to make tanghulu that has...

57
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,008
only four pieces of fruit.

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,038
(Pancake Im wanted to make king-sized tanghulu.)

59
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,409
(Whatever)

60
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,178
(How will Ji Yeon's tanghulu turn out...)

61
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,939
(now that her cooking skills are improving?)

62
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,779
I'll add strawberries as well.

63
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,218
(Strawberries and green grapes)

64
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,289
Here you go.

65
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,929
(She makes the skewers in no time.)

66
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,759
Only the difficult process remains.

67
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,199
The ratio is important.

68
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,299
It's 2 to 1.

69
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,368
- Two parts sugar?
- Yes.

70
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,489
(The ratio of sugar and water is the most important.)

71
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,909
(And)

72
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,409
You know that you shouldn't mix them, right?

73
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:32,639
What?

74
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:33,878
It won't work if you stir it.

75
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,408
(Tip for making sugar syrup: If you stir the sugar water, )

76
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,009
(it'll crystallize and harden in lumps.)

77
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:38,818
I need to stir it after adding all the sugar.

78
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,649
(Confident)

79
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,288
- Do you need to stir it afterward?
- Yes.

80
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,349
The sugar?

81
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,188
Can't I stir it?

82
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,389
(Can't I stir it?)

83
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,219
- Can't I?
- Why don't you check the recipe?

84
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,329
- Let me use the restroom.
- Go ahead.

85
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,899
(I have an urgent matter to take care of.)

86
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,298
I guess you're in a hurry.

87
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,568
(I'll be back soon.)

88
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,539
(Using the restroom)

89
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,308
Didn't she say that she needed to use the restroom?

90
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:09,379
(Laughing)

91
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,949
(She should know the recipe by heart this time.)

92
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,719
(My goodness)

93
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:19,958
Did you check the recipe? Should you stir it or not?

94
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,959
What? I used the restroom for a second.

95
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,898
So, should you stir it or not?

96
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,998
Here's what I think.

97
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,029
Like you said it would be better not to stir it.

98
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,969
The water will turn clear,

99
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,138
and the sugar will take on the ivory color.

100
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,869
That's the right timing.

101
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,478
It's turning clear.

102
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,679
(The sugar is turning clear.)

103
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,448
(Stirring)

104
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,118
(You said that you wouldn't stir it.)

105
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,119
(Chuckling)

106
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,788
I think it's coming along.

107
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:54,119
(I think it's coming along.)

108
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,828
Some water...

109
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,799
(She uses the ice water to test if it congeals well!)

110
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,438
When it's in the ice water,

111
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,669
it should turn hard.

112
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,939
(Sticky)

113
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,749
Why is it like this?

114
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,679
(She keeps stirring.)

115
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,879
The instruction about not stirring is only for the beginning, right?

116
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,619
Since...

117
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,318
(Since I don't know if this is going well)

118
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,459
I'll try making one.

119
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,228
I think it's ruined, but...

120
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,288
(I'll try making it as it is.)

121
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,289
I'll try it.

122
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,129
It looks fine.

123
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,199
(Then comes the strawberry tanghulu.)

124
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,199
(There's the Im family's special, collaboration tanghulu.)

125
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,709
It needs to harden, but I don't think it'll do that.

126
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,009
(Sticky)

127
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,289
Is it a success?

128
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,219
- I think it's ruined.
- Why?

129
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,819
It looks like it's a success.

130
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,628
- But...
- It's a total success.

131
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,629
They look store-bought.

132
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,798
(They look perfect.)

133
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,559
You put them in the fridge afterward, right?

134
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:15,268
(Will they harden in the fridge?)

135
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,309
They look fine now.

136
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,078
I'll put them here.

137
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,379
(She'll cool them down while they eat dinner.)

138
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,849
- Let's set up the table.
- She's neat.

139
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,819
(Jae Wook prepares the shabu-shabu meat.)

140
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,319
Jae Wook's big picture.

141
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,689
Gosh, it's so...

142
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,389
(One more packet!)

143
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:35,589
(Impressed)

144
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:38,999
- All done?
- I feel so happy.

145
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,468
(A mountain of meat)

146
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,538
There's so much food.

147
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,179
(Next to it is a mountain of vegetables.)

148
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,268
The broth is rich.

149
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:50,939
(There's a pot of rich broth as well.)

150
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,979
(He puts the pot of broth in the middle.)

151
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,449
Where will we put the webfoot octopuses?

152
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,949
We're in trouble.

153
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:03,719
(You can always add a table.)

154
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,458
My goodness. Webfoot octopuses are the main ingredient.

155
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,059
(The VIP seat for the webfoot octopuses)

156
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,288
Will you fry them again?

157
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,169
(He begins to fry the webfoot octopuses again!)

158
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,959
They'll be done in three minutes.

159
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,838
My goodness. Nice.

160
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,120
(After the second frying, they look twice as appetizing.)

161
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,649
(He takes out the golden fried webfoot octopuses.)

162
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,149
(They get delivered to the table right away!)

163
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:37,688
They look so tasty.

164
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,249
(Freshly-fried giant webfoot octopuses)

165
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,058
- Is it insane?
- Everyone is saying...

166
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,588
that dried squid stir-fry has the perfect seasoning.

167
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,628
Is that so?

168
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,105
(Seasoning Im's ambitious work, dried squid stir-fry)

169
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:49,268
(Webfoot octopus shabu-shabu with fresh ingredients)

170
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,399
It looks pretty.

171
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,868
- It looks tasty.
- Today's dinner will be so tasty.

172
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,909
(It's the most hearty meal with webfoot octopuses.)

173
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,555
(The size is so big that it's hard to pick up at once.)

174
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,179
Should we put in three for now?

175
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:04,409
It looks tasty.

176
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,719
(The never-ending addition of the shabu-shabu ingredients)

177
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,595
(She's surprised by how much the members eat.)

178
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,519
(The Fresh Overeating Diner is operating as usual.)

179
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,029
(Looking around)

180
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,649
(She picks up a piece of fried webfoot octopus.)

181
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,959
Try the fried one.

182
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,629
Dip it in the sauce.

183
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,799
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy the food.

184
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,709
(Crunchy)

185
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,809
(You can hear how crunchy it is.)

186
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,979
(My goodness)

187
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,819
It's totally tasty.

188
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,389
(Jung Ah dips it in the sauce.)

189
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,359
(She enjoys the crunchiness.)

190
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
(Crunchy)

191
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,038
(A relay of crunching sounds)

192
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,675
Isn't the fried webfoot octopus so tasty?

193
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,099
- It's tasty. It's so tasty.
- Yes.

194
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,568
It came out so well.

195
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,308
(The dish is so crunchy...)

196
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,249
(that you keep reaching for more.)

197
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:10,809
(It makes her happy.)

198
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,779
It's so tasty.

199
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,948
(The fried webfoot octopus goes into Jae Wook's mouth.)

200
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:15,149
(This is the taste.)

201
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,189
(Jae Wook eats the pieces in a single bite, )

202
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,259
(but she can't do the same.)

203
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,028
(I want to cut it, )

204
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,429
(but it's hard.)

205
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,469
Shall we clink our glasses for Hye Yoon?

206
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,838
- Okay.
- Hye Yoon.

207
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,338
Hye Yoon, why don't you give a toast?

208
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,469
- Okay.
- Hey.

209
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,439
Okay.

210
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,649
- Let me stand up.
- Okay.

211
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:46,419
Thank you for having me here on Fresh off the Sea.

212
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,289
I hope we'll meet often at work in the future.

213
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,189
- Sing!
- Don't do that.

214
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,938
- Sing!
- Don't do that.

215
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:02,979
Don't be like that.

216
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:04,339
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,855
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

218
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,448
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Hye Yoon, good luck.

219
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:09,449
Okay.

220
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,818
(My goodness)

221
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,888
(Since I finished giving a toast, )

222
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,089
(shall I resume eating?)

223
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,519
(The next question enters.)

224
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,489
(It isn't easy to eat fried webfoot octopus.)

225
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,429
How does it feel to see the table of food?

226
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,899
Everyone is good at cooking.

227
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,169
- Ji Yeon, you're good at cooking.
- You're too kind.

228
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:30,968
(I can't believe it.)

229
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,669
(Embarrassed)

230
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,479
Why is she feigning modesty? Isn't it too late for that?

231
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,839
I hate it.

232
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:41,278
Hye Yoon, you'll be able to cook...

233
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,078
if you work hard.

234
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,149
My goodness. Stop being mean to the newbie.

235
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:48,119
(What are you saying?)

236
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:50,019
(I'll end you.)

237
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,158
(While they laugh and chat, )

238
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,599
(the webfoot octopus shabu-shabu begins to boil.)

239
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,968
We can eat them now.

240
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,369
(It's the best time for eating.)

241
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,899
- I'll cut the webfoot octopuses.
- Okay.

242
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,138
Look at the head. How is this a webfoot octopus?

243
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,309
It's so big. Look at this.

244
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,509
It's an octopus.

245
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,579
- It's so big.
- It's an octopus.

246
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:17,749
(She cuts the webfoot octopuses into bite-sized pieces.)

247
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:20,889
I bet it tastes amazing. It's bound to be good.

248
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,659
It's so fresh.

249
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,658
- We caught them.
- Thank you.

250
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,459
(Hye Yoon first)

251
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,628
(Hye Yoon eats...)

252
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,198
(a leg.)

253
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,939
(What is this taste?)

254
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,209
(Then she eats shabu-shabu in a proper way.)

255
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,108
I want some.

256
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,709
(This must be the shabu-shabu paradise.)

257
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,948
It's big.

258
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,429
(A big leg that matches the size of the giant webfoot octopus)

259
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,649
(Jae Wook eats the beef brisket.)

260
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,659
- It's really tasty, right?
- Yes.

261
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,789
(Being a vegetable enthusiast, Jung Ah eats the vegetables first.)

262
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,128
(I made this, but...)

263
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,629
It's tasty. The shabu-shabu is tasty.

264
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:06,729
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

265
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:07,999
I agree.

266
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,038
(They eat the ingredients that suit their tastes.)

267
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,908
You should eat what you like.

268
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,209
(It's the charm of shabu-shabu.)

269
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,538
- It's bound to be tasty.
- Yes.

270
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,539
(That means...)

271
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,149
(Jung Ah will eat all the vegetables.)

272
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,089
I'll eat the head.

273
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,988
(The hunter of webfoot octopus head, Ji Yeon)

274
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:29,989
The egg-filled one?

275
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,029
Is the head filled with eggs?

276
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,029
It's so big. This is the delicacy.

277
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,969
(I'll show you.)

278
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,139
(She cuts the head with scissors.)

279
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,909
(Webfoot octopus eggs pour out like a waterfall.)

280
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,978
(It's full of eggs.)

281
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,089
(Shall I try the webfoot octopus head?)

282
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:04,359
(This is a wordless praise.)

283
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,759
(Is it tasty?)

284
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,029
(It's insane.)

285
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,959
She knows how to eat webfoot octopuses.

286
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,798
(She picks up meat and webfoot octopus...)

287
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,529
(and dips them in Jung Ah's sauce.)

288
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,639
(They go straight into her mouth.)

289
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,409
What's this sauce? Jung Ah, it's so tasty.

290
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:24,939
Isn't the sauce tasty?

291
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:26,709
It contains light mustard.

292
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,749
(She dips it in sauce...)

293
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,219
(and takes a bite.)

294
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,749
(The taste makes her nod her head.)

295
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:37,159
I guess an ink sac burst. The soup is turning dark.

296
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,129
Because of a burst ink sac, the broth turned dark.

297
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,329
- It's luxurious.
- It's luxurious.

298
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,199
(She tries the luxurious soup.)

299
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,668
(This is it!)

300
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,768
It's clean, Jung Ah.

301
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,438
- The broth is clean.
- It's bound to be tasty.

302
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,909
The taste is more than rich.

303
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,378
- It's so tasty.
- It's deep.

304
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,849
(The taste is more than rich. It's deep.)

305
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,049
Gosh, this broth...

306
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,618
(The giant webfoot octopuses and various vegetables...)

307
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,149
(deepened the taste of the broth.)

308
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,459
It's so tasty.

309
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,028
(Plump)

310
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,159
Have some more.

311
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,529
(While eating webfoot octopus shabu-shabu, she spots...)

312
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:25,569
(Jun Myun's signature cucumber kimchi.)

313
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,268
- Hye Yoon, try this.
- Yes.

314
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,778
- I cut it into small pieces.
- Okay.

315
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,408
- Give it a try.
- Thank you.

316
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,609
(Placing it right on the scallion kimchi plate)

317
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,349
(Crunchy)

318
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,539
(A refreshing kick of spice bursts in her mouth.)

319
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,019
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- Yes.

320
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:44,889
It's so good.

321
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:46,889
It's so refreshing.

322
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,859
This cucumber kimchi is delicious.

323
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,599
It's okay unfermented, right?

324
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:52,929
It's delicious.

325
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,599
(And right next to it...)

326
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,739
We should try rice and dried squid stir-fry.

327
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,969
We should try what Ji Yeon made.

328
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,609
It looks delicious.

329
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,448
(Focusing)

330
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,879
My hands are trembling.

331
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,489
(Judge Park Jun Myun)

332
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,188
(How does it taste?)

333
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,359
How is it?

334
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:20,059
(What's Seasoning Park's verdict?)

335
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,959
Well done.

336
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,728
(It's a pass.)

337
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,529
- Did I do well?
- It's delicious.

338
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:28,938
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

339
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,219
(Chef Yum joins in with praise.)

340
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,639
(Hye Yoon takes a bite, too.)

341
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:33,839
(Exclaiming)

342
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,578
- This is really good.
- Really?

343
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,699
- I tried it earlier. It was good.
- It is delicious.

344
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:41,048
(Feeling on top of the world)

345
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,119
It's really good.

346
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,779
(Now...)

347
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,189
(it's shabu-shabu devouring time.)

348
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:50,959
Have some more.

349
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,788
(They eat as if there's no tomorrow.)

350
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,359
(And before they realize it, )

351
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,369
(the pot is completely empty.)

352
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:02,999
This would be perfect for making porridge.

353
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,099
- That's right.
- Let's make porridge.

354
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,108
- The porridge?
- Yes.

355
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,639
(Jung Ah's eyes light up.)

356
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,878
(The gas burner turns on.)

357
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,978
It would be so good to eat the porridge while...

358
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,455
- blowing on it to cool it down.
- The porridge sounds so good.

359
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,718
I want to try it.

360
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,719
(Shall we make porridge?)

361
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,988
(Chopping the remaining ingredients)

362
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,259
- There are some ingredients left.
- Right.

363
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,889
(A generous scoop of cold rice goes in.)

364
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:29,458
(She just added rice, and yet...)

365
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,729
It looks so delicious.

366
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,299
Good.

367
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,439
(Eggs are a must, of course.)

368
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,808
(Pouring in a gentle swirl of beaten egg...)

369
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,439
(over the perfectly cooked porridge)

370
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,609
(Once the egg is well mixed, )

371
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:51,648
(a drizzle of sesame oil completes the flavor.)

372
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,749
This is amazing.

373
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,088
(Adding dried laver flakes for a savory kick)

374
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,529
I like it with lots of dried laver.

375
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,089
- This looks so good. Okay.
- Let's move it over there.

376
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,599
(It looks too good not to be delicious.)

377
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,568
There you go.

378
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,039
(The 2nd round begins.)

379
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,719
- This looks so delicious.
- It really looks so good.

380
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,538
There's no way it doesn't taste good.

381
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,179
(Rice soaked with deeply infused broth)

382
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,389
(What is this flavor?)

383
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,719
It has such a rich flavor.

384
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,559
(Jun Myun, who can't handle hot food, )

385
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,259
(cools it down.)

386
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,399
It's hot.

387
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,698
(Boiled to a rolling boil, )

388
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,599
(it feels like a furnace.)

389
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,968
(Jung Ah feels...)

390
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:49,539
(the heat, too.)

391
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,108
It's so delicious.

392
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,209
- It's seriously so good.
- Isn't it amazing?

393
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:57,878
Jung Ah, this is amazing.

394
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,549
The depth of the broth...

395
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,719
It's unreal.

396
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,429
We actually finished it all.

397
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,859
(Since it looks like they've almost finished...)

398
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,898
I'll go get the tanghulu.

399
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,299
(Exciting dessert time)

400
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,269
Please don't clap.

401
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,239
(Did the tanghulu survive?)

402
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,709
(What?)

403
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,709
(What's going on?)

404
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,079
I think it worked.

405
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,849
(She decides to take it outside.)

406
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,189
- Here it is.
- How do the lyrics go?

407
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,689
It looks good.

408
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,089
- I think it'll taste okay.
- Right.

409
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:43,328
(But...)

410
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,829
Is it coming off the plate?

411
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,529
(Laughing)

412
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,699
(Trying to lift it off the plate)

413
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,669
(Hold on a second.)

414
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,479
(Trying again)

415
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,849
(The strawberry is tearing apart.)

416
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:02,769
Here's what's happening right now.

417
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,819
- The stick is coming out.
- Let me see it.

418
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,149
Look at this.

419
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,588
(Passing it to Jae Wook)

420
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,488
It's just...

421
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:12,559
(A face full of concern)

422
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:16,999
(Jae Wook tries to pull it apart.)

423
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,169
(The tanghulu stays completely still.)

424
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,999
Did you get dental veneers, by any chance?

425
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,238
This is not for those with dental veneers.

426
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,239
(Dental veneer warning)

427
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:30,708
Why?

428
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:31,709
(What's going on?)

429
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,078
- It's too hard.
- The spoon won't go in.

430
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,519
He's saying your teeth might break.

431
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:40,219
(This is unbelievable.)

432
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:41,518
I mean...

433
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,039
- All your teeth might fall out.
- If you got dental veneers...

434
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:45,689
Let's just not eat it.

435
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,388
- We still have to taste it.
- I'll just...

436
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,528
- suck on it.
- I'll suck on it too.

437
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,658
- We can't risk it.
- But we still have to taste it.

438
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,199
What if someone loses a tooth?

439
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,599
(Tanghulu finally comes off the plate.)

440
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,209
This is a twin popsicle.

441
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:01,438
- We're going to split it together.
- Oh, my.

442
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,079
(Tanghulu is supposed to have...)

443
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,109
(a smooth sugar-coated surface.)

444
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:08,249
(It should crack with a crisp snap when you tap it.)

445
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,549
This is a twin popsicle.

446
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,819
(The shape is already off.)

447
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,548
One, two, three...

448
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,109
(Attempting to split the twin popsicle)

449
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,658
Oh, my. What is that?

450
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,329
(It's completely torn apart.)

451
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:23,398
(Oh, my. What is that?)

452
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:24,559
Seriously...

453
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,898
- What should I do with it?
- Should we eat them 1 by 1?

454
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,098
(It looks disastrous.)

455
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,538
- Can I try it?
- No, don't eat it.

456
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,909
Let's just try sucking on it.

457
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:36,809
I'll try it first.

458
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,079
(Will the messy tanghulu still taste good?)

459
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,449
(Will the messy tanghulu still taste good?)

460
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:46,389
Let's suck on them one by one.

461
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,589
(Ji Yeon stays silent.)

462
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:58,129
(Even without a word, the flavor made itself known.)

463
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,869
(Fruit lover Jun Myun gives it a try.)

464
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,268
How is it?

465
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,389
(What's Jun Myun's verdict?)

466
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,308
(What is this?)

467
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,739
(I'm sorry.)

468
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,818
This is inedible.

469
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,649
(She is not throwing up.)

470
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:20,889
(Glaring)

471
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,418
(It eventually had to leave her mouth.)

472
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,539
Even Jun Myun has a day when she spits something out.

473
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:29,598
There's taffy in it.

474
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,198
(You've hit me with taffy.)

475
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,229
Taffy.

476
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,668
(The one who unwittingly handed over taffy)

477
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,429
It feels like my tooth might get pulled out.

478
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,469
(Watch out for accidental tooth extraction.)

479
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,038
Have you tried tasting it yet?

480
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,708
(It's understandable.)

481
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,709
This...

482
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,548
(It sticks to the molars.)

483
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:49,719
(Clinging and pulling between molars)

484
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,419
- May I go to the restroom?
- Hye Yoon, don't eat it.

485
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,918
My molars are all stuck together.

486
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,919
(Losing his pronunciation ability)

487
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,995
He can't speak because his molars are stuck together.

488
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,029
My teeth are sticking together too tightly.

489
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,199
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

490
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,229
I just wanted to make you a nice dessert.

491
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,729
- That is fine.
- I was too ambitious. I'm sorry.

492
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,669
No, it's okay. Should we wash it and eat it?

493
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,638
- Just the fruit.
- There's some fruit left.

494
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:17,038
I'll try again tomorrow.

495
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,509
Don't try it. Do it at home.

496
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,349
I can just boil it over there in the corner...

497
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,749
(Cooking again after the meal)

498
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,148
I'm making this so I can sleep 15 minutes longer.

499
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:30,069
(Preparing soup in advance for tomorrow morning)

500
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,659
This kind of food tastes good the next day.

501
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,029
Preparing everything will ease the mind.

502
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,629
I can sleep 15 minutes longer.

503
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,769
(True happiness of 15 minutes)

504
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,998
I can just boil it again tomorrow.

505
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,139
(It's ready in no time.)

506
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,538
(See you tomorrow morning.)

507
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,539
(By dried radish greens bean sprouts soup)

508
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:52,779
(A sweet moment of rest after dinner)

509
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:55,248
(Jae Wook, having finished his tasks, )

510
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,878
(packs up props and an instant camera.)

511
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,988
(He makes sure to bring the vest.)

512
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:01,118
Try it on.

513
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,989
(Handing the vest to Hye Yoon)

514
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,089
This is cute.

515
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:06,629
I really like things like this.

516
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:08,688
(And then, Jae Wook takes out...)

517
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,729
- What is this?
- It's an old camera.

518
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:13,569
I love it.

519
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,468
How do you feel coming all the way to Boryeong from Seoul?

520
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:19,469
(Reporter Lee's cam)

521
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,769
I feel great.

522
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,679
What accent was that?

523
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,378
- That's North Korea.
- What accent is this?

524
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,109
(Laughing)

525
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,578
You have to talk in a Seoul accent.

526
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,649
I feel good when I dress like this.

527
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,579
(Retake)

528
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,048
It's a long trip from Seoul.

529
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,388
How are you feeling?

530
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:36,588
When I dress like this...

531
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,858
I can't.

532
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,159
(Laughing)

533
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:40,389
What is this?

534
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:42,798
Let's stop.

535
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,229
(The interview ends abruptly.)

536
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,899
We went with the wrong theme.

537
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:48,299
(It's now time for the second theme.)

538
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:50,269
(Sunglasses)

539
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,075
This is a couple-themed photoshoot.

540
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,239
I see.

541
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:57,109
(Chic and lovely)

542
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:01,808
(The theme is Dan Oh and Baek Kyung enjoying their rural getaway.)

543
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,348
I bet the pictures turned out great.

544
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,449
Let's wait and see.

545
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:05,988
I want to use this one.

546
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:08,318
(Baek Kyung's pick)

547
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,489
Sure. I like it too.

548
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,289
(Baek Kyung brings over his favorite pictures...)

549
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,259
(and fills the wall with those precious memories.)

550
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,329
These pictures are so cute.

551
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,069
Jae Wook is excited to have his friend here.

552
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,599
I am.

553
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,469
Try not to like me too much.

554
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,469
Right. You'll end up getting hurt.

555
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,078
(That's right. I'm Ye Seo, so I have to focus on studying.)

556
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,449
(Our youngest ones are adorable.)

557
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,019
(Jae Wook loves these pictures he took with Hye Yoon.)

558
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,229
(Hye Yoon is now saved in their Boryeong memories.)

559
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:49,598
Gosh.

560
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,859
(The night quietly settled in at the Fresh House.)

561
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,268
Cheers.

562
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:54,998
Are you drinking soju tonight, Jae Wook?

563
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,869
Yes, I was craving soju yesterday.

564
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,009
Do you think Ji Yeon will wake up soon?

565
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,508
She might not wake up at all.

566
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,708
- Right.
- But there's...

567
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,278
an 85 percent chance...

568
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,909
that she'll wake up when we get loud.

569
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,379
The thing is,

570
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,919
I actually...

571
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,789
I didn't want to show up empty-handed,

572
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,019
(Curious)

573
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,119
so I bought these.

574
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,359
They're gifts for you.

575
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,628
What are these?

576
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:21,989
(Surprised and touched)

577
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,429
You didn't have to.

578
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,449
You take the one that's slightly torn open.

579
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,929
- Can I open it?
- Yes.

580
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,968
It's makeup.

581
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:30,898
I was trying to figure out what to get you.

582
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:34,239
Gosh, these must have been so heavy to carry.

583
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,439
- Thank you. Goodness.
- Right. Thank you.

584
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,579
I'll be thinking of you whenever I use it.

585
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:41,008
Hye Yoon.

586
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,178
(I love that.)

587
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,419
When you use it all up, you can say "Goodbye, Hye Yoon."

588
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:47,719
Hye Yoon...

589
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,559
- has such a cheerful personality.
- Right.

590
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,659
She used to...

591
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,229
use all that energy at work...

592
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:57,998
and get deeply exhausted.

593
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,569
(She got deeply exhausted.)

594
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,569
But that's all in the past.

595
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:03,669
When was this?

596
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,838
Since "SKY Castle," I think.

597
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,139
Before that, when I met new people,

598
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,908
their vibes were like "Who are you?"

599
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:12,978
But ever since the show,

600
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,848
they would go "You're Ye Seo. I see."

601
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:17,179
But it felt as if their eyes were...

602
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:20,489
judging me for being different in person.

603
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:21,888
You should have said "I'm way prettier in person, right?"

604
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:23,719
("I'm way prettier in person, right?")

605
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,259
As I started gaining attention,

606
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,999
I found myself being more guarded with people.

607
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,058
Even saying a single word,

608
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,969
it was just... How should I put this...

609
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:35,668
- It's all part of the process.
- Yes.

610
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:36,739
That's right.

611
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,069
I've truly never met...

612
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,308
such a selfless actor on set...

613
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,708
Of course, I've worked with so many amazing actors,

614
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,525
but I still haven't seen anyone like Hye Yoon so far.

615
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:47,779
Yes, Hye Yoon is like that.

616
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,879
She gives her all in acting.

617
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,079
Why are you...

618
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
- praising her to her face?
- She has great energy.

619
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,095
- She must be embarrassed.
- You can talk about me, too.

620
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,818
I personally feel embarrassed in situations like this.

621
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:58,919
- You do?
- Yes.

622
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,328
(Jun Myun is a shy girl.)

623
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,398
(When you feel embarrassed, have a drink.)

624
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,558
Pace yourself.

625
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,239
(When you feel embarrassed, have a drink.)

626
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,998
Gosh, Jung Ah.

627
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,399
(The noise from the living room...)

628
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,739
(woke Ji Yeon up.)

629
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,139
She's here.

630
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,855
I meant to lie down for a second but ended up falling asleep.

631
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,409
I told you Ji Yeon would wake up soon.

632
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,018
(Groggy)

633
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,119
You're still half-asleep.

634
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,289
I fell asleep without even washing up.

635
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,758
What's the plan for tomorrow? The two of you...

636
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,989
You go running while we make breakfast.

637
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,628
- And then...
- What time?

638
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:35,659
- At 7am.
- At 7am.

639
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,299
Seven...

640
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:38,498
(Looking around)

641
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:41,328
(Jung Ah keeps looking at Ji Yeon and Jae Wook.)

642
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,499
How can two people look so alike?

643
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:45,469
How is it possible?

644
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,609
You and I really do look alike.

645
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,208
They resemble each other like real siblings.

646
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,779
- Right? They're like real siblings.
- They kind of...

647
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,055
I can see the resemblance too. It's pretty fascinating.

648
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,079
My own younger brother resembles me too.

649
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:58,695
But Jae Wook looks more like me than he does.

650
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,248
I told you before.

651
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,619
My mom has a daughter too.

652
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,358
- What?
- She said you look more like me...

653
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,479
than my mom's daughter does.

654
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,759
Why would you say that your mom has a daughter?

655
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,558
It's your older sister.

656
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,158
(Jae Wook's mom's daughter is his older sister.)

657
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,769
We might share the same bloodline.

658
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,038
We could have a shared ancestor.

659
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,369
(We might share ancestors.)

660
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,039
(Thanks to the lookalike siblings, )

661
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,579
(a joyful night in Boryeong comes to an end.)

662
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:29,279
(The night fades away...)

663
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,549
(and the sun comes up the following morning.)

664
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:37,789
(Warm sunlight spreads across Hapyeong Village.)

665
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:42,629
(This is when locals start their day.)

666
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,229
(Current time: 7am)

667
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,068
(At the Fresh House, )

668
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,208
(everyone is still sound asleep.)

669
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,638
(One spot is empty.)

670
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,638
(Ji Yeon changed into her running clothes...)

671
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,508
(after waking up at 7am sharp.)

672
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,379
(Stretch first before running!)

673
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:05,279
(Athletic Ji Yeon's vibe radiates beyond the walls.)

674
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,019
(Flexible)

675
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,859
(She gets her body properly warmed up.)

676
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,388
Let's go.

677
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:13,459
(Let's go!)

678
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:15,929
(Ready for takeoff)

679
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,569
(Today's running route)

680
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,429
(Excited)

681
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,239
One, two.

682
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,569
One, two.

683
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,239
This is nice.

684
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,379
What a perfect view.

685
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,578
(The privilege of a morning run)

686
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,699
(Enjoying the refreshing scenery of Hapyeong Village)

687
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,579
(Running along the farm road early in the morning)

688
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:42,689
Breathing in the smell of compost...

689
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,489
while running...

690
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,859
feels nice.

691
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,629
I feel so refreshed.

692
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,068
Jung Ah must be up by now.

693
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,098
(Jung Ah must be up by now.)

694
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:59,669
(While Ji Yeon is running energetically, the rest are...)

695
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,369
(running in their sleep.)

696
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:06,379
(Hye Yoon is sound asleep surrounded by steam.)

697
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,019
(Suddenly sitting up)

698
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,889
(Jun Myun quickly turns off the alarm.)

699
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,788
- What time is it?
- 7:15am.

700
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,088
- It's 7:15am? Hey, aren't you...
- Yes.

701
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,198
Going to work out?

702
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,798
- This isn't Ji Yeon.
- She left already.

703
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,899
Ji Yeon left.

704
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,768
(This is Hye Yoon, not Ji Yeon.)

705
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,169
- Gosh.
- I thought it was Ji Yeon.

706
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,239
(Ji Yeon arrives home shortly after.)

707
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:41,108
That was 32 minutes and 30 seconds.

708
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,918
Distance, 5km.

709
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,479
Ending workout.

710
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,719
I ran exactly 5km.

711
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:49,488
You're up.

712
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:50,489
(Ji Yeon is back.)

713
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,058
- Good morning.
- Did you enjoy your run?

714
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,229
(Yes, I did.)

715
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:00,399
(Hye Yoon returns to the room after washing up...)

716
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:06,709
(and quickly tidies up the bedding.)

717
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,609
(Shaking)

718
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,709
(Folding)

719
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:17,679
(She finishes tidying up in no time and heads out of the room.)

720
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:20,419
- Did you wash up?
- Yes.

721
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:24,089
(Hopping)

722
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,729
How much aged kimchi do we need?

723
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,429
When we roll the aged kimchi...

724
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,499
That's actually quite tasty. I...

725
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,198
At home, I rinse aged kimchi in water...

726
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,669
and roll it with canned tuna and mayonnaise.

727
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,669
- It's good.
- Is it?

728
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,738
(Using the kimchi that. Sauce Park brought, )

729
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,649
(they're making aged kimchi tuna rolls.)

730
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,649
- Two heads?
- Yes!

731
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,559
- Two heads should be enough.
- Two heads.

732
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,818
- That should be perfect.
- I'll wash...

733
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,759
I'll wash off the seasoning.

734
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,529
There shouldn't be any chili powder left.

735
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,999
(She thoroughly rinses between the cabbage leaves.)

736
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:09,469
Tear off a small piece for me,

737
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,169
so I can have a taste.

738
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,398
Let's see.

739
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,739
(Jun Myun tries a leaf to taste.)

740
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,338
(The aged kimchi is. well-fermented.)

741
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:19,849
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's good.

742
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:22,978
(Jung Ah also tries a leaf of the sweet and sour aged kimchi.)

743
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,049
Is it too salty?

744
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:25,719
- Is it good?
- Yes.

745
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,759
It's not too fermented.

746
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,789
It's perfect.

747
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,329
(The ingredients are laid out.)

748
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,459
(The aged kimchi tuna rolls will be made with...)

749
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,999
(canned tuna.)

750
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,168
Goodness.

751
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:46,569
(Chef Yum will be rolling the aged kimchi tuna rolls.)

752
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,509
(Shaking the canned tuna)

753
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,579
This tastes best when mixed with rice right away.

754
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,349
Mix it with rice right away.

755
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:00,119
(The canned tuna with mayonnaise and sesame oil...)

756
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,319
(is mixed thoroughly with rice.)

757
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:10,599
(Add whatever toppings you want.)

758
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:15,429
(Jung Ah chose Cheongyang pepper to give it a spicy kick.)

759
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,469
(Here comes the next ingredient.)

760
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:22,038
(Instead of dried laver, she lines the bamboo mat...)

761
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,779
(with tangy aged kimchi.)

762
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,878
And we can eat these right away.

763
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,879
(She spreads the tuna mayo rice evenly over the aged kimchi.)

764
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,119
(With the rice packed in place, )

765
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,389
(it's now time...)

766
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,989
(to roll it up.)

767
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,959
(Making sounds with her mouth)

768
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:47,469
(Roll it up tightly, just like you would with gimbap.)

769
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,039
(The aged kimchi tuna roll came out perfectly plump and tight.)

770
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,008
(The finale of the aged kimchi tuna roll)

771
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,809
(Cutting the roll into pieces)

772
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,609
Can I try the end piece?

773
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:00,909
- You want to?
- Yes.

774
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,679
(The Fresh taste-tester takes a quick bite.)

775
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,019
(Yum)

776
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,019
Isn't it good?

777
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:09,319
(It tastes great.)

778
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,679
It's so good, Jung Ah. Seriously.

779
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,129
- You like it?
- Yes.

780
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:18,359
(As Jung Ah neatly slices the roll, )

781
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:22,429
(pieces of the aged kimchi tuna roll pile up on the plate.)

782
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:30,879
(Generous Jung Ah isn't satisfied with just one roll.)

783
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,849
(She rolls up another one firmly.)

784
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,449
(Patting down both ends)

785
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,089
(She cuts it gently so it doesn't break apart.)

786
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,318
This one is finished. Just a second.

787
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,159
(Just like that, one plate is ready to serve.)

788
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,369
Today, I went for a denim-on-denim look.

789
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,438
I actually pull it off pretty well.

790
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,238
It's perfect.

791
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,109
You know, not anyone can rock a denim-on-denim outfit.

792
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,279
Oh, I see.

793
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,909
You're right. Not anyone can.

794
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,149
What?

795
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,919
What are you doing?

796
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,689
What are you doing?

797
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,389
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

798
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:21,189
This is the one outfit I ambitiously packed to dress up in.

799
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,858
I brought this to wear on our outing during our last day here.

800
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:26,669
What is this? Go change into something else.

801
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,075
- You two have the same faces too.
- I don't have other options either.

802
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,299
We can't go out like this. It's too embarrassing!

803
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,569
(Scoffing)

804
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,468
I can't believe this.

805
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,738
I had this hung up in there for all three days.

806
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:37,778
- Gosh.
- Why are you acting like...

807
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:38,938
you're just now seeing this?

808
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:41,049
This is humiliating. What's wrong with him?

809
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:44,079
- The collars are the same too.
- Even on the first day,

810
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,318
our outfits overlapped a bit. We both wore blue.

811
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,989
The two of you have identical faces too.

812
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,619
(A denim disaster)

813
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,118
Both of you, just wear it...

814
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,618
- like twins.
- You should both just wear it.

815
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,059
We can't. It's too embarrassing.

816
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,599
Guys, look over here.

817
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,359
Having footage of this is embarrassing enough.

818
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,599
This is too funny.

819
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,469
(Can you tell who's who?)

820
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,808
(Hye Yoon is also checking out their twinning denim outfits.)

821
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:09,509
Hye Yoon, go stand over there.

822
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,039
- Over here?
- No, go stand on the right.

823
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,155
- I'll take a picture of you.
- Okay.

824
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,460
I wanted to take a photo of you because you look so cute.

825
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:19,549
(Striking a pose with a hair roller in her bangs)

826
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,189
You look like a model.

827
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:22,189
(Did the picture turn out okay?)

828
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,218
(Putting her phone away)

829
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,159
- Aren't you going to show me?
- No.

830
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:26,628
I see.

831
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:28,865
(I said I was going to take a photo, not show you the photo.)

832
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,429
(The model did all the work.)

833
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,875
Is that all? Is there anything else to bring to the table?

834
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:36,639
- All we need is the soup.
- Soup.

835
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,819
(Ji Yeon is already pouring the soup into separate bowls.)

836
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,909
Gosh, this looks great.

837
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:45,309
(In awe)

838
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,448
This is insane.

839
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:47,808
(They made the dried radish greens bean sprouts soup yesterday.)

840
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,279
This looks amazing.

841
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:51,019
(Here comes the delivery girl.)

842
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,679
(Glancing over at her)

843
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:55,449
It feels like I'm looking at myself whenever I see her.

844
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:56,819
(In despair)

845
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,389
Someone who looks like me is walking in the same clothes as me.

846
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:04,158
(Jae Wook... No, Ji Yeon sets the bowls of soup on the table.)

847
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,869
Gosh, how did you make these so easily?

848
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:09,249
Jung Ah, how did you make the rolls so quickly?

849
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:10,899
There wasn't much to do.

850
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,868
- The canned tuna is pre-seasoned.
- They look so good.

851
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,269
(A quick and easy breakfast spread)

852
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:17,809
Hye Yoon, I think we'll be done if you set this on the table.

853
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:18,909
Okay.

854
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,248
(The second plate is full of pieces of the aged kimchi tuna roll.)

855
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:23,529
We'll just put this on the side.

856
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:25,678
(Hye Yoon moves the plate to the breakfast table.)

857
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,189
Just in case you want more.

858
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,189
All right. Let's eat.

859
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:31,589
- Okay. Are we all set?
- Yes.

860
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,329
Gosh, breakfast.

861
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,428
- Everything looks so good.
- You said this was a simple meal.

862
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,798
- It is a simple meal.
- No, it's not.

863
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,759
(Today's breakfast was. quickly thrown together.)

864
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,969
(Aged kimchi tuna rolls packed with sesame-oil-rich tuna mayo rice)

865
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:49,389
(Dried radish greens bean sprouts soup that is refreshing and spicy)

866
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:52,409
(Fresh cucumber kimchi perfect for a fresh morning)

867
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:56,719
(A simple yet hearty breakfast)

868
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,778
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

869
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,489
(Thank you for another good meal!)

870
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,919
(Hye Yoon first takes a bite of the aged kimchi tuna roll.)

871
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,459
(Yum)

872
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,659
(My friend's really enjoying the food.)

873
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,039
(Jae Wook follows her lead and tries the aged kimchi tuna roll.)

874
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,368
It's good, right?

875
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:21,409
(Crunchy)

876
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:23,909
This is very good.

877
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,409
(Chef Yum takes a bite to check if the roll turned out good.)

878
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:32,279
(Nice)

879
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,019
This seems simple and easy to make.

880
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,959
- It's easy enough for you to make.
- Totally.

881
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:40,420
There's sesame oil inside, so all you have to do is mix it with rice.

882
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:43,258
Doesn't the sauce pair perfectly with the aged kimchi?

883
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,259
- It's so good.
- Yes.

884
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,375
- On top of that, tuna is protein.
- Right.

885
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,719
So it's good for muscle building.

886
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,575
This is just what you need since you just finished working out.

887
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,599
Yes, it's perfect.

888
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:56,539
(Eating protein is a must after working out.)

889
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,139
(Crunchy)

890
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,539
(Yum)

891
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,679
This is so good.

892
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:06,019
The tuna goes so well with the aged kimchi.

893
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,119
It does.

894
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:11,789
(Jun Myun tries the aged kimchi tuna roll made with her kimchi.)

895
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:13,359
It's really...

896
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,359
- It's so good.
- It really is.

897
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:18,299
(Chef Yum is loving their reaction.)

898
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,898
(After a bite of the aged kimchi tuna roll, )

899
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:22,899
It's so refreshing.

900
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,580
(she eats a spoonful of the dried radish greens bean sprouts soup.)

901
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,039
(A hot bowl of soup is perfect for warming you up in the morning.)

902
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,739
(It's so tasty.)

903
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,409
(The dried radish greens are tender from being well-cooked.)

904
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:39,179
(The soup brings a smile to Jun Myun's face.)

905
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,589
(Hye Yoon scoops up plenty of the ingredients...)

906
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,859
(and puts them all in her mouth.)

907
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:49,329
It's good.

908
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,229
(Watching the younger members enjoy the food)

909
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:52,859
What is it?

910
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,975
I'm glad we had the dried radish greens ready from before.

911
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,399
We could use them like this.

912
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,008
We cooked these dried radish greens in advance.

913
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:01,838
(They had cooked the dried radish greens in Gangwon Province.)

914
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,309
Back at our first filming location.

915
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:05,779
Really?

916
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,379
Leaving it to sit for a day brought out the flavors.

917
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,888
(Hot dried radish greens bean sprouts soup...)

918
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,659
(and tangy and light-aged kimchi tuna rolls)

919
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:19,219
(They are right up Hye Yoon's alley.)

920
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,658
These are so good.

921
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,059
(Seeing Hye Yoon enjoy the food...)

922
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,799
(is making Jung Ah want to eat more of the aged kimchi tuna rolls.)

923
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,839
(With everyone...)

924
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,409
(gradually digging in, )

925
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,108
That was amazing.

926
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,549
(the plates are completely cleared.)

927
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,739
They were so good.

928
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:41,449
They were really good.

929
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,479
(Proud)

930
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,678
- The weather is great today.
- Right.

931
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,725
(The morning sky feels especially clear today.)

932
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:50,689
I heard there's a green barley field nearby.

933
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,588
(On such a lovely day, they head out to a nearby green barley field.)

934
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:57,229
- It's perfect for today's weather.
- It must be really beautiful.

935
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,229
(They add a touch of spring using a handkerchief.)

936
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,099
(Hye Yoon gets dressed up too.)

937
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:09,169
(Jae Wook ties one around his face like "The Little Matchstick Girl.")

938
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,579
(He must love it since he keeps pacing in front of the mirror.)

939
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:14,609
Gosh. There's a mirror over here...

940
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:16,378
and a mirror over there.

941
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:18,655
(There's a mirror in front of him and another mirror behind him.)

942
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,748
Gosh.

943
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:21,789
(A mirror image)

944
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,959
(They're so cute.)

945
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,589
(Laughing)

946
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,329
(They're all ready to go on their outing!)

947
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:33,029
We should all film a dance challenge at the green barley field.

948
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:34,968
The "I'll Be Missing You" dance challenge.

949
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:39,568
(While we're at it, let's film a dance challenge to remember.)

950
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,568
Let's give it a shot. One, two.

951
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:42,569
(Let's practice first.)

952
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,308
One, two, three, four.

953
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,209
One, two, three. Clap.

954
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,308
One, two, three, four.

955
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:50,749
One, two, three.

956
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,819
- One, two, three, four. One, two...
- One, two, three, four.

957
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:56,078
One, two, three. Clap.

958
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,119
One, two, three, four.

959
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,649
One, two, three.

960
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:02,859
- One, two, three, four. One, two...
- One, two, three, four.

961
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,659
(Stiff)

962
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,128
(No-rhythm Yum has returned.)

963
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:08,499
- How do I do it?
- Jung Ah.

964
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,429
Come stand over here.

965
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:11,898
- What?
- Three, four.

966
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:16,239
One, two, three, four. Like this.

967
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,739
Jung Ah. Do you think you can do this?

968
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,808
- Move your feet like this.
- I see.

969
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:22,978
(On the beat)

970
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:24,779
(Off the beat)

971
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:27,519
Clap once.

972
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,119
I don't think we can film this. We're in trouble, Jung Ah.

973
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:34,069
I thought I could do it, but I can't.

974
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:38,358
I don't think I can film it because it's too funny.

975
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,929
(Giving up teaching her)

976
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:42,158
- Isn't it so good?
- She doesn't stop practicing.

977
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,875
(Trying hard, even with no sense of rhythm)

978
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:45,619
I'll walk like this until I get to the car.

979
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:48,468
How do I do this? What was it?

980
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,189
(Jung Ah's journey with no sense of rhythm)

981
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,338
(Taking forever to get to the car)

982
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,909
(Wobbling)

983
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,479
(Losing the beat)

984
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:01,249
(Are we going to make it?)

985
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:04,149
Let's go.

986
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,019
(Typing)

987
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,859
It's playing. Nice work, Ji Yeon.

988
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:15,959
(Turning up the volume)

989
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,528
(Getting excited)

990
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,569
(Moving to the beat)

991
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,369
(Glancing)

992
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,009
(Moving to the beat)

993
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,208
One, two, three, four.

994
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:29,338
Shake your body. Clap once.

995
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,478
Once. One, two, three, four.

996
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:33,479
(Practicing hard)

997
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,749
Hand up.

998
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:38,088
Hand up. Freestyle.

999
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:40,048
One, two, three, four.

1000
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:42,018
And that is it. Okay?

1001
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,089
Okay.

1002
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:48,029
(Driving for some time while practicing)

1003
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:59,369
(Hye Yoon is taking a nap with Ji Yeon's care.)

1004
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,949
(Taking a nap together)

1005
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,059
- Everyone. We're almost there.
- Okay.

1006
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,458
- It's good.
- Cool.

1007
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:19,028
(The vast green field is getting closer.)

1008
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:20,289
It's really big.

1009
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,828
- It's so big.
- It's beautiful.

1010
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,468
(Boryeong Green Barley Field with greenery under the blue sky)

1011
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:26,669
It's so pretty.

1012
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:28,699
- It's like a picture.
- Yes.

1013
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,709
- It's really beautiful.
- It's so pretty.

1014
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:35,108
(Fresh green waves welcome them.)

1015
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,979
(April is the greenest month.)

1016
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:41,279
(On top of the hill)

1017
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,849
(There is a cafe.)

1018
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:52,488
(Where the sky and the earth)

1019
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,259
(seem to meet)

1020
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:00,229
Every direction I look is beautiful.

1021
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:01,569
It's so beautiful.

1022
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,108
I've never seen a place like this.

1023
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,839
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

1024
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:11,078
(Turning around)

1025
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,349
It's so pretty.

1026
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:16,378
We should take a picture on this path.

1027
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:17,389
Each of us alone.

1028
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,288
This is a good spot for a photo.

1029
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:21,959
- It's so pretty.
- I'm next.

1030
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:23,689
You're cute.

1031
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,035
(Jun Myun is taking several shots with different poses.)

1032
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,189
It's worth taking a photo.

1033
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:29,129
(On the green barley)

1034
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:31,128
She looks like the daughter of the green barley field.

1035
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,145
(She's the daughter of the green barley field today.)

1036
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:34,809
With the building behind me. That's good.

1037
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,398
I should be in the center.

1038
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,479
If I put you in the center, I can't see the building

1039
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:41,438
He's so picky.

1040
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,479
(He's picky.)

1041
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:43,878
- Is that what you wanted?
- Yes. I'm glad.

1042
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:44,949
- Are you?
- Yes.

1043
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,578
(The Fresh members came to the green barley field.)

1044
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,649
Let's have coffee.

1045
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:52,088
(Looking at the photos while taking a break)

1046
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:53,249
She's so cute.

1047
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,389
(Making a cheek heart)

1048
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,789
(Continuing to take photos)

1049
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:01,528
(Thinking)

1050
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,929
By the way, so...

1051
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:05,728
To film this,

1052
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,538
- will that spot be the best?
- Yes.

1053
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:08,639
- The floor?
- Yes.

1054
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:11,208
- Here?
- I think...

1055
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,509
(Can they dance on the pebbles?)

1056
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:13,809
(Staring)

1057
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,779
The green barley will be seen behind us.

1058
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:18,308
Why? Are you worried it'll be hard to dance?

1059
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,578
- Yes.
- Can you dance on the better floor?

1060
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,419
(Embarrassed)

1061
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:26,849
(Laughing)

1062
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,158
Let's go out.

1063
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,189
Go!

1064
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,589
One, two, three, four.

1065
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:33,788
(Looking like having fun)

1066
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:34,798
Clap.

1067
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:36,829
(Awkward, off the beat, stiff, shy)

1068
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,799
(Shy)

1069
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,138
Freestyle.

1070
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:43,599
(Away from the formation)

1071
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,568
It's done. How does it look?

1072
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:47,709
(Will it turn out well?)

1073
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:51,279
(Ji Yeon looks a bit disappointed.)

1074
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,419
Everyone, listen.

1075
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,688
We should have fun without worrying about movements.

1076
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,918
- We don't look fun, do we?
- No. We should look fun.

1077
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:05,088
We look too serious. At the end, when we dance...

1078
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,258
When we do freestyle, we can jump.

1079
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:08,558
I think we need to look fun.

1080
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,898
At the part of "missing you,"

1081
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:12,668
- how about dancing like this?
- I like it.

1082
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:13,698
Okay, Pancake Im.

1083
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,798
(Got it.)

1084
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:18,708
This place is narrow and the shot is vertical, so...

1085
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:19,838
(Then...)

1086
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,709
(Changing the location)

1087
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,309
Five, two, three, four.

1088
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,308
(Big smile)

1089
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:28,749
(Smooth groove)

1090
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,619
(Dancing in sync)

1091
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,948
(Pointing with a finger)

1092
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,049
(Pointing with a finger)

1093
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:39,459
(I'll Be Missing You dance challenge is completed.)

1094
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:44,128
I'll take a nice shot for you. I got it.

1095
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,599
- I'll stay like this.
- While we're chatting,

1096
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:48,768
we look at the front at one point.

1097
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,668
Then, you stand up. That's it.

1098
00:47:50,669 --> 00:47:51,829
(Height difference challenge)

1099
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,539
It's a video to tease short people.

1100
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:58,278
(Watching)

1101
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:00,009
- Like this.
- While we're talking.

1102
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,578
(Getting taller)

1103
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,019
(Getting much taller)

1104
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:05,888
(Hye Yoon and...)

1105
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,759
(Jae Wook tree)

1106
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,588
(The ideal height difference for a couple is the key.)

1107
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,359
(Result)

1108
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:20,869
(Cute)

1109
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:23,598
(Someone shows up to Jae Wook.)

1110
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,338
I feel all fluttery inside.

1111
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:26,468
(His new fiancee?)

1112
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:27,589
- Am I just standing?
- Yes.

1113
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:29,809
(Laughing)

1114
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:31,149
Don't laugh like that.

1115
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:33,449
(But I can't stop laughing.)

1116
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,548
On count two, I'm standing up.

1117
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:38,149
(The old couple)

1118
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:41,189
(Height difference challenge with Jun Myun)

1119
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:42,419
Go away.

1120
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,859
(Like a cat and dog)

1121
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:48,398
(Celebrating on completing challenges)

1122
00:48:48,399 --> 00:48:49,529
It's pretty.

1123
00:48:50,529 --> 00:48:51,529
This is it.

1124
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,529
(It's fun.)

1125
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:55,939
It looks like she's cooking when she does.

1126
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,408
You're controlling the bubbles.

1127
00:48:58,409 --> 00:48:59,839
Now, I know how to do it.

1128
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:04,608
Ji Yeon likes this kind of thing. She really does.

1129
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,009
(She's tasting the bubbles.)

1130
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:07,989
- Let's do it together.
- Let's do it at once.

1131
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,448
- Let's do it at once.
- Everybody, take one each.

1132
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,818
(Memories that fall drop by drop with bubbles on the barley field.)

1133
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:11,919
That was nice.

1134
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,459
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

1135
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,488
The colors of the sky and the green barley are pretty.

1136
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,099
(Warm sunshine and greenery)

1137
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:23,599
It was really amazing.

1138
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:28,769
(The perfect outing to the green barley field)

1139
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,338
We're home.

1140
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,839
- We're back.
- We're back.

1141
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,809
- Should I start to cook ramyeon?
- Yes.

1142
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:40,749
(Today's lunch is ramyeon!)

1143
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,818
(It's not an ordinary ramyeon.)

1144
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,889
I'm going to add webfoot octopus to make it like jjamppong

1145
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:49,059
(Collaboration of Jae Wook and Boryeong)

1146
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:52,459
(Aromatic and sweet scallions of Ungcheon)

1147
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:54,029
Egg-filled webfoot octopus.

1148
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,258
(Egg-filled webfoot octopus they caught yesterday)

1149
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:58,129
(From the land and sea of Boryeong)

1150
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,339
(Jae Wook's webfoot octopus ramyeon is coming soon.)

1151
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:06,469
(The main ingredient is webfoot octopus.)

1152
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:08,639
- Will you use scallions?
- Yes, I will.

1153
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:12,149
(Today's sous-chef is Jung Ah.)

1154
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,948
(Here are the scallions.)

1155
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:16,349
- These are washed.
- Should I do it with flour?

1156
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:17,718
Here is the flour.

1157
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,949
(She bought the flour.)

1158
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:23,289
(Thanks to Jung Ah, all the ingredients are ready.)

1159
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,328
Four?

1160
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:28,358
(Four webfoot octopus)

1161
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,728
- About this much?
- Yes.

1162
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,299
(Big ones)

1163
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:36,199
(Washing the webfoot octopus with flour)

1164
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:40,809
(While Jae Wook is washing webfoot octopus with flour, )

1165
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:42,809
(today's sous-chef...)

1166
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,779
(is cutting scallions.)

1167
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:48,619
(Preparing Cheongyang pepper)

1168
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,019
- I'll put this outside, Jae Wook.
- Yes.

1169
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,419
(Working well together)

1170
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,789
(Everyone is busy preparing lunch.)

1171
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:04,969
(She doesn't know what to do.)

1172
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,169
Hye Yoon, rest lying down here.

1173
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,339
You can do yoga.

1174
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,039
Yoga?

1175
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,409
(A bit too much consideration for the guest)

1176
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,009
(Wandering)

1177
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:23,679
(Hye Yoon is looking for something to do.)

1178
00:51:24,589 --> 00:51:27,919
(Many people are at the sink.)

1179
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,759
(I want to do something.)

1180
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,199
(Getting a dishcloth)

1181
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,969
(Since everyone is busy, )

1182
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:46,139
(I'll wipe the table, at least.)

1183
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,109
(Setting up the utensils)

1184
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:52,548
(Wiping the floor)

1185
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:54,779
(Fashion style of the spring girl)

1186
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:59,489
I'm cleaning with my sunglasses on.

1187
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:01,919
I wiped it all.

1188
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:06,589
(She cleaned the floor.)

1189
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:10,229
(She is now washing the dishes.)

1190
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:15,069
(Jae Wook is starting to cook the webfoot octopus jjamppong ramyeon.)

1191
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,369
(Turning on the stove)

1192
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:20,439
(Pouring)

1193
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,379
(Pouring oil, not water, when making ramyeon?)

1194
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:29,679
(Next up is the scallions.)

00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,319
(Cutting the scallions)

1196
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,388
(The essence of jjamppong ramyeon is the scallion oil)

1197
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:39,489
(A handful of scallions from Ungcheon)

1198
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:43,029
(The aroma of scallions is spreading.)

1199
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,529
(Next up is soy sauce.)

1200
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,869
(Stir-frying soy sauce in scallion oil)

1201
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:58,049
(Controlling the heat to prevent it from burning)

1202
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,148
(Jae Wook's tip)

1203
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:02,078
(You can add a smoky flavor...)

1204
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,079
(by stir-frying soy sauce in the scallion oil.)

1205
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:06,219
Ji Yeon, can you open the soup powder?

1206
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:07,648
Of course.

1207
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:08,818
(Cooking ramyeon is about speed.)

1208
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,495
(Ji Yeon, setting the side dishes, helps with the ramyeon.)

1209
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:13,259
(Soy sauce and scallions are stir-fried nicely.)

1210
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:15,859
Put everything into it.

1211
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,809
(Putting soup powder before adding water?)

1212
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,809
(Stir-frying the soup powder in scallion oil)

1213
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:32,978
(The second tip of Jae Wook's jjamppong ramyeon)

1214
00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:35,919
(Stir-frying the soup powder first to maximize a smoky flavor)

1215
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:39,249
(Jae Wook's ramyeon is being cooked with care.)

1216
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,219
(The soup powder and scallion oil are mixed well.)

1217
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:47,589
(Finally, adding water)

1218
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:54,799
(Suddenly looking like jjamppong)

1219
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:59,369
(Drizzling chili oil for a rich flavor)

1220
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:04,809
(Once adding noodles and webfoot octopus, it is done.)

1221
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,779
We just need to cook the noodles now, right?

1222
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:10,379
I just need to add noodles and webfoot octopus.

1223
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:14,089
(When Jae Wook's special soup is boiling, )

1224
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:19,059
(adding noodles.)

1225
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:23,399
(Adding 5 noodles for 5 people)

1226
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:25,699
Do you want to add eggs?

1227
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:28,069
I'm fine with either way.

1228
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,069
It needs to suit the ramyeon.

1229
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,809
- I don't think it suits.
- Yes.

1230
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,139
- Won't it suit?
- No.

1231
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,008
Eggs and webfoot octopus.

1232
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:38,009
(Eggs and webfoot octopus won't go well together.)

1233
00:54:38,379 --> 00:54:41,719
(As she requested, adding only webfoot octopus)

1234
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:45,319
(Onto the beautiful noodles, )

1235
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:49,059
(adding the main ingredient)

1236
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:54,929
(Adding large webfoot octopus, today's main ingredient.)

1237
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,899
(Dipping)

1238
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:04,168
(Dipping webfoot octopus makes it cook in a nice shape.)

1239
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:06,809
(Showering in the soup)

1240
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,039
(The webfoot octopus flower is blooming.)

1241
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:11,909
It looks delicious.

1242
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,779
(One at a time with care)

1243
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,359
(Blooming)

1244
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:31,469
(Continuing to dip it to make it taste better.)

1245
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,398
(Red soup filled with webfoot octopus)

1246
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,769
(Looking just like jjamppong)

1247
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:48,578
(This is high-quality cooking.)

1248
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,279
Ramyeon was a great choice.

1249
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:51,689
It looks so delicious.

1250
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:55,889
It really looks like jjamppong.

1251
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,359
(Watching it speechlessly)

1252
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,098
(The sweetness of scallions)

1253
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,458
(The savory taste of webfoot octopus)

1254
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:05,968
(Jae Wook's earnestness)

1255
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:08,239
(Full of those)

1256
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:12,869
(Webfoot octopus jjamppong ramyeon)

1257
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:15,738
(Bringing the whole pot)

1258
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,838
The pot is pretty big,

1259
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:18,079
so I need more space to put it.

1260
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:19,308
Thank you.

1261
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,949
(Surprising)

1262
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:24,719
(It's not done, Jung Ah.)

1263
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,648
- It looks amazing.
- It's great.

1264
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,118
This is awesome.

1265
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,679
(Fresh scallions and Cheongyang pepper)

1266
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:31,629
Okay. It's done.

1267
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,729
It looks delicious.

1268
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:40,469
(Rich in smoky aroma)

1269
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:47,169
(Lunch made with ingredients from Boryeong)

1270
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:52,049
(Taking the noodles out before it gets soggy)

1271
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:59,919
(Taking out tender webfoot octopus)

1272
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,989
(Adding webfoot octopus on the top)

1273
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:08,899
(Jung Ah pours soup over the noodles.)

1274
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:10,499
Jung Ah, please give me a lot.

1275
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:12,899
(Got it.)

1276
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,638
The bowl with a lot of noodles is for Ji Yeon.

1277
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,639
(Double portions for Ji Yeon)

1278
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,509
(Serving is done.)

1279
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,778
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

1280
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:26,309
(Shall we eat webfoot octopus jjamppong ramyeon?)

1281
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:30,379
(Slurping without hesitation)

1282
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:35,119
This is so good.

1283
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:36,819
This is insane.

1284
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:41,088
(Eating it right away)

1285
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:42,228
(Surprising)

1286
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:45,499
(Admiring)

1287
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:50,369
(Perfectly cooked noodles)

1288
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:54,809
(He's such a great cook.)

1289
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,479
(Eating ramyeon together, wearing a floral scarf)

1290
00:58:00,379 --> 00:58:02,579
(Do you like it?)

1291
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,619
How did you make the soup?

1292
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:06,995
What else did you put beside the soup powder?

1293
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:08,558
I stir-fried soy sauce until it was almost burned.

1294
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,688
I see. You made a smoky flavor with soy sauce.

1295
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,758
(He's a great cook.)

1296
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,929
It's webfoot octopus jjamppong ramyeon.

1297
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:16,535
- It tastes like jjamppong.
- It's so good.

1298
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,858
- This ramyeon is great.
- It's good.

1299
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:18,899
(It tastes good.)

1300
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,999
(Once they like it, )

1301
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:25,439
(Jae Wook is eating at ease.)

1302
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:26,939
It's really good.

1303
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,749
(Spicy soup with a smoky flavor)

1304
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,949
(Satisfied)

1305
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:39,819
(She can't stop eating it with a nice spicy flavor.)

1306
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:42,659
(Her cheeks are filled with ramyeon.)

1307
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,619
(Admiring)

1308
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:48,228
(Eating webfoot octopus)

1309
00:58:48,229 --> 00:58:51,669
(Tender and savory)

1310
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:55,769
(Eating it holding the bowl)

1311
00:58:55,939 --> 00:58:58,339
(The soup also tastes amazing.)

1312
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,269
(It's incredibly good.)

1313
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,408
(I'm happy.)

1314
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,309
(Waving her head with happiness)

1315
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:13,919
(It's so good.)

1316
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,189
(Perfect noodles sparked her appetite.)

1317
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:21,499
It's good.

1318
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,999
(A taste that makes her feel good)

1319
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,969
- Hye Yoon is eating it well.
- Yes.

1320
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:29,899
(It's good.)

1321
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:32,709
(Thumbs up)

1322
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:35,309
How was it, Hye Yoon?

1323
00:59:37,879 --> 00:59:40,279
It felt like I'd been in this show...

1324
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:42,618
- from the beginning.
- Is that so?

1325
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:43,718
You felt comfortable, didn't you?

1326
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:46,219
Yes. It didn’t feel like it was my first time on the show.

1327
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:47,849
We felt the same.

1328
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,358
- Did you?
- We fell for you right away.

1329
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,359
We felt the same way.

1330
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,259
It was so natural.

1331
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:54,159
She worked so well.

1332
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:56,529
She looks like she works smart.

1333
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,529
(Hye Yoon feels shy as they compliment her a lot.)

1334
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:01,068
Thanks.

1335
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:02,299
(Thanks.)

1336
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,269
We ate it all.

1337
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,669
We finished everything.

1338
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,938
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

1339
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,079
Thanks for the food.

1340
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:13,049
Do you want to take some scallion kimchi?

1341
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:14,479
I'd love that.

1342
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:17,378
Take it as it is.

1343
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:18,789
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1344
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,889
(It's like the holidays with the family.)

1345
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,959
(True hospitality is sharing kimchi.)

1346
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:31,059
It felt like I visited one of their houses.

1347
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:33,198
It was like I was on vacation,

1348
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,938
eating good food, and relaxing.

1349
01:00:34,939 --> 01:00:36,368
That's what I felt.

1350
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:37,698
I had a really good time.

1351
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:39,609
I'm just disappointed that time flew.

1352
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:43,639
(A month later)

1353
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:48,479
(Dolsan Island, Yeosu-si)

1354
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,789
(Seongdu Village)

1355
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:56,788
(A small town by the sea)

1356
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,029
Let's go.

1357
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:02,459
The weather is amazing.

1358
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:08,869
Yeosu night sea.

1359
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,439
(Walking with excitement)

1360
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:16,039
It brings back a lot of memories.

1361
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,148
(Dex of Fresh members)

1362
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:22,149
I'd never imagined I'd come here as a guest.

1363
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:26,218
(Jin Young is here.)

1364
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:27,688
I feel so weird.

1365
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:29,819
(He came even before Fresh members.)

1366
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:32,188
It feels good...

1367
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,429
to be back in Yeosu because it's familiar.

1368
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,058
(The clarity of Namhae and...)

1369
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:41,499
(its fresh seafood)

1370
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,738
(Under the warm sunlight, )

1371
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:45,869
(its greeneries greet us.)

1372
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,709
(Yeosu, a beautiful port city)

1373
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,278
(The biggest island in Yeosu)

1374
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:56,019
(We came to Dolsan Island.)

1375
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,749
They're working on namul.

1376
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:02,689
Hi, how are you?

1377
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,818
Is it spinach?

1378
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:05,859
They're dandelions.

1379
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,759
Do you season the dandelions?

1380
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,458
We make fresh kimchi with it.

1381
01:02:10,459 --> 01:02:11,929
It's made into fresh kimchi.

1382
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13,399
Thanks.

1383
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:16,668
So dandelions are edible.

1384
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,015
(After a short conversation with a local, )

1385
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:20,669
(he reaches the Fresh House.)

1386
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,379
(There's a small dock in front of the sea.)

1387
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:26,449
It must be a very old tree.

1388
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:30,479
(The Fresh House is in front of the village's protected tree.)

1389
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:34,318
(It's nice to see them.)

1390
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,519
The bicycles got an upgrade.

1391
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:39,328
When I rode it last time,

1392
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,529
I almost died since the seat hurt so badly.

1393
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:43,898
(Some familiar things remained the same.)

1394
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,498
That won't happen now.

1395
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:46,799
(Some familiar things remain.)

1396
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:52,039
There's a doorplate that says "Fresh House" now.

1397
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:53,668
(Fresh House)

1398
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:56,039
(The Fresh House also has many new things.)

1399
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,509
(Peeking)

1400
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,679
(He carefully enters the Fresh House.)

1401
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,879
It has been a while.

1402
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,458
Hello. My goodness.

1403
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,699
(He says hello to the Fresh House of the second season.)

1404
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,489
I didn't know that such a house existed.

1405
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,258
(Chuckling)

1406
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:18,999
The shoes are cute.

1407
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:20,729
What are these?

1408
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:24,598
(Chuckling)

1409
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:25,938
(He puts his feet next to the members' shoes.)

1410
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:27,509
(Laughing)

1411
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:32,048
There are mushrooms too.

1412
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:33,578
(He looks around the Fresh House since it has been a while.)

1413
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:35,178
(Looking around)

1414
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:37,948
Where is the firewood? We'll need to build a fire.

1415
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:38,988
Let's see.

1416
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,365
(He's used to doing all the work as the youngest one.)

1417
01:03:40,389 --> 01:03:42,358
(He heads over to the storage as his body remembers.)

1418
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,689
Here it is.

1419
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:48,699
I'm sure Jae Wook is taking care of things well.

1420
01:03:50,529 --> 01:03:51,559
What's this?

1421
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:56,668
Photo. Gosh, they took many photos.

1422
01:03:56,669 --> 01:03:58,389
(There are photos on one side of the wall.)

1423
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,509
(They show the memories they've made so far.)

1424
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:06,349
Jae Wook is very handsome.

1425
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:12,349
Gosh, that's a danger to my position.

1426
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:13,949
(Laughing)

1427
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,589
(He looks at the fridge in the kitchen.)

1428
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:20,429
Let's see. They made pickles.

1429
01:04:21,229 --> 01:04:23,199
Scallion kimchi by Seasoning Park.

1430
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:25,199
Aged kimchi.

1431
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:27,328
Aged kimchi.

1432
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:29,175
(He's happy to see the Fresh members' side dishes.)

1433
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,169
(He checks the freezer as well.)

1434
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:32,869
Anchovies.

1435
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,968
(He closes the freezer right away.)

1436
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:37,439
I'm reminded of the time I caught anchovies.

1437
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:42,849
(While Dex is secretly hanging out in the house)

1438
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:46,218
(This place is a 15-minute walk from the Fresh House.)

1439
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,219
(Soyul Port, Dolsan Island)

1440
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:51,689
The weather turned so nice.

1441
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,288
We escaped the cold.

1442
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:56,075
(Ji Yeon and Jae Wook walk to savor the warm spring.)

1443
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:58,599
(The weather puts them in a good mood.)

1444
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:00,829
You looked so pretty at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

1445
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,769
(Embarrassed)

1446
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:04,768
(Ji Yeon looked hot while she did her main job.)

1447
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:06,309
The red dress was pretty.

1448
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,289
How did you suppress the urge to eat?

1449
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,939
For three days...

1450
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,409
Seriously.

1451
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,578
The timing was perfect.

1452
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,618
The Fresh off the Sea shoot came after the Baeksang Arts Awards.

1453
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:18,695
(After the Baeksang Arts Awards, Ji Yeon met the Fresh members.)

1454
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:21,489
Had it been the other way around, I would've struggled a lot.

1455
01:05:21,819 --> 01:05:23,419
(I wouldn't have been able to do it.)

1456
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,829
(Now, Ji Yeon can eat anything.)

1457
01:05:26,029 --> 01:05:27,088
(With a big appetite, )

1458
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,089
I think it's a raw fish restaurant.

1459
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,098
(they enter today's restaurant.)

1460
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:30,658
- Hello.
- Hello.

1461
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:32,729
(It's good to see you guys.)

1462
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:35,669
(They scan the menu first.)

1463
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:37,799
(Let's see.)

1464
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,115
- Will we catch hairtails?
- It has to be hairtails.

1465
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:42,079
I feel like it'll be hairtail.

1466
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,078
It has to be hairtails.

1467
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,079
(She gets a hunch.)

1468
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,648
(Jae Wook goes through the menu.)

1469
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:47,649
I'm hungry.

1470
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:48,649
(He becomes hungry.)

1471
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:50,619
I'm hungry.

1472
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,049
You lost weight.

1473
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,249
- Did I lose weight?
- Yes.

1474
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,488
(It's because I'm hungry.)

1475
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:57,258
It must be the actor mode.

1476
01:05:57,259 --> 01:05:58,259
No.

1477
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,588
I'm not on a diet. I'll play a beggar.

1478
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,429
- You? Will you play a beggar?
- Yes.

1479
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:05,128
- Really?
- Look at my hair.

1480
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:06,129
You know,

1481
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:10,168
people with a face like mine or Jae Wook's...

1482
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:11,469
suit the role of a beggar.

1483
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:15,539
- I...
- While playing Goo Deok,

1484
01:06:15,879 --> 01:06:18,378
I realized that my face was perfect for playing a slave.

1485
01:06:18,379 --> 01:06:20,449
I didn't know that.

1486
01:06:21,279 --> 01:06:23,199
- It suits me so well.
- It's bound to suit you.

1487
01:06:23,549 --> 01:06:25,149
- It suits me.
- I'm certain of it.

1488
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:26,519
It suits me so well.

1489
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:29,119
Hello.

1490
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,719
- You're here.
- Hello.

1491
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:33,688
You look great.

1492
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:34,969
(The four siblings finally met.)

1493
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:37,729
Jung Ah, doesn't it look like we'll catch hairtail?

1494
01:06:37,929 --> 01:06:39,599
There must be a hint.

1495
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:42,649
(They focus on labor since it's the most important.)

1496
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,269
It's here.

1497
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:46,208
- Hello.
- Hello.

1498
01:06:46,209 --> 01:06:47,369
Gosh, it looks delicious.

1499
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:49,139
(Impressed)

1500
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,279
(My goodness)

1501
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,578
(Their first meal in Yeosu makes their mouths water.)

1502
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:54,579
It looks so tasty.

1503
01:06:55,149 --> 01:06:56,878
(The savory Asian paddle crabs of Yeosu...)

1504
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:58,219
(and salty soy sauce meet.)

1505
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,949
(The specialty of Yeosu, marinated Asian paddle crabs)

1506
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:02,188
(Another dish that represents Yeosu, )

1507
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,219
(mustard green kimchi)

1508
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,189
(It's crunchier since it's made with mustard greens from Dolsan.)

1509
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,698
(Grey mullet, Japanese red seaperch)

1510
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:10,339
- Is the bottom one a grey mullet?
- Yes.

1511
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:12,828
It contains mustard greens.

1512
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,728
(The charming combination of doenjang and mustard greens, )

1513
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:16,969
(mustard green and doenjang soup)

1514
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:20,309
(If it ends here, it isn't a meal in Jeolla Province.)

1515
01:07:20,409 --> 01:07:21,878
Gosh, look at the scallion kimchi.

1516
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:23,155
(There are 2 types of kimchi. Scallion and radish green kimchi.)

1517
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:26,048
(A generous meal of Yeosu with 14 side dishes)

1518
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:28,549
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1519
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,379
I was hungry.

1520
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,389
(Let's eat first.)

1521
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:34,869
- Thank you for the food.
- Let me scoop it for you.

1522
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,119
Thank you.

1523
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:41,528
(You can judge a restaurant by its kimchi.)

1524
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:44,129
(She cuts the mustard green kimchi into bite-sized pieces.)

1525
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:47,529
(She tries a piece first.)

1526
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:50,569
(Impressed)

1527
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,539
This mustard green is so tasty.

1528
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:56,809
(She adds another piece right away.)

1529
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:58,608
(Upon hearing Jung Ah's exclaim, )

1530
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:02,418
(Jun Myun takes one piece.)

1531
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:03,419
(Jun Myun takes two pieces.)

1532
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:04,419
It's so tasty.

1533
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,418
This mustard green kimchi has been aged perfectly.

1534
01:08:07,419 --> 01:08:08,419
That's right.

1535
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:12,959
(Mustard green kimchi has a piquant and soft taste.)

1536
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:14,829
(Exclaiming)

1537
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,968
It's so tasty. Seriously.

1538
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,969
(It really suits Jung Ah's taste.)

1539
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,569
(By the way)

1540
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:26,939
Jung Ah, the mustard green kimchi...

1541
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:29,408
Is this mustard green?

1542
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:32,309
- Yes, it's mustard green.
- Does it look like green onion?

1543
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,609
It's mustard green.

1544
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,955
(This is what fresh mustard green looks like.)

1545
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,019
What did you think it was?

1546
01:08:37,519 --> 01:08:38,948
Of course, it's made with mustard green.

1547
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,349
It thought it meant "Fresh."

1548
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,258
(I see.)

1549
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:44,589
- Fresh kimchi?
- Yes.

1550
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:48,189
(It's kimchi made with mustard greens.)

1551
01:08:48,429 --> 01:08:51,099
- I don't think I've had it often.
- I see.

1552
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:53,469
It's understandable if you haven't had it often.

1553
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:54,968
(Poor mustard greens)

1554
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:56,038
(Ji Yeon isn't familiar with mustard greens.)

1555
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:57,438
Mustard greens are tasty.

1556
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,509
(Jung Ah falls in love with mustard greens.)

1557
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:02,639
It's so tasty. I fell in love with mustard greens.

1558
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,555
(She's obsessed with mustard green kimchi.)

1559
01:09:04,579 --> 01:09:06,079
(Jung Ah is eating with gusto.)

1560
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:08,719
- Shall we ask for more?
- Yes.

1561
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:11,648
(Here's a refill on the mustard green kimchi.)

1562
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:12,749
Thank you.

1563
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,719
(Let's cut the mustard green kimchi.)

1564
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,658
(Watching)

1565
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:21,259
How did she make it so tasty?

1566
01:09:21,959 --> 01:09:24,359
(There is love in her eyes.)

1567
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:27,168
(As soon as it's cut, )

1568
01:09:27,169 --> 01:09:29,699
(she resumes eating.)

1569
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:32,569
(She eats...)

1570
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:34,539
(and eats.)

1571
01:09:34,639 --> 01:09:36,599
What's up with me today? Why am I eating so much?

1572
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:38,878
(Jung Ah has a big appetite.)

1573
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:40,949
(She's eating with gusto.)

1574
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:43,489
I guess the food of Yeosu suits my taste.

1575
01:09:43,919 --> 01:09:46,318
(Yeosu leaves a good first impression.)

1576
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,389
I'll try the grey mullet.

1577
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,989
It's my first time eating grilled grey mullet.

1578
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,928
(A fresh grey mullet that's caught in the sea of Yeosu)

1579
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:55,089
Don't you usually eat it raw?

1580
01:09:55,129 --> 01:09:56,898
I think it's more common to eat it as raw fish.

1581
01:09:56,899 --> 01:09:58,528
(It's more common to eat it as raw fish.)

1582
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:02,469
(How does grilled grey mullet taste?)

1583
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:05,568
Grey mullet is tasty.

1584
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:06,609
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1585
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,679
(Ji Yeon takes a bite of the grey mullet.)

1586
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,139
(What?)

1587
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:13,478
- The flesh is so chewy.
- It's savory.

1588
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:14,799
- There is a lot to eat.
- Right.

1589
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:17,749
- It's so chewy. It's like meat.
- The flesh is...

1590
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:21,289
(There is a lot of the chewy and plump flesh.)

1591
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:25,759
(Happy)

1592
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,158
(Jae Wook's chopsticks go...)

1593
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,388
(to the marinated Asian paddle crabs.)

1594
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:29,398
It's tasty.

1595
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:33,068
(He picks up a leg...)

1596
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,769
(and puts it in his mouth.)

1597
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:37,199
It's so tasty.

1598
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:42,639
(The savory flavors come from the meat.)

1599
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,709
(Amazed)

1600
01:10:45,009 --> 01:10:47,548
The side dishes are so tasty. Jeolla Province doesn't disappoint.

1601
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:49,055
(Marinated Asian paddle crabs are the best in Yeosu.)

1602
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,748
The ingredients we can catch here...

1603
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:54,649
- are the crabs and the fishes.
- Yes.

1604
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:57,058
I don't think we'll get on a boat today.

1605
01:10:57,059 --> 01:10:58,189
I don't think so.

1606
01:10:58,419 --> 01:11:00,358
We're past the time to get on a boat.

1607
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:01,788
(The experienced worker even calculates the time.)

1608
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:06,099
Today, it'll be similar to the time we harvested scallions.

1609
01:11:06,769 --> 01:11:07,898
- The field?
- Yes.

1610
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:09,699
(They expect to work in a field.)

1611
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,338
The dishes that represent Yeosu are marinated Asian paddle crabs...

1612
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:14,245
- and mustard green kimchi.
- Mustard green kimchi.

1613
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:17,308
Will we harvest mustard greens?

1614
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,509
That's right. I think we'll work on the mustard greens.

1615
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:21,348
The dish is in the middle.

1616
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:22,379
There's a possibility.

1617
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,378
(Will they harvest mustard greens, )

1618
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:25,989
(the ingredient that represents Yeosu?)

1619
01:11:26,589 --> 01:11:28,289
Garlic scapes? Bellflower roots?

1620
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:29,589
Coastal hog fennel?

1621
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,288
- We might go in that direction.
- Yes.

1622
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,358
(She even covers the hidden dishes.)

1623
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:33,728
It might surprise us.

1624
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:34,729
Yes.

1625
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,098
Would you tell us what today's labor is about?

1626
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:41,028
(What is today's labor about?)

1627
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:43,799
The seasonal ingredient you'll work on today is...

1628
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,938
(Today's...)

1629
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:47,569
(labor involves...)

1630
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:50,739
Dolsan's mustard greens.

1631
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:53,109
It'll be my first time.

1632
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:56,679
(The pride of Yeosu)

1633
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,419
(Mustard greens)

1634
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:03,419
(The specialty of Dolsan Island, Yeosu is...)

1635
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:06,088
(the Dolsan mustard greens.)

1636
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:08,658
(More than 80 percent of Korean mustard greens...)

1637
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:10,029
(are harvested in Dolsan.)

1638
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:11,858
Yeosu is known for the mustard greens...

1639
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:12,898
that grew with the sea breeze.

1640
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:17,239
(They grow with Yeosu's sea breeze and warm sunlight.)

1641
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:19,838
(The texture is tender...)

1642
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:22,309
(and the taste is piquant.)

1643
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:26,749
(Today's seasonal ingredient, Dolsan mustard greens)

1644
01:12:27,549 --> 01:12:28,749
Mustard greens.

1645
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:30,809
Are there dishes you can make with mustard greens?

1646
01:12:31,149 --> 01:12:33,089
You usually make kimchi with mustard greens.

1647
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:36,418
(But you can't eat mustard green kimchi right away.)

1648
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:38,818
(Let's see.)

1649
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:41,228
Let's make water kimchi. Water mustard green kimchi.

1650
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:43,029
- That sounds good.
- We can eat it tomorrow.

1651
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:45,399
(How about the main dish?)

1652
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,629
It'll be nice to eat meat.

1653
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:49,869
Okay. Let's eat meat.

1654
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,879
We have some sour kimchi left, right?

1655
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:55,808
Let's buy pork belly and grill sour kimchi in lard.

1656
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:56,979
I love the idea.

1657
01:12:57,079 --> 01:12:59,609
(That sounds delicious.)

1658
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:01,308
What should we do then?

1659
01:13:01,309 --> 01:13:02,579
We should make a lot of money.

1660
01:13:03,419 --> 01:13:05,279
We need to make a lot of money to buy meat.

1661
01:13:05,379 --> 01:13:06,449
I'll work hard.

1662
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:08,588
Let's get going.

1663
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:11,459
(15 minutes before the siblings arrive in the house)

1664
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,788
Anyway, they'll be here soon.

1665
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:16,199
I'll hide my suitcase...

1666
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,159
and surprise them.

1667
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,368
Let's get rid of the traces first.

1668
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,299
(Dex has a plan.)

1669
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,299
(Hiding his suitcase)

1670
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,938
There's a saying,

1671
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:28,709
"The beacon does not shine on its own base."

1672
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:31,938
(I'm just saying.)

1673
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:33,409
(Excited)

1674
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:35,349
They'll never know.

1675
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:37,749
(Proud)

1676
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:40,588
It's so visible.

1677
01:13:40,589 --> 01:13:42,688
Gosh, it's so visible.

1678
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:43,919
(Peek-a-boo)

1679
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,389
I can't hide it here.

1680
01:13:46,459 --> 01:13:48,058
The beacon does shine on its own base.

1681
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:49,659
(The beacon does shine on its own base.)

1682
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:51,598
(He plays it safe and puts it in the storage.)

1683
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:52,599
That's right.

1684
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:54,199
All set.

1685
01:13:55,499 --> 01:13:56,969
Now,

1686
01:13:57,339 --> 01:13:59,239
I'll go and put on a disguise.

1687
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:01,839
(What disguise?)

1688
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,179
(A little while later)

1689
01:14:04,209 --> 01:14:07,708
(To catch a fish)

1690
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,418
(Shall I go to the mountains?)

1691
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:13,249
(Picking up)

1692
01:14:13,389 --> 01:14:15,389
Shall I go fishing?

1693
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:18,259
For dinner,

1694
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:20,429
I'll catch a few fish.

1695
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:23,789
What do you think? Isn't my disguise perfect?

1696
01:14:24,429 --> 01:14:25,769
I brought them from Seoul.

1697
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,969
(He brought the clothes in a passionate manner.)

1698
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:34,209
It should be a bit rumpled up.

1699
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:38,678
If 1 bottle is knocked over and 1 bottle is standing,

1700
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:39,878
it'll look very natural.

1701
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:42,149
Imagine that I cast a fishing rod.

1702
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:45,379
If they look in my direction, I'll do this.

1703
01:14:45,789 --> 01:14:47,089
(Turning away)

1704
01:14:47,289 --> 01:14:48,549
It'll hide my face.

1705
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:52,858
(Sighing)

1706
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:54,959
(He finished preparing the disguise and props.)

1707
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:57,258
I should've come with Eun Jin.

1708
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,169
It's so hard to be here alone.

1709
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,399
I talked big and told her...

1710
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:03,999
that I'd do well.

1711
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,409
Now that I'm here, I miss her a lot.

1712
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,369
"Hey, Kim Dex."

1713
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:11,209
"Are you happy to be here with me?"

1714
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:13,149
"You're happy to be here with me, right?"

1715
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:15,718
"Hey, Kim Dex. Work properly."

1716
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,918
"Work properly."

1717
01:15:16,919 --> 01:15:18,978
We should've done that. It's too bad that I'm here alone.

1718
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:21,749
(Will Dex be able to do well by himself?)

1719
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:24,889
I need to figure out how much money we have left.

1720
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:27,558
(She counts the remaining money.)

1721
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:29,279
- It's 27 dollars.
- A bit over 20 dollars.

1722
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:31,998
- How much? Did you say 20 dollars?
- It's 27 dollars.

1723
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:32,999
Really?

1724
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,399
(They don't have much money.)

1725
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,299
When we harvest mustard greens today...

1726
01:15:37,769 --> 01:15:39,369
Harvest a lot of mustard greens.

1727
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:41,539
Okay.

1728
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,808
(They're ready to pull out the entire field.)

1729
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:45,309
Let's go.

1730
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:50,919
Look to the side, Jun Myun. It's so pretty.

1731
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:53,388
- The weather is so nice.
- I think...

1732
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:56,019
- summer will come soon.
- It's so pretty.

1733
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,589
I stopped here earlier.

1734
01:15:58,919 --> 01:15:59,928
I know.

1735
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:01,829
(They enjoy the green scenery.)

1736
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:04,399
Three, four!

1737
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,568
(Let's dance first.)

1738
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:10,639
(I can't say no to a dance.)

1739
01:16:14,839 --> 01:16:16,308
(The perfect beat)

1740
01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:17,579
(She's cute.)

1741
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:20,379
My solo camera.

1742
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,619
(The nice weather makes her even more excited.)

1743
01:16:24,349 --> 01:16:26,188
(The cheerful Jung Ah joins in.)

1744
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:28,548
(She shows her special move, the arm twist.)

1745
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:30,288
(The cheerful sisters' energy level is at its max.)

1746
01:16:30,289 --> 01:16:31,459
Jung Ah.

1747
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:37,629
(The cheerful Jung Ah speaks gibberish.)

1748
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:41,998
(The strange rap ends.)

1749
01:16:41,999 --> 01:16:43,298
(My goodness)

1750
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:44,369
It's the sea.

1751
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:47,068
- It's so pretty.
- It's the sea.

1752
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,279
(The sea slowly begins to show itself.)

1753
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:58,549
(While the four siblings are driving along the beautiful seaside road)

1754
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:03,189
(Seongdu Village, the place where the members are headed to, )

1755
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,329
(is full of people who are enjoying fishing.)

1756
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:13,099
(A fisherman has blended in.)

1757
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,729
I'll set up the props.

1758
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:19,639
(He sets up the props he brought from home.)

1759
01:17:20,839 --> 01:17:21,868
All done.

1760
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:23,029
(Everything is in its place.)

1761
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:24,679
I'll cast the fishing line now.

1762
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:26,948
(He warms up before the Fresh members arrive.)

1763
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:28,009
I got the hang of it.

1764
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:32,819
Go!

1765
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,158
(Is there a problem?)

1766
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,688
(Flustered)

1767
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:42,849
The fishing line got cut off.

1768
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:47,428
I... Where did the fishing line go?

1769
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,098
(The fishing line actually went as he said.)

1770
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:51,468
(Even the reel gives him trouble.)

1771
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:53,369
Fishing is so much trouble.

1772
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:55,169
It isn't easy.

1773
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,579
It's okay.

1774
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,339
I can sit like this.

1775
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:01,278
I'm catching something.

1776
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:02,409
(I'll go as it is.)

1777
01:18:02,549 --> 01:18:04,519
It's obvious that I haven't fished before.

1778
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:07,369
(For the first time in the world, he fishes without a fishing line.)

1779
01:18:07,789 --> 01:18:09,619
My movements are very limited.

1780
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:12,249
I can't give the reel more than half a spin.

1781
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:17,258
Back and forth.

1782
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,329
(Chuckling)

1783
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,839
It's a big catch!

1784
01:18:23,769 --> 01:18:24,898
It's a big catch!

1785
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:26,915
(How did he get a big catch without a fishing line?)

1786
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:28,008
Come here.

1787
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:29,809
(The big catch slowly begins to show itself.)

1788
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:31,738
I got something.

1789
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:33,709
(It's a piece of trash from the sea.)

1790
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:37,279
(A neighborhood cleaner)

1791
01:18:38,849 --> 01:18:41,289
Let's catch a big fish.

1792
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:44,859
It's about time they come here.

1793
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:47,789
(The big fishes are coming.)

1794
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,865
- Is this the place?
- It's a seaside village.

1795
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:51,099
This is our house. We're nearly there.

1796
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:53,329
It's another seaside village.

1797
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:57,268
(They have no idea about...)

1798
01:18:57,269 --> 01:18:59,569
(the fishing line Fisherman Dex cast.)

1799
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,469
(You've arrived at your destination.)

1800
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,778
- Shall we get off?
- We're here.

1801
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:04,978
- Are we here?
- Yes.

1802
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:06,809
(The four siblings arrive at the house!)

1803
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:10,579
(The fisherman is still waiting for the big fishes.)

1804
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:15,788
(The big fishes finally arrive!)

1805
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:18,788
(He scatters some bait.)

1806
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:21,429
(Clearing his throat)

1807
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:23,428
We haven't even worked yet.

1808
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:25,529
(The first big fish is worried about work.)

1809
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:27,868
- We should unload the luggage.
- Yes.

1810
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:28,899
(Glancing over)

1811
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,269
They're here.

1812
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:33,039
Is it yours?

1813
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:34,708
They're here.

1814
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,149
(They get on the fisherman's radar.)

1815
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:37,708
They're big.

1816
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:38,779
(A family of big fishes)

1817
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:41,948
(There is only a distance of 50m between them!)

1818
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:47,019
(Will the Fresh members spot Dex?)

1819
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,558
I wonder how well they decorated the place this time.

1820
01:19:49,559 --> 01:19:52,119
(The Fresh members head over to the house.)

1821
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:55,758
My goodness, they have no idea.

1822
01:19:55,759 --> 01:19:57,059
(Moving)

1823
01:19:57,429 --> 01:19:59,329
- Thank you.
- We're in your care for two days.

1824
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:04,569
(They say hello to the locals.)

1825
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:06,969
(Will they figure it out?)

1826
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,309
(Glancing over)

1827
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:12,109
Hey, there's a supermarket in front of the house.

1828
01:20:12,439 --> 01:20:14,408
Shouldn't we come here once?

1829
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,449
That's right.

1830
01:20:16,749 --> 01:20:20,389
(They show no interest in Dex's direction.)

1831
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,589
(How could they be so clueless?)

1832
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:26,359
Here I go.

1833
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:31,859
(He makes a big action.)

1834
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:33,969
(Groaning)

1835
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:36,369
(Are they still not looking?)

1836
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:38,869
(Glancing over)

1837
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:45,479
(Jung Ah spots the fisherman.)

1838
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:51,819
He's fishing over there.

1839
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:56,059
(She mistakes him for an actual fisherman.)

1840
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,819
He's reeling in a fish.

1841
01:20:58,889 --> 01:21:01,289
(That's impressive.)

1842
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:02,898
(Groaning)

1843
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,899
(From the back, it looks like he's catching a whale.)

1844
01:21:06,269 --> 01:21:07,768
(My goodness)

1845
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:09,269
I haven't fished like that before.

1846
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:10,639
- Right?
- My dad will love it.

1847
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:13,809
(It's no wonder he hasn't fished like this before.)

1848
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:15,569
- Right?
- My dad will love it.

1849
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:17,479
Your dad enjoys fishing, right?

1850
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:18,979
Ji Yeon's dad.

1851
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:21,055
(They head over to the house without any suspicions.)

1852
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:23,479
(The Fresh members begin to leave.)

1853
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:24,919
It's a big catch!

1854
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:26,918
It's a big catch!

1855
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:28,359
(Unaware, he continues to struggle.)

1856
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:30,989
Gosh, this is the house.

1857
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:32,865
Is this the house? It says, "Fresh House."

1858
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:33,889
(They arrive at the Fresh House.)

1859
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,730
- It's right by the sea.
- This is incredible.

1860
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:38,128
It's so pretty.

1861
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:40,469
(The Fresh members go inside.)

1862
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:43,369
(Are they still looking?)

1863
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:46,609
They went inside.

1864
01:21:48,839 --> 01:21:52,309
(Now, the distance is too great.)

1865
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:57,379
(Even from a distance, you can see that he's dejected.)

1866
01:21:57,919 --> 01:22:00,349
(Sighing)

1867
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:04,458
(I'll use the cup I brought.)

1868
01:22:04,459 --> 01:22:06,758
(My goodness)

1869
01:22:06,759 --> 01:22:08,989
(He pretends to drink alcohol.)

1870
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:12,129
(He gets a reality check.)

1871
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:17,299
Today, I failed.

1872
01:22:18,369 --> 01:22:20,668
I failed.

1873
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,539
(Fisherman Dex begins to pack up.)

1874
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:26,309
(Sighing)

1875
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:29,308
Even if they're busy,

1876
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:32,719
they should recognize their younger brother.

1877
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:37,419
(Feeling disappointed, he looks at the Fresh House.)

1878
01:22:37,789 --> 01:22:39,549
- Not much of my head will remain.
- I know.

1879
01:22:39,589 --> 01:22:40,988
You'll bump into it every day.

1880
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,728
- Jung Ah, let's take...
- What?

1881
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:44,969
- a photo to mark our arrival.
- My head touches it too.

1882
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:48,369
(I think it's time for the last resort.)

1883
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:53,609
Ladies!

1884
01:22:55,139 --> 01:22:56,379
Ladies!

1885
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:00,909
(What?)

1886
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:03,179
Jung Ah!

1887
01:23:03,949 --> 01:23:05,479
Jun Myun!

1888
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,518
(Dazed)

1889
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:10,019
(Frozen)

1890
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:12,558
- Jung Ah.
- Yes?

1891
01:23:12,559 --> 01:23:13,628
(Flustered)

1892
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:15,729
- What is it?
- Someone is calling you.

1893
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:17,559
- What?
- What?

1894
01:23:17,629 --> 01:23:19,359
- "Jung Ah." - Who is it?

1895
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,269
What?

1896
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:23,739
- What?
- I guess someone is here.

1897
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,308
Who do you think I am?

1898
01:23:26,309 --> 01:23:27,309
(Who do you think I am?)

1899
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:30,379
Hold on.

1900
01:23:30,509 --> 01:23:32,309
- What? Who is it?
- What's going on?

1901
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:35,749
(It's hard to recognize him since the distance is too great.)

1902
01:23:35,879 --> 01:23:37,119
He's calling for us.

1903
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:39,249
Us?

1904
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:41,649
Who are you?

1905
01:23:42,919 --> 01:23:45,159
(Who is calling for us in Yeosu?)

1906
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,458
(Jung Ah comes out to the front yard...)

1907
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:48,899
(to check out the mysterious voice.)

1908
01:23:52,999 --> 01:23:54,599
Jung Ah!

1909
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:57,398
Jun Myun!

1910
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,939
(Jung Ah stares into a distance.)

1911
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:01,839
I'm Dex!

1912
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:04,079
I'm Dex!

1913
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,308
(Is Dex here?)

1914
01:24:09,309 --> 01:24:10,479
Oh, my.

1915
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,818
- Earlier, over there...
- He was the fisherman.

1916
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:14,919
He was the fisherman.

1917
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:16,489
The man who was fishing.

1918
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,619
This is incredible.

1919
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:20,119
(They finally uncovered the fisherman's true identity.)

1920
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,488
I got...

1921
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,059
a big catch!

1922
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:27,098
(He's happy to see them again after a long while.)

1923
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:28,398
For goodness' sake.

1924
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:29,468
(He's happy to see them again after a long while.)

1925
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:31,069
(Laughing)

1926
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:34,039
I can't believe it.

1927
01:24:34,839 --> 01:24:37,008
Hey! That's our...

1928
01:24:37,009 --> 01:24:38,929
(Feeling happy to see him, they move hurriedly.)

1929
01:24:40,349 --> 01:24:41,948
I can't believe he's here.

1930
01:24:41,949 --> 01:24:43,519
(Hurried)

1931
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:46,748
For goodness' sake.

1932
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:48,749
(They haven't seen each other for a while.)

1933
01:24:50,489 --> 01:24:51,888
- Hey.
- I can't believe it.

1934
01:24:51,889 --> 01:24:53,459
(They didn't expect Dex's visit.)

1935
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,428
My goodness.

1936
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:57,729
(Jung Ah hurriedly goes outside the gate.)

1937
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:03,098
Jin Young!

1938
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:05,599
(She hasn't called his name in a while.)

1939
01:25:05,999 --> 01:25:07,008
(Laughing)

1940
01:25:07,009 --> 01:25:08,109
Jung Ah!

1941
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:09,568
Jung Ah!

1942
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:12,379
- Jin Young!
- Jung Ah!

1943
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:16,009
- Jin Young!
- Jung Ah!

1944
01:25:18,219 --> 01:25:20,389
- Jung Ah!
- Jin Young!

1945
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:23,119
I can't believe you're here!

1946
01:25:23,789 --> 01:25:26,688
You were the man who was fishing over there.

1947
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:28,058
It was me.

1948
01:25:28,059 --> 01:25:29,389
You punk.

1949
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:31,099
My goodness.

1950
01:25:32,099 --> 01:25:33,968
What?

1951
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:35,869
(They hold hands again.)

1952
01:25:36,769 --> 01:25:38,039
Dex, is that you?

1953
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:39,638
Jun Myun.

1954
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:41,668
- Dex.
- I'm here, Jun Myun.

1955
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:42,938
(Jun Myun hasn't seen him in a long while.)

1956
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:44,039
Hello.

1957
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,638
- Hello.
- You're here.

1958
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:46,908
- I'm here.
- I can't believe it.

1959
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:47,949
I'm here.

1960
01:25:48,879 --> 01:25:50,378
- Hello.
- Hello.

1961
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,718
- Say hello to Ji Yeon and Jae Wook.
- Hello. Yes.

1962
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,948
- Hello.
- I can't believe it.

1963
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,018
Is it your first time meeting him?

1964
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,589
- Hello.
- It's my first time. Hello.

1965
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:00,059
- This is Dex.
- Yes. I'm Dex.

1966
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:01,928
- The fisherman from earlier...
- The fisherman from earlier...

1967
01:26:01,929 --> 01:26:03,098
- We thought...
- We went,

1968
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:05,498
- an old man was fishing.
- "He's fishing."

1969
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:06,798
We were like, "He's fishing."

1970
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:08,598
Didn't you know?

1971
01:26:08,599 --> 01:26:10,339
- We didn't know that it was you.
- Really?

1972
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:15,609
The 4 siblings' house became the 5 siblings' house.

1973
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:18,239
Will you stay with us until the end?

1974
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:20,548
We'll go all the way today.

1975
01:26:20,549 --> 01:26:22,348
(He works well.)

1976
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:24,849
(He eats well.)

1977
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:28,719
(The former youngest, Dex will bring...)

1978
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:32,258
(a lot of all-natural laughter.)

1979
01:26:32,259 --> 01:26:33,589
Stop it!

1980
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,528
(The richer and happier days...)

1981
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,629
(of the five siblings in Yeosu)

1982
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:39,869
- It's pretty.
- I know.

1983
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:42,429
Since he's here, I feel invincible.

1984
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:44,299
- He's got our back.
- I know.

1985
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,039
We need to make a lot of money today.

1986
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,938
(Jung Ah, I'm Dex.)

1987
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:51,499
(Before the eyes of the confident Dex, )

1988
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:54,009
(3,305m² of the mustard green field unfolds.)

1989
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:56,049
(Oh, my mustard greens)

1990
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:57,218
I'll earn a lot of money...

1991
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:58,519
and eat a lot of pork belly.

1992
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:00,849
(Let's do this for the pork belly!)

1993
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,548
(I, Kim Dex, )

1994
01:27:02,549 --> 01:27:04,089
(is unfazed by this type of labor.)

1995
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:06,728
(I'll let you eat pork belly to your heart's content.)

1996
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,529
(Jung Ah is satisfied.)

1997
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:10,928
It's a team dinner.

1998
01:27:10,929 --> 01:27:11,929
(Thanks to Dex, )

1999
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:13,568
(they begin the party...)

2000
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:15,229
(with pork belly on the cauldron lid.)

2001
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:17,898
(Seasoning Park's pork and mustard green stew)

2002
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,909
(Let's put it in our mouths.)

2003
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,938
(Today's meal is a work of art.)

2004
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:24,478
Dex and I will make jjajang ramyeon.

2005
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:25,538
Who do you think will make it tastier?

2006
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:27,609
- Dex.
- That's it.

2007
01:27:27,879 --> 01:27:29,008
(After a long while, )

2008
01:27:29,009 --> 01:27:30,289
(Dex's jjajang ramyeon is back.)

2009
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,349
(The chef of Season 2, Childish Im...)

2010
01:27:32,519 --> 01:27:34,679
(and the chef of Season 1, Childish Dex have a match.)

2011
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:38,259
(Would you like to join in with the rowdy Fresh members?)

2012
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:40,975
