1
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:18,538
(The 26,446m² pollack drying yard in Daegwallyeong)

2
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,167
(The sheer number of the pollacks...)

3
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:23,278
(overwhelmed the four siblings, )

4
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,984
(There was a person who was ready to overwhelm them further.)

5
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,508
(In the tense moment between the seekers and prankster, )

6
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:35,048
(someone's voice made the drying field freeze!)

7
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,757
(Freeze!)

8
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:38,788
(Unfreeze!)

9
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,658
(The first guest, Lee Jung Jae)

10
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,858
(It's Lee Jung Jae.)

11
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,098
(Let me freeze too!)

12
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:47,927
(I have a runny nose.)

13
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,248
(You came here without knowing which task you were doing.)

14
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:51,997
(Hang up...)

15
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,437
(the pollacks...)

16
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,068
(continuously.)

17
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,707
(The diligent worker mode came on.)

18
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,108
(The clumsy worker mode came on.)

19
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:03,018
(Jung Jae was surprised by the workload on the show.)

20
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,028
(If you're done working, you should play!)

21
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:07,487
(It's so much fun!)

22
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:09,328
(They enjoyed sledding after their hard work.)

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,558
(Mr. Freeze put his guard down!)

24
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,458
(Excited)

25
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,798
(They enjoyed winter to the fullest.)

26
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:19,258
(Why isn't it going? Please.)

27
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:21,828
(I give up.)

28
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:27,338
(They enjoyed it in their own ways.)

29
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,437
(Let's go...)

30
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,708
(and build a fire for dinner!)

31
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,888
(Leader Yum's time to make pork backbone stew!)

32
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:36,848
(The quantity was large as always.)

33
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,118
(Jung Jae hadn't seen such a quantity before.)

34
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:40,417
(We'll eat all of it.)

35
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:41,618
(All of it?)

36
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,257
(The family of bulk cooking...)

37
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,988
(was visited by the neat Jung Jae.)

38
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:47,338
(So that there wasn't even a speck, he peeled, )

39
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:48,858
(rinsed, )

40
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,558
(cleaned, )

41
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,558
(and threw away.)

42
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,098
(How well did Jung Jae peel the potatoes?)

43
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:56,968
(Clean)

44
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,268
(The newbie cook refused to lose.)

45
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,848
(She began reviving the sujebi dough!)

46
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,378
(How will Ji Yeon's sujebi turn out?)

47
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:12,577
(Everyone was charmed...)

48
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,588
(by the ingredient of the day.)

49
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:17,418
(Daegwallyeong grilled dried pollack)

50
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,357
(Very excited)

51
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,288
(Spaced out)

52
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,057
(Were they done setting up a hearty meal of the day?)

53
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,468
(What should I do now?)

54
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,298
(Spotting Ji Yeon)

55
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:33,638
Ji Yeon, sujebi!

56
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,208
Sujebi!

57
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,707
- This is... - We almost forgot about it again.

58
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,908
- We forgot yesterday. - She kneaded the dough so much.

59
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:43,718
(She carries the dough to the yard.)

60
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,548
Jung Ah, do we...

61
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,718
Do we add the sujebi now?

62
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:51,958
What? Can you repeat that?

63
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,718
(She was so excited that she lost her communication skills.)

64
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:57,958
(How will Ji Yeon's sujebi turn out?)

65
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,127
(The first dough)

66
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,397
(Excited)

67
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,538
It's boiling well thanks to the strong fire.

68
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,467
(The dough sticks to the hands.)

69
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,738
The sujebi dough is a bit sticky.

70
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:14,448
(Nervous)

71
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,778
(She sits down and tries to take it off with her both hands.)

72
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,088
(It sticks to her both hands.)

73
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:22,448
Sujebi?

74
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,558
Yes. Why is the sujebi dough so wet?

75
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,457
- Then... - Do I need to add more flour?

76
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,997
Isn't it ready?

77
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,627
It won't come off of your hands.

78
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,898
It'll come off.

79
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,098
Take it off then.

80
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:38,568
(Sticking)

81
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,707
If you do that, we won't get to eat until tomorrow morning.

82
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,384
(The dough shows a symptom of separation anxiety.)

83
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,737
What's this situation?

84
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:45,314
(Jae Wook is confused and Ji Yeon is embarrassed.)

85
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,478
Jung Ah.

86
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:48,377
(What's going on?)

87
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,547
Jung Ah, she keeps rapping in front of the pork backbone stew.

88
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,088
- Jung Ah, this dough... - Doesn't it come off? Is it wet?

89
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,587
(Is the dough wet?)

90
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,087
I added more flour earlier.

91
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,387
Ji Yeon, I think it'll work better...

92
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:00,657
if you wash your hands and do it with your bare hands.

93
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,828
- With my bare hands? Okay. - Don't wear those gloves.

94
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,497
(After washing her hands, she solemnly gets ready again.)

95
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:07,498
Does it come off?

96
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:13,038
(How will it go this time?)

97
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,308
You're rapping again.

98
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:18,577
(A strong hip-hop gesture for sujebi)

99
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:21,877
("Sujebi Rhapsody" by MC Ji Yeon featuring Lee Jae Wook)

100
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,347
("Sujebi Rhapsody" is a hip-hop song by MC Ji Yeon...)

101
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,868
(that shows strong desire for sujebi.)

102
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,618
(Dropping)

103
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,248
(Sujebi finally succeeds in debuting.)

104
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,887
Do it one more time.

105
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:32,017
"Hey, listen."

106
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,018
(Here comes an encore performance.)

107
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,739
Faster than anyone, different from everyone

108
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,628
(Lip-syncing allegations)

109
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,128
(The perfect group dance)

110
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,168
When will we eat if you work like that?

111
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:47,868
(Seriously.)

112
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,878
(Shaking)

113
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:56,718
(Crying)

114
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,018
Hey, don't laugh.

115
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,848
(Laughing soundlessly)

116
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,857
(Anxious)

117
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,187
(It's hard to trust Ji Yeon.)

118
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,428
Jun Myun.

119
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,558
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

120
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:10,857
Don't worry.

121
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:11,997
Okay.

122
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,198
(So cool)

123
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,668
I'm not worried.

124
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:16,737
The route doesn't matter as long as we reach Seoul.

125
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,858
(The route doesn't matter as long as we reach Seoul!)

126
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:20,708
What should I do?

127
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,408
(But we might not be able to reach Seoul.)

128
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,907
I definitely added more flour.

129
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,878
I made the dough with so much care.

130
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,018
(It looks like her care was excessive.)

131
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,948
(The fate of sujebi is shrouded in smoke.)

132
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,887
(Amidst the mess)

133
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,988
How do you make everyone laugh with sujebi?

134
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:44,297
(The dishwashing spirit can't leave the sink.)

135
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,897
(Scrubbing)

136
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:49,297
(He scrubs with gritted teeth.)

137
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:52,497
(He's about to put a hole in the bowl.)

138
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:54,367
(He removes the oily film perfectly with hot water.)

139
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,738
(Steaming)

140
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,607
(The neat Jung Jae)

141
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,707
(The sujebi crew enters to wash their hands.)

142
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,117
Jung Jae, why are you so...

143
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,818
What's this? Why is it so clean?

144
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,388
Jung Jae, why..

145
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,428
You didn't have to clean it so well.

146
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:12,958
(Jung Jae feels at ease when the kitchen is clean.)

147
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,127
Are you done? Did you finish adding sujebi?

148
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:16,128
(Nodding)

149
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,897
- Are you done? - All of it went in.

150
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,727
- That's good. - It'll get cooked.

151
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:20,767
Okay.

152
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:23,968
(While they wait for the pork backbone stew)

153
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:29,068
(Shall I begin?)

154
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:32,477
(Seasoned cucumber begins with a swirl of fish sauce.)

155
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,647
(She adds various condiments such as sugar and salt.)

156
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,377
(Her best student is on standby.)

157
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,748
- Mix them. - Okay.

158
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,347
(Mixing with a spoon)

159
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,457
No. Mix them.

160
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,358
- Bring the plastic gloves. - With this?

161
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:50,128
(Article 1, Protocol 1: Mix it with your hands.)

162
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,557
I'll add sesame seeds as well.

163
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,628
(Pouting in concentration)

164
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,197
(With the delicate control of her wrist, )

165
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,838
(she adds the nutty flavour.)

166
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,037
Try it.

167
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,138
(How does it taste?)

168
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,377
(Approved)

169
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,437
Here.

170
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,047
(Will it suit Leader Yum's tastes?)

171
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:09,048
Shall I plate it?

172
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,347
- Yes. - It's good.

173
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,948
- It's good. - You can stop.

174
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,917
(The crunchy seasoned cucumber that'll stimulate the appetite...)

175
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,017
(is done.)

176
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,418
(I'll plate it prettily.)

177
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,717
(Seasoning Park's 2nd round)

178
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,558
(She'll prepare the coastal spinach that's in season.)

179
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:27,527
(She eyeballs the ingredients in an effortless and chic way.)

180
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:30,097
(Sesame seeds, salt)

181
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,437
(Scraping the remaining seasoning)

182
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,668
(Adding flavours)

183
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:38,378
(Checking the seasoning)

184
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,148
(Satisfied)

185
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,507
It's sweet.

186
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,978
Try it, Ji Yeon.

187
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:45,847
See if it's good.

188
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,188
(Ji Yeon tries a bite.)

189
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:50,417
It's tasty.

190
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,788
It's sweet, right? Coastal spinach is tasty.

191
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,027
It's perfect for consumption around this time.

192
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,974
(Coastal spinach that's in season is sweeter and nuttier.)

193
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:00,328
(The side dishes are ready.)

194
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:04,298
(One person is in front of the pork backbone stew.)

195
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,598
What will I do if the sujebi is undercooked?

196
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,038
Why don't you try the sujebi?

197
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:10,608
- Now? - Yes.

198
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:12,478
- Is it cooked? - I'll try it then.

199
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:14,777
(Judgment time)

200
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:15,878
I found it.

201
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,948
(Sujebi, are you cooked?)

202
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,018
- Hold on. I'll try it first. - Okay.

203
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:25,857
(Fat)

204
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,457
(The sujebi piece is a bit plump.)

205
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,158
(She studies it carefully...)

206
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,128
(and tastes it.)

207
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,398
(How does it taste?)

208
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:40,737
(Well...)

209
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,268
- It needs more time, right? - Yes.

210
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,108
(Chuckling)

211
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,907
- Hold on. - Let me see it.

212
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,207
- No. - Come on.

213
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,477
- It isn't your fault. - This sujebi...

214
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:51,578
- isn't ready. - It just needs more time.

215
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,347
It's undercooked.

216
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,418
(Medium-rare)

217
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,887
It's undercooked. Seriously.

218
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,357
- Throw it away. - It's very chewy.

219
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,794
- Throw it away. - It's undercooked.

220
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,688
(Sujebi Number 1 fails.)

221
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,457
(She quietly makes the fire stronger.)

222
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,668
(Get cooked.)

223
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,567
It'll get cooked. Don't worry.

224
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:11,867
The potatoes aren't cooked either.

225
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,748
(The path of the sujebi master is a rough one.)

226
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:17,278
(Leader Yum enters the house for a second.)

227
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:21,978
What are you washing this time?

228
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:23,817
- What? - You're washing the dishes all day.

229
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,178
- That's... - It's okay.

230
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,187
There isn't much. I'm done.

231
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:28,594
(He says that he's done, but his hands don't stop.)

232
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,657
You're so neat.

233
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:32,817
(Not even Leader Yum can beat this neat freak.)

234
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:36,927
(Only after wiping the water on the sink, )

235
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:40,128
(he escapes the fate of the dishwashing spirit.)

236
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,898
(I'm done with dishwashing.)

237
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,337
My goodness.

238
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,967
(Staggering)

239
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,567
(He's hungry after dishwashing.)

240
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:52,477
I think this is perfect right now.

241
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:54,307
(He sits in front of the grilled dried pollack.)

242
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,978
(Appetizing)

243
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:59,318
(Picking up)

244
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:02,488
(He puts a tiny piece in his mouth.)

245
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,458
- Is it tasty? - It's tasty.

246
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,358
(Relieved)

247
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,658
(I can't wait to eat dinner.)

248
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,668
(But the pork backbone stew should be boiled for a long time!)

249
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,398
Shall we check the potatoes?

250
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,838
(It's ready once the potatoes are cooked.)

251
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,367
(They can't see much because of the steam.)

252
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:23,437
What a sound.

253
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:24,977
(But the sound gets their approval!)

254
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,748
(They excavate a potato.)

255
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,918
(Amidst the smoke, they take out a potato.)

256
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,218
(Piercing)

257
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:33,517
It's cooked.

258
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:35,818
It's cooked. Bring the perilla powder now.

259
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,788
(Finally)

260
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,757
(The nutty perilla powder wraps up Chef Yum's pork backbone stew.)

261
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:41,857
All done.

262
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,498
(The nutty perilla powder wraps up Chef Yum's pork backbone stew.)

263
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,398
- Will we eat now? - Put it in the bowl.

264
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,728
(Yes.)

265
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,468
- What? - Here.

266
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:51,968
(Fainting)

267
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,738
Jung Jae, my senior.

268
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,467
- Will you use that? - Please help.

269
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,777
(This is ordinary for us.)

270
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,048
(Huge)

271
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,348
(His jaw drops.)

272
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,248
Is this for five people?

273
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,348
He's a small eater.

274
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,188
We love hearty meals.

275
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,558
(Welcome to the overeating club of Fresh off the Sea.)

276
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,527
My goodness.

277
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,888
(They scoop out the generous amount of pork backbone stew.)

278
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,228
It's incredible.

279
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,297
It looks amazing.

280
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,767
It's something you find at Jongno 3-ga, right?

281
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,798
(That's the vibe.)

282
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:30,808
(It looks like a dish you get at an old restaurant.)

283
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:35,178
(Scooping out without hesitation)

284
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:42,948
(Isn't it too hearty?)

285
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:44,818
Gosh, this is...

286
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:48,158
(It makes him exclaim.)

287
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,788
(Will we really eat all of it?)

288
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,027
(Flustered)

289
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,328
(Will we really eat all of it?)

290
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,598
(A mountain of potatoes and pork backbones...)

291
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:01,307
(gets delivered to the table.)

292
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,337
I can't carry it alone.

293
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,637
(Struggling)

294
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,707
Oh, no. Don't do it alone.

295
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,278
Oh, no. Put it down.

296
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,647
(It's too heavy for one person.)

297
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,378
Jae Wook, help me with this.

298
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,287
Jae Wook!

299
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:15,608
(Jae Wook was scooping out rice.)

300
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:17,888
Jae Wook!

301
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,257
(Freeze)

302
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,704
- My goodness. - Help me with this first.

303
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:22,928
My goodness.

304
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,928
Gosh, this is...

305
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,798
Be careful.

306
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:31,298
My goodness.

307
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:35,207
(He became gaunt in half a day on Fresh off the Sea.)

308
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,638
I don't think I need dinner.

309
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,348
I'm full already.

310
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:41,577
Shall we eat?

311
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,047
Let's eat.

312
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:44,928
(Since we cooked diligently, shall we eat now?)

313
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:49,918
(Introducing the dinner of the day)

314
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:51,487
(The cooking time...)

315
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,788
(was a total of 3 hours.)

316
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,957
(The pork backbone stew...)

317
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,958
(with potatoes and radish greens from Gangwon Province)

318
00:13:00,298 --> 00:13:02,027
(Next to the pork backbone stew...)

319
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,168
(with a mountain of effort and taste...)

320
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,667
(lies the fruit of today's labour, )

321
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,668
(spicy and sweet grilled dried pollack.)

322
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:11,277
(Crispy seasoned cucumber peeled by Lee Jung Jae...)

323
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,878
(and savoury coastal spinach seasoned by Seasoning Park)

324
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:20,018
(The generous pork backbone stew and grilled dried pollack)

325
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,557
Thank you for the food.

326
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:26,018
(Thank you for the food!)

327
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,127
(Looking)

328
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,757
(Jung Jae carefully studies the table.)

329
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:30,827
I can see the bones.

330
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,027
This rice...

331
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,397
(This rice...)

332
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,918
- Go ahead. - Do you want to share it?

333
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,898
(Excuse me?)

334
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:41,038
(It isn't even a full bowl.)

335
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:45,677
(Ji Yeon doesn't understand.)

336
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,377
(Is something wrong?)

337
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,847
Jung Jae, you should eat that much.

338
00:13:48,848 --> 00:13:50,818
There isn't a lot of rice.

339
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,747
I need to eat this dish.

340
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,494
(I need to eat a lot of pork backbone stew.)

341
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:55,887
(She doesn't understand.)

342
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,017
I'll eat the leftovers.

343
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:58,134
(I'll eat the leftovers if there's any.)

344
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,418
I'll scoop it.

345
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,528
What?

346
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:03,757
(Jung Ah first.)

347
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:04,797
Here.

348
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:08,267
(The pork backbones are tender.)

349
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,538
(Generously putting the whole potato)

350
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,197
(After ladling the well-simmered broth...)

351
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:13,537
- Jae Wook. - Yes.

352
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:14,538
That's too much.

353
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,037
Gosh. Thank you.

354
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,778
(It goes back to her as a bowl full of pork backbone stew.)

355
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,748
Give four potatoes to Jun Myun.

356
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:23,748
Jung Ah.

357
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,417
(Wait. Potatoes?)

358
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,647
- Considering the potatoes, - Four potatoes.

359
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,017
There is too much rice.

360
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,818
(There's too much rice to have potatoes too.)

361
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,517
Still, it's better to give you more than less...

362
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,958
even if you'd have leftovers.

363
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:39,828
(He can't get used to the size of 1 serving here.)

364
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,818
(Meanwhile, she quietly makes a move for the grilled dried pollack.)

365
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,968
(Savouring)

366
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:47,437
The dried pollack tastes so good.

367
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,607
- It's good, right? - Yes.

368
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,608
(I know, right?)

369
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,307
It's so good.

370
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,948
(When Daegwallyeong's dried pollack meets Jung Ah's seasoning, )

371
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,448
(it becomes a dish you want to share with others.)

372
00:14:56,908 --> 00:15:00,618
(At this moment, they look after each other.)

373
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,147
It's so good.

374
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,318
(It's really insane.)

375
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,057
(Each gets a bowl of the amazing pork backbone stew.)

376
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,228
Thank you.

377
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,587
- Should I turn off the heat? - Yes, turn it off.

378
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,327
Okay. I'll turn it off.

379
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,734
(They sit around the table together.)

380
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:13,927
- Gosh. - Okay. Raise your glasses.

381
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,068
Jung Jae, please say a word.

382
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,598
Gosh. Thanks to you,

383
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:21,438
I've got to experience something new after a long time.

384
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:26,208
I had a really joyful and happy first day.

385
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,408
- Yes. Thank you. - Thank you.

386
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:30,007
- Thank you for coming. - Nice work.

387
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:33,248
- Thank you. - Good job.

388
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:37,087
(Washing down today's hardship...)

389
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:41,988
(with a glass of cold beer)

390
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:44,997
Goodness.

391
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,758
(Groaning habitually)

392
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,498
Thanks for the food.

393
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:51,038
Please enjoy it.

394
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:53,698
Jung Ah, its colour is fantastic already.

395
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,137
It's so tasty.

396
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,684
(Finally, he takes his first bite of the pork backbone stew.)

397
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,808
It's really good.

398
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,928
Jung Ah, its colour is fantastic already.

399
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,497
It's so tasty.

400
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:04,004
(Finally, he takes his first bite of the pork backbone stew.)

401
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,128
It's really good.

402
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,498
(Tremendously amazed)

403
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,838
How is the meat?

404
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,479
(The meat comes off the bone easily just by using the chopsticks.)

405
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,008
The meat is well-cooked.

406
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:19,428
- Is it well-cooked? - Yes.

407
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:25,148
(Taking a bite of the tender pork backbone first)

408
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,618
(Amazed)

409
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,517
- It's tasty. - It is, isn't it?

410
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:31,998
- I'm glad to hear that. - It's good.

411
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,227
- I'm glad. - You're a good cook.

412
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,258
(Shy)

413
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:38,068
They say it's hard to season a dish when it's in large quantities.

414
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,197
(Taking another bite)

415
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:41,868
So, Jun Myun helps me season it.

416
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:43,737
Not really, Jung Ah.

417
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,298
(Jung Ah's reliable aide for seasoning)

418
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,677
(Another highlight of the pork backbone stew...)

419
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,008
(is the dried radish greens.)

420
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,608
(Savouring)

421
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:55,578
Gosh. This is good.

422
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,588
- It has absorbed the sauce. - Right.

423
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:01,888
It has absorbed the seasoning well.

424
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,058
(Savouring)

425
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,228
(Taking a mouthful)

426
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:15,138
(Slurping)

427
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,228
I'm glad I put a lot of dried radish greens.

428
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,707
I eat the pork backbone stew for the dried radish greens.

429
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,937
Right. The dried radish greens are tasty.

430
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:22,014
(The dried radish greens in pork backbone stew are the best.)

431
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,278
(Jung Ah takes a bite of the dried radish greens too.)

432
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:29,118
(Enjoying the dried radish greens' savoury and rich flavours)

433
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,618
What is this?

434
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,488
That's sujebi.

435
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,498
(How does sujebi by Ji Yeon taste?)

436
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,968
- How does it taste? - It's all right.

437
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,438
(I made it.)

438
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,337
Ji Yeon's sujebi is a bit...

439
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,337
- like a potato... Right? - It looks like ongsimi, right?

440
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,278
- A potato ongsimi? - It resembles a potato.

441
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,608
(Laughing)

442
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,248
It's not undercooked, and it's very chewy.

443
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:03,948
- It's chewy, right? - Yes.

444
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:05,718
Good job.

445
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,757
- Nice. - It's cooked.

446
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:08,798
(Her sujebi is a success!)

447
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,388
Why is it so chewy?

448
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:14,228
- Because of my hands' strength. - She kneaded it well.

449
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:18,998
(Amazed)

450
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,898
It's truly amazing.

451
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,638
(Getting addicted to the pork backbone stew)

452
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:28,977
Gosh. This is so...

453
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,648
(He is amazed continuously.)

454
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:34,848
(Jung Ah tries the well-cooked potato first.)

455
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:39,518
(Then she devours the pork backbones.)

456
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:44,187
Gosh. I can't believe I'll gnaw on the pork backbones...

457
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,258
when Jung Jae is watching.

458
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:49,498
It's embarrassing.

459
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,267
(Still, you have to gnaw on the pork backbone...)

460
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,638
(while holding it with your hand.)

461
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,808
(After saying it was embarrassing, she gnaws on it meticulously.)

462
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,508
(She uses her chopsticks for a moment, )

463
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,847
(but it's not satisfying.)

464
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,168
I have to hold it and gnaw on it.

465
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,248
I have to hold it with my hands.

466
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,464
(One has to hold the bone and gnaw on it.)

467
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,618
(She takes the meat off the bone carefully.)

468
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:18,088
(First, she clears the bones.)

469
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,058
(A devoted deboning skill)

470
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:27,328
(She gathers the meat and eats it in one go.)

471
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:33,338
(She eats it passionately while using her chopsticks.)

472
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:39,348
(In the end, she uses her hands too.)

473
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,848
(Happy)

474
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:45,988
(And next to her...)

475
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:51,988
(is another person who is mesmerized by the pork backbones.)

476
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,958
It's so good. I'm so happy.

477
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:01,867
(While everyone else is chewing, gnawing, )

478
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,998
(and enjoying the pork backbone stew, )

479
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,838
(Jung Ah is inhaling the seasoned coastal spinach.)

480
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:10,078
(Does it taste good?)

481
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:14,048
- You blanched it just right. - Yes.

482
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,518
- There's the seasoned cucumber too. - Yes.

483
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,517
(How does the seasoned cucumber by Jung Jae and Jun Myun taste?)

484
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,587
(Satisfied)

485
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,357
These are the cucumbers you chopped.

486
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:22,387
(Taking another piece)

487
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,018
- I know. - It's tasty.

488
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,288
Goodness. It's the dried radish greens.

489
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:29,858
(He takes a bite of the pork backbone stew.)

490
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:33,997
(Then he freshens his mouth with the seasoned cucumber.)

491
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,518
The seasoned cucumber tastes good too.

492
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,738
(Jun Myun's refreshing seasoned coastal spinach and cucumber)

493
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,658
I like how it's lightly seasoned.

494
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,008
I tried to suit your palate.

495
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,177
(Look at her.)

496
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,747
- It has a clean taste. - It's just how you like it.

497
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,577
It's a light and clean-tasting side dish.

498
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:49,648
(She loves it.)

499
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,047
(It's time to try...)

500
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,924
(the grilled dried pollack that has been deboned nicely.)

501
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:57,218
(She takes a big bite without worrying about the bones.)

502
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,887
(Savouring)

503
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,608
- Is it good? - It's so delicious, Jung Ah.

504
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,828
(She can't stop smiling.)

505
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:06,967
(Thanks to Jung Ah, who deboned it meticulously, )

506
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,008
(they enjoy the grilled dried pollack comfortably.)

507
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:14,038
(The harmony of the spicy sauce and the chewy texture)

508
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,308
(Amazed)

509
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,678
- Is it good? - My goodness.

510
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:21,348
It's so good that you have to keep eating it.

511
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:24,617
(Chef Yum's sweet and spicy grilled dried pollack...)

512
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,448
(allows them to eat so much rice.)

513
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,258
It's so good.

514
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,187
Gosh. It's so delicious. Seriously.

515
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,527
(They eat the pork backbone...)

516
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:32,687
(again...)

517
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:33,688
(and again...)

518
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,228
(until...)

519
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:37,497
(the bones mount up...)

520
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,598
(into a big pile.)

521
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:43,997
I'm happy.

522
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,308
(Sentimental)

523
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,608
Should we make a tomb made of the bones today?

524
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:52,647
It always tastes better when we have it here.

525
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:53,648
You're right.

526
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,277
(What?)

527
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:56,917
- No, that's not the case. - No?

528
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:57,918
It is just tasty.

529
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,247
- They're just delicious. - That's true too.

530
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,187
- They're just made deliciously. - They're tasty.

531
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,487
(Leader Yum's food is delicious no matter where they eat it.)

532
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,058
I'm so happy that you like them.

533
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,228
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

534
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,568
I've improved. I cook at home almost every day.

535
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,968
My mother cooks every day too.

536
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,638
Gosh, but...

537
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,638
I try hard too.

538
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,248
- I do try hard. - Yes.

539
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:29,478
You put the seasoning in and...

540
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,518
(Amazed)

541
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:34,417
(How can it have such a rich flavour?)

542
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,157
I think the wood fire plays a big part too.

543
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:38,588
Exactly. The fire is crucial.

544
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,228
- It's a strong fire. - Yes.

545
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,828
I don't know about the fire.

546
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,228
(It's just amazing.)

547
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,637
(The pork backbone stew tastes phenomenally good.)

548
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,638
You're amazing.

549
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,807
(Disappeared in no time)

550
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,747
Are we going to fry some rice?

551
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,308
(Are you eating more?)

552
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,748
But...

553
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:03,618
What?

554
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,288
(Is Foodie Ji Yeon giving up already?)

555
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,658
We have to fry some rice, don't we?

556
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,688
(Dumbfounded)

557
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,488
(But Jung Jae didn't know.)

558
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,804
- Is there any rice left? - We have a lot of rice left.

559
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,298
We have leftover white rice from this afternoon too.

560
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:19,797
Then let's make fried rice.

561
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,467
(Proceed)

562
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,437
- We can fry the rice here, right? - Sure.

563
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:24,798
Dried laver flakes and sesame oil.

564
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,407
Let's heat it up a little over low fire.

565
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:28,508
(Igniting the stove)

566
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:30,738
- Should we make it right now? - Yes.

567
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,878
(First, they throw in the leftover rice from dinner.)

568
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,018
(Gasping)

569
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,717
That's the leftover rice from this morning.

570
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,218
Yes, the leftover rice.

571
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,427
(While Jun Myun pours in the sesame oil, )

572
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:48,698
(Jung Jae takes over the ladle.)

573
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,657
(They cut up some dried radish greens.)

574
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,768
Dried radish greens.

575
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:54,397
- You brought these to cut them up. - Yes.

576
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:55,568
- Goodness. - Goodness.

577
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,767
(Goodness)

578
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:58,838
Hey, take them out.

579
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:01,507
- That's way too much. - Take them out?

580
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,508
Yes, I poured in too much by mistake.

581
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,607
(The dried laver flakes look like a black layer over the rice.)

582
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,208
That's way too much.

583
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:09,418
- It's okay. - That's way too much.

584
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:14,218
(The extra dried laver flakes will make it taste even better.)

585
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:17,788
(Impressed)

586
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:22,698
Brother Squid is making fried rice for us.

587
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,568
I just mixed the ingredients.

588
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,668
(Amazed)

589
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:29,868
I think it will taste like kalguksu.

590
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:31,368
- I think so too. - Yes.

591
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:32,908
It's going to be good.

592
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,207
(Pressing the rice down onto the pot to scorch it.)

593
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,478
(The fried rice is complete!)

594
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:39,748
Gosh, that was hectic.

595
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,878
It's been hectic here all day.

596
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,818
Can I try it? I'll use a fresh spoon.

597
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,218
We put in too many dried laver flakes.

598
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,117
- It's hot. - I hope it tastes okay.

599
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:51,527
- Gosh, it will. - It's hot.

600
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:52,728
(It's all right.)

601
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,228
(How is it?)

602
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:00,697
(How is the fried rice?)

603
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:02,137
You should start eating right now.

604
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:04,067
- Is it good? - We have to eat it right now?

605
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,468
(Right now!)

606
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,408
Please try it.

607
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,708
(If you insist.)

608
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:12,708
Goodness.

609
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,148
- Is the flavour insane? - It's so good.

610
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:20,048
(Ji Yeon takes a huge bite of fried rice too.)

611
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:21,388
Gosh, it's good.

612
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:25,087
(I'm...)

613
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,588
(too full.)

614
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:32,198
(Everyone else is clearly enjoying it.)

615
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:37,538
(I'll just have a taste of it then.)

616
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:47,207
(One more bite)

617
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:52,388
(Another bite?)

618
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,618
(Jung Jae is digging in.)

619
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:01,648
- Go ahead. - Do you want to share it?

620
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:04,258
(Didn't you say you usually don't eat much?)

621
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,898
- Gosh. - What?

622
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,298
This is good.

623
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,637
(Laughing)

624
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,208
This tastes like dried radish green risotto.

625
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:17,854
You're right. It does taste like dried radish green risotto.

626
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:20,947
I think it's because the potatoes were mashed as we were cooking.

627
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:22,548
That's what created this creamy texture.

628
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,617
I didn't know home-cooking could taste this good.

629
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,918
- Right? - Right?

630
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,557
Now that I've eaten...

631
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:32,128
(Jung Jae has adapted to the Fresh Overeating Diner.)

632
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:34,534
This is why all the hard work we do before every meal is worth it.

633
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,674
- Because the food tastes great. - Yes, the food tastes great.

634
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,827
It's so good.

635
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,004
(The seasonal meals are made through the four siblings' hard work.)

636
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:41,968
You complimented me so much today...

637
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:44,178
that I'm now considering selling pork backbone stew.

638
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,307
- Yum Jung Ah's pork backbone stew? - Yes.

639
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,478
(We look forward to it becoming a reality someday.)

640
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,847
- Thank you for the wonderful meal. - Thank you for the wonderful meal.

641
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:53,768
- Thank you. - Thank you for the wonderful meal.

642
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:55,318
I ate so much food.

643
00:26:57,218 --> 00:26:59,748
(They finished eating their hearty dinner.)

644
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,728
- I can do it by myself. I got it. - You don't have to do it alone.

645
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,258
(That's how the dishwashing fairy ended up by the sink again.)

646
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:08,558
(Did someone ask me to wash the dishes?)

647
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:11,158
(Jung Jae is devoted to removing any trace of food.)

648
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:16,238
(He will not allow even the tiniest food particle.)

649
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,738
You seem so experienced at this.

650
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,138
I mean, I know you are.

651
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,738
(Jung Jae rolls up his sleeves...)

652
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:27,708
(and brings the dishes to Jae Wook, )

653
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,288
(so that he can focus on washing them.)

654
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,688
(Jung Jae provides Jae Wook with the perfect assist.)

655
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,128
The dishes...

656
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:41,327
Jung Jae is the dishwashing fairy.

657
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,798
(The Fresh Dishwashing Fairy)

658
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:44,928
(Drained)

659
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,568
(A day of labour, cooking, and eating has Jun Myun knocked down.)

660
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,608
Come sit, Jung Ah. Take a break.

661
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:54,207
- I feel bad. - What?

662
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,278
I feel bad that our guest worked all day.

663
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,147
(Jung Jae worked all day, )

664
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:04,988
(and Jung Ah feels apologetic.)

665
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:08,294
But it's not like our guest could just hang around and do nothing.

666
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,488
That's true.

667
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:11,657
He has to do something.

668
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:14,188
(Labour is strictly distributed to each member.)

669
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:15,897
Sit and relax for just two minutes.

670
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:16,997
You can't sit for two minutes?

671
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:19,328
I've never seen you relax for that long.

672
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,228
That's not true. Sometimes, I sit and relax for ten minutes.

673
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:24,867
Ten minutes? That's nothing.

674
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:26,228
(Jun Myun can relax for 10 hours.)

675
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:28,207
I'm so exhausted.

676
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,138
(Let's just sit here for 10 minutes.)

677
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,278
- Thank you for helping me. - Thank you for your hard work.

678
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,148
(He's not done, yet.)

679
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:38,818
(It's not over until it's over.)

680
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,358
(He cleans every nook and cranny of the sink.)

681
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:45,158
(Jung Jae is finally done.)

682
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:49,157
Jung Jae is so neat when he does the dishes.

683
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,318
- He doesn't let anything go, right? - No, he doesn't.

684
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:55,998
(Now this is how you do the dishes.)

685
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,868
(The meticulous dishwashing is finally over...)

686
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,707
(and the two dishwashers are sitting across from each other.)

687
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,147
(Jae Wook's back is straight with the veteran actor in front of him.)

688
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:06,788
When will you be serving in the military?

689
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,977
(Jae Wook hasn't completed the mandatory military service yet.)

690
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:11,147
I want to finish at least two to three projects...

691
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,347
(Jae Wook will probably enlist after filming two projects.)

692
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:13,688
before I join.

693
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:15,748
You're filming two projects at the same time?

694
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:17,517
Yes, I think they will overlap a bit.

695
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:18,688
Goodness.

696
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,328
As you progress in your career,

697
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,548
you won't be able to transit between roles as easily.

698
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,527
Portraying two distinct characters...

699
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:28,738
through your acting alone...

700
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:30,797
is quite difficult.

701
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:32,478
(Jung Jae is giving him heartfelt advice.)

702
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:34,938
(Jae Wook hangs on to every word that Jung Jae says.)

703
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,938
- He was giving you good advice. - Yes.

704
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,108
It's natural to worry a lot at your age.

705
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,418
- Anyway, you... - Why is this...

706
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,518
- have to... - This is...

707
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:51,828
(Here comes the table.)

708
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,998
(It's too early to go to bed. We should have more fun.)

709
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,027
Last night, we used the small table. We're using this bigger one for you.

710
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,868
(They brought out this large table in honour of Jung Jae.)

711
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:06,667
The lighting too? You're serious about setting the mood.

712
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,638
We take this very seriously.

713
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,447
Yes, I noticed that you're concerned about acting.

714
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:14,694
(The Fresh members and Jung Jae are gathered around the table.)

715
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:17,347
It was so funny how Jung Jae showed himself to us.

716
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,164
It's even funnier now that I think back on it.

717
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,717
Right, on the pollack drying yard.

718
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,857
The way he walked through the pollacks was so funny.

719
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:26,758
(The way he walked)

720
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,298
I said, "Freeze!"

721
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,528
- The potatoes were funny too. - The way they shined?

722
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:36,038
I've never seen potatoes shine like that before.

723
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,138
You washed a lot of dishes too.

724
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,737
Right.

725
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,338
Whenever I wondered where he was, he was always doing the dishes.

726
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,384
- He must have felt comfortable. - Yes, he kept going there.

727
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:46,677
I would hear water running, so I would turn around...

728
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,418
and see Jung Jae washing something.

729
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:49,778
I was like, "Again?"

730
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,147
Honestly, I didn't think he could do the dishes at all.

731
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:53,187
I didn't think he could do the dishes.

732
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:55,217
- I thought he would hurt himself. - I thought he didn't do any chores,

733
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:58,018
and only worked and went to meetings.

734
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,127
I think a lot of people would be smitten...

735
00:31:01,128 --> 00:31:02,497
seeing him sort the garbage.

736
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:04,618
(Today, they got to see different sides to Jung Jae.)

737
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:10,867
Jung Ah's father and my father...

738
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,838
- know each other. - Our dads, yes.

739
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:14,368
My dad was born in 1946.

740
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,207
- My father was born in 1946 too. - Right.

741
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,528
(Their fathers are the same age.)

742
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:20,408
Gosh, they're already 80 years old.

743
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,517
That's something that gets me thinking a lot these days.

744
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:26,188
- They're 80. - It's like,

745
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:28,418
right now, I'm...

746
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,927
still single, you know.

747
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:36,157
So I talk to my parents on the phone every day...

748
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:38,128
and I try to visit them often too.

749
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:42,138
But I'm way too busy,

750
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,837
so I don't get to see them.

751
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:44,867
(I don't get to visit my parents.)

752
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:47,368
So I only talk to them on the phone, not see them in person.

753
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,338
Father.

754
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,747
(Jung Jae laughs heartily as he talks to his father.)

755
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:57,848
I'm filming something in Gangwon Province.

756
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,287
We're just now done for the day.

757
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:03,757
(After catching each other up on their lives, as usual, )

758
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,028
All right. Bye.

759
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:14,128
(Jung Jae sits alone in his thoughts.)

760
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:17,497
To be honest, I want to...

761
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,868
- travel more with my parents... - Sure.

762
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,008
And spend more time with them.

763
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,877
But they keep getting older.

764
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:29,147
They're 80 now.

765
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,548
(As our parents age, the time we have with them is limited.)

766
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,587
They just see me on TV and think, "Jung Jae is successful."

767
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,157
"Jung Jae is popular."

768
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:41,328
All they can do is be happy for me.

769
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:44,327
So then I'm left to wonder what I'm doing.

770
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:46,328
(What am I doing?)

771
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:51,067
(It's ironic that the closer he gets to the public, )

772
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:53,538
(the further away he is from his parents.)

773
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,537
That's a huge dilemma for me.

774
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,348
(Jung Ah empathizes with him.)

775
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:01,208
I actually don't like working.

776
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:05,718
I just want to watch "Fresh off the Sea" and...

777
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,048
While lying down.

778
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:09,157
I just want to decide what to eat for dinner.

779
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:10,317
(Laughing)

780
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,227
That's what I like to do.

781
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,857
I want to relax and have fun too.

782
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,758
(I want to relax and have fun too.)

783
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,427
You had a lot of fun in your 20s.

784
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,667
- He... - I did have fun in my 20s.

785
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:20,868
(Jung Ah knows Jung Jae well.)

786
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:22,837
- I saw him. - In my 20s...

787
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:24,437
He was having fun when I was having fun.

788
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:26,438
(I saw him have fun!)

789
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,538
(Their conversation with Jung Jae came to a close.)

790
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,178
(The sun rises over the East Sea.)

791
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:38,418
(Under the fresh morning sun, )

792
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,058
(people are busily moving around at the port.)

793
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:48,628
(The sun is up at the Fresh House too.)

794
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:55,268
(Jae Wook, Jung Ah, Ji Yeon, Jun Myun)

795
00:33:55,998 --> 00:33:58,037
(Ji Yeon is the first to wake up.)

796
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,838
(Jung Ah is still asleep, which is unusual for her.)

797
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:04,278
(Sitting up)

798
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,908
(Ji Yeon rubs her eyes before getting up.)

799
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:12,588
(Jung Ah wakes at her movement.)

800
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,557
(You got this, Ji Yeon.)

801
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:16,617
I'm going out.

802
00:34:16,618 --> 00:34:18,188
(Go get ready.)

803
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:22,758
(Ji Yeon leaves the room to wash up, )

804
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:28,438
(and Jung Ah returns to sleep.)

805
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:33,468
(An alarm suddenly starts blaring.)

806
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:39,348
(In case it wakes up the others, she throws her body to turn it off.)

807
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,107
Did you just jump?

808
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:42,577
That was so funny.

809
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:45,548
(Laughing)

810
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,787
Jung Ah just jumped.

811
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:49,258
(Jung Ah just jumped.)

812
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:52,728
(She put on a jump performance early in the morning.)

813
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:59,128
(Not able to go back to sleep, Jung Ah gets up.)

814
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:02,438
(Today, she's forced to start the day early.)

815
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:07,668
(Just when Jung Ah went to brush her teeth)

816
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,408
Goodness, my back!

817
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,348
Goodness!

818
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:17,847
Goodness, my back!

819
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,488
(Goodness, my back!)

820
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,057
Oh, dear.

821
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:24,664
(Jung Jae's groans echo through the Fresh House.)

822
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,628
(Bursting out laughing)

823
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:28,457
(Working at the pollack drying yard must have caused some damage.)

824
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,697
Goodness, my back!

825
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:31,968
(He's crying out about his back for the third time.)

826
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:33,568
Goodness.

827
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,298
I heard him wailing.

828
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,537
Goodness.

829
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,977
(His 5th groan)

830
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:45,147
Goodness.

831
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:47,578
(His 6th groan)

832
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,117
(Jung Jae's face is puffy.)

833
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:51,547
(He tries to wake himself up by drinking a bottle of water.)

834
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:53,517
(But he fails.)

835
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,957
(Swaying side to side)

836
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,428
(Groaning)

837
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:01,187
(Where am I?)

838
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:04,127
(Who am I?)

839
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,328
Goodness.

840
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:07,228
Goodness.

841
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:11,838
(You got this, Superstar.)

842
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,078
(Jung Jae drags himself outside to wash up and get ready.)

843
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:19,078
Did you sleep well?

844
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,088
- Are you going out for a run? - Yes.

845
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:22,718
- Really? - Yes.

846
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,617
(Surprised)

847
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:25,847
That's impressive.

848
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:27,118
(Gosh, that's impressive.)

849
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:30,158
(As always, Ji Yeon warms up before she starts running.)

850
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:34,358
(She looks very cool.)

851
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,698
(She has the flexibility of a professional athlete.)

852
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,527
(She gathers...)

853
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,868
(her strong determination...)

854
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:47,508
(toward running as she gets ready.)

855
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,677
(I, Im Ji Yeon, )

856
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,348
(will get going.)

857
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,448
(I'll see you when you return.)

858
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:58,548
(Jae Wook isn't joining her today.)

859
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,988
(Have a good run, Ji Yeon.)

860
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:08,358
(Ji Yeon sets off by herself today.)

861
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:11,258
(She puts her phone in her pocket.)

862
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:14,598
(Let's go!)

863
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:19,237
(After running between colourful roofs...)

864
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,978
(and charming stonewalls, )

865
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,207
It's undone.

866
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,748
(Ji Yeon's shoelace came undone.)

867
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:29,717
Pausing workout.

868
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:30,848
No, I'm not.

869
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,748
My shoelace just came undone.

870
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:37,288
(She ties her shoelace.)

871
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:40,188
Restarting workout.

872
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,998
(Let's start the day energetically.)

873
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:51,538
(Happy)

874
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:52,967
This feels great.

875
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,808
(This feels great!)

876
00:37:56,538 --> 00:38:03,378
(It feels refreshing to run through the cold morning air.)

877
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,158
I wish this was right by my house.

878
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,588
I love it here.

879
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,197
(This moment feels special...)

880
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:17,128
(because it's not an everyday experience.)

881
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,038
The endless beach

882
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:25,938
Where the morning sun shines

883
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,537
(She's singing while running.)

884
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:31,738
Let's run with excitement.

885
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:36,148
(The sunlight is warm and Mount Seorak's air is clear.)

886
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,788
(This is a perfect morning to go on a run.)

887
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:41,688
The endless beach

888
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,288
Hello there.

889
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,358
Puppy.

890
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,288
(Hello to you too!)

891
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:51,528
(Good morning!)

892
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:52,898
Let's wrap this up.

893
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:57,437
Let's go towards victory

894
00:38:57,438 --> 00:39:00,208
(Runner's high)

895
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,448
(Refreshed)

896
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:10,418
Hello.

897
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:12,418
- Hello. - Hello.

898
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:16,758
(This mineral spring is used by the villagers.)

899
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,418
I was just craving water.

900
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:24,998
(Ji Yeon quenches her thirst with cold water.)

901
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,438
(Meanwhile, at the Fresh House, )

902
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:35,238
(yesterday's running partner is tossing and turning.)

903
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:38,438
(At 8:03am, the youngest member is awake.)

904
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:39,707
(Puffy)

905
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,478
(Who is this?)

906
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:44,947
I thought the wake-up time was 8:30am.

907
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:46,288
That's right. But...

908
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,087
I just woke up.

909
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:50,168
- You should go back to sleep. - You're so diligent.

910
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:51,618
Ji Yeon went to work out.

911
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,027
She went out for a run.

912
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,228
(That's amazing.)

913
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:59,868
(Jung Ah Junior folds the bedding as soon as he gets up.)

914
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:01,827
(Jun Myun notices him.)

915
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:04,938
(Folding the bedding is my specialty.)

916
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:08,538
(Dragging across the room.)

917
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,947
(She throws the bedding into the cabinet...)

918
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,678
(and folds it again there.)

919
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,878
I'll do it.

920
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,888
(Thanks.)

921
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:22,217
(Smacking to see where to fold)

922
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:23,987
(Folding)

923
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,528
(The youngest member cares about precision.)

924
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,827
(He folds the bedding one by one.)

925
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,628
(Meanwhile, )

926
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:36,798
(this man walks up while brushing his teeth.)

927
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,938
(Looking out the window)

928
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,308
I can't...

929
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,978
I can't...

930
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:51,578
The fact that I'm here is...

931
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:52,748
Right?

932
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,148
This morning, I woke up like...

933
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:57,217
(Every newbie gets like this.)

934
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:58,357
"Where am I?"

935
00:40:58,358 --> 00:40:59,688
("Where am I? Who am I?)

936
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,528
"Goodness. Goodness, my back."

937
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,427
Does your back hurt a lot?

938
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:06,697
(While their guest recovers, )

939
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,098
Gosh.

940
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:12,508
(the third sibling returns.)

941
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,407
- Was it good? - I'm back.

942
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:16,677
(The third sibling cheerfully shouts a morning greeting.)

943
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:18,278
She looks alive.

944
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:20,347
She ran for quite a while today.

945
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:21,808
(She ran for quite a while today.)

946
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:26,617
(The eldest sibling prepares to make breakfast.)

947
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,117
(What's the first thing she takes out?)

948
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,718
I should soak the rice cakes.

949
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:36,058
(Those are the kind used in a rice cake soup.)

950
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:38,228
Tomorrow morning,

951
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,067
since we're in Gangwon Province,

952
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,598
I'm going to make buckwheat crepes...

953
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,537
and rice cake soup with dried pollack.

954
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,778
(Buckwheat crepes and rice cake soup with dried pollack)

955
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,337
How can I help?

956
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,708
I'm going to soak the rice cakes in water.

957
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:53,377
- In a stainless steel bowl? - Yes.

958
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,577
That will work.

959
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,017
(The small one?)

960
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:58,378
Yes. We're going to use both bags, so this one.

961
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:00,847
You're making a lot of food, again?

962
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:02,064
(You're making a lot of food, again?)

963
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:03,218
I mean,

964
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:05,888
will this be too much for five people?

965
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,298
I'll give you a small portion.

966
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,897
Sometimes, some of the members eat a lot.

967
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:13,127
(Sometimes, some of the members eat a lot.)

968
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:14,697
(Putting a little into the bowl)

969
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,938
Maybe I'll just use this much.

970
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:17,368
A little more.

971
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:20,867
(Throwing in the whole bag)

972
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:22,837
It's a waste of food. We should finish all of this.

973
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,708
(She really thinks it's a waste of food.)

974
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:29,378
(After filling the bowl with rice cakes, )

975
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,888
(it's time to take out the dried pollack strips they got yesterday.)

976
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:35,787
Gosh, that smells amazing.

977
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:36,908
(Gosh, that smells amazing.)

978
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,528
It smells so good.

979
00:42:39,988 --> 00:42:41,887
You should take these.

980
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:44,597
They have bones inside.

981
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,118
- You want me to take them out? - Yes.

982
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:47,797
All right.

983
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,238
(Request received)

984
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,008
(He carries the dried pollack strips out of the kitchen.)

985
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,237
I was told to take the fish bones out.

986
00:42:56,238 --> 00:42:58,408
(I was told to take the fish bones out.)

987
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:01,708
(Is something wrong?)

988
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,148
- The fish bones. - Jung Jae.

989
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,988
- Jung Jae, I... - I can't see the fish bones.

990
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,118
Jae Wook. I think he needs help.

991
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:11,988
What's the matter?

992
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,488
I can't see anything.

993
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:17,958
Wait. Are there really bones?

994
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,337
If you run your hand along it, you can feel them.

995
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:26,668
Please cut them into pieces after removing the bones.

996
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:28,267
- You mean, these pollacks? - Yes,

997
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:29,337
(Jae Wook jumps in to help Jung Jae before he feels more down.)

998
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:30,538
Do we have a tool to cut them?

999
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:31,677
I'll go get scissors.

1000
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:32,678
(Getting away)

1001
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:36,178
(Jung Jae is sad about not being able to see bones.)

1002
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:40,087
(He decides to do what he's good at.)

1003
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:43,158
(Instead of Jung Jae, who's washing the dishes)

1004
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,088
- You can hand me that now. - Sure.

1005
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:48,627
It was in the back, hiding.

1006
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:50,588
(Leader Yum's secret to making milky-white broth)

1007
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,598
(Adding perilla oil generously)

1008
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:58,298
(Mixing it together)

1009
00:43:58,638 --> 00:43:59,638
I need to boil water.

1010
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,668
(Pollack absorbed perilla oil.)

1011
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:04,408
(Adding enough water just to cover the pollack)

1012
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:05,677
(Leader Yum's tip: If you add a little water...)

1013
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:09,148
(and simmer for a long time, you'll have a milky-white broth.)

1014
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:11,647
Please be milky-white.

1015
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,288
(While the pollack broth is boiling)

1016
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:16,158
I need to go over there to make buckwheat crepes.

1017
00:44:16,772 --> 00:44:20,102
(Buckwheat crepes?)

1018
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:22,939
I need to go over there to make buckwheat crepes.

1019
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:27,008
(Buckwheat crepes?)

1020
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,008
(The pride of Gangwon Province)

1021
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,709
(A delicacy made from buckwheat)

1022
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:34,919
Chop the aged kimchi.

1023
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,549
Freshly made tofu is the best.

1024
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:42,629
(Kimchi that Jun Myun secretly brought in)

1025
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:45,489
(Slightly cooked mung bean sprouts)

1026
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:49,169
(They'll put a generous amount of them in the crepes.)

1027
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,698
Jung Ah. So, now,

1028
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:53,699
- what do we do? - We need help.

1029
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,285
- Someone needs to squeeze it out. - Does kimchi need to be squeezed?

1030
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:57,908
I think Jung Jae can do it.

1031
00:44:57,909 --> 00:44:59,579
Sure. He can do that.

1032
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:03,409
(He's rolling his sleeves up.)

1033
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:07,619
(Next to Jung Jae, who's squeezing kimchi)

1034
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:10,249
-Is it kimchi? - Yes.

1035
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:11,619
It looks delicious.

1036
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,258
I made this kimchi this winter. I made it myself.

1037
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:17,329
(Bragging)

1038
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:18,988
(Surprised)

1039
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,159
- Did you make it? - Yes.

1040
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,839
People just buy it these days, don't they?

1041
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:26,168
I love kimchi.

1042
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:28,499
(I want to eat it as much as I want.)

1043
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:31,239
- What's your secret for kimchi? - What?

1044
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,479
My secret?

1045
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:36,409
Salted small yellow croaker. I make seasoning with it.

1046
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,919
Kimchi tastes rich when made with the seasoning.

1047
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,418
I use dried radish instead of fresh radish.

1048
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:45,918
(Top secret)

1049
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:46,989
It's chewy.

1050
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,029
She put dried radish generously.

1051
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:55,199
(Jung Jae takes it to squeeze out the juice.)

1052
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:57,329
(Glancing at it)

1053
00:45:58,699 --> 00:45:59,938
Do we need more kimchi?

1054
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:01,969
(Debating with herself)

1055
00:46:02,439 --> 00:46:04,408
- To be honest, kimchi... - Isn't it for crepes?

1056
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:05,938
Yes. Do I need to get more?

1057
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,739
Are you really going to eat that many crepes?

1058
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:13,318
- You're so funny. - Isn't it a side dish?

1059
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,518
(Are you eating that much of a side dish?)

1060
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,549
It's a side dish.

1061
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:18,389
Did you forget the stew we had last night?

1062
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:21,918
Yes, the pork backbone stew.

1063
00:46:21,919 --> 00:46:24,789
(I remember that.)

1064
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:27,899
(Mr. Freeze got more kimchi.)

1065
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,399
(When he squeezes it, )

1066
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:34,769
(kimchi juice is coming out.)

1067
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:38,939
(It splashes everywhere.)

1068
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,579
(What's happening?)

1069
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,209
It splashed on you.

1070
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:45,149
Oh, no.

1071
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,318
(Until this happened, )

1072
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,359
(he kept squeezing the kimchi.)

1073
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:56,259
Oh, no.

1074
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:59,428
Aren't we going to a nice place in Sokcho today?

1075
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:00,989
We should be dressed up. What do we do?

1076
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:02,398
I got kimchi juice on my clothes.

1077
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,828
- Where can I go like this? - Oh, no.

1078
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:04,829
(Mr. Freeze is sad again.)

1079
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,390
- What do we do? - Jung Jae, you can...

1080
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,538
- Go to the bathroom. -Try to wipe it out.

1081
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:09,809
Okay.

1082
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:12,309
Oh, my gosh.

1083
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,809
(Let me squeeze the kimchi first.)

1084
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:16,909
(The kimchi that Jung Jae squeezed while ruining his pants)

1085
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:18,148
I'll stir-fry kimchi.

1086
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:20,019
(It'll be stir-fried kimchi.)

1087
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:21,679
Add sesame oil.

1088
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,148
(Minced garlic)

1089
00:47:25,149 --> 00:47:27,519
(Sugar)

1090
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:29,628
(Thinking)

1091
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:30,758
I'm debating with myself...

1092
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:32,698
whether to add soy sauce or not because the tofu is a bit salty.

1093
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:33,959
I usually add soy sauce.

1094
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,698
Then, just add a tiny bit.

1095
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,798
- Just a tiny bit? - Yes. You should add it.

1096
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:39,399
- It gives more flavour to it. - Exactly.

1097
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:43,509
If you're debating with yourself about such a thing, just ask me.

1098
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:46,579
(Seasoning Park at Fresh House)

1099
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:48,379
That is a serious matter...

1100
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:49,849
at Fresh House.

1101
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:55,119
(There is a man.)

1102
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,848
(There is a global star...)

1103
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,619
(who has no clothes to change into.)

1104
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,029
Had I known we were going to Sokcho, I would've brought more clothes.

1105
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,028
You didn't bring outfits for a date.

1106
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:08,559
Outfits for a date? Right.

1107
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:12,168
I should've brought outfits for a date.

1108
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:13,575
(With his sacrifice of kimchi juice, )

1109
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,169
(making buckwheat crepes is moved to the next step.)

1110
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,408
Ji Yeon. I think you need to stir it for a long time.

1111
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,809
Okay. Ji Yeon. You need to stir it for a long time.

1112
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,408
- It's lumpy. - It's lumpy.

1113
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,649
(He's repeating what she says.)

1114
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:29,149
(She's making the crepe batter.)

1115
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:32,419
(It's fun.)

1116
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:34,788
(Mixing it with the right hand)

1117
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:36,959
(Mixing it with the left hand)

1118
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,259
(She continues to mix it with all her efforts.)

1119
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:42,029
Is it done?

1120
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:46,339
(Is it done? Or not?)

1121
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:49,339
Jae Wook.

1122
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,568
Do you think it's done?

1123
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,309
(When she's not sure, she calls Jae Wook.)

1124
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,049
Ji Yeon, if it has no lumps, it's done.

1125
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:58,049
(Checking the batter instead of Jung Ah)
Let me see.

1126
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,979
(Nervous)

1127
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,488
It's still lumpy.

1128
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,635
(He found a lump right away.)

1129
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:07,789
There's no lump.

1130
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:09,188
What is it, then?

1131
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:12,229
What is this round thing that I'm looking at now?

1132
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:15,758
Just go away. I got it.

1133
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:18,099
(Having fun with teasing her)

1134
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,639
Should I mix it more?

1135
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:22,539
You don't need to.

1136
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,268
- Is it done? - If you want...

1137
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:27,239
to get yelled at by Jung Ah later.

1138
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:33,519
(I'll get back at him.)

1139
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:36,088
(While Ji Yeon is thinking about getting back at him, )

1140
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:39,049
(the filling for crepes is almost ready.)

1141
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,618
(The filling with kimchi, tofu, and mung bean sprouts)

1142
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,228
(Adding sesame seeds)

1143
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:45,229
(Adding chilli powder)

1144
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,499
- And mix it? - Yes.

1145
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:49,129
Then, the filling is ready.

1146
00:49:49,629 --> 00:49:52,429
(Taste it.)

1147
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,569
- What is this? - It's so good.

1148
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:58,139
(Then, now, )

1149
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:02,079
(it's time to make crepes.)

1150
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,949
(The buckwheat batter that Ji Yeon mixed)

1151
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:11,449
(When it becomes golden brown)

1152
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:13,019
Hold on.

1153
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,158
(A spoonful of the filling)

1154
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:17,229
Are you putting it on?

1155
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:20,259
You don't put it on the edge, where you can stick it later.

1156
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,968
(Folding once)

1157
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,328
(Folding twice)

1158
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:26,369
Press the edges.

1159
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,138
Just cook it, flipping over.

1160
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:32,369
Make them as I showed.

1161
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,679
Drizzle a bit of oil while cooking.

1162
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:38,349
I'll go make rice cake soup.

1163
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:43,049
- Can you do it alone? - You need to help me.

1164
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:45,149
Do I flip it?

1165
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,359
I think I can flip it with my hand.

1166
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:50,558
- I think it'll burst. - What?

1167
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,679
(Folding his hands in worry)

1168
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:53,129
(She just gives it a try.)

1169
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,159
It looks delicious.

1170
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:58,469
A buckwheat crepe.

1171
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,239
(Flipping it with his bare hand)

1172
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:01,799
It's done.

1173
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:03,969
- Is it done? - Is it not?

1174
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:07,209
Some parts are crumbled.

1175
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:08,839
Did we do this correctly?

1176
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:10,619
I think we can just eat it as it crumbles.

1177
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,918
- How is it? Is that the second? - I think it's done.

1178
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:15,239
- No, it's the first one. - Okay.

1179
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:16,949
- Did you flip it once? - Yes.

1180
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:18,989
I think we should taste it.

1181
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:21,919
- Is it cooked inside? - This one is cooked.

1182
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,299
(Giving Jung Ah a piece.)

1183
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,099
(Giving Jung Jae a piece.)

1184
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,729
(I also have a piece.)

1185
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:33,139
(Ji Yeon has a bite.)

1186
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,999
(Analysing the taste)

1187
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:38,039
The crepe is a bit undercooked.

1188
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:40,039
Is that so? We need to cook it longer.

1189
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:42,408
I'm eating it.

1190
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:43,649
(Is it undercooked?)

1191
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:45,349
What should I do?

1192
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:47,048
- I'm still chewing it. - Just swallow it.

1193
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:48,119
You can just swallow it.

1194
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:50,789
You can just swallow it.

1195
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,689
(Training the guest to be tough)

1196
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:56,259
(Trying the second buckwheat crepe)

1197
00:51:56,959 --> 00:52:00,628
(Learning their lessons from the first undercooked one)

1198
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:02,158
(They cook...)

1199
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,729
(the second one longer.)

1200
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:06,379
Should you put the filling?

1201
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,669
- We'll put the filling now. - Okay.

1202
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:10,869
- It looks good. - Yes.

1203
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:12,639
- It's perfect. - Yes.

1204
00:52:14,379 --> 00:52:17,549
(Putting the filling carefully)

1205
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:20,178
Wait. Push it to one side.

1206
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,248
(Let's fold it together.)

1207
00:52:22,249 --> 00:52:24,089
- Flip it. - Take the spatula out.

1208
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:25,188
(Oh?)

1209
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:27,518
(Oh? No!)

1210
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,519
(Oh?)

1211
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,029
(Oh? No!)

1212
00:52:31,759 --> 00:52:32,828
It is...

1213
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:34,229
(We are doomed.)

1214
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,869
- It's done. - It's not done at all.

1215
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:39,998
(Trying to fix it)

1216
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:41,068
(Failed)

1217
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:42,299
It's breaking apart.

1218
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:43,909
What should we do?

1219
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,739
(It's breaking apart, although it's fully cooked.)

1220
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:51,108
- Jung Ah, the crepe is too fragile. - The buckwheat crepe is...

1221
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:52,848
Then, add more flour.

1222
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:55,249
(Adding buckwheat flour to the thin batter.)

1223
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:56,549
Jung Ah, is it enough?

1224
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:57,918
- Yes. - I added it.

1225
00:52:57,919 --> 00:52:59,718
Go and mix it quickly.

1226
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:00,889
(Redoing the batter)

1227
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:05,429
Are you making it that much more?

1228
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:08,729
(Will we be able to have breakfast?)

1229
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:11,528
(Current time: 9:45pm)

1230
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:14,299
(We need to have breakfast and go out before it gets too late.)

1231
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:18,469
(Jung Ah comes to check the broth.)

1232
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:22,409
(Boiling)

1233
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:23,978
(Looking at it like meerkats)

1234
00:53:23,979 --> 00:53:25,249
Look at this broth.

1235
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,379
It's so milky white.

1236
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,048
(Milky-white pollack broth)

1237
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:33,158
- It will be... - Jung Ah, do you want to taste it?

1238
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:34,889
- Why would I want it? - You don't need to?

1239
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,188
- Why did you ask me to taste it? - I thought you might want to.

1240
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:39,058
I don't need to. I just need to let it boil.

1241
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,798
I'll add rice cakes when it boils.

1242
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:42,199
(She starts making rice cake soup.)

1243
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,168
(Korean-style soy sauce)

1244
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:45,169
(Minced garlic)

1245
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,238
It's done.

1246
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:48,168
(Tuna fish sauce)

1247
00:53:48,169 --> 00:53:49,499
The smell is so good.

1248
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:53,009
(Seasoning it lightly for a clean taste)

1249
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:56,708
- Rice cakes will be cooked quickly. - Yes, it'll be done quickly.

1250
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:58,109
When that's done...

1251
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,648
What should I do? Should I cook rice cakes or not?

1252
00:54:01,649 --> 00:54:03,148
How are crepes going on?

1253
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:04,918
- Wait a minute. - Should I cook or not?

1254
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:06,189
Hold it for five minutes.

1255
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,088
(Leaving it)

1256
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:11,159
Did you give up making buckwheat crepes?

1257
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:13,099
- No. They're making it. - What's the status?

1258
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:15,828
Do we have any cooked buckwheat crepes?

1259
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:17,498
We have one that failed.

1260
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:19,059
- Do we have only 1? - Don't we have 2?

1261
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:21,469
- We ate it. - We ate it.

1262
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,409
- Did you eat it? - Did we eat it?

1263
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:28,079
(All we have is one that is burst.)

1264
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:30,749
Do we really have to...

1265
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,549
make them look restaurant-style?

1266
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:40,389
(Mr. Freeze comes in after watching it for a while.)

1267
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:41,989
Let's cook only the filling.

1268
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:48,198
(Thinking outside the box?)

1269
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:50,069
Ask Ji Yeon...

1270
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:52,799
- for some batter to pour over it. - Okay.

1271
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,599
It's very creative.

1272
00:54:57,139 --> 00:54:59,138
All that matters is eating it deliciously.

1273
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:00,515
Certainly. It's good as long as it's tasty.

1274
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,109
Are you making it like kimchi pancakes?

1275
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:06,319
(Pouring the batter over the filling)

1276
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:08,648
- I'll cover it more. - Sure.

1277
00:55:08,649 --> 00:55:10,088
(Making a pancake instead of making tricky crepes.)

1278
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,918
(Buckwheat crepe)

1279
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:13,689
(Buckwheat pancake)

1280
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:15,388
Let's flip it.

1281
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:17,489
- We need to flip it. - Flip it now.

1282
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,988
Use this to flip it.

1283
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,999
(It's time to see how it turned out.)

1284
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:23,869
Three!

1285
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:28,439
(I'm nervous, Jung Jae.)

1286
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,639
(Just trust me.)

1287
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:39,378
We need to wipe the pan to do the next one.

1288
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,819
- It looks fine. - Hey, so...

1289
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:44,448
It will taste the same as crepes anyway.

1290
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:45,648
(It worked.)

1291
00:55:45,649 --> 00:55:47,588
It turns into kimchi pancakes.

1292
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:49,119
Okay. It's good.

1293
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,928
(Jung Jae's trick worked.)

1294
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:54,528
Then, just keep the one buckwheat crepe.

1295
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:56,999
Make kimchi pancakes with the rest.

1296
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,128
- Can we cook rice cakes? - Yes.

1297
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:00,668
- Can we boil rice cake soup? - Yes.

1298
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:02,298
Can we do it?

1299
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:04,139
(Do it.)

1300
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:07,679
(Adding rice cakes after a long wait)

1301
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,889
Jung Jae asked me why I prepared so many rice cakes.

1302
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:15,948
It's for five people.

1303
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:17,025
(We can eat 1kg of rice cakes.)

1304
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:19,419
He eats small portions.

1305
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:23,758
It's ready now.

1306
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,959
(She made a big portion.)

1307
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:29,428
- Look at the pollacks. - There are a lot of them.

1308
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,429
(To fill up their empty stomach)

1309
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,539
(Rice cake soup with dried pollack made by Jung Ah)

1310
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,698
Look at this buckwheat crepe.

1311
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:36,969
(It's funny-looking.)

1312
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:40,139
(Ugly buckwheat crepe)

1313
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:43,479
(Upgraded buckwheat pancake)

1314
00:56:45,879 --> 00:56:47,348
It's a hearty breakfast.

1315
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:48,978
(It's a hearty breakfast made with everyone's efforts.)

1316
00:56:48,979 --> 00:56:51,448
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1317
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,009
-It looks tasty. - Thanks for the food.

1318
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,029
(Tasting rice cake soup with dried pollack first)

1319
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,929
(Having a spoonful of the soup)

1320
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:04,168
- It's awesome. - Do you like it?

1321
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:06,939
(Let me try it.)

1322
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:11,139
(Smiling)

1323
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:13,808
- The flavour is really rich. - Yes. I put a lot of pollack in it.

1324
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:15,889
- How could the flavour be this rich? - It's so good.

1325
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:17,648
It's really refreshing.

1326
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:20,419
(The rich, savoury flavour satisfies their appetites.)

1327
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,049
(Feeling proud)

1328
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,119
You don't usually have breakfast, do you?

1329
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,665
- I don't think you eat like this. - For breakfast...

1330
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:30,958
I usually skip breakfast.

1331
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:33,059
(Jung Jae says he usually skips breakfast.)

1332
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:36,329
(But he eats.)

1333
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,529
(It's hot.)

1334
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,809
(He eats.)

1335
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:48,839
(He eats from the bowl.)

1336
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:54,149
(He's really enjoying breakfast.)

1337
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:58,689
You say you don't usually have breakfast.

1338
00:57:59,649 --> 00:58:01,219
You're really enjoying breakfast.

1339
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:03,688
I can't stop eating it.

1340
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:04,989
(Embarrassed)

1341
00:58:06,189 --> 00:58:07,959
You really eat well.

1342
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:09,559
We always eat well.

1343
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:13,238
I'll tear it into pieces. Can I?

1344
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,439
- Sure. - It sounds good.

1345
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:16,509
This is a new type of pancake.

1346
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,938
- It's a buckwheat kimchi pancake. - Buckwheat kimchi pancake?

1347
00:58:18,939 --> 00:58:20,238
It's tearing apart.

1348
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:21,438
(It looks fine.)

1349
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:23,409
(But how is the taste?)

1350
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:26,648
- It tastes good. - Does it?

1351
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:27,849
- Does it taste good? - Yes.

1352
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:32,219
(Good)

1353
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,219
The taste is amazing.

1354
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:36,558
(Jung Jae's buckwheat pancake looks pleasing and tastes amazing.)

1355
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,659
It's so good.

1356
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:39,459
It's really tasty.

1357
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:42,699
(While they're enjoying breakfast)

1358
00:58:42,959 --> 00:58:45,529
Why does no one touch the buckwheat crepes?

1359
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:48,209
- I haven't tried it. - It's because it's far away.

1360
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:51,839
(No one touched the buckwheat crepe because it's far away.)

1361
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:56,139
- Let's try it since they made it. - We should try it.

1362
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:58,878
(Let's try it.)

1363
00:58:58,879 --> 00:59:01,349
- Let's try some. - Let's taste it.

1364
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,589
(Admiring before even chewing it)

1365
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:12,929
(And she's speechless.)

1366
00:59:13,089 --> 00:59:14,328
I personally like this one better.

1367
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:16,199
(Sorry)

1368
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:17,998
- That's more crispy. - This one is better.

1369
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:19,698
- It has more texture. - Buckwheat pancake.

1370
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:21,659
(Having a better breakfast, thanks to Mr. Freeze)

1371
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:24,469
(Jung Jae is holding the bowl of rice cake soup.)

1372
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:27,609
(Clearing the bowl)

1373
00:59:33,749 --> 00:59:36,788
(Finishing up rice cake soup with dried pollack)

1374
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:39,489
I've never seen you eat this much.

1375
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,259
I've never eaten this much.

1376
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,219
He's eating more and more.

1377
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,059
He cleared the bowl.

1378
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:47,998
I gave you a lot.

1379
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:49,228
(It's my first time eating this much.)

1380
00:59:49,229 --> 00:59:50,699
(Staring)

1381
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:53,268
Do you have something to tell us?

1382
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:54,498
- Do you want us to finish eating? - Please tell us.

1383
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:57,739
We need to discuss what we talked about last night.

1384
00:59:58,209 --> 00:59:59,309
Advance payment?

1385
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:02,109
- Let's go out after breakfast. - Going out?

1386
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:04,578
Let's eat out.

1387
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:06,419
(Leader Yum announced that they would go out.)

1388
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:08,379
How much do we have?

1389
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:11,019
About that...

1390
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,559
We need some help.

1391
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:17,429
Since Jung Jae came here,

1392
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,228
we should treat him to coffee at a nice place.

1393
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:20,398
- At a nice place? - Yes, at a nice place.

1394
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:21,999
I really crave coffee from a cafe.

1395
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:24,629
(Please help us out.)

1396
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:26,699
We've thought about it.

1397
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:30,039
It'd be a shame just to give you an advance payment.

1398
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:34,179
And Lee Jung Jae starred in "Squid Game."

1399
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:36,808
We'll play some games...

1400
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,409
and give you a chance to earn money for an outing.

1401
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,319
What if the guest doesn't want to play games?

1402
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,319
He's probably sick of games because of "Squid Game."

1403
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,889
What if the guest wants to go out right away?

1404
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:55,158
We prepared two games.

1405
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,768
If you win both games,

1406
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:59,298
you'll earn up to 250 dollars.

1407
01:00:59,299 --> 01:01:00,299
(Intriguing)

1408
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,399
(An amount similar to the daily pay)

1409
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,409
Let me hear what games you prepared.

1410
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:08,778
(Stage 1: Ddakji)

1411
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:11,809
Everyone gets three chances to play Ddakji.

1412
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:15,018
You will earn ten dollars for each success.

1413
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:16,448
- If we flip it? - Yes.

1414
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:17,725
(They can earn up to 150 dollars with 10 dollars for each success.)

1415
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:19,789
Another game is Jegi.

1416
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:21,159
I'm not confident in that.

1417
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:23,558
Jegi is pretty hard to play.

1418
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,458
(If they kick it 10 times together, it's a success.)

1419
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:27,528
If you succeed, you'll get 100 dollars.

1420
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:29,799
(They get 100 dollars when they succeed.)

1421
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,498
(150 dollars for Ddakji, 100 dollars for Jegi)

1422
01:01:32,499 --> 01:01:34,669
(They can get up to 250 dollars in total.)

1423
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,909
(No way)

1424
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:39,509
I know it very well.

1425
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:42,839
- He has played it. - Ddakji! Jegi!

1426
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,979
I know it very well.

1427
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:46,919
- We're not going to succeed. - Everyone!

1428
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:51,189
Oh, my gosh. It looks easy to you, doesn't it?

1429
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:53,089
"I have played this game before."

1430
01:01:54,689 --> 01:01:56,419
Since the weather is so nice today,

1431
01:01:56,689 --> 01:02:00,058
it'll be nice to go out to the beach and enjoy some good food.

1432
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:01,499
We'd love to do that.

1433
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:05,198
Jung Ah, did you finish breakfast? Should we play the games now?

1434
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,228
Do it now?

1435
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:07,498
It's challenging.

1436
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:09,938
My goodness. I can't believe we'll play those games.

1437
01:02:09,939 --> 01:02:11,769
(Stage 1: Ddakji)

1438
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:14,078
Will it work? Shall I try it?

1439
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,319
(Will it work? Shall I try it?)

1440
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,678
It's worth ten dollars, right?

1441
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:18,855
(1 success is worth 10 dollars.)

1442
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,679
(She practices.)

1443
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:23,179
(Laughing)

1444
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:25,618
(Slapping)

1445
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:26,919
What's this?

1446
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:28,589
(Embarrassed)

1447
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,829
I can't even hit the target.

1448
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:32,088
I don't think it'll work.

1449
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:35,099
(Missing)

1450
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:39,569
(She hits it multiple times, but the ddakji doesn't budge.)

1451
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:42,738
Gosh, I'll drop out.

1452
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:43,769
(Gosh, I'll drop out.)

1453
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:46,469
(The youngest one puts on his combat shoes.)

1454
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:48,339
- Let's earn some money. - Okay.

1455
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,349
Back in the day...

1456
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:53,009
- when I was in elementary school, - Okay.

1457
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:56,178
I made kids in my neighbourhood cry with the Pokemon ddakji.

1458
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:57,819
Don't talk big. Hurry up and try it.

1459
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:02,489
(I'll make the production crew cry today.)

1460
01:03:02,689 --> 01:03:04,959
(Expectant)

1461
01:03:07,129 --> 01:03:09,998
(His form is perfect.)

1462
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:11,829
(How will be the result?)

1463
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,139
(It doesn't even budge.)

1464
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:17,909
(Disappointed)

1465
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:20,539
(Embarrassed)

1466
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,509
(I told you that it wouldn't work.)

1467
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,509
(Full of doubts)

1468
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,479
It won't work. For goodness' sake.

1469
01:03:28,249 --> 01:03:30,548
The next player is Lee Jung Jae, the world-renowned star.

1470
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:32,909
(How will be the ddakji skills of the world-renowned star?)

1471
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:37,989
(Freeze)

1472
01:03:38,259 --> 01:03:40,158
Jung Jae.

1473
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,529
(Dejected)

1474
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:43,159
Oh, no.

1475
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:46,028
- There are skills, right? - What?

1476
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:47,298
Aren't there skills?

1477
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:48,769
There are skills indeed.

1478
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,138
That's right. There's a trick.

1479
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:52,739
(It's a trick he honed on "Squid Game.")

1480
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,479
(The lethal move, foot support)

1481
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:00,849
(The lethal move, making a dust storm)

1482
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:02,979
(What was that?)

1483
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:05,219
Gosh, you're good.

1484
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,195
- Have you tried it? - I can't do it.

1485
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,459
I can't even hit the target.

1486
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:10,788
- Have you played Ddakji before? - No.

1487
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:12,469
(The first sibling hasn't even played it.)

1488
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:13,929
I might be good at it.

1489
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:17,029
- Doesn't it look easier? - What?

1490
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:20,468
Change it to a different one.

1491
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:22,268
Which one? Will you keep using this one?

1492
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:23,639
Do you want a different one?

1493
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:25,738
(He changes the ddakji.)

1494
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:26,808
That one?

1495
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:29,078
Ready? Set, go.

1496
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:30,439
(The real game begins for Ddakji.)

1497
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:33,579
(The 1st player, Lee Jung Jae)

1498
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:35,148
(Each person will get three chances.)

1499
01:04:35,149 --> 01:04:36,749
(Each success will get them 10 dollars.)

1500
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:40,149
(How much money will the experienced player earn?)

1501
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:43,858
(From the start, )

1502
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:45,929
(he shows a full swing.)

1503
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,668
(The ddakji nearly flips over, )

1504
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:53,669
(but he fails.)
It was close.

1505
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,238
- Gosh. - I think it'll work.

1506
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:57,539
(But he gets three chances.)

1507
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:02,109
(The beast has spotted the target.)

1508
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:05,149
(It's the biggest crisis in this ddakji's life.)

1509
01:05:06,109 --> 01:05:07,379
- Please. - My goodness.

1510
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:09,519
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

1511
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:11,549
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

1512
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,559
- He's exhausted already. - Already...

1513
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:16,859
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

1514
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:18,289
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

1515
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:21,759
(The 1st player, Lee Jung Jae is out without any points.)

1516
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,128
This is...

1517
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:24,769
(Even an experienced player failed.)

1518
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:27,599
What are we going to do? We won't succeed in it once.

1519
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:29,099
I'll give it a go.

1520
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:31,908
Gosh.

1521
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:33,669
(Without any success, Park Jun Myun is out.)

1522
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:37,049
(Shouting)

1523
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:41,119
(As expected, Yum Jung Ah is out.)

1524
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:43,918
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?

1525
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:44,989
One, two...

1526
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:46,958
(1 failure out of 3 chances)

1527
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,219
(The 2nd try)

1528
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:50,928
(Success?)

1529
01:05:50,929 --> 01:05:52,559
(2 consecutive failures)

1530
01:05:58,629 --> 01:06:00,799
It was a trickier shot.

1531
01:06:01,299 --> 01:06:02,499
Was it a trickier shot?

1532
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:03,968
Try it again.

1533
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:05,309
(It's Ji Yeon's last chance.)

1534
01:06:05,409 --> 01:06:07,639
Ji Yeon, hit it well. It's flip over if you do that.

1535
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:09,109
I just need to hit it well.

1536
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:11,478
- I think I can do it. - You can do it.

1537
01:06:11,479 --> 01:06:13,399
- You're nearly there. - You can do it, Ji Yeon.

1538
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:14,679
You're nearly there.
(I told you that it was hard.)

1539
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,019
(What?)

1540
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:23,789
(She made it flip over!)

1541
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:28,328
- Of course. - Gosh, Ji Yeon.

1542
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:29,358
Ten dollars.

1543
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,829
Did we earn ten dollars?

1544
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:34,099
Jae Wook, just once.

1545
01:06:35,499 --> 01:06:37,609
(1 failure out of 3 chances)

1546
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:40,679
(2 failures out of 3 chances)

1547
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:43,438
The third try. Jae Wook, good luck.

1548
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:45,399
(It's their last chance to earn money in Ddakji.)

1549
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:48,519
Come to your senses.

1550
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:50,269
- I feel dizzy. - Come to your senses.

1551
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:52,049
I miss my mom.

1552
01:06:53,649 --> 01:06:56,019
(Captain Ddakji's last swing)

1553
01:07:00,629 --> 01:07:01,898
(He succeeds in scoring.)

1554
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:03,828
- Twenty dollars. Well done. - Twenty dollars.

1555
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:06,128
- Okay. - Twenty dollars? With that...

1556
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:08,639
(With Ddakji, they only earned 20 dollars.)

1557
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:11,268
(The Ferris wheel fare:)

1558
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:14,539
(60 dollars)

1559
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:18,479
(The beach awaits us.)

1560
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,018
Will we be able to do it?

1561
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:23,179
(They need more money.)

1562
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:27,119
(They must succeed in Jegi.)

1563
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,689
- Practice. - Practice.

1564
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:29,858
Here.

1565
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,188
(Hurried)

1566
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:32,289
Practice.

1567
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,769
(Solemn)

1568
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:42,368
(The first sibling shows strange movements.)

1569
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:43,469
Right now...

1570
01:07:45,339 --> 01:07:46,409
What?

1571
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:47,909
What?

1572
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:49,039
- Jung Ah. - Hold on.

1573
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,208
Jung Ah, don't make me laugh. Seriously.

1574
01:07:52,209 --> 01:07:53,689
(We forgot about Jung Ah's nickname.)

1575
01:07:55,249 --> 01:07:57,589
Move to the rhythm!

1576
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:59,589
(No-rhythm Yum)

1577
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:01,988
(Throughout the summer last year, )

1578
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:05,189
(she showed no improvement.)

1579
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:08,499
It'll be bad if I don't kick it once.

1580
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,299
(Laughing)

1581
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:11,798
It'll be bad if I don't kick it once.

1582
01:08:11,799 --> 01:08:14,399
(Is that the Bongsan Mask Dance?)

1583
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:16,638
Why are you being funny?

1584
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:18,108
I'm not being funny.

1585
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:19,369
I'm doing my absolute best.

1586
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:23,038
(The second sibling isn't much better.)

1587
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:25,049
I can only kick it once.

1588
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:26,678
One each.

1589
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:28,649
I can't kick it more than once.

1590
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:30,688
(Is Jung Jae good at it?)

1591
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,119
One, two.

1592
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:33,619
(Is that all?)

1593
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:36,218
- All right. - He surely has experience.

1594
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:37,259
(He kicked it once more.)

1595
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:39,189
One, two.

1596
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:41,059
He can kick it twice.

1597
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,429
I haven't done it before.

1598
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,729
(Let's see the young blood.)

1599
01:08:46,429 --> 01:08:47,569
Gosh.

1600
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:48,769
I can only kick it twice.

1601
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:51,509
I can only kick it twice.

1602
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:54,408
(The third sibling who was a student-athlete)

1603
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:55,938
One, two.

1604
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:57,108
- Ji Yeon did it twice. - Twice.

1605
01:08:57,109 --> 01:08:59,309
You can do it. You have a chance, Ji Yeon.

1606
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,419
- It isn't easy. - Hold on. Two.

1607
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:02,848
- One. - Two.

1608
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:04,448
- I kicked it once. - One, one, and two.

1609
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:05,449
(The total is 8.)

1610
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:07,048
(We're in trouble.)

1611
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:08,759
It's impossible.

1612
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,459
I'm really bad at Jegi.

1613
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:12,029
I haven't tried it before.

1614
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:16,299
Jung Ah was excited about going out in pretty clothes.

1615
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,829
It's really difficult.

1616
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:22,368
Jegi is difficult.

1617
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:23,808
(Fresh off the Sea members are bad with their bodies.)

1618
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:24,969
This is driving me crazy.

1619
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:26,838
I can't kick it more than once.

1620
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,078
(They can't get more than 10.)

1621
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:29,238
I can't do it well since I'm not used to it.

1622
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:30,548
You invited a guest,

1623
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:32,848
but you don't even want to buy a cup of coffee!

1624
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:35,848
(The world-renowned star becomes upset in the end.)

1625
01:09:35,849 --> 01:09:38,548
If you kick it ten times at once,

1626
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,719
we'll give you 150 dollars.

1627
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:42,218
Ten times?

1628
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,465
(The reward improves drastically.)

1629
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:45,628
- Okay. - That'll be great. We're on.

1630
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:46,958
- Let's go. - Okay.

1631
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:48,028
Now...

1632
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:49,758
- Shall I go first? - Okay.

1633
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:50,768
Will you give it a go?

1634
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:51,928
- Here we go. - Here we go.

1635
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:53,669
(The 1st player, Jae Wook)

1636
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:56,068
(They become nervous as well.)

1637
01:09:56,069 --> 01:09:58,208
(Let's do well, okay?)

1638
01:09:58,209 --> 01:09:59,469
- I'll begin. - Here we go.

1639
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:00,679
Here I go.

1640
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:04,948
One, two,

1641
01:10:04,949 --> 01:10:06,078
- No! - three, four.

1642
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,449
- Three. - Three.

1643
01:10:08,849 --> 01:10:10,949
Oh, no. Jae Wook, you...

1644
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:13,188
(He kicked it once more...)

1645
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:14,749
(compared to his record from practice.)

1646
01:10:14,959 --> 01:10:16,388
- Ji Yeon, it's your turn. - Show us.

1647
01:10:16,389 --> 01:10:17,889
- Two. - Ji Yeon.

1648
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:20,429
(Shouting)

1649
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:24,368
(Shouting)

1650
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:26,299
(We're ruined.)

1651
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:29,039
- One. - One.

1652
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:30,669
(Dejected)

1653
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,739
One.

1654
01:10:32,669 --> 01:10:34,679
- Let's kick it once each. - Okay.

1655
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:35,778
Seriously. One.

1656
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:37,909
Kick it once at the very least!

1657
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:39,908
- One. - Gosh, the wind...

1658
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:41,879
Kick it once at the very least!

1659
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,189
One.

1660
01:10:44,289 --> 01:10:45,489
Done.

1661
01:10:45,919 --> 01:10:48,159
(For goodness' sake)

1662
01:10:48,419 --> 01:10:49,718
(Up next is the No-Rhythm Yum.)

1663
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:50,959
The ground needs to be flat.

1664
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:54,259
(Flattening the ground)

1665
01:10:58,169 --> 01:10:59,799
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

1666
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:02,379
I'm scared that I won't kick it once.

1667
01:11:03,499 --> 01:11:06,539
(We believe in you!)

1668
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:10,439
(The jegi leaves her hand.)

1669
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:12,249
(Screaming)

1670
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:14,649
(She succeeds in kicking it once!)

1671
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:20,419
(She threw her entire body and succeeded in kicking it once.)

1672
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,319
- You still kicked it. - Seriously.

1673
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:24,128
- You still kicked it. - Seriously.

1674
01:11:24,129 --> 01:11:26,329
(No-Rhythm Yum overcame her limits.)

1675
01:11:26,889 --> 01:11:29,858
(The last player can't smile.)

1676
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,669
- One. - How many do we have left?

1677
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:33,068
(1, 1, 1, and 3 times)

1678
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:34,798
(They kicked it 6 out of 10 times.)

1679
01:11:34,799 --> 01:11:36,568
For goodness' sake.

1680
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:38,568
(He needs to kick it 4 times to succeed in the mission.)

1681
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:39,739
It's hard.

1682
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:41,838
Jung Jae, good luck!

1683
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,739
(World-renowned star, good luck!)

1684
01:11:44,249 --> 01:11:46,109
- Set, go. - Go.

1685
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:49,079
Why am I the last one to go?

1686
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,388
(As soon as he finishes talking, )

1687
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,459
(he begins!)

1688
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:55,919
- One. - All right.

1689
01:11:57,329 --> 01:11:58,428
- One. - All right.

1690
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:00,528
(What was that?)

1691
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:01,629
One.

1692
01:12:02,599 --> 01:12:04,569
It doesn't count if you catch the jegi.

1693
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:06,569
- It ends when the jegi drops. - That's right.

1694
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:09,299
(He has a heavy responsibility.)

1695
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:13,269
(He made a mess upon arrival.)

1696
01:12:14,609 --> 01:12:17,279
(There were some humiliating moments.)

1697
01:12:18,009 --> 01:12:20,249
(But it's time for the real competition.)

1698
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:24,189
One, two,

1699
01:12:26,289 --> 01:12:27,319
three...

1700
01:12:28,019 --> 01:12:30,419
(What?)

1701
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:32,689
(Jung Jae!)

1702
01:12:33,429 --> 01:12:34,429
(I have played...)

1703
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,929
(this game before.)

1704
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:38,629
- Four, five. - Four.

1705
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:43,368
- One, two, three, four, five. - Four.

1706
01:12:43,369 --> 01:12:45,209
(It's a home run.)

1707
01:12:45,609 --> 01:12:46,839
(Jung Jae!)

1708
01:12:48,579 --> 01:12:51,248
Jegi! I know it very well.

1709
01:12:51,249 --> 01:12:52,649
(A hero appears in troubled times.)

1710
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,348
(They succeed in Jegi!)

1711
01:12:56,349 --> 01:12:59,248
People ask me to play Jegi whenever I go somewhere.

1712
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,619
I've never obliged.

1713
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:03,259
I can't believe I did it here. For goodness' sake.

1714
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,958
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1715
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:07,158
(We're honoured.)

1716
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:08,398
- Eleven times? - Yes.

1717
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:09,658
(With the Jegi mission, they earned 150 dollars.)

1718
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,869
- Is the total 170 dollars? - The total is 170 dollars.

1719
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:13,498
The total is 170 dollars.

1720
01:13:13,499 --> 01:13:16,599
(The four siblings and Jung Jae won.)

1721
01:13:17,169 --> 01:13:19,768
Let's do this around the world.

1722
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:21,008
Shall we play Jegi around the world?

1723
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:22,255
(The Jegi troupe gets ready to go out.)

1724
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:23,939
Let's pack money.

1725
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,879
We have 170 dollars.

1726
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:31,519
(Lady Ok applies makeup.)

1727
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:35,319
(The oldest member makes herself pretty as well.)

1728
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:39,329
(Jung Jae uses the spare time to work.)

1729
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:43,329
(Jae Wook checks his appearance thoroughly.)

1730
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:45,429
(Let's go.)

1731
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:48,039
(She puts on the hip sunglasses.)

1732
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:49,969
- Do I look strange? - You look cute.

1733
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:52,969
I look like Zhu Bajie. Seriously.

1734
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:54,778
(Howdy.)

1735
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:56,109
- Zhu Bajie. - You look funny.

1736
01:13:57,339 --> 01:13:59,308
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1737
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,279
(Shall we leave for an outing in Sokcho?)

1738
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:08,059
(Rolling)

1739
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,059
(Rushing over)

1740
01:14:12,259 --> 01:14:14,629
(Lock the door when you leave the house!)

1741
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:16,605
Are you worried about a thief?

1742
01:14:16,629 --> 01:14:18,929
- Still, we should lock the door. - It's our house.

1743
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:21,299
(We need to close the door well.)

1744
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,439
(Laughing)

1745
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:27,938
A thief will be able to open it easily.

1746
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:29,455
(A thief will be able to open it easily.)

1747
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:31,079
(Sad)

1748
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:33,649
(Staring)

1749
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,679
(I'll mind the house.)

1750
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:39,289
(Have a nice trip.)

1751
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:41,089
- Shall we go? - Let's hit the road.

1752
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:43,619
All right. Let's go.

1753
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:48,099
- Jung Jae. - Yes?

1754
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,369
- What's your song request? - My song request?

1755
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:52,469
I like all sorts of songs.

1756
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,169
(Which song will DJ Yum choose for Jung Jae?)

1757
01:14:57,469 --> 01:14:59,269
(This is a good choice, right?)

1758
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:00,939
(She turns on the music.)

1759
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,249
(My goodness)

1760
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:08,449
("That That" by PSY for the world-renowned star)

1761
01:15:08,549 --> 01:15:10,349
(Their excitement is coming back.)

1762
01:15:10,449 --> 01:15:11,449
(Come here.)

1763
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,118
(We're here.)

1764
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,189
(Our excitement is here.)

1765
01:15:16,559 --> 01:15:17,559
(Bobbing his head)

1766
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,389
(Even Mr. Freeze unfreezes!)

1767
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:22,229
(Chuckling)

1768
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,598
(Get ready)

1769
01:15:25,599 --> 01:15:27,129
(And shoot!)

1770
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:30,339
(Jung Ah and Jae Wook are responsible for the good cheer.)

1771
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:34,239
(Left, right)

1772
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:38,449
(Their good cheer doesn't die down.)

1773
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:43,419
(This is fun.)

1774
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:48,489
(Is it over already?)

1775
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:53,789
(Jung Ah's performance begins now!)

1776
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:55,529
(The old student of hip-hop)

1777
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:56,559
(Chuckling)

1778
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:00,869
(It isn't over until it is.)

1779
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,809
(The next song is "Dynamite" by BTS.)

1780
01:16:05,539 --> 01:16:08,409
(It's perfect for the drive.)

1781
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:12,479
(It suits Jung Jae's tastes.)

1782
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:18,119
(They drive along the rice fields and the sea.)

1783
01:16:18,849 --> 01:16:20,889
(Glancing over)

1784
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:24,789
(Jung Jae is curious about what's outside the window.)

1785
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:27,489
(Staring)

1786
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,429
Jung Jae, aren't you very excited?

1787
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:30,899
I bet you are.

1788
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,098
Aren't you very excited?

1789
01:16:33,099 --> 01:16:34,099
(Laughing)

1790
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:35,598
Should I be?

1791
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:37,439
(Am I excited?)

1792
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:43,109
(With excitement, they leave the foot of Mount Seorak.)

1793
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:46,678
The weather is so nice today.

1794
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:48,149
(They drive along the sea.)

1795
01:16:50,549 --> 01:16:51,989
It's the sea.

1796
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:53,619
It's so nice.

1797
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:54,958
That's it.

1798
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:57,628
The Ferris wheel is much bigger than I expected.

1799
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:59,089
The view will be amazing.

1800
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:02,399
(Shall we go and ride the Ferris wheel?)

1801
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:04,329
Do we need to get on as it moves?

1802
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,998
It doesn't stop. It keeps moving.

1803
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,898
We should get on quickly.

1804
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:13,069
(Watch your feet when you get on.)

1805
01:17:13,269 --> 01:17:15,038
- Please enter the pod. Go on in. - Okay.

1806
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:16,039
Go on in.

1807
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,749
(The older girls enter first.)

1808
01:17:17,849 --> 01:17:20,309
(Entering)

1809
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:22,978
(Jung Ah rushes over.)

1810
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:24,719
Jung Ah, you won't die.

1811
01:17:24,749 --> 01:17:27,389
- My goodness. - It's very spacious.

1812
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:28,719
It's so nice.

1813
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:32,529
- Gosh, this is doable. - It's so nice.

1814
01:17:32,759 --> 01:17:34,899
There must be something.

1815
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:38,568
(It captivates the hearts of the members.)

1816
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:39,769
It's so pretty.

1817
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:42,139
It's so nice.

1818
01:17:42,439 --> 01:17:44,198
You can see the mountains in the back...

1819
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,968
and the sea in the front. It's nice.

1820
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:47,779
(The view of Mount Seorak is a bonus.)

1821
01:17:52,879 --> 01:17:54,049
The beginning.

1822
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:55,879
(My goodness)

1823
01:17:56,549 --> 01:17:58,389
(Impressed)

1824
01:17:59,019 --> 01:18:01,159
(Jung Jae is fascinated by the Ferris wheel.)

1825
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:02,859
Isn't it your first time riding it?

1826
01:18:03,089 --> 01:18:05,588
I don't even ride it at a tourist destination abroad.

1827
01:18:05,589 --> 01:18:06,759
Of course not.

1828
01:18:07,259 --> 01:18:08,298
It's my first time.

1829
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:11,168
(He rides it for the first time...)

1830
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:14,499
(with the four siblings.)

1831
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:18,539
The sandy beach bends at the spot with water.

1832
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:21,508
Gosh, which plot of land should I buy?

1833
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:23,209
(Laughing)

1834
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,779
(It looks like he still has the prize money.)

1835
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:27,278
Jung Jae, do you want to sit on this side?

1836
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:28,849
No. I can see everything.

1837
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:32,149
The sides will switch as the pod goes down.

1838
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:35,119
So it doesn't matter where you sit.

1839
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:42,959
(She becomes absorbed in her memories.)

1840
01:18:43,529 --> 01:18:47,629
You know, you ride the Ferris wheel during a trip.

1841
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:51,968
Couples ride it at night.

1842
01:18:51,969 --> 01:18:55,079
- Stop talking about kissing. - You should kiss as you live.

1843
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,439
(Laughing)

1844
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,249
Where do you kiss?

1845
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:01,578
- When the pod is at the very top, - The very top?

1846
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:03,348
You kiss.

1847
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:04,349
That's right.

1848
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:08,159
- It isn't the right time yet. - No.

1849
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:14,529
(They haven't reached the best spot for a kiss.)

1850
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:16,998
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1851
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:18,769
- The sea is so pretty. - Look at that.

1852
01:19:19,429 --> 01:19:21,799
(They look at the horizon in a daze.)

1853
01:19:23,569 --> 01:19:25,668
- It's nice. - My goodness.

1854
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:27,368
The sea is pretty. Look at the colour.

1855
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:28,579
Isn't the colour beautiful?'

1856
01:19:29,979 --> 01:19:32,809
The winter sea is romantic.

1857
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:35,379
Let's check out the sea and...

1858
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:36,779
You want to walk, right?

1859
01:19:43,019 --> 01:19:45,729
(They decide to walk on the beach.)

1860
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:50,028
(Sokcho's winter sea is full of romance.)

1861
01:19:50,029 --> 01:19:51,129
It's the winter sea.

1862
01:19:52,499 --> 01:19:53,768
Let's play rock-paper-scissors and have the loser jump in.

1863
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:54,769
Come on.

1864
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:57,469
(He's mischievous.)

1865
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:00,208
- It's the sea. - The sea is pretty.

1866
01:20:00,209 --> 01:20:01,308
It's pretty.

1867
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:02,409
(It's nice to look at it.)

1868
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:06,409
Shall I take a photo each? A solo photo?

1869
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,119
Why would you take a solo photo? Don't take it.

1870
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:12,249
Don't take it.

1871
01:20:13,389 --> 01:20:14,688
(We'll take the photos in earnest.)

1872
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:16,189
Gosh, Jung Ah.

1873
01:20:17,589 --> 01:20:18,758
Gosh.

1874
01:20:18,759 --> 01:20:20,259
(Ji Yeon hops lightly.)

1875
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,698
- Gosh, Jae Wook. - His limbs are so long.

1876
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:25,228
- Jae Wook. - My goodness.

1877
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:27,309
(They know how to make him look tall in the photos.)

1878
01:20:27,429 --> 01:20:28,639
I want to jump.

1879
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:30,219
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1880
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:31,839
Something like this.

1881
01:20:32,469 --> 01:20:33,738
(Shouting)

1882
01:20:33,739 --> 01:20:35,308
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1883
01:20:35,309 --> 01:20:37,109
(Invested)

1884
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:38,749
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1885
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:39,908
(Jun Myun flies.)

1886
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,718
- Did you take it? - You overdid yourself.

1887
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:42,719
Did I overdo myself?

1888
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:45,819
(The thing is...)

1889
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:48,018
- I'm nearly on the ground. - I couldn't capture it.

1890
01:20:48,019 --> 01:20:49,899
- The jump was too small. - For goodness' sake.

1891
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,559
At least you got off the Earth.

1892
01:20:55,599 --> 01:20:57,659
Let's take a selfie.

1893
01:20:58,699 --> 01:20:59,968
All right.

1894
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:01,169
- One, two, three. - Three.

1895
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:04,398
(The four siblings' Sokcho outing with Mr. Freeze)

1896
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:05,409
Let's go now.

1897
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:06,945
Are you done looking at it?

1898
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:08,208
- We took the photos. - Let's go.

1899
01:21:08,209 --> 01:21:10,215
- Do we leave after the photos? - We leave after the photos.

1900
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,278
Let's go.

1901
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:12,909
(Jae Wook doesn't want to go.)

1902
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:14,278
Make a good memory.

1903
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:17,279
(He writes a message on the beach.)

1904
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:20,119
(Walking over)

1905
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,389
(Glancing over)

1906
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,358
Go over there. Stay in my line of sight.

1907
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:25,429
(Suspicious)

1908
01:21:26,659 --> 01:21:29,129
(Ji Yeon participates in making a good memory.)

1909
01:21:33,269 --> 01:21:34,399
You startled me!

1910
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:40,009
(He writes a message again.)

1911
01:21:41,139 --> 01:21:43,979
(The first outing was precious.)

1912
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:50,779
(Fresh off the Sea 2)

1913
01:21:51,289 --> 01:21:53,388
Ji Yeon, take the lead.

1914
01:21:53,389 --> 01:21:54,789
You know the way.

1915
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:56,865
- Okay. - We ran down this road earlier.

1916
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:58,989
Yes. If you look around,

1917
01:21:59,089 --> 01:22:01,189
there are stone walls everywhere.

1918
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:03,529
Stone walls.

1919
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,768
(My goodness)

1920
01:22:04,769 --> 01:22:06,069
An artwork is standing there.

1921
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:09,039
It's cute.

1922
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:12,838
- It's an artwork. - It was made with painted rocks.

1923
01:22:12,839 --> 01:22:14,615
(A cute artwork adorns the top of the stone wall.)

1924
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,978
Each house has...

1925
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,249
- a unique stone artwork. - Okay. She's our guide.

1926
01:22:20,309 --> 01:22:21,749
I think it's handmade.

1927
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:25,149
- Look at this. Isn't it cute? - It's cute.

1928
01:22:25,949 --> 01:22:27,249
The photo studio is here.

1929
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:29,358
Let's go.

1930
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:30,459
(A photo studio?)

1931
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:33,389
- Black and white self photo studio. - Yes.

1932
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:37,258
It's so pretty.

1933
01:22:37,259 --> 01:22:38,829
- It's cute, right? - Yes.

1934
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:41,798
- This is the place. - My goodness.

1935
01:22:41,799 --> 01:22:43,599
(They're here for the first family portrait.)

1936
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:46,238
- The photos are so pretty. - Yes.

1937
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,639
How cute.

1938
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,608
Should we wear an item each?

1939
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:52,709
A funny item?

1940
01:22:52,879 --> 01:22:54,608
Should we wear a funny item each?

1941
01:22:54,609 --> 01:22:55,819
- Good. - That's a good idea.

1942
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,519
(Jung Ah's choice)

1943
01:22:59,619 --> 01:23:00,688
It's cute.

1944
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:03,889
(The personification of coolness)

1945
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:07,029
(Laughing)

1946
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:10,059
(Cute and adorable)

1947
01:23:10,829 --> 01:23:12,028
Jung Jae.

1948
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,949
(It's our first time seeing Jung Jae like this.)

1949
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:16,269
One, two, three.

1950
01:23:18,169 --> 01:23:20,439
- How cute. - How cute.

1951
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:21,608
(However)

1952
01:23:21,609 --> 01:23:22,839
Jung Jae, did you yawn?

1953
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:26,279
(Awkward)

1954
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:28,949
(This won't do.)

1955
01:23:29,049 --> 01:23:31,319
Let's stop at "Fresh off" this time.

1956
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:33,448
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1957
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:35,119
- Fresh off. - Fresh off.

1958
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:36,688
One, two, three.

1959
01:23:36,689 --> 01:23:38,189
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1960
01:23:39,459 --> 01:23:42,659
- Let's move. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1961
01:23:43,929 --> 01:23:45,568
(Fresh off the Sea, )

1962
01:23:45,569 --> 01:23:47,569
(let's go!)

1963
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:49,998
(Laughing)

1964
01:23:49,999 --> 01:23:51,298
We look like a band.

1965
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:52,868
(A 5-member band, The Seas)

1966
01:23:52,869 --> 01:23:54,855
- A mixed-gender band? - It's a mixed-gender band.

1967
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,209
How about this one?

1968
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:58,249
Go with that one then.

1969
01:23:58,309 --> 01:24:00,609
- This one? - The band one is nice.

1970
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:04,149
- You guys look like a family. - A family.

1971
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:06,019
We're practically a family.

1972
01:24:06,219 --> 01:24:07,819
- We'll have five copies. - Okay.

1973
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:12,289
- It's cute. - Is it cute?

1974
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:16,458
(February 21, 2025, The 1st family portrait...)

1975
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:17,999
(with Jung Jae)

1976
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:21,799
- We're done with this house, right? - That's right.

1977
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,538
I'm so disappointed.

1978
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:25,109
(Disappointed)

1979
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:27,038
Did you finish packing up?

1980
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,339
(The four siblings get ready to return to their daily lives.)

1981
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:34,209
(My precious soybean water)

1982
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:36,679
Let me get you the soybean water.

1983
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:41,388
(The homemade soybean water goes to the guest they're thankful to.)

1984
01:24:41,389 --> 01:24:42,518
I'll enjoy it.

1985
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:43,788
Now,

1986
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:46,888
we'll take our last selfie in the house.

1987
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:48,259
- The last selfie? Okay. - Yes.

1988
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,799
- I'll hold it. - A selfie.

1989
01:24:51,599 --> 01:24:52,768
Bye.

1990
01:24:52,769 --> 01:24:54,029
(My precious soybean water)

1991
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:56,538
It was my first time on a variety show,

1992
01:24:56,539 --> 01:25:00,039
so I was like, "Is this real?"

1993
01:25:00,669 --> 01:25:03,539
"Why are there so many dirty dishes?"

1994
01:25:05,749 --> 01:25:07,548
I realized once again...

1995
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:11,118
that there were people who worked hard...

1996
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:13,189
to make delicious food.

1997
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:16,859
We built a friendship over the course...

1998
01:25:17,289 --> 01:25:18,659
of 1 night and 2 days.

1999
01:25:18,789 --> 01:25:20,928
- Bye, Sokcho. - Bye.

2000
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:22,728
(The 4 siblings' 1st winter with Jung Jae)

2001
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:24,629
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2002
01:25:28,339 --> 01:25:29,439
Bye.

2003
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:30,969
I feel disappointed.

2004
01:25:31,469 --> 01:25:33,039
Jung Jae, what was the tastiest?

2005
01:25:33,569 --> 01:25:35,878
- Of course, pork backbone stew. - Pork backbone stew?

2006
01:25:35,879 --> 01:25:36,908
(He can't forget the taste of Jung Ah's pork backbone stew.)

2007
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:38,039
Of course.

2008
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:40,779
It was a surprising taste.

2009
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:43,719
The weather will be like this in March, right?

2010
01:25:43,919 --> 01:25:45,618
Which boat will we get on then?

2011
01:25:45,619 --> 01:25:47,179
(Which taste will they meet next time?)

2012
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:50,721
(They drive for 6 hours...)

2013
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:52,086
(to reach Wando.)

2014
01:25:52,316 --> 01:25:54,356
(It's where the emerald sea stretches on forever.)

2015
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:55,725
(What are the seasonal ingredients of Wando...)

2016
01:25:55,726 --> 01:25:57,156
(that contain the fresh nature?)

2017
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:58,356
(The place where...)

2018
01:25:58,357 --> 01:25:59,856
(you'll work today...)

2019
01:26:00,096 --> 01:26:02,195
(is an island named Soan Island.)

2020
01:26:02,196 --> 01:26:03,425
(By boat, )

2021
01:26:03,426 --> 01:26:04,666
(it takes 1 hour to get there.)

2022
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,395
(They'll go deeper...)

2023
01:26:06,396 --> 01:26:07,996
(into the mysterious island.)

2024
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:09,805
(What?)

2025
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:12,006
(Very nervous)

2026
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:14,535
(The members face...)

2027
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:15,805
(the busy people...)

2028
01:26:15,806 --> 01:26:17,276
(and huge cranes.)

2029
01:26:17,746 --> 01:26:19,946
(What's the place that looks like a construction site?)

2030
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:21,375
(It's laver!)

2031
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,816
(All of this is laver.)

2032
01:26:24,446 --> 01:26:25,815
(How many kilograms is this?)

2033
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:26,816
(40kg)

2034
01:26:26,817 --> 01:26:28,326
(The target is 40kg.)

2035
01:26:29,626 --> 01:26:31,456
(Jun Myun struggles with laver.)

2036
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:34,196
(Their backs bend in the 90-degree angle.)

2037
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,226
(Getting wet is a bonus.)

2038
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:39,065
(Will even the older members with experience...)

2039
01:26:39,066 --> 01:26:41,635
(crumble because of the worst work?)

2040
01:26:41,636 --> 01:26:43,065
(Here comes Chef Yum's Western restaurant.)

2041
01:26:43,066 --> 01:26:44,105
I'll get the fire going first.

2042
01:26:44,106 --> 01:26:46,106
(Today, they have a barbecue party in the garden.)

2043
01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:47,906
(Four strips of whole pork belly)

2044
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:49,576
(One strip per person)

2045
01:26:50,146 --> 01:26:51,815
(The size of the abalones is on another level.)

2046
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:53,076
(It's as big as her face.)

2047
01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:55,385
(One bag)

2048
01:26:55,386 --> 01:26:56,885
(Two bags)

2049
01:26:56,886 --> 01:26:58,045
(You're so generous.)

2050
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,085
(Cooked pasta...)

2051
01:26:59,086 --> 01:27:00,716
(and laver meet.)

2052
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,425
(The endless transformation of laver, )

2053
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:06,356
(laver and cream pasta)

2054
01:27:06,896 --> 01:27:09,426
(The umami explodes.)

2055
01:27:09,896 --> 01:27:12,412
(The flower of the garden party is the whole pork belly barbecue.)

2056
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:14,372
(There are even fried abalones from Wando with butter.)

2057
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,236
(I'm happy because there's so much to eat.)

2058
01:27:16,566 --> 01:27:19,076
(The happy Western restaurant will open.)
