1
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:17,862
(4am in Goseong, Gangwon Province)

2
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:21,032
(What was the four siblings' first work?)

3
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,801
(No one knew...)

4
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:24,272
(what would get caught.)

5
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:27,927
(The difficulty level of the first work was high.)

6
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:29,071
(Grunting)

7
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,241
(Screaming)

8
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,111
(The ailing sounds filled...)

9
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:34,152
(the four siblings' extreme work!)

10
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:40,352
(Fresh fish were right before their eyes.)

11
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:44,262
(But the joy of the catch was short-lived!)

12
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:45,462
(Are you okay?)

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,891
(The pain of seasickness hit Jae Wook very suddenly.)

14
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:49,231
(Me too.)

15
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:50,331
(Ji Yeon, Jae Wook)

16
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,532
(The new youngsters had an intense welcoming ceremony.)

17
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:56,942
(I've never experienced this kind of seasickness.)

18
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,071
(They forgot about seasickness...)

19
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:02,372
(thanks to their house at the foot of Mount Seorak.)

20
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:07,452
(They began making seokbakji they'd eat for days!)

21
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:08,581
Add one spoonful.

22
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:12,452
(Seasoning Park gave her student, Ji Yeon, a lesson.)

23
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:15,092
(I'll learn everything about seokbakji!)

24
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:17,122
(What happened in the yard in the meanwhile?)

25
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:20,531
(Generous Jung Ah...)

26
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,562
(began making tofu!)

27
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:27,102
(Jae Wook became Jung Ah's helper.)

28
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:28,802
(It should be boiling by now.)
(I know.)

29
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:33,202
(Did Generous Jung Ah encounter a problem?)

30
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,511
It's taking so long.

31
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,512
(It's taking too long to boil.)

32
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,912
There's a lot.

33
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:40,652
- The heat is high, so be careful. - Okay.

34
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,611
(Why isn't it boiling when the heat is high?)

35
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:43,782
It makes no sense.

36
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:46,221
- It should boil. - With this much smoke,

37
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,552
it should be boiling.

38
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,622
I'll add half the saltwater.

39
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,162
- Will it be okay, Jung Ah? - Yes.

40
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,561
Since we've boiled it for a while...

41
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,078
- Maybe it needs more time. - The beans should be cooked by now.

42
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,672
(Even though they're a bit nervous, )

43
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,772
(they add saltwater to make the soybean water congeal.)

44
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,442
(However, no changes occur to the soybean water.)

45
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,251
This didn't happen when I made it at home.

46
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,481
Curds floated up right away.

47
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:16,651
Does it usually congeal right away?

48
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,922
Yes. It totally turns into soft tofu.

49
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,421
Curds should form.

50
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:23,521
(Curds should form.)

51
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,892
(Adding more saltwater)

52
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,062
What do you think?

53
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:29,692
Right now...

54
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,132
(Will they fail to make tofu?)

55
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,505
What do you think?

56
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,065
Right now...

57
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,104
Is it because there's so much soybean water?

58
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,675
(Will they fail to make tofu?)

59
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:44,674
(Step 1: Denial)

60
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,115
This makes no sense.

61
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,185
This makes no sense. We added saltwater.

62
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:50,554
(Step 2: Anxiety)

63
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:52,054
This is bad.

64
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,384
The tofu will be ruined.

65
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,385
Why?

66
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,745
Maybe I should've squeezed out the soybean water more.

67
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,025
No.

68
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,865
(Step 3: Guilt)

69
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,385
Maybe I should put my hand in it.

70
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,111
- No. Are you insane? - Just once.

71
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,695
- I want to check how hot it is. - No.

72
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,764
- It isn't boiling. Did we fail? - We failed.

73
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:09,835
Yes, we failed.

74
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,405
Oh, no. We ruined the tofu. It isn't working.

75
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:15,144
I don't know what the problem is.

76
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:17,051
(Will they give up on the grand journey to make tofu?)

77
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:20,075
(The tofu siblings can't leave the soybean water.)

78
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,515
(Staring)

79
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,784
(She tastes it again.)

80
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,155
(Shaking her head)

81
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,154
It's just soybean water.

82
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:31,395
(It's just warm soybean water.)

83
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:35,794
Maybe the quantity was the problem. There was a lot.

84
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,711
(It isn't easy to cook a large quantity of food.)

85
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:40,295
Why isn't it working? It's so strange.

86
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,904
It's because we made too much. We should've used 1kg only.

87
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,305
(Reason: Too much quantity)

88
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:48,175
(If the quantity is the problem)

89
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:51,675
I should make more saltwater.

90
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,344
(Combat quantity with quantity.)

91
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,885
(1.5l of saltwater)

92
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,625
(If you don't become tofu, )

93
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:05,195
(I'll pour in saltwater.)

94
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,094
- It won't be too salty, right? - I think it'll be salty.

95
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,595
(Saltwater is made with salt.)

96
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,265
I think it'll be too salty to eat.

97
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,635
For now,

98
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,404
let's focus on the shape.

99
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:15,934
(She's determined to complete making this tofu.)

100
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:18,734
- I think it became heavier. - Yes. I think it's working.

101
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,104
(Is there hope for tofu?)

102
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,665
(She brings another 1.5l of saltwater.)

103
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,775
(My goodness)

104
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,645
(Pouring)

105
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,444
It's working.

106
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:29,445
(Congealing)

107
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,584
(The soybean water begins to congeal.)

108
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,615
Isn't it fascinating?

109
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,254
All right.

110
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:37,735
(She adds some more saltwater so that it definitely congeals.)

111
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,895
(It's turning into soft tofu.)

112
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,695
(Adding saltwater one last time)

113
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,905
(So much saltwater is added that it has to become tofu.)

114
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,004
(Shall I taste it?)

115
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,275
(Tasting)

116
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:58,475
When I made it at home... What?

117
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,375
- It's inedible. It's too salty. - Really? Is it too salty?

118
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,685
(It's the side effect of adding a lot of saltwater.)

119
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,455
(Sighing)

120
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,854
(The sad back of the head of the house)

121
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,085
This is driving me crazy.

122
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,224
I don't know what to do.

123
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,624
Shall we go ahead and pour it?

124
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,064
- All right. Let's try it. - Shall we pour it?

125
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,094
- Sure. - Okay.

126
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,095
I'll help.

127
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,735
(There's a bit of hope.)

128
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,465
We might get tofu this big.

129
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,775
It's a bit salty,

130
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,434
but it'll be tasty with rice.

131
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:29,204
That's right. Don't make a sauce for tofu.

132
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,245
(Don't make a sauce for tofu.)

133
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,845
(The tofu siblings are positive.)

134
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,754
(Soft tofu fills up the mold.)

135
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:47,625
I think there'll be a lot.

136
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,164
I think it'll work.

137
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,165
(Will you be able to become tofu?)

138
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,305
Don't you think it'll work?

139
00:05:56,635 --> 00:06:00,575
(She folds the cloth carefully...)

140
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,615
(and presses the top.)

141
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:09,215
Stay there for about 30 minutes.

142
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,415
(The soft tofu is in the tofu mold sauna.)

143
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,525
(The saltwater will seep out.)

144
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,825
(Meanwhile, this woman can't leave the seokbakji seasoning.)

145
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,835
(Dabbing)

146
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:29,765
(It isn't satisfactory to Seasoning Park.)

147
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,874
(She adds more green plum syrup...)

148
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,205
(and ground onions.)

149
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,545
(Dabbing)

150
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:41,245
Do you need help?

151
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:44,355
- You're still working on it. - Yes.

152
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,615
(Dabbing)

153
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,425
You taste it so many times.

154
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,994
Seriously. You taste it...

155
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,995
(She'll be full from tasting it.)

156
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,925
I'm the type to taste the food often.

157
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,095
Earlier,

158
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:59,934
I think I added too much garlic and ginger.

159
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:01,504
- Did you add too much? - I could've added less.

160
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,834
- That's right. - I added too much.

161
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,534
The taste of ginger was a bit strong.

162
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,034
(She speaks her mind.)

163
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:09,405
(Jun Myun's feelings are hurt.)

164
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,844
How dare you!

165
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:12,845
(Why did I say that?)

166
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,085
- You're a rookie chef. - My goodness.

167
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:19,855
How dare you make a comment about my kimchi?

168
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:27,494
(Will seokbakji come out well?)

169
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,764
Let's add...

170
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:29,994
- the glutinous rice paste. - Okay.

171
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,535
(They add the glutinous rice paste that has been cooled down!)

172
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,705
(Shall we mix the seokbakji ingredients now?)

173
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:40,274
(Scallion)

174
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,975
(Chili powder)

175
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:49,345
(Mix the ingredients well.)

176
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,285
Gosh, Seasoning Park.

177
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,325
You add the chili powder first.

178
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:59,154
That way, the seasoning sticks better.

179
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,255
I see.

180
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:05,195
(Pouring the seasoning)

181
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:08,804
(Gosh, it looks tasty.)

182
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,005
It looks tasty.

183
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,375
- Try one. - Okay.

184
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,844
A small piece. It might be too big.

185
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,444
- Why don't you cut it? - It's small.

186
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,845
Is it small? Is it okay?

187
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,815
(Crunchy)

188
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,014
(What's this taste?)

189
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,354
- It's tasty. - Is it good?

190
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,355
Yes.

191
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,054
- It'll be so tasty after a day. - It needs time to mature.

192
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,775
It's impossible to determine the taste now.

193
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,565
It needs to be seasoned.

194
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,565
(Satisfied)

195
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,634
- The radish is so sweet. - The radish is sweet...

196
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:46,875
because it's winter.

197
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,575
It's tasty, right?

198
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,374
You have the golden touch.

199
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,015
(You have the golden touch!)

200
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,944
Your kimchi is the best.

201
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,514
I have the know-how.

202
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,655
(The spicy and sweet seokbakji is the best!)

203
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,425
(They get three containers of seokbakji.)

204
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:11,565
(This seokbakji will be the members' precious side dish.)

205
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:15,535
(Team Tofu is at the end of the grand journey.)

206
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:20,535
(They're about to open the tofu mold.)

207
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,475
(Worried)

208
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,574
(It's time to check the result.)

209
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:29,115
(What will it be at the end of the grand tofu-making journey?)

210
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,315
I'm so curious.

211
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,085
(Nervous)

212
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:37,795
(When they remove the top, they see the cloth.)

213
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:41,325
(She lifts up the tofu carefully.)

214
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:47,835
Is it out?

215
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:52,275
(She sets it down.)

216
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,005
(How will it look?)

217
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,644
(Laughing)

218
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,015
It worked.

219
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,045
Is it out?

220
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,555
(Did it work?)

221
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:08,225
(Hurry over here!)

222
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,925
(Hello. It's me, tofu.)

(Yum Jung Ah's tofu story)

224

(Yum Jung Ah's sad tofu story)

225
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,835
It's thicker than I imagined.

226
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,234
(Thick)

227
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,704
(Milky white)

228
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:27,845
It's salty, but...

229
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:29,705
It came out well.

230
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,775
- Here. - Jung Ah.

231
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,215
- Nice. - My goodness.

232
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,015
It broke a bit.

233
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,715
(The end piece escapes.)

234
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,355
(It's warm and bouncy.)

235
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:48,924
We made it in the end.

236
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:49,965
(Laughing)

237
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:53,565
(They came a long way for this happy ending.)

238
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:57,165
(Jung Ah's handmade tofu is complete.)

239
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,145
(The success reminds her of someone.)

240
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,145
Jun Myun, come and taste it.

241
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:11,154
(The taster appears.)

242
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,754
Jung Ah, it came out so well.

243
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,755
We should taste a piece each.

244
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,525
(How does it taste?)

245
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:23,795
It's tasty.

246
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:24,965
It's tasty.

247
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,435
(The taste gets a pass.)

248
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:31,435
(They hum in unison.)

Try it.

252
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:43,285
Try this.

253
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:44,655
It's tasty.

254
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:47,414
It's good, right? It's tasty.

255
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,585
(Tofu commercial)

256
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,394
- It's tasty. - It's tasty, right?

257
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,694
Freshly made tofu is the best.

258
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:55,425
- Seriously. - It's so tasty.

259
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,735
(Jae Wook missed the tasting because he was working.)

260
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,605
(Food gets shoved into his mouth.)

261
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,035
- What? - It's tasty, right?

262
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,104
Isn't it so good? Right?

263
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:06,305
It's so tasty.

264
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,275
It's a bit salty.

265
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,714
(Laughing)

266
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:12,844

(He knows the secret of the saltwater.)

268
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:15,315
But it's okay.

269
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,514
I was going to make a sauce,

270
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,355
but that won't be necessary.

271
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:21,484
It's salty.

272
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:22,625
(Was it a grand scheme?)

273
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:27,024
(It's nice to eat it as it is.)

274
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,664
The tofu is so tasty.

275
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,295
(The saltiness is perfect for Ji Yeon.)

276
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:33,595
(She prepares a plate of tofu.)

277
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,435
Will we be able to eat everything?

278
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,104
- It's so tasty. - Is it that tasty?

279
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,175
- Yes. - All right.

280

A small one.

(She stimulates her appetite with tofu.)

287
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,495
I'm beginning to get hungry. This is bad.

288
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,064
I feel a bit dizzy.

289
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,505
- She says she's hungry. - Really?

290
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:11,234

Flounders are in season.

297
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,824
Many flounders are caught in Sokcho in wintertime.

298
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,994
It's seasonal food.

299
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,515
(Flounders have hard flesh since they grow up in the cold sea.)

300
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,334
I add a bit of sugar and chili powder...

301
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,435
to soy sauce to make the seasoning.

302
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,044
(She pours it over the flounders and braise them with green onion.)

303
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,975
I top them with chopped green onions and braise them.

304
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:55,614
Flounders don't have a fishy taste. The taste is clean.

(A neighbor's menu, braised flounder)

306

We grow thistle.

308
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,055

Using salt and flour,

327
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,874
- rub the squids clean. - Okay.

328
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,745
Peel a few onions.

329
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,014
- This one and an onion. - Squids.

330
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:04,854

00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,215
- How nice. - We caught it in the morning.

342
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,384
It's big.

343
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,454
(She begins to prepare the codfish.)

344
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:45,525
There's a bone.

346
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,795
- Is it tough? - It's a bit big.

347
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,195
I'm sorry.

348
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,064
- Shall I do it? - No, I can do it.

349
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,335
(No, I can do it.)

350
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,034

351
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:02,204
- Really? - You can do other things.

352
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:03,744
- Slice this and that. - Okay.

353
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,715
You know how to cut it, right?

354
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,685

355
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,785

356

357
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:17,825
(Soy sauce, minced garlic)

358
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:23,065
(She adds a lot of spicy gochujang.)

359
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,534
I'll add allulose syrup.

360
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,795
(She sweetens the seasoning with allulose syrup.)

361
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,565
(Tasting)

00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,405
(Adding sweetness)

363
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,175
(Crab powder, pepper)

364
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,915
(Tasting again)

365
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:45,355
This is the seasoning for the squid dish.

366
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,084
Next,

367
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,784
I'll make the seasoning for the spicy fish stew.

368
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:51,105
(She makes the seasoning for the spicy codfish stew next.)

369
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,755
(Humming)

370
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,765
(Humming)

371
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:00,695
(Jumping straight into the spicy seafood stew base)

372
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,265
(A big spoonful of doenjang)

373
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,304
(Adding 1 spoonful of minced garlic)

374
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:07,674
(Adding 2 spoonfuls of minced garlic)

375
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,244
(Adding 3 spoonfuls of minced garlic)

376
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,805
(Adding 4 spoonfuls of minced garlic)

377
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:14,175
(This is truly the garlic-loving nation.)

378
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,805
I might need to add a little bit of Korean style soy sauce.

379
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,414
(There is no such thing as "a little...")

380
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,825
(for an open hand in the kitchen.)

381
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,495
(The highlight of the spicy codfish stew seasoning)

382
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,624
(Dried pollack powder for the rich flavor of spicy codfish stew)

383
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,865
(Adding generously)

384
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,404
Okay, the seasoning sauce is done now.

385
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,405
This is for the spicy codfish stew.

386
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,006
(Spicy codfish stew seasoning is ready.)

387
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:42,245
Do I need to cut these squid tentacles?

388
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,404
- Should I cut this? - Like this.

389
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,575
- In the middle? - Yes.

390
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,985
There's quite a bit of squid.

391
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:50,844
I think it's about ten of them.

392
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,855
- Really? That is a lot. - Yes.

393
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,485
(Cutting the squid into bite-sized pieces)

394
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:03,795
(Refilling)

395
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,895
The squid seems endless.

396
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,135
Making a meal for yourself is really...

397
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,535
- not easy, right? - Right.

398
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:17,305
(After all the squid preparation)

399
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,345
(What about the prepared squid?)

400
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,914
The squid needs to be marinated in cheongju.

401
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:28,425
(Marinating in cheongju to remove any unwanted odor)

402
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:32,025
(Shall we prepare the vegetables in the meantime?)

403
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,525
(Straight)

404
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,965
(Sticking out the tongue)

405
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:45,075
(Ji Yeon is cutting with perfect precision.)

406
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:46,874
Okay, this is perfect.

407
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,974
(Adding)

408
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,275
(Adding more)

409
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:52,205
How much Cheongyang pepper do you need?

410
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,015
Both dishes need Cheongyang peppers.

411
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:56,914
- We need to wash all of that. - Okay.

412
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,035
(All the Cheongyang peppers)

413
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,655
It smells spicy.

414
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,154
(Vegetables being neatly prepared at the request of the open hand)

415
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:04,085
Cutting Cheongyang peppers makes it really...

416
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:11,265
(The generous amount of ingredients for Generous Jung Ah)

417
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:13,734
- Is everything ready? - Yes.

418
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,735
(What's next?)

419
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,605
- I'm going to make radish salad. - Yes.

420
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,834
As a side dish.

421
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,311
(Today's side dish is spicy radish salad.)

422
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,774
Using a slicer makes the radish too crushed.

423
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,304
- Can you do this? - I will do it.

424
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:25,374
- Hold on. I'll finish this up. - Okay.

425
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,715
(Cutting the radish into thin strips for the salad)

426
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,645
(In the process)

427
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,515
(Looking intently)

428
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:34,854
You trust me, right?

429
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,925
Of course, I trust you. I was just watching.

430
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,725
- Just in case. - You are better at it than I am.

431
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,835
(Diligently cutting)

432
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,605
- You are good at it. - Yes, she is.

433
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:53,435
Good job.

434
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:57,375
(Speeding up with the praise)

435
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:00,215
- Great. Let's cut all this. - Did you see it?

436
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,295
- Are you bragging to me right now? - Yes.

437
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,215
I'm pretty good at it.

438
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:08,625
You are good with a knife.

439
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:10,225
Not bad, right?

440
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,755
Not bad at all. You are good at it.

441
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:13,925
It's not easy to slice like this.

442
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:16,195
Failed.

443
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,665
Seriously, right after the compliment...

444
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,705
- This is... - Nothing got cut at all.

445
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,075
(Dangling)

446
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,735
(Put it down!)

447
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,444
Go away.

448
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:31,445
(Error occurrence)

449
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,574
(Going through it again)

450
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,515
(Complete)

451
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:38,855
(The return of Seasoning Park)

452
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:42,555
(Chili powder, sesame oil, refined sugar, sesame)

453
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,195
(Gently sprinkling coarse salt)

454
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,824
(Shaking)

455
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,825
Coat it with the seasoning like this.

456
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,365
Try it.

457
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,265
(How's the taste of the quick-made radish salad?)

458
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,105
(So delicious)

459
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,404
As a side dish with rice.

460
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:01,405
(This is Seasoning Park.)

461
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,775
Can you taste it, please?

462
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,274
Just as a side dish with rice, with a clean taste.

463
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,451
(Leader Yum also takes a bite of the radish salad.)

464
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,755
- It is so good. - So delicious.

465
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,855
(Spicy radish salad is ready.)

466
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,215
First, let's boil some water.

467
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,955
(Boiling water in progress)

468
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,294
(There are two dishes...)

469
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:21,765
(but only one stove.)

470
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:25,535
(Okay, then...)

471
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,565
(Making the stove on her own)

472
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:34,735
(Gently placing by the stove that Jae Wook made)

473
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:36,805
(Glancing)

474
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:42,415
(Referring to the stove made by Jae Wook)

475
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:46,355
- Are you making another one? - Yes.

476
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,685
(Placing the stove on)

477
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,695
(Opening the window)

478
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:55,425
I'll give it a try, too.

479
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,365
(Igniting)

480
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:03,565
(Letting the fire start)

481
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:06,705
I think it's done. It worked.

482
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,105
I think the fire's on, Jae Wook.

483
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,645
Yes, it's on.

484
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,085
(Success in lighting the fire)

485
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,255
It's no big deal.

486
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,424
Ji Yeon, is the fire ready?

487
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,825
- Yes. - Okay, then...

488
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:25,955
Right.

489
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,455
Shall I boil some water?

490
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:29,165
Yes.

491
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:31,795
You can pour the water.

492
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:33,765
- Pour the water, and... - Yes.

493
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,065
- put all the radish in. - Okay.

494
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:39,534
Add a few pieces of kelp. There is some kelp here.

495
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:40,535
Okay.

496
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:46,074
(Adding the radish, and adding the kelp)

497
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,075
I'll do it.

498
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:50,645
How many pieces of kelp should I add?

499
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:56,154
How much kelp should I add?

500
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:59,055
- Let me do it. - What? Add a few.

501
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:03,764
How much should I add?

502
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,865
(Stopping operation)

503
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:07,865
Ten pieces.

504
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,435
Three, four...

505
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,945
(Adding the radish, and adding 10 pieces of kelp)

506
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:18,345
(Ji Yeon, after completing the task)

507
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:23,045
(Holding the seasoning sauce and moving around)

508
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:26,755
That's not it. Put that down.

509
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,085
We are not doing it right now. Put it down.

510
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,955
(When should I add the vegetables?)

511
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:36,625
No, put it down.

512
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,035
No...

513
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:44,705
We haven't even added the fish yet. You keep picking up the vegetables.

514
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,275
I'm dying of laughter because of Ji Yeon.

515
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,745
(Jung Ah checks the pot.)

516
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,075
How long is this going to take to boil?

517
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:55,885
There's no way.

518
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,085
(Silent)

519
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:02,155
You need to turn up the heat.

520
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:03,385
The heat...

521
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,594
Turn up the heat.

522
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,095
(Starting the task with a chant)

523
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,594
(Impatient Leader Yum quickly adds the firewood she sees.)

524
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:09,624
Is there anything I can use?

525
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,765
Like what? That box?

526
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,535
- Let me do it. - Okay.

527
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,865
(Confidently sitting in front of the fire)

528
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,774
(But...)

529
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,404
(a sharp gaze...)

530
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:23,405
(is piercing from behind.)

531
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,645
(Focusing intensely)

532
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:31,485
(There's no such thing as an error in my dictionary.)

533
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:33,255
Okay, this is good.

534
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:36,755
(Turning up the heat)

535
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,055
Did you set the fire?

536
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,125
(Happy)

537
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:41,595
You started the fire well.

538
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:43,705
- I started it well, right? - Right.

539
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,794
(So proud)

540
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:47,894
- The fire... Ji Yeon. - Yes.

541
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:50,604
You need to light the fire on the other side, too.

542
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,235
- That one over there. - This one here?

543
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,834
- You mean this one, right? - Yes.

544
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:56,004
The one on the next.

545
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,905
(Work in progress)

546
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:02,015
(Now smoothly moving the firewood)

547
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,905
(Opening the vent window wide for some fresh air)

548
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:08,084
(Flame)

549
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,255
(Charisma)

550
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,455
(Glancing)

551
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:19,595
(Now, two stoves are easy.)

552
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,594
- The water is boiling. - Okay.

553
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,265
(In the blazing firewood)

554
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:24,435
(Happy)

555
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:26,404
(Leader Yum's passion for cooking is also on fire.)

556
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,775
(Throwing the codfish into the blazing hot broth)

557
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,385
(Two large pieces of codfish splashing in)

558
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,185
(With the intense heat, the fresh codfish boils vigorously.)

559
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:46,925
(Resulting in a rich broth, as thick and cloudy as a meat soup)

560
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,594
Let's add the seasoning sauce.

561
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,395
(Adding generously)

562
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:57,465
(Sweeping all the seasoning sauce from the bowl)

563
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:04,205
(As the rich broth absorbs a spicy, deep flavor...)

564
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:08,015
(Leader Yum summons a mountain of vegetables.)

565
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,415
(Assist awaiting)

566
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,784
(Throwing in a bunch of crispy, refreshing bean sprouts)

567
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,125
Let's put it in like this.

568
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:17,385
(Let it become delicious.)

569
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,895
(Throwing in a generous amount of fragrant water parsley)

570
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:23,064
(There's still this much left.)

571
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,124
(The more, the better)

572
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:27,835
(The more fragrant)

573
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:31,835
(Generously adding enoki mushrooms as well)

574
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,474
That is a lot.

575
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,375
(From Jung Ah, to Jung Ah)

576
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:39,775
(An open hand's specialty is all about solid ingredients.)

577
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,955
(Adding the finishing touch with green onion and Cheongyang pepper)

578
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:52,795
(The spicy codfish stew’s flavor deepens.)

579
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:58,065
This is going to be spicy.

580
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,064
A lot of Cheongyang pepper.

581
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,634
(She's imagining herself eating the food.)

582
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:05,204
(Meanwhile, )

583
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:08,904
(they can hear a scary sound from somewhere.)

584
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,974
(The person making this sound...)

585
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,474
(is the youngest?)

586
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:16,285
(Jae Wook is focused on...)

587
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,055
(sharpening a knife.)

588
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,255
(Sharpening a knife)

589
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:25,355
(What is our youngest doing?)

590
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:28,085
Knives have to be sharp to slice sashimi.

591
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:31,655
(Is our youngest slicing sashimi?)

592
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:35,294
(Do you know how to slice sashimi?)

593
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:36,964
(I can learn.)

594
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:39,135
(I want them to like me.)

595
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:42,875
(To be able to slice sashimi himself for the three sisters, )

596
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:45,944
(Jae Wook went to learn how to do it.)

597
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,704
(Serious)

598
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:51,115
(The youngest put in a lot of effort.)

599
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,145
(Chef Lee is deboning the halibut and rockfish.)

600
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:58,854
(First, he removes the scales.)

601
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,584
(Scraping)

602
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:04,794
(He checks on his progress.)

603
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:07,225
(He's not done, yet.)

604
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,635
(Focused)

605
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:16,675
(The youngest trained for this moment.)

606
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:18,775
(Taking a peek)

607
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:21,075
Gosh, look at him.

608
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:24,244
He went and learned how to do that.

609
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,585
That's great.

610
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,644
(Proud)

611
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:29,684
(Seeing a new side of the youngest)

612
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:31,554
Ji Yeon, can you hold this for me?

613
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:33,655
- You have to remove all that? - Yes.

614
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,824
- Okay. - Thank you.

615
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:39,195
(Thanks to Ji Yeon, Jae Wook is able to work faster.)

616
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,164
Does the fish smell if you don't remove that?

617
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:44,794
Yes, it will taste very fishy.

618
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:46,211
(The blood will make the fish taste very fishy.)

619
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:48,134
(Jae Wook's tip for cleaning fish)

620
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:49,804
(Remove the guts and rinse the fish thoroughly...)

621
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:51,651
(in cold, clean water to prevent a strong fish taste.)

622
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,274
(After cleaning the halibut with all his might, )

623
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,715
(he goes over to the kitchen.)

624
00:28:57,675 --> 00:29:00,585
(He pats the fish dry.)

625
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:08,025
(And he grabs the knife.)

626
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,795
(Now, he's all set to go.)

627
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:14,745
- Are you slicing the sashimi? - Yes.

628
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:19,605
(His eyes are as sharp as the knife.)

629
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:23,435
(First, make an incision along the edge.)

630
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:28,105
(Careful)

631
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:32,285
(Delicately separating the flesh)

632
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,325
(Laser focus)

633
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,165
That's so cool.

634
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,804
(While slicing off the flesh, the knife will touch the spine.)

635
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:58,034
(Crack)

636
00:29:58,035 --> 00:29:59,975
(Sashimi slicing ASMR)

637
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,475
(Do you hear him delicately deboning the halibut?)

638
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:06,914
(After some ASMR, )

639
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:09,855
(the top layer of flesh is removed.)

640
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,885
(Clean)

641
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:15,895
(The rockfish is easy.)

642
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,325
(All it takes is a few slices.)

643
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:23,034
(The rockfish is cut open too.)

644
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:25,535
(Jae Wook checks for small bones.)

645
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:28,935
(Chef Lee's sashimi slicing is going smoothly.)

646
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,705
(He neatly deboned and cut the fish into blocks of flesh.)

647
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,145
(The next step is removing the skin.)

648
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:41,484
(He removes it with a single slice.)

649
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,955
(Jae Wook's job satisfaction is very high.)

650
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:49,155
(While he was slicing the sashimi, )

651
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:52,265
(it has now become evening at the Stone Wall Village.)

652
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:56,465
(Ji Yeon puts in the firewood, )

653
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:59,434
(and Jung Ah pours the oil.)

654
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:02,805
(Pouring in oil)

655
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,905
(How much oil is she pouring?)

656
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:10,874
(What is Generous Jung Ah trying to do?)

657
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,515
(Pouring in chili powder)

658
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:19,155
Are you making chili oil?

659
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:20,585
Yes.

660
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,054
(There's so much that it's burning her eyes.)

661
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:24,195
Gosh, that's spicy.

662
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,665
(Chili oil is the secret to a spicy flavor with depth.)

663
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:29,995
That's...

664
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,535
(But!)

665
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,805
(Warning: Chili oil burns easily.)

666
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,105
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

667
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:37,904
(Ji Yeon is right behind her.)

668
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:38,945
Can you...

669
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,144
bring me the vegetables?

670
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,775
(Input: Vegetables)

671
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,374
(Output: Vegetables)

672
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,085
Throw them all in.

673
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:47,644
Throw them in.

674
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:50,085
(Output: Throw them all in!)

675
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:55,085
(Stir-frying the vegetables)

676
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,155
The seasoning.

677
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:58,255
The seasoning!

678
00:31:58,795 --> 00:31:59,894
- Pour it in? - Yes, pour it all in.

679
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:00,895
(Input: Pour it all in!)

680
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:04,165
(Output: Pour it all in.)

681
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:10,434
(Once the vegetables are stir-fried in the smoky-flavored chili oil, )

682
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:13,305
(the magister armhook squids are added into the pan.)

683
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:26,085
(The squids absorb the spicy seasoning.)

684
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:30,895
(The smoky, spicy flavor is amazing.)

685
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,565
(Jun Myun, now!)

686
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:41,364
(She finishes off with sesame oil to add a nutty flavor.)

687
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,505
The color looks divine.

688
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:45,574
It's done.

689
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,575
(It's stir-fried over high heat to keep the texture soft.)
Gosh, my back.

690
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:49,175
Now...

691
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:52,244
(The spicy squid stimulates your appetite.)

692
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,645
Let's put it on a plate.

693
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,354
(Scrumptious)

694
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:57,555
I want to plate it nicely.

695
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:00,825
How did you make the fire this strong?

696
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,655
I've become the master of fire.

697
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:04,894
Tha'ts impressive.

698
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,601
(While the three sisters are talking happily, )

699
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,335
(Chef Lee is by his lonesome.)

700
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:15,405
(He finally slices the first piece of sashimi.)

701
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:22,545
(Come and watch the youngest's sashimi slicing skills!)

702
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:25,784
(He moves the knife without hesitation.)

703
00:33:25,785 --> 00:33:27,615
(The knife is held at a precise angle.)

704
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,755
(There is no unnecessary movement.)

705
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:34,385
(The sashimi pieces look very neat.)

706
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:38,755
(He is putting a lot of effort into each of the pieces for his sisters.)

707
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,124
(Jung Ah spots Jae Wook's work.)

708
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,011
Hey, that looks like it was done by a professional.

709
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:45,164
- Pardon? - That looks really professional.

710
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,334
(Chef Lee's sashimi restaurant is open.)

711
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:48,865
What do we eat it with? Wasabi?

712
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,474
Chojang, soy sauce, and wasabi.

713
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:52,475
(The trio of sauces)

714
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:55,575
(Once the sauces that will elevate...)

715
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:59,515
(the youngest's sashimi is ready, )

716
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:02,715
(Jae Wook's halibut and rockfish sashimi is complete.)

717
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:07,185
(As Ji Yeon, the master of fire, heats up the room, )

718
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:11,455
(Jun Myun sets the table for their first Fresh off the Sea meal.)

719
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,225
(Leader Yum...)

720
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:16,895
(affectionately fills their bowls.)

721
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:18,664
Goodness.

722
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:19,764
(The bowl is filled to the rim.)

723
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:22,905
(Something's missing.)

724
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:24,804
Jung Ah, we don't have tofu.

725
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:25,845
Tofu?

726
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,604
(Right, my tofu!)

727
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:31,845
(The precious tofu that Jung Ah made during the day)

728
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:37,284
Did you finish cooking while I was doing this?

729
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,485
Yes, it's all done.

730
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,625
(Gosh)

731
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:42,125
We have so much food.

732
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:45,395
- I'm hungry. - I bet.

733
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:49,395
(He's adorable.)

734
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:53,535
(The four siblings finally sit down for their first dinner.)

735
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:56,574
This looks so good.

736
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:58,634
- This is amazing. - This looks really good.

737
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,104
(They sit at the table with excitement.)

738
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:02,244
Me.

739
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,514
(Taking pictures of the food is a must.)

740
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:07,285
(The two younger siblings are excited about their first dinner.)

741
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:09,355
(Photographer Park is proud of them.)

742
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,455
Gosh, look at this sashimi.

743
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,755
(Jae Wook's fresh sashimi)

744
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,565
(The spicy stir-fried squid)

745
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,905
(Generous Jung Ah's refreshing spicy codfish stew)

746
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:29,335
(Seasoning Park's spicy radish salad that Ji Yeon helped make)

747
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,945
(The handmade tofu that was made despite challenges)

748
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:40,344
(Their first meal with seasonal ingredients from Gangwon Province)

749
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:43,154
- Enjoy the food. - Enjoy the food.

750
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:45,314
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

751
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,585
To our first meal.

752
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:49,155
Gosh, I didn't think it would be this exhausting.

753
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,195
(Drained)

754
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,465
We finally get to eat.

755
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:57,435
What should we eat first?

756
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:59,405
Let's try Jae Wook's sashimi first.

757
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,234
These are rockfish, these are halibut fin,

758
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:03,604
and these are all halibut.

759
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:05,504
(Halibut, rockfish, halibut fin)

760
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:08,005
Jae Woo's sashimi.

761
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:09,945
Gosh, this is nice.

762
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:11,375
You like it?

763
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:12,745
It's good.

764
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:14,345
(Yum)

765
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:15,815
It's so fresh.

766
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:18,054
- Hey. - It's really fresh.

767
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,225
(Jae Wook!)

768
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:21,054
This is so good.

769
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,455
(It's even fresher because they caught the fish themselves.)

770
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,665
(Jun Myun prefers her sashimi with chojang.)

771
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,535
The sashimi is honestly so good.

772
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:31,235
It's so chewy.

773
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:35,704
The thickness of the pieces is perfect.

774
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,681
(The freshness of the seasonal fish met Jae Wook's efforts.)

775
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:40,574
- Eating sashimi like this... - It's great.

776
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,004
- is extraordinary. - It's extraordinary.

777
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,815
- It's impossible back home. - It's so good.

778
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,474
You did such a great job.

779
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,061
(Everyone is happy, thanks to Chef Lee.)

780
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:48,444
I made this.

781
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,454
(The hot, spicy codfish stew goes perfectly with sashimi.)

782
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:50,614
I'll move this to the middle.

783
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:51,885
Jung Ah, I love this.

784
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,454
(Jung Ah is already busy eating the water parsley.)

785
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:56,954
(This is how Jung Ah eats spicy fish stew.)

786
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:58,925
(Crunchy)

787
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:03,894
(Jung Ah is in love with the aromatic water parsley.)

788
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:05,294
The stew turned out great.

789
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:06,764
- It's so good. - It's so good.

790
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,485
(I'm glad I put in a lot of water parsley.)

791
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,435
Yes, it's so good.

792
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,105
(He takes a sip of the refreshing soup first.)

793
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,515
(How's the spicy codfish stew?)

794
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,185
It's really good.

795
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,255
(He can't help but keep reaching for it.)

796
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:30,654
(The youngest's reaction makes Ji Yeon want to try it.)

797
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,795
- It's that good? - It's really good.

798
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:35,024
(She takes a bite of the juicy codfish first.)

799
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,294
We have rice.

800
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,741
(She takes a bite of the juicy codfish first.)

801
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:40,864
(She then takes a bite of the radish that absorbed the soup.)

802
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,075
(Goodness)

803
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,075
(Exclaiming)

804
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:48,474
It's so refreshing.

805
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,575
(The two younger siblings both gasp in amazement.)

806
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:55,014
(This spicy fish stew)

807
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:57,754
(It's undoubtedly...)

808
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,655
- Gosh, this is so good. - You like it?

809
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,084
It's so good.

810
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:04,524
(Seeing the two younger siblings enjoy it makes Jung Ah feel proud.)

811
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,664
- It's very good. - It's good.

812
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:08,624
(Jae Wook takes a bite of Jun Myun's spicy radish salad.)

813
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,265
(Crunchy)

814
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:12,925
It's even tastier now that the radish softened up a little.

815
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:14,065
Right?

816
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,951
(The radish absorbed the seasoning even more after softening.)

817
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:18,075
I'm the one who cut the radish.

818
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:19,544
You did?

819
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:21,304
(Yum)

820
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,404
You did great.

821
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:23,545
(You did great.)

822
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,414
(The way she said that is so funny.)

823
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:30,854
(Embarrassed)

824
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,924
(The Thinking type failed to empathize.)

825
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:34,055
You did a good job.

826
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:37,525
Right, you did great.

827
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:40,795
Jung Ah, you...

828
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:43,564
(Throwing a glance)

829
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,195
(Ji Yeon looks at Jae Wook's bowl.)

830
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:49,204
(Throwing a glance)

831
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:51,834
- The squid is really soft. - It's really good.

832
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:54,904
Do you mind sharing your bean sprouts?

833
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:57,945
(She takes the youngest's bean sprouts.)

834
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,045
You...

835
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:04,015
- I didn't even give you permission. - About what?

836
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,131
She asked if I could share my bean sprouts with her.

837
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:09,425
(The younger siblings argue even at the dinner table.)

838
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:12,154
(Other people's bean sprouts taste much better.)

839
00:39:12,155 --> 00:39:13,465
I'm so happy.

840
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,564
Everything turned out great.

841
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,365
- It's all so good. - It is.

842
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:21,235
Most of all,

843
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:24,174
- everything is fresh. - Right.

844
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,605
- We got everything today. - The fish was freshly caught.

845
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,714
Cooking a meal with the fish we caught...

846
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,044
- feels very weird. - Right?

847
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:32,175
Of course.

848
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,514
- It's so good. - I know.

849
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:37,185
(The younger siblings are overjoyed about their first catch.)

850
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:39,824
(They're now in love with meals made with seasonal ingredients.)

851
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,355
I feel so happy.

852
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,395
Do you mind sharing your soy sauce?

853
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:46,624
Not at all.

854
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:50,195
(Jae Wook dips a piece of tofu in Ji Yeon's soy sauce.)

855
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,404
(He pushes the plate of food toward the older sisters for them.)

856
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:54,535
Thank you.

857
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:58,105
(Let me take a bite of the tofu I made.)

858
00:39:58,175 --> 00:39:59,805
The tofu is so cold now.

859
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,045
- Gosh. Still, Jung Ah. - Yes?

860
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,715
(You like it?)

861
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:07,384
It's good.

862
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,385
(Jung Ah's three siblings love her handmade tofu.)

863
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:13,755
It's a bit salty for my taste.

864
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:16,525
I think it tastes a little saltier since it cooled down.

865
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:19,965
(Let's try the stir-fried squid too.)

866
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,965
What do you think?

867
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:24,295
- Gosh, it's good. - You like it?

868
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:27,335
You like it?

869
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:30,535
The squid is really good.

870
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:32,734
The squid itself is good.

871
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:35,645
The squid here is especially soft.

872
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:37,244
It's really soft.

873
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:38,614
It's so good.

874
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:39,615
(The squid has a soft texture.)

875
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:42,584
(One piece of squid)

876
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:44,815
(One piece of vegetable)

877
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,254
(The soft squid and the crunchy vegetable...)

878
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:49,215
(are perfectly paired as she eats them together.)

879
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:54,264
(Jun Myun is slurping up squid legs the way she would eat noodles.)

880
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,324
(Covering her mouth)

881
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:57,194
(The rich umami flavor fills her mouth.)

882
00:40:57,195 --> 00:40:58,695
(Covering his mouth)

883
00:40:58,765 --> 00:41:00,204
- It has a smoky flavor. - What?

884
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:01,565
The flavor is slightly smoky.

885
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:03,675
Of course, the flavor is smoky.

886
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,435
(Laughing)

887
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,505
(My fire added the smokiness. It's a success.)

888
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:15,045
(The combination of East Sea squid and Jung Ah's seasoning...)

889
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:19,455
(makes them eat nonstop.)

890
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,725
(Yes, this tastes perfect.)

891
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,494
(Gosh)

892
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:27,665
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

893
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,634
Yes?

894
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:30,935
How do you do it?

895
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:32,371
You could sell this at a restaurant.

896
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:34,064
(The way the youngest sibling...)

897
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:35,835
(enjoys the stir-fried squid)

898
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:37,774
(Step 1)

899
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,545
(Take it easy and eat a squid leg.)

900
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:45,044
(This isn't working! I need a different utensil!)

901
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,074
(Step 2)

902
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:47,814
(Have a spoonful of rice with the squid.)

903
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:50,615
(Taking a huge bite)

904
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,554
(Step 3: Speak inaudibly.)

905
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:54,355
(Translation: That's what I'm talking about.)

906
00:41:54,385 --> 00:41:57,155
(Step 4: He hears bells.)

907
00:41:58,455 --> 00:41:59,594
It tastes good.

908
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:00,894
(Jae Wook is in a daze because of the stir-fried squid.)

909
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,364
How many dishes did you make today?

910
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:03,564
(I have a good idea!)

911
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,064
Do you want fried rice? I'll go make some.

912
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:08,234
You can make it over there.

913
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,835
(What an unnecessary question. Proceed.)

914
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:11,334
Jae Wook says he'll make it.

915
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:13,375
(We have to make fried rice with this seasoning.)

916
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:17,215
(He gathers the remaining seasoning.)

917
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,074
Gosh, this is going to be great.

918
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:20,435
(Gosh, this is going to be great.)

919
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:22,954
- We have instant rice. - Yes.

920
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:23,984
(He puts two bowls of unheated instant rice into the pan.)

921
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:27,124
(It's not enough, so he adds 2 more servings of rice.)

922
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,355
(Eventually, he's making fried rice to feed 4 people.)

923
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,065
(Foodie Ji Yeon: I'm going to eat everything!)

924
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:36,495
(Jae Wook is so skilled at using a spoon.)

925
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,365
(Dried laver flakes are added for a nutty and savory flavor.)

926
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,575
(Now, it's time to stir and toss the rice.)

927
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:49,675
(Sprinkling sesame seeds)

928
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:52,615
That looks really good.

929
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,425
It's time for our second round of dinner.

930
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:57,385
Gosh, that looks divine.

931
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,455
There's no way that could taste bad.

932
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:01,654
Careful, it's hot.

933
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:02,895
(Ji Yeon takes the first bite.)

934
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,425
It's all done.

935
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,324
She just wants to start eating right now.

936
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:09,164
That doesn't mean I'm willing to eat under-cooked food.

937
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:11,446
(That doesn't mean I'm willing to eat under-cooked food.)

938
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,805
- The rice is done. I'm serious. - Jae Wook.

939
00:43:14,565 --> 00:43:15,904
(The fried rice nicely coated in seasoning and oil is complete.)

940
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,035
Gosh, that looks divine.

941
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:19,174
There's no way that could taste bad.

942
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:21,675
(It's time for their 2nd round of dinner.)

943
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,775
(Scrumptious)

944
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:27,985
(Jae Wook takes a bite of the fried rice.)

945
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:29,954
Gosh.

946
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,414
(It's unbelievable how tasty the fried rice is.)

947
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:33,125
It's so good.

948
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:38,925
(No matter how full you are, there's always room for fried rice!)

949
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:43,565
(What a perfect ending to their dinner.)

950
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:47,565
(The four siblings are finally able to take a breather.)

951
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:50,274
I'm too full.

952
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:51,781
We almost finished everything, though.

953
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:55,145
(Ji Yeon is still eating.)

954
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:58,815
(What do you mean by "full?")

955
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,445
(After moving her hands and mouth nonstop, )

956
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:05,055
(the skin around her mouth turned red from the seasoning.)

957
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:06,785
(Glancing at Ji Yeon)

958
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:08,955
Wipe your mouth.

959
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:13,125
(Embarrassed)

960
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:15,265
(She's adorable.)

961
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:18,695
(Still, our Ji Yeon...)

962
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:23,305
(is a foodie who doesn't give up.)

963
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:26,774
(Where is she going?)

964
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:29,344
(With a very serious look on her face, )

965
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:32,644
(she's refilling her bowl with spicy fish stew...)

966
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:35,185
(until it overflows.)

967
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:37,614
Gosh, Ji Yeon. Did you refill your bowl?

968
00:44:37,615 --> 00:44:38,854
I wanted some more bean sprouts and water parsley.

969
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:40,124
- Okay. - They're so refreshing.

970
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,824
- Good idea. - Is there any water parsley left?

971
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:42,885
(In awe)

972
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,824
(Ji Yeon begins eating again, starting with spicy fish stew.)

973
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:50,895
(Those are not noodles.)

974
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,364
(This is so good.)

975
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:57,535
(Eat Again Ji Yeon is having a 3rd round of dinner by herself.)

976
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:00,705
(The rest of the siblings are helping her reach the foods.)

977
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:03,515
(Amazed)

978
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:05,845
Jae Wook, you haven't eaten much.

979
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:07,185
Are you full?

980
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,385
(Speechless)

981
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,386
- It's because the weather's cold. - Are you cold?

982
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:14,255
(I did eat a lot of food.)

983
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:15,724
(It's natural for Ji Yeon to eat a lot.)

984
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:16,955
It's so good.

985
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:18,924
(Now that they're done eating, they begin to wonder...)

986
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,965
Are you going to tell us what we're doing tomorrow?

987
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:23,495
You might have trouble digesting if we told you.

988
00:45:24,195 --> 00:45:25,565
Have trouble digesting?

989
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,335
- Why? - Maybe we're working early.

990
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:28,635
I'm scared.

991
00:45:29,565 --> 00:45:30,674
(Yum. What could be the reason?)

992
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:31,935
Tell us.

993
00:45:32,775 --> 00:45:35,345
We're bracing ourselves. Tell us, please.

994
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:40,015
Tomorrow, the place you're going to get fresh ingredients...

995
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:42,945
(The tension is making Ji Yeon put her chopsticks down.)

996
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:44,955
It's somewhere in Gangwon Province,

997
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:47,255
- where it's especially cold... - What?

998
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:50,025
And there's a lot of snow.

999
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:54,725
It's Daegwallyeong.

1000
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:55,825
What?

1001
00:45:56,935 --> 00:45:57,994
It feels cold already.

1002
00:45:57,995 --> 00:45:59,041
(Getting chill just hearing it)

1003
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:01,305
(Daegwallyeong in the middle of winter?)

1004
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:03,274
(No way.)

1005
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:06,475
It was freezing during filming "The Tale of Lady Ok" there.

1006
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:09,705
Oh, no. What do we do in Daegwallyeong?

1007
00:46:09,945 --> 00:46:12,674
The seasonal ingredient that you will find...

1008
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:14,515
in Daegwallyeong, Gangwon Province...

1009
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:18,385
is dried pollack.

1010
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:20,525
Dried pollack.

1011
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,925
(Dried pollack)

1012
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,524
We will be working...

1013
00:46:24,525 --> 00:46:28,794
at a pollack drying field...

1014
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:30,695
that measures about 26,446m².

1015
00:46:31,765 --> 00:46:33,465
(Overwhelming size)

1016
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:36,735
(Pollack drying field)

1017
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,375
Dried pollack?

1018
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:44,115
It's 26,446m²? Daegwallyeong?

1019
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:46,074
- Oh, no. - Oh, my.

1020
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,245
(Worrying about work)

1021
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,984
(Dropping)

1022
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:53,855
- What's wrong? - Her hands are trembling.

1023
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,654
I'm flustered.

1024
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:56,795
(Shocked)

1025
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:59,054
(Processing reality)

1026
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:00,625
Okay. Pollack, it is.

1027
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:02,765
We have to brace ourselves.

1028
00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:04,815
Dried pollack soup will be good.

1029
00:47:06,605 --> 00:47:09,135
(We'll worry about it tomorrow.)

1030
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:10,534
Who would like to have coffee?

1031
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:14,005
(Coffee time for their trembling hands)

1032
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:15,805
Here it is.

1033
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:17,615
(Jae Wook's Coffee Prince is open.)

1034
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:20,415
With less water.

1035
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:22,244
- Ji Yeon is... - Jun Myun, do you want it sweet?

1036
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:23,584
- I want it strong. - Give me some.

1037
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:24,655
Pour less water.

1038
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:26,784
(Pouring a little water as she wants)

1039
00:47:26,785 --> 00:47:27,825
That's good.

1040
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:29,995
If you give it to me, I'll stir it.

1041
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:31,825
- It's hot. - Thanks.

1042
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:35,264
(Staring)

1043
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:38,495
Jae Wook, you look great making coffee in that vest.

1044
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:40,835
I need to do something with Jae Wook's outfit.

1045
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:43,035
- What? - Hold on.

1046
00:47:44,005 --> 00:47:46,334
I need to take a picture of you in that vest.

1047
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,674
(Oh, I need to take a picture!)

1048
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:48,845
Look at Jae Wook.

1049
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:51,345
Yes, come on!

1050
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:54,745
(Photographer Park comes back.)

1051
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:57,715
(Photographer Park's photo after returning)

1052
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:00,355
(I'll take a picture of him, too.)

1053
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:05,125
(Take a good picture of me.)

1054
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:07,695
(Posing for pictures)

1055
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:14,035
(Being playful)

1056
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:23,644
(Dynamic Photographer Im)

1057
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:24,715
Stop wiggling your toes.

1058
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:27,985
(The four of them are getting closer.)

1059
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:32,985
(Their first dinner ended with a lot of laughter.)

1060
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:35,455
Thanks for the dinner.

1061
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,654
Let's bring it all inside.

1062
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:38,655
(Time to clean it up)

1063
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:41,665
(Jun Myun and Ji Yeon are doing the dishes.)

1064
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,065
Oh, my.

1065
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:44,695
(Jae Wook is cleaning the countertop.)

1066
00:48:44,995 --> 00:48:48,105
(Spraying something all over the countertop)

1067
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:53,345
(Wiping)

1068
00:48:53,445 --> 00:48:56,075
(Disinfecting with alcohol)

1069
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,115
You're so clean.

1070
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,545
The smell may last until tomorrow because I sliced the fish.

1071
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,795
I think we need to clean up here as well.

1072
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,185
Yes, I'll wipe there, too.

1073
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:10,525
(They share the same view on cleaning.)

1074
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,565
(They all know what to do.)

1075
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:16,965
(The oldest sister is wrapping the leftovers at ease.)

1076
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:21,705
(Vacuuming)

1077
00:49:24,835 --> 00:49:26,104
You worked so hard.

1078
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:27,774
(Finally, a peaceful night...)

1079
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:29,905
(has settled into their house.)

1080
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:31,845
("Like Rain, Like Music" by Kim Hyun Sik)

1081
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:35,115
(When it's raining)

1082
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:36,545
(And music is playing.)

1083
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:37,555
(Laughing)

1084
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:42,225
(Being funny)

1085
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:44,455
That's too cringy.

1086
00:49:44,555 --> 00:49:46,395
It's too much, right? It's annoying, isn't it?

1087
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,895
(Laughing)

1088
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:53,165
(Something seems really wrong with the jukebox.)

1089
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:54,934
I'm so worn out, Jung Ah.

1090
00:49:54,935 --> 00:49:56,615
(Nighttime at Fresh House is never quiet.)

1091
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,305
Ji Yeon, are you going for a run tomorrow?

1092
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:01,505
I'm asking you again.

1093
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,014
Why, Jun Myun? Do you want to join?

1094
00:50:04,015 --> 00:50:05,075
No, I can't.

1095
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:07,815
I need to help Jung Ah make hamburger steaks.

1096
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:09,184
I can do it alone.

1097
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:10,885
No way, Jung Ah.

1098
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:16,085
(What are they talking about?)

1099
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:19,655
Feel free to share your ideas. I heard you like exercises, Ji Yeon.

1100
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:21,125
What kind of exercise?

1101
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:22,895
Exercise?

1102
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:25,835
I often go for a run.

1103
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:29,205
What about running in the morning to reduce a puffy face?

1104
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:31,804
I think we will probably eat a lot.

1105
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:34,004
So, I was thinking about running in the morning.

1106
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:35,325
Okay, you can go for a run alone.

1107
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:37,675
Take Jae Wook with you.

1108
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:41,314
I went to London for work recently.

1109
00:50:41,315 --> 00:50:44,715
I ran among many Londoners, making eye contact with them.

1110
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:46,865
- It felt so good. Yes. - Did you go for a run?

1111
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,084
- Are you excited thinking of it? - Yes.

1112
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,095
Try it, then.

1113
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:52,455
It's not that I don't do it. I just can't.

1114
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:53,795
I can't wake up for that.
(Getting timid)

1115
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:56,964
Work is really exhausting.

1116
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:58,645
(Being worn out from tough work every day)

1117
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:01,135
You'll feel better if you go for a run in the morning.

1118
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,505
(She's so stubborn.)

1119
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:04,774
Please try it just once.

1120
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:08,305
It will help reduce a puffy face and fatigue.

1121
00:51:09,075 --> 00:51:10,615
- Let's try it. - Let's do it.

1122
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:12,274
We could just walk.

1123
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:15,985
(It seemed they would go for a run.)

1124
00:51:16,345 --> 00:51:20,455
If I weren't worn out today, I'd go. I even brought my running shoes.

1125
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,155
I can wear my sweatsuits.

1126
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:23,994
Jung Ah, you know I've been running...

1127
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:25,524
- on the treadmill. - Yes, I know that.

1128
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:27,045
- For 30 minutes a day. - I know that.

1129
00:51:27,095 --> 00:51:29,295
- I've sent her my running photos. - That's right.

1130
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:32,395
- It's freezing. - It's too cold for a run.

1131
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:35,505
But it's not that far.

1132
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:37,604
We won't drive for ten minutes to go for a run.

1133
00:51:37,605 --> 00:51:39,305
I'm just too lazy.

1134
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:41,845
We can be. It's not easy when you're over 50.

1135
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,614
- It's not easy when you're 50. - I mean...

1136
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:44,974
It's not that we have to.

1137
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:46,014
Jung Ah, I have turned 50.

1138
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,214
- You're 50, right? - Yes.

1139
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,844
- I just wanted to use the bathroom. - I won't give you errands anymore.

1140
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:50,954
- With a comfortable mind. - I can do errands.

1141
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:52,795
I was trying to go to the bathroom in comfort.

1142
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:54,525
Okay.
(I'll always be her younger sister.)

1143
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,524
- Right. - It feels like...

1144
00:51:57,525 --> 00:51:59,955
I have new sisters and colleagues.

1145
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:06,064
I have many reasons to join this show,

1146
00:52:06,065 --> 00:52:08,004
but the most significant one is this.

1147
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,275
- Hanging out with just us? - Yes.

1148
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,515
- You're cute. - Do you want a fried egg?

1149
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,445
- No, I'm good. - Do we have some ham?

1150
00:52:16,815 --> 00:52:18,114
Are you making fried eggs?

1151
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:20,645
Ji Yeon asked Jae Wook to make fried eggs.

1152
00:52:21,445 --> 00:52:22,684
We have instant jjajang ramen.

1153
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,114
Would you like to have instant jjajang ramen?

1154
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:25,591
(Would you like to have instant jjajang ramen?)

1155
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,654
(Instant jjajang ramen?)

1156
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:28,655
(Chuckling)

1157
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:31,294
Are you not having a fried egg but instant jjajang ramen?

1158
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:32,654
It's not like that.

1159
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:34,975
- Jun Myun. You looked really... - Why were you surprised?

1160
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,441
Do you want instant jjajang ramen?

1161
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:39,294
I mean, why are you asking me that?

1162
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,104
We bought it to eat, didn't we?

1163
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:42,705
(Ji Yeon's excuse: We bought it to eat.)

1164
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:47,304
It's not our last day. We can have it another day.

1165
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:49,904
- Then, tonight... - Should we have only fried eggs?

1166
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,114
Are two fried eggs good?

1167
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:52,115
- What do you think? - Let's just have fried eggs.

1168
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,174
- Just fried eggs? - Yes.

1169
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:56,745
(Take it easy on eating on the first day)

1170
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:00,885
(Jae Wook living in style)

1171
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,055
(Spicy radish salad on the side)

1172
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,995
(Sprinkling sesame seeds)

1173
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,725
(Having fried eggs in style)

1174
00:53:09,265 --> 00:53:10,934
(Here you are.)

1175
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:13,364
Thanks, Jae Wook. You're so sweet.

1176
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:16,165
You plated the fried eggs beautifully.

1177
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:21,974
(Taking a selfie over drinks on the first night)

1178
00:53:21,975 --> 00:53:23,004
That's good.

1179
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:24,614
It'll be fun to see all the photos later.

1180
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:25,915
Yes, it's really fun.

1181
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:28,815
- We bought a lot. - Jung Ah, do we have money left?

1182
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:30,654
I think we have about 30 dollars.

1183
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:32,831
- No, we have more. - We spent about 100 dollars today.

1184
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:33,855
Pass me the bag.

1185
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:35,654
- I actually wanted... - We spent a lot of money today.

1186
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:37,255
To buy strawberries.

1187
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,971
- Have them when you go back home. - Strawberries are expensive.

1188
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:41,624
- It's ten dollars. - Buy it with your own money.

1189
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,825
Strawberries are expensive.

1190
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:48,065
- How much do we have? - One, two, three, four, five...

1191
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:49,965
We have 50 dollars.

1192
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:51,504
(Current financial status)

1193
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:52,574
We might be in trouble tomorrow.

1194
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:53,744
(Daily pay: 200 dollars Traditional Market: 37 dollars)

1195
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:54,844
(Supermarket: 102 dollars)

1196
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:55,904
(Bungeoppang: 4 dollars Balance: 57 dollars)

1197
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:57,615
We have about 50 dollars, not 30.

1198
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:02,445
(Daily pay is almost gone quickly.)

1199
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,855
It'll be freezing in the pollack drying field.

1200
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:10,594
I'm quite anxious.

1201
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,235
(It seems it'll be a tough day tomorrow.)

1202
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:15,625
When would we experience this if it weren't for now?

1203
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:17,764
- In winter. - In a pollack drying field.

1204
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:20,046
The winter winds are freezing in Daegwallyeong in winter.

1205
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:21,634
We came to Gangwon Province.

1206
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,341
(Jung Ah is cheering those who are worried.)

1207
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:25,135
What should I wear?

1208
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,345
- Should I bundle up? - Sure, bundle up.

1209
00:54:27,575 --> 00:54:30,314
As long as we don't feel cold, we can work hard.

1210
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:31,635
(Bundle up, and let's work hard.)

1211
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:33,945
I feel bad for the guest.

1212
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:37,085
The guest is coming to a freezing place.

1213
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:42,185
(They have forgotten about the guest.)

1214
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:43,525
What if no one comes?

1215
00:54:44,055 --> 00:54:45,694
- Just the four of us. - We might work without any guests.

1216
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:47,995
We might not have any guests.

1217
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:50,164
I don't think the guest is young.

1218
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,295
(Leader Yum's hunch says the guest won't be young.)

1219
00:54:53,065 --> 00:54:55,265
Who knows? We've never guessed...

1220
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:57,335
- it correctly. - We have never.

1221
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:02,945
(Who would join them in this freezing weather?)

1222
00:55:03,745 --> 00:55:04,845
Why don't we raise a toast?

1223
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,014
I'd like that.

1224
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:07,095
- I love you all. - Cheers.

1225
00:55:09,245 --> 00:55:11,985
I should work hard, even if it's cold and I'm shivering.

1226
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,625
Of course, we should work hard.

1227
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:19,025
(As they're girding their loins for tomorrow, )

1228
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:24,465
(their first night wore on.)

1229
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:38,344
(Through the chilly winter air, )

1230
00:55:38,345 --> 00:55:42,045
(sunlight shines on the village.)

1231
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:46,255
(Morning has broken.)

1232
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,124
(They are...)

1233
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:53,455
(still asleep?)

1234
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:56,465
(Wiggling)

1235
00:55:56,795 --> 00:55:59,435
(At 7:28am, Ji Yeon wakes up.)

1236
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:07,105
(Where is Jung Ah?)

1237
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,775
(Blinking)

1238
00:56:15,985 --> 00:56:19,185
(While she is half asleep, )

1239
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:23,085
(Leader Yum has already washed up.)

1240
00:56:24,595 --> 00:56:27,225
Oh, are you up?

1241
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,835
(Half asleep)

1242
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:34,004
What are you thinking?

1243
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:36,165
Are you thinking, "Where am I and who am I?"

1244
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,074
- I couldn't sleep well. - What?

1245
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:42,504
- I didn't sleep well. - Didn't you sleep well?

1246
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:43,985
You were sleeping soundly. I saw you.

1247
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:47,485
(Laughing)

1248
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:49,784
I saw you sleeping soundly.

1249
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:51,314
I didn't. I had a dream last night.

1250
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:52,915
(Whining)

1251
00:56:57,895 --> 00:57:00,795
(Looking out the window, rubbing her eyes)

1252
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:04,365
(The beautiful sun has risen again.)

1253
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:08,565
(Let's wake up.)

1254
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:11,635
(Jun Myun woke up.)

1255
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,505
(Folding a comforter first)

1256
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:25,785
How could I be so bad at folding them?

1257
00:57:26,415 --> 00:57:27,785
How could you do that?

1258
00:57:29,585 --> 00:57:31,895
- Is it that hard? - Jung Ah, I don't know.

1259
00:57:32,255 --> 00:57:34,665
Not everyone is good at it.

1260
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:36,665
It'll be fine as long as it stays closed.

1261
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:39,964
- As long as it stays closed. - Oh, no.

1262
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:41,004
(Nothing goes as she hopes.)

1263
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,135
I can't even close it.

1264
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:46,905
(Three sisters' laughter from the next room)

1265
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,215
(Jae Wook wakes up while stretching.)

1266
00:57:52,575 --> 00:57:56,245
(Their second day has begun.)

1267
00:57:57,555 --> 00:58:01,425
(Ji Yeon is wearing workout clothes.)

1268
00:58:02,555 --> 00:58:05,395
(At the corner of the living room)

1269
00:58:05,795 --> 00:58:07,164
(Stretching...)

1270
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:09,725
(her legs)

1271
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,034
Are you stretching before going for a run?

1272
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:18,275
- I could get injured if I didn't. - I see.

1273
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,234
You look cool, Ji Yeon.

1274
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:22,245
You look awesome when you work out.

1275
00:58:23,505 --> 00:58:25,144
- Did you see her stretching? - Yes.

1276
00:58:25,145 --> 00:58:27,885
She looks like an athlete.

1277
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:32,485
(Ready to go for a run)

1278
00:58:32,815 --> 00:58:35,685
(Who is joining Ji Yeon for a run?)

1279
00:58:37,155 --> 00:58:41,065
(That is Jae Wook.)

1280
00:58:42,225 --> 00:58:43,765
- Wear this. - What?

1281
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:45,095
Wear it.

1282
00:58:45,695 --> 00:58:46,965
I'm good.

1283
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:48,165
Okay, thanks.

1284
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,165
Did you say thanks?

1285
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:52,605
Let's go.
(Going for a run together for the first time)

1286
00:58:53,606 --> 00:58:54,775
We'll see you later.

1287
00:58:56,175 --> 00:58:57,345
Let's go. Come on.

1288
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,815
(Running past the alley between stone walls)

1289
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:03,285
(Where are they heading?)

1290
00:59:05,615 --> 00:59:06,615
Oh, no.

1291
00:59:08,685 --> 00:59:09,985
There is a path to go upward.

1292
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:11,655
Let's go through that path.

1293
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:17,794
(Going up steep stone stairs)

1294
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:18,995
It's awesome.

1295
00:59:20,535 --> 00:59:24,375
(Long road under Mount Seorak)

1296
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:28,505
(Endless and wide open scenery)

1297
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:32,745
(They can see their house from there.)

1298
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,915
(Today, they'll run on this road.)

1299
00:59:36,815 --> 00:59:37,885
Let's go.

1300
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:42,685
- It's beautiful. - I love it.

1301
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:45,654
This is great. I love it.

1302
00:59:45,655 --> 00:59:48,025
(Breathing in the fresh air of Mount Seorak)

1303
00:59:48,495 --> 00:59:50,894
(Running together)

1304
00:59:50,895 --> 00:59:52,095
I can see our house.

1305
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:55,605
(I can see our house with a blue roof.)

1306
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:03,904
I feel so good.

1307
01:00:03,905 --> 01:00:07,175
(Even out of breath)

1308
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:09,584
Jae Wook, isn't it so good?

1309
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:10,885
- It's good. - Right?

1310
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:14,125
- Are you feeling good? - I'm feeling amazing.

1311
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:15,925
Are you feeling alive?

1312
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,595
Yes, I'm happy.

1313
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,094
(While awakening all the cells in the body, )

1314
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:23,664
(they keep running.)

1315
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:24,835
How far are we going?

1316
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:28,135
Let's run a little further.

1317
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:30,775
(Laughing)

1318
01:00:30,975 --> 01:00:32,205
(Let's go until we get there.)

1319
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:38,345
(While they're starting the morning cheerfully, )

1320
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:43,485
(what are the rest doing?)

1321
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:47,555
(Hard-working Jung Ah is showing up first.)

1322
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,055
(Pulling it out)

1323
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:50,995
(Starting vacuuming energetically)

1324
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,095
(Starting with their room)

1325
01:00:54,695 --> 01:00:56,364
(Move aside for a moment.)

1326
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:57,365
(Vacuuming)

1327
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,435
(Vacuuming every corner)

1328
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,565
(Vacuuming the carpet as well)

1329
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:04,605
(It's Clean Yum.)

1330
01:01:05,005 --> 01:01:07,005
(Jun Myun is cleaning up as well.)

1331
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:10,204
- I found something interesting. - What is it?

1332
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:12,345
(Turning off the vacuum cleaner.)

1333
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:14,825
I heard that this refrigerator could talk.

1334
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:20,515
Watch me. Hi, Bixby.

1335
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:22,224
(Listening)

1336
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,685
Tell me about the weather in Sokcho.

1337
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:29,425
(It is sunny in Sokcho-si, Dongmyeong-dong.)

1338
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,694
(The sky will stay clear throughout the day.)

1339
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:32,995
That's good.

1340
01:01:33,295 --> 01:01:35,834
The AI is so smart and useful.

1341
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,504
We can also listen to music.

1342
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:39,504
- Can we listen to music? - Music and the weather.

1343
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:40,844
(Dignified)

1344
01:01:40,845 --> 01:01:42,675
Hi Bixby. I hope we get along.

1345
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:45,415
(While they're enjoying new technology, )

1346
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:48,345
(the runners are almost home.)

1347
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:50,014
Here we are.

1348
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:52,355
(Running happily like two big dogs)

1349
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:53,455
Are you back?

1350
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:56,385
You're blushing from running.

1351
01:01:56,885 --> 01:01:58,555
(Out of breath)

1352
01:01:58,595 --> 01:01:59,655
It feels good, right?

1353
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:01,675
Were you happy running with me or not?

1354
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:04,395
- I wasn't. - Don't lie to me.

1355
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:07,405
(You always say the opposite of what your sister says.)

1356
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:09,534
How was it? Is the course good?

1357
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:10,605
It was beautiful.

1358
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:12,704
- Was it? - It was great up there.

1359
01:02:12,705 --> 01:02:13,905
- I see. - It was really good.

1360
01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:16,105
(She has no interest in running.)

1361
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,815
The path seemed as if it were made for us to run.

1362
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:20,215
- Is that so? - Yes.

1363
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:22,385
You should join me tomorrow.

1364
01:02:23,245 --> 01:02:24,315
Do I?

1365
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:28,624
(Ji Yeon and Jae Wook are washing up.)

1366
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,985
- Jung Ah, I think we should hurry. - Okay. Let's start it.

1367
01:02:31,755 --> 01:02:32,824
- Wash onions. - Onions.

1368
01:02:32,825 --> 01:02:34,395
I'll wash them.

1369
01:02:34,565 --> 01:02:37,195
(Onions are the key ingredient for today's breakfast.)

1370
01:02:37,265 --> 01:02:39,395
(What's for breakfast today?)

1371
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:41,504
(Going grocery shopping yesterday)

1372
01:02:41,505 --> 01:02:43,035
We need onions.

1373
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:44,575
Ground beef.

1374
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:46,674
Ground pork.

1375
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:47,975
(Guessing the menu)

1376
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:50,705
- Hamburger steak for breakfast? - Yes, hamburger steak.

1377
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:56,045
(They'll make thick and juicy hamburger steaks.)

1378
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:59,584
(Step 1: Clean up onions.)

1379
01:02:59,585 --> 01:03:01,255
(Cutting out each end)

1380
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:03,424
(Peeling)

1381
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:05,194
(Eyes sting.)

1382
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:08,195
Onions make my eyes sting.

1383
01:03:08,695 --> 01:03:09,895
We should hurry.

1384
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:12,794
(Still peeling)

1385
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:15,235
(Her hands are moving fast.)

1386
01:03:15,435 --> 01:03:16,834
(I'm leaving.)

1387
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,035
(Jung Ah with extreme efficiency is moving it forward.)

1388
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,404
(Cutting onions into big pieces)

1389
01:03:21,405 --> 01:03:23,575
(Putting them into a manual blender)

1390
01:03:24,445 --> 01:03:26,675
(Chopping them)

1391
01:03:26,945 --> 01:03:28,585
Are you going to chop all three onions?

1392
01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:30,825
It tastes better when you put a lot of onions in it.

1393
01:03:31,315 --> 01:03:33,315
(More onions)

1394
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:37,255
(Chopping them and putting them into a bowl)

1395
01:03:37,925 --> 01:03:41,125
(Once chopped, onions are ready.)

1396
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:44,265
(The onions will make hamburger steaks incredible.)

1397
01:03:44,735 --> 01:03:46,434
(Putting oil...)

1398
01:03:46,435 --> 01:03:47,704
(and butter into a pan)

1399
01:03:47,705 --> 01:03:49,764
This is everything you need to do to make hamburger steaks.

1400
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:51,204
All you need to do is stir-fry onions.

1401
01:03:51,205 --> 01:03:52,551
(Stir-frying chopped onions to caramelize them)

1402
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,705
(Checking if it's low heat.)

1403
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,405
It takes quite a while.

1404
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,314
It takes time until it's ready.

1405
01:03:58,315 --> 01:03:59,644
(The more you stir-fry them, the more flavorful they get.)

1406
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,085
You're supposed to stir-fry them over low heat.

1407
01:04:03,445 --> 01:04:07,355
(Making hamburger steaks with care and love)

1408
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,425
(Once all the onions have softened)

1409
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:12,655
Get golden brown.

1410
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:15,494
(Adding a generous spoonful of garlic for more flavor)

1411
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:18,965
I'm adding a bit of salt.

1412
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:22,704
(Stir-frying them while humming)

1413
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:25,135
(The color is still white.)

1414
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:29,474
Can you do it over high heat?

1415
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:30,574
(Suggesting a shortcut)

1416
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,974
I need to stir-fry them slowly over low heat...

1417
01:04:31,975 --> 01:04:33,375
until they turn golden brown.

1418
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:36,684
This isn't that simple. We should've done it yesterday.

1419
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:37,915
(I know.)

1420
01:04:38,615 --> 01:04:40,985
(Onions make her anxious.)

1421
01:04:41,155 --> 01:04:43,784
Should I start to make soup now?

1422
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:44,795
Sure.

1423
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:46,824
(In Western cuisine, soup as an appetizer is a must.)

1424
01:04:46,825 --> 01:04:49,164
(It's so simple. Just add soup powder and water.)

1425
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:51,995
(Mixing them)

1426
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:55,665
(Once it boils up, it's ready to serve.)

1427
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:58,405
It would be a problem if we forgot to cook rice.

1428
01:04:59,705 --> 01:05:02,845
(Starting to cook rice)

1429
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,344
(Jae Wook got out of the bathroom after washing up.)

1430
01:05:04,345 --> 01:05:07,015
- Where is it? - It already smells so good.

1431
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:09,485
Nothing is ready yet.

1432
01:05:10,145 --> 01:05:11,355
(I'm hungry.)

1433
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:13,584
(Coming to the kitchen hungry after running)

1434
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:14,955
What is this smell?

1435
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:16,884
(Oh, no...)

1436
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:19,295
I need to let it cool down. Jae Wook.

1437
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:20,594
It's getting late.

1438
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:22,265
It'll be tasty.

1439
01:05:22,495 --> 01:05:23,694
(White)

1440
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:25,835
(Come on. Get golden brown quickly.)

1441
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:29,665
(Setting the table with excitement)

1442
01:05:32,035 --> 01:05:34,845
(It's getting brownish.)

1443
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:36,345
That's enough.

1444
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:41,514
I'll make the sauce while it cools down.

1445
01:05:41,515 --> 01:05:43,784
Can you take it to a cold area?

1446
01:05:43,785 --> 01:05:45,085
Let them cool right away.

1447
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:48,585
(While it cools down in cold air, )

1448
01:05:49,285 --> 01:05:51,294
(Jung Ah makes the sauce.)

1449
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:52,724
Add the cooking oil and butter...

1450
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,365
and stir-fry until the onions are cooked.

1451
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:56,095
(Ketchup)

1452
01:05:57,165 --> 01:06:01,034
(She adds ketchup for the sweet and sour taste!)

1453
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:03,595
Stir-fry so that the sourness of the ketchup evaporates a bit...

1454
01:06:03,735 --> 01:06:04,935
and add water.

1455
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:08,445
(Chef Yum adds a kick to the sauce!)

1456
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,114
Squeeze in a bit of wholegrain mustard.

1457
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:13,251
(Complete the sauce with the spicy wholegrain mustard.)

1458
01:06:13,275 --> 01:06:15,144
(Jung Ah's hamburger steak sauce...)

1459
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:18,415
(is very easy to make.)

1460
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:20,975
Jung Ah, does it need to be completely cold?

1461
01:06:21,085 --> 01:06:22,954
Is it cooled down? It's pretty cooled down, right?

1462
01:06:22,955 --> 01:06:24,124
It's lukewarm.

1463
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,654
(When the stir-fried onion is cooled down, )

1464
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:27,794
We need to make this.

1465
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:29,825
(Jung Ah and Jun Myun begin to make the mixture.)

1466
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,665
- That's where you add it. - Yes.

1467
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:37,205
(The stir-fried onions and meat will meet and become tender.)

1468
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:39,974
(She adds umami with ketchup.)

1469
01:06:39,975 --> 01:06:42,105
(She adds the flavors with Worcestershire sauce.)

1470
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:43,445
(Cracking)

1471
01:06:43,905 --> 01:06:46,515
(She adds eggs so that the ingredients stick.)

1472
01:06:47,075 --> 01:06:48,484
(While she adds another egg, )

1473
01:06:48,485 --> 01:06:49,614
(Jun Myun prepares for the next step.)

1474
01:06:49,615 --> 01:06:51,414
- Tell me when to stop. - Okay.

1475
01:06:51,415 --> 01:06:52,785
(They work in unison.)

1476
01:06:52,915 --> 01:06:54,055
We need more.

1477
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,654
We need more to make the ingredients stick.

1478
01:06:55,655 --> 01:06:56,831
(The second glue for the mixture, breadcrumbs get added.)

1479
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:58,124
Stop for now.

1480
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:01,695
(The hamburger steak mixture is complete!)

1481
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:04,894
(When she kneads the mixture, )

1482
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:09,305
(Ji Yeon approaches.)

1483
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:11,575
Go ahead and make it.

1484
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:13,575
(Happy)

1485
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:19,015
Let's go and make hamburger steak

1486
01:07:20,015 --> 01:07:24,345
- The inside needs to be full. - My goodness.

1487
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:26,454
Like this.

1488
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:27,854
(The plump patty...)

1489
01:07:27,855 --> 01:07:30,155
(makes them exclaim.)

1490
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:31,555
- I want a lot. - Okay.

1491
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:33,054
Don't make it too fat...

1492
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:34,775
because it'll take too long to get cooking.

1493
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:42,605
- I'll do it. - Okay.

1494
01:07:42,665 --> 01:07:43,765
(Patting)

1495
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:46,775
(Ji Yeon makes pretty patties.)

1496
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,574
(When she pats the patties diligently)

1497
01:07:48,575 --> 01:07:49,645
(Glancing over)

1498
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,475
All done.

1499
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:53,244
(The second sibling adds a detail.)

1500
01:07:53,245 --> 01:07:54,345
Let's use the last bit.

1501
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:55,914
Let's not waste anything.

1502
01:07:55,915 --> 01:07:57,115
(They use all the mixture.)

1503
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:59,085
(Ta-da)

1504
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,155
- Well done. - It's pretty.

1505
01:08:02,255 --> 01:08:04,355
Do you want your fried egg over easy or over hard?

1506
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:05,824
Over hard, please.

1507
01:08:05,825 --> 01:08:07,024
Do what you want.

1508
01:08:07,025 --> 01:08:09,141
- I just want the leftover. - Do what you want, Jae Wook.

1509
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,434
(Jung Ah is funny.)

1510
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:13,095
- What I want? - Do what you can.

1511
01:08:13,535 --> 01:08:14,765
I'll do what I can.

1512
01:08:15,435 --> 01:08:19,135
(Now comes the youngest one's egg show.)

1513
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:21,975
(He heats up the frying pan in a edgy way.)

1514
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,774
(Forget about the regular fried eggs.)

1515
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:28,215
(You'll get a taste that's beyond your imagination.)

1516
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,715
Gosh, it burst. It's yours.

1517
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:32,355
No!

1518
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:33,915
You wanted yours to be over hard.

1519
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,554
I want the shape to be pretty.

1520
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:36,755
(Okay. I got it.)

1521
01:08:38,425 --> 01:08:41,295
(He shapes Ji Yeon's egg so that it becomes pretty.)

1522
01:08:41,395 --> 01:08:43,024
(Water)

1523
01:08:43,025 --> 01:08:44,795
(Why is he adding water to the frying pan?)

1524
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:48,804
(He shakes the pan so that the water spreads evenly.)

1525
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,305
(Then he covers the pan and waits for a while.)

1526
01:08:52,135 --> 01:08:55,605
(They've been steamed perfectly.)

1527
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:58,645
(The top side is moist and the bottom side is crispy.)

1528
01:08:58,675 --> 01:09:01,285
Jae Wook, you do it properly.

1529
01:09:02,945 --> 01:09:06,054
(The youngest member's fried eggs have details.)

1530
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:08,785
(Shall we fry the hamburger steaks that are full of onion?)

1531
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:11,794
(Ji Yeon's)

1532
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:13,354
(Jun Myun's)

1533
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:17,365
(The four siblings' hamburger steaks go over the fire.)

1534
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:21,335
(They get cooked thoroughly over medium-low heat.)

1535
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:24,905
(Brown)

1536
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:27,535
(She adds a bit of water in the middle of the pan.)

1537
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:30,544
(Jung Ah's tip for hamburg steak: Add water and cover the lid...)

1538
01:09:30,545 --> 01:09:32,715
(to create steam so that the patties don't burn.)

1539
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,785
(The outside is golden and the inside is juicy.)

1540
01:09:41,685 --> 01:09:43,425
They're done.

1541
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,494
(It's time to plate the dishes.)

1542
01:09:47,495 --> 01:09:48,795
(Pressing)

1543
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:52,464
(She makes a rice mound you see at a Western food restaurant.)

1544
01:09:52,465 --> 01:09:54,835
It looks pretty.

1545
01:09:55,165 --> 01:09:57,404
(Instead of a salad)

1546
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:59,335
It's radish.

1547
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:02,004
(Moist and well-cooked hamburger steak)

1548
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:03,244
All right.

1549
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:04,445
(A fried egg goes on the top.)

1550
01:10:06,775 --> 01:10:10,845
(Jung Ah's onion sauce is added as well.)

1551
01:10:11,485 --> 01:10:13,985
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1552
01:10:15,685 --> 01:10:17,724
(The thick hamburger steak, fried egg, and onion sauce...)

1553
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:19,755
(complete the trinity.)

1554
01:10:20,225 --> 01:10:23,165
(There's creamy soup as an appetizer.)

1555
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:27,695
It's like what you get at an old Western food restaurant.

1556
01:10:28,635 --> 01:10:30,465
There's warm soup.

1557
01:10:31,065 --> 01:10:32,835
(Slurping)

1558
01:10:33,805 --> 01:10:37,075
(The second sibling who made the soup tries it as well.)

1559
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:39,945
(Drinking)

1560
01:10:40,415 --> 01:10:42,384
(Drinking)

1561
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:43,615
(My goodness)

1562
01:10:44,315 --> 01:10:46,455
(My goodness)

1563
01:10:46,515 --> 01:10:48,525
(Who made that sound?)

1564
01:10:48,655 --> 01:10:50,131
- He's a middle-aged man. - Jae Wook.

1565
01:10:50,155 --> 01:10:51,454
- What? - You...

1566
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:52,755
He went, "My goodness."

1567
01:10:53,055 --> 01:10:54,154
- He eats... - It's so nice.

1568
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:55,864
- He eats it like a hangover soup. - Seriously.

1569
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:56,865
(The sound came out since it was so tasty.)

1570
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,995
It's like what you get at an old Western food restaurant.

1571
01:11:02,365 --> 01:11:05,175
(A big bite)

1572
01:11:05,635 --> 01:11:07,375
- Is it tasty? - It's so tasty.

1573
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,974
Is it tasty?

1574
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:10,405
(No words are needed.)

1575
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:14,074
(Ji Yeon dips it in the onion sauce.)

1576
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,745
(Having a bite)

1577
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:19,884
(The taste makes her dance!)

1578
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:20,955
- It's so tasty. - Yes.

1579
01:11:22,055 --> 01:11:25,054
(Jung Ah has a bite with the meat and fried egg.)

1580
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:26,895
(Satisfied)

1581
01:11:27,155 --> 01:11:29,765
(Jun Myun tries a big piece of meat.)

1582
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:31,965
- Is it tasty? - It's tasty.

1583
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:34,194
- The sauce is so tasty. - Seriously.

1584
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:36,105
(It isn't an ordinary hamburger steak.)

1585
01:11:36,135 --> 01:11:37,765
- The onion is sweet, Jung Ah. - Yes.

1586
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:39,334
It's tasty because it contains a lot of onions.

1587
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:41,645
- We used all three onions. - Yes.

1588
01:11:42,305 --> 01:11:45,675
If you add more meat, it becomes dry.

1589
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:47,575
I can imagine that.

1590
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:53,285
(Jung Ah's hamburger steak contains a lot of onions.)

1591
01:11:54,255 --> 01:11:56,284
Jung Ah's cooking skills...

1592
01:11:56,285 --> 01:11:59,095
are at their height. Her dishes are so tasty.

1593
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,495
Jung Ah became the master of cooking.

1594
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:03,564
(Shout out to Master Jung Ah!)

1595
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:05,065
(She becomes embarrassed.)

1596
01:12:05,695 --> 01:12:08,834
Jae Wook's fried egg has...

1597
01:12:08,835 --> 01:12:10,235
chewy ends.

1598
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:15,005
(I'll eat it in one bite.)

1599
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:18,815
(The one who loves her fried egg over hard takes a bite.)

1600
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:20,445
(Impressed)

1601
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:23,514
(After checking that the older members like it, )

1602
01:12:23,515 --> 01:12:25,785
(he pulls up his sleeves.)

1603
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,954
(Fried egg)

1604
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:32,824
(Radish)

1605
01:12:32,825 --> 01:12:36,295
(Hamburger steak)

1606
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:39,465
(Drinking the soup)

1607
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:43,335
(He's inhaling the food.)

1608
01:12:44,605 --> 01:12:48,475
(He cleanses his palate with spicy radish salad.)

1609
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:51,544
(Jae Wook's plate is empty.)

1610
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,015
I'm full. It's nice.

1611
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:54,174
(Startled)

1612
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:55,885
You finished everything quickly.

1613
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:58,214
- It's so tasty, Jung Ah. - Jae Wook cleared his plate.

1614
01:12:58,215 --> 01:12:59,215
He cleared it.

1615
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:01,425
You gave me a big hamburger steak.

1616
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,925
(Upon seeing Jae Wook's empty plate, )

1617
01:13:05,955 --> 01:13:08,664
(Ji Yeon shares her hamburg steak...)

1618
01:13:08,665 --> 01:13:11,435
(with him.)

1619
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:14,194
(Why would you share the precious meat with me?)

1620
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:15,834
(Thinking)

1621
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:18,334
It's okay. Jung Ah gave me a big piece.

1622
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,305
- Don't you want to eat more? - No.

1623
01:13:20,505 --> 01:13:21,774
(She takes it back.)

1624
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:23,305
I can't believe you're taking it back.

1625
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:26,415
(Flustered and embarrassed)

1626
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:28,935
I've never had an experience like this.

1627
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:33,355
(Thank goodness.)

1628
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:36,554
(The work time approaches.)

1629
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:37,654
We need to get ready by 30 minutes after, right?

1630
01:13:37,655 --> 01:13:38,655
Yes.

1631
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:40,525
Jae Wook, what time is it?

1632
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,425
It's five minutes until the hour.

1633
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:47,094
- Then we should brush our teeth. - We should do that and such.

1634
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:48,904
We should apply a lot of sunscreen.

1635
01:13:48,905 --> 01:13:50,764
We should also take supplements.

1636
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:52,074
That's right.

1637
01:13:52,075 --> 01:13:53,305
(They're experienced workers!)

1638
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:58,115
Now, shall we clean up?

1639
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,875
(Dabbing)

1640
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:02,984
Jae Wook, did you apply sunscreen?

1641
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:04,245
- No. - Come here.

1642
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:07,815
Thank you.

1643
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,524
How many socks did you put on?

1644
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:12,225
You should wear waterproof shoes.

1645
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:14,225
Hurry up and apply sunscreen.

1646
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:16,864
I did that. What else do I need to apply?

1647
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:18,064
Sunscreen.

1648
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:19,634
(Jung Ah gets ready to go out.)

1649
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:21,195
(Sunscreen)

1650
01:14:21,465 --> 01:14:22,634
The team outfit.

1651
01:14:22,635 --> 01:14:24,875
(Fresh off the Sea's work clothes for the second season)

1652
01:14:24,905 --> 01:14:26,274
Are you wearing an undershirt?

1653
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:27,405
I'm wearing three layers.

1654
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:30,505
(The first layer)

1655
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,175
(The second layer)

1656
01:14:32,775 --> 01:14:33,915
(The third layer)

1657
01:14:34,415 --> 01:14:36,645
It's better to layer up using thin clothes.

1658
01:14:37,245 --> 01:14:39,955
(The second sibling adds moisture to her lips.)

1659
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:43,685
(Being an experienced worker, Jung Ah packs everything.)

1660
01:14:44,085 --> 01:14:46,425
I'll bring the hand warmers.

1661
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:49,995
We need to shop for groceries, so I'll bring money.

1662
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:54,165
(The experienced workers are ready to go.)

1663
01:14:55,335 --> 01:14:58,234
(She sits still like an avocado.)

1664
01:14:58,235 --> 01:15:01,645
(A snow-capped mountain)

1665
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:03,605
It must be very cold.

1666
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:06,845
Since it's really cold,

1667
01:15:07,275 --> 01:15:09,045
I need to soak up the sunlight.

1668
01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:11,815
I need photosynthesis.

1669
01:15:12,155 --> 01:15:14,055
(This avocado becomes red.)

1670
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:16,524
I want to avoid the sun.

1671
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:18,855
- I wanted to avoid the sun - I wanted to avoid the sun

1672
01:15:20,455 --> 01:15:22,525
- My back hurts. - You need to stretch your back.

1673
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,965
(The stretching dance begins.)

1674
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,835
(The third sibling joins them after getting ready.)

1675
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,735
- My goodness. - Hey.

1676
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:35,775
(They're absorbed.)

1677
01:15:36,605 --> 01:15:39,675
(The youngest one films them.)

1678
01:15:41,075 --> 01:15:44,185
(The three siblings' dance time becomes heated.)

1679
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,954
- I'm too warm to dance now. - I'm too warm.

1680
01:15:46,955 --> 01:15:48,055
- Gosh. - Seriously.

1681
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:51,284
(The four siblings are all warmed up for work.)

1682
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,494
Will Ji Yeon drive?

1683
01:15:52,495 --> 01:15:53,825
Ji Yeon, good luck with driving.

1684
01:15:55,395 --> 01:15:56,794
All right.

1685
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:58,195
(Ji Yeon is the driver of the day.)

1686
01:15:58,395 --> 01:16:00,834
(With a loud shout, they set off to Daegwallyeong.)

1687
01:16:00,835 --> 01:16:04,305
Since we're going to Daegwallyeong, may I put in a song request?

1688
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:05,735
I forgot that I was the DJ.

1689
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:07,534
(Which song does Cheerful Jun Myun want?)

1690
01:16:07,535 --> 01:16:08,875
"Peak" by Kim Min Gi.

1691
01:16:09,145 --> 01:16:10,875
- What was that? - "Peak."

1692
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:13,415
Why don't we listen to "Peak" by Kim Min Gi?

1693
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,384
Sure.

1694
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:16,921
(I've never heard of it, but Jun Myun wants to listen to it.)

1695
01:16:16,945 --> 01:16:18,485
(She turns on the music.)

1696
01:16:23,385 --> 01:16:27,155
(People raise their hands and point)

1697
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:31,525
To the high and pointy peaks only.

1698
01:16:33,565 --> 01:16:36,735
(What?)

1699
01:16:37,265 --> 01:16:38,775
(Glancing over)

1700
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:42,944
(Peak)

1701
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:45,145
(Absorbed)

1702
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:50,385
(Is it a lecture?)

1703
01:16:51,855 --> 01:16:52,985
Is this a song?

1704
01:16:53,185 --> 01:16:54,745
- The song will come out now. - Really?

1705
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:57,485
(So it is a song.)

1706
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,024
("Peak")

1707
01:16:59,025 --> 01:17:01,095
(Lyrics, music, and singing by Kim Min Gi)

1708
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:06,764
(I was alone)

1709
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:08,334
(I was climbing)

1710
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:10,904
(Toward the highest peak)

1711
01:17:10,905 --> 01:17:12,435
(I knew)

1712
01:17:14,275 --> 01:17:15,374
("Peak" by Kim Min Gi is a song that was made...)

1713
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,544
(for the Korean athletes who participated in...)

1714
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:17,744
(the LA Summer Games in 1984, but failed to win a medal...)

1715
01:17:17,745 --> 01:17:18,975
(and returned home early.)

1716
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:22,885
(Emotional)

1717
01:17:24,045 --> 01:17:26,285
(Wary)

1718
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:30,485
(For the first time, something fills the car.)

1719
01:17:32,295 --> 01:17:37,195
(It's silent.)

1720
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,535
(Shout)

1721
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:43,365
(The current hardship is nothing)

1722
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,835
(The message is deep.)

1723
01:17:47,035 --> 01:17:48,575
(Glancing over)

1724
01:17:49,975 --> 01:17:53,775
(The message is too deep.)

1725
01:17:54,845 --> 01:17:58,315
(DJ Yum prepares the next song to change up the atmosphere.)

1726
01:17:59,115 --> 01:18:01,214
(Touching)

1727
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,755
(Turning off the music)

1728
01:18:02,855 --> 01:18:05,594
I'm sorry. I pressed it by mistake.

1729
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:06,875
(I pressed a button by mistake.)

1730
01:18:07,025 --> 01:18:09,225
(She ended the silence by mistake.)

1731
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:11,524
I pressed the X button.

1732
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,671
(Even though it wasn't intentional, she can't help but smile.)

1733
01:18:13,695 --> 01:18:15,465
(Suppressing laughter)

1734
01:18:16,435 --> 01:18:19,334
I was absorbed in the song. How did this happen?

1735
01:18:19,335 --> 01:18:20,615
(Her mind is still at the peak.)

1736
01:18:21,205 --> 01:18:22,205
(A walk to the peak was short and intense.)

1737
01:18:22,206 --> 01:18:23,245
It's okay. I enjoyed it.

1738
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:26,815
(DJ Yum picks the song this time.)

1739
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:31,414
She switched up the atmosphere.

1740
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,955
The songs are too different.

1741
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,784
He said, "The songs are too different."

1742
01:18:36,785 --> 01:18:38,345
(Jung Ah eliminated the middle ground.)

1743
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,255
(They get a dopamine rush.)

1744
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,025
(Shall we warm up our bodies?)

1745
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:45,641
- We should stretch our shoulders. - Let's stretch our shoulders.

1746
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:47,535
(The dancing avocado is on.)

1747
01:18:48,735 --> 01:18:50,835
(This is why they're experienced workers.)

1748
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:56,305
(Dancing)

1749
01:18:56,575 --> 01:19:00,145
(Let's shake it up.)

1750
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:03,745
(Dancing Jung Ah has no brakes.)

1751
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,384
Jung Ah, you danced with all your might.

1752
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:07,415
- Jung Ah. - Seriously.

1753
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:09,415
I think Jung Ah is the funniest in the world.

1754
01:19:11,225 --> 01:19:14,995
(Yum shakalaka)

1755
01:19:15,895 --> 01:19:18,835
(Dancing to the rhythm, the four siblings head to...)

1756
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:22,964
(Daegwallyeong.)

1757
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:24,005
It's minus 4°C.

1758
01:19:24,405 --> 01:19:26,511
The temperature dropped by 3°C as soon as we got here.

1759
01:19:26,535 --> 01:19:27,535
Seriously.

1760
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:32,445
(It's hidden deep in the Taebaek Mountains.)

1761
01:19:32,545 --> 01:19:34,375
(Daegwallyeong)

1762
01:19:35,115 --> 01:19:36,785
(On the rough pass lies...)

1763
01:19:36,885 --> 01:19:38,985
(today's workplace.)

1764
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:41,924
(They get caught at the lowest place...)

1765
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:43,955
(and get dried at the highest place.)

1766
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,955
(Only then, people can taste this precious food.)

1767
01:19:47,525 --> 01:19:51,525
(The siblings are on their way to meet dried pollack.)

1768
01:19:51,835 --> 01:19:53,094
It must be cold.

1769
01:19:53,095 --> 01:19:56,035
(And)

1770
01:19:56,665 --> 01:19:59,435
I feel like I'm entering the military.

1771
01:20:00,975 --> 01:20:03,505
(A guest came to Daegwallyeong secretly.)

1772
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:08,945
(Confused)

1773
01:20:08,946 --> 01:20:11,045
(Actor Lee Jung Jae)

1774
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,555
Once I get out of this car...

1775
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:14,484
(Wary)

1776
01:20:14,485 --> 01:20:15,685
It begins.

1777
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,825
- Oh, my. Just like this? - Yes.

1778
01:20:21,795 --> 01:20:25,665
(Lee Jung Jae joined the Pollack Game.)

1779
01:20:27,065 --> 01:20:29,805
I watched the show often.

1780
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,805
So I know that I'll definitely work.

1781
01:20:34,075 --> 01:20:35,505
Since we're in Gangwon Province...

1782
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:40,645
(How did Jung Jae come to the snow-capped Daegwallyeong?)

1783
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:45,185
Jung Ah and I know each other well.

1784
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:48,284
Ji Yeon is on this show too.

1785
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,225
(He's preparing to film a drama with Ji Yeon.)

1786
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:53,194
(However)

1787
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:54,454
Do they really not know?

1788
01:20:54,455 --> 01:20:55,571
(Do they really not know that I'm coming?)

1789
01:20:55,595 --> 01:20:56,765
They really don't know.

1790
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,934
Did you really keep it...

1791
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:01,904
(The secret guest is worried about the security.)

1792
01:21:01,905 --> 01:21:03,105
a secret...

1793
01:21:04,105 --> 01:21:05,105
to surprise them?

1794
01:21:05,675 --> 01:21:08,335
Not even our cameramen know.

1795
01:21:08,775 --> 01:21:10,905
(Really?)

1796
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:12,975
This is bad.

1797
01:21:13,975 --> 01:21:15,845
(He becomes more worried.)

1798
01:21:16,715 --> 01:21:19,885
I thought hard about how I should enter.

1799
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:24,325
But I haven't found an answer yet.

1800
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:30,264
I did bring a few hats...

1801
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,734
the roasted chestnut sellers wear.

1802
01:21:32,735 --> 01:21:33,995
(Why did he bring such a hat?)

1803
01:21:34,565 --> 01:21:35,935
How should I surprise them?

1804
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:40,305
(The thought of teasing the siblings makes his eye shine.)

1805
01:21:41,405 --> 01:21:43,174
(As he thinks about the hidden camera prank, )

1806
01:21:43,175 --> 01:21:44,945
(he arrives at the workplace.)

1807
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:48,175
- What... - You can see it, right?

1808
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:49,845
That's...

1809
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:55,685
(What awaits Jung Jae...)

1810
01:21:56,885 --> 01:22:00,595
(is a pollack drying field of an enormous size.)

1811
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:02,665
Is that...

1812
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,194
Is that what we need to work on?

1813
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:07,411
(He becomes flustered by the scale of work.)

1814
01:22:07,435 --> 01:22:09,035
You're hurriedly going through your bag.

1815
01:22:09,865 --> 01:22:11,234
I think I'll need gloves.

1816
01:22:11,235 --> 01:22:12,735
(He hurriedly looks for his gloves.)

1817
01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:18,405
(My goodness)

1818
01:22:18,945 --> 01:22:21,945
(This is a real situation.)

1819
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:25,455
Hello.

1820
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:31,455
(Jung Jae gets out of the car at the pollack drying field.)

1821
01:22:32,355 --> 01:22:34,795
(He looks around first.)

1822
01:22:35,725 --> 01:22:37,694
(Today's workplace and the location...)

1823
01:22:37,695 --> 01:22:39,635
(where Jung Jae will make a surprise entrance)

1824
01:22:39,965 --> 01:22:40,965
Hold on.

1825
01:22:40,966 --> 01:22:43,235
(Coming up with a plan)

1826
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,605
(He looks serious when he comes up with a plan.)

1827
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:49,675
(Ta-da)

1828
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:53,445
(Careful)

1829
01:22:53,645 --> 01:22:56,915
(What Jung Jae took out with caution...)

1830
01:22:57,745 --> 01:23:00,884
(is a chestnut seller's hat.)

1831
01:23:00,885 --> 01:23:04,625
(It's for his disguise.)

1832
01:23:05,525 --> 01:23:09,025
(The thought of surprising the siblings makes him smile.)

1833
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:13,034
(Jung Jae returns to the car with a strategy.)

1834
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,095
Oh, my.

1835
01:23:16,835 --> 01:23:19,635
(Rummaging)

1836
01:23:20,105 --> 01:23:23,345
(He begins to disguise himself in earnest.)

1837
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:25,675
(Throwing)

1838
01:23:25,715 --> 01:23:28,075
(He changes into his work clothes.)

1839
01:23:29,285 --> 01:23:33,015
(A thorough disguise)

1840
01:23:34,255 --> 01:23:38,425
(He takes out a mask as well.)

1841
01:23:39,655 --> 01:23:41,555
(Humming)

1842
01:23:42,025 --> 01:23:44,265
(He waits as he hums.)

1843
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:47,595
(Meanwhile, the four siblings have no idea about the guest.)

1844
01:23:47,835 --> 01:23:50,335
It's so cold that the snow doesn't melt.

1845
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:53,875
- I knew it. - We should brace ourselves.

1846
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:57,375
This must be the place.

1847
01:23:58,145 --> 01:23:59,274
- Is this the place? - Yes.

1848
01:23:59,275 --> 01:24:00,275
(Is this the place?)

1849
01:24:00,815 --> 01:24:02,715
- It's this place. - Look from here to the end.

1850
01:24:04,515 --> 01:24:08,585
(It's so long that you can't see the end.)

1851
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:11,784
(Shocked)

1852
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,124
- Look at that. - My goodness.

1853
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,494
It stretches out to the bottom.

1854
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:16,495
This is incredible.

1855
01:24:17,895 --> 01:24:21,335
(The members' car enters the white field of snow.)

1856
01:24:23,365 --> 01:24:25,335
Shouldn't we travel in a car?

1857
01:24:25,975 --> 01:24:27,035
We're here.

1858
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:31,144
(The 4 clueless victims arrive at the field.)

1859
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:32,265
Let's wear the body warmers.

1860
01:24:32,515 --> 01:24:33,515
Put them on here.

1861
01:24:33,516 --> 01:24:34,944
(A sudden snowy field stretches out before them.)

1862
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,385
My goodness.

1863
01:24:40,185 --> 01:24:42,185
I can't see the end.

1864
01:24:43,755 --> 01:24:45,554
I've never been to a pollack drying field.

1865
01:24:45,555 --> 01:24:47,624
I wonder how many pollacks are getting dried.

1866
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:49,594
- My goodness. - How did they hang them up?

1867
01:24:49,595 --> 01:24:50,915
(The field is close to 26,446m².)

1868
01:24:51,065 --> 01:24:52,734
I never thought that pollacks would overwhelm me.

1869
01:24:52,735 --> 01:24:54,335
- Seriously. - Aren't they overwhelming?

1870
01:24:55,035 --> 01:24:57,475
- The pollacks overwhelmed us. - The pollacks overwhelmed us.

1871
01:24:57,705 --> 01:24:59,535
I underestimated the pollacks.

1872
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:00,935
This is no joke.

1873
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:07,375
(What awaits the members at the end of the long drying field...)

1874
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:12,685
(isn't just hard labor.)

1875
01:25:13,615 --> 01:25:16,185
(Shall I begin the game?)

1876
01:25:16,785 --> 01:25:17,854
How will we do this?

1877
01:25:17,855 --> 01:25:19,655
(In the middle of the pollack drying field, )

1878
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:22,465
(a war of nerves begins.)

1879
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,594
- Hello. - Hello.

1880
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:25,595
Hello.

1881
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,805
(The one who hides)

1882
01:25:29,565 --> 01:25:31,764
(The ones that are dry)

1883
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:34,034
(The four siblings...)

1884
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:36,144
(versus Lee Jung Jae...)

1885
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:39,244
(versus pollacks)

1886
01:25:39,245 --> 01:25:42,415
(Who will be the winner of the Pollack Game?)

1887
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:45,962
(Welcome to the Pollack Game.)

1888
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:47,191
It's no joke.

1889
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:48,862
(The size of the vast field is 26,446m².)

1890
01:25:49,262 --> 01:25:50,832
(Would you like to enter...)

1891
01:25:51,202 --> 01:25:53,332
(the Pollack Game?)

1892
01:25:53,502 --> 01:25:55,671
(No.)

1893
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:57,202
(The city man has no strength.)

1894
01:25:57,272 --> 01:25:58,372
(They work...)

1895
01:25:58,502 --> 01:25:59,612
(endlessly...)

1896
01:25:59,972 --> 01:26:02,182
(and hang up the pollacks.)

1897
01:26:02,242 --> 01:26:03,381
(How does it feel...)

1898
01:26:03,382 --> 01:26:05,011
(to hang up the pollacks as a world-renowned star?)

1899
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:06,382
(I need to leave on Sunday.)

1900
01:26:06,882 --> 01:26:09,082
(I'm going to Milan on Sunday.)

1901
01:26:09,322 --> 01:26:11,822
(You can go to Milan when it's time.)

1902
01:26:12,552 --> 01:26:14,632
(But it'll be nice to enjoy sledding before you go!)

1903
01:26:14,822 --> 01:26:16,062
(Are you done having fun?)

1904
01:26:16,322 --> 01:26:18,262
(Then it's time to eat!)

1905
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:19,562
(Pouring in the backbones)

1906
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:21,092
(Pouring in the potatoes)

1907
01:26:21,332 --> 01:26:22,772
(Pouring in the dried radish greens)

1908
01:26:22,802 --> 01:26:24,202
(Are these 5 servings?)

1909
01:26:26,532 --> 01:26:27,701
This is insane.

1910
01:26:27,702 --> 01:26:29,402
(Extra large)

1911
01:26:29,802 --> 01:26:32,041
(Jung Ah's amazing gamjatang rivals 30 years of traditions.)

1912
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:33,042
(Anxious)

1913
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:35,042
(The youngest one suddenly collapses!)

1914
01:26:35,372 --> 01:26:38,212
(Spicy grilled pollack)

1915
01:26:38,242 --> 01:26:39,912
(Are the staff members eating too?)

1916
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,851
(No, we'll eat all the food.)

1917
01:26:41,852 --> 01:26:42,852
(All of this food?)

1918
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:43,882
(We can finish it!)

1919
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,751
(The seasonal meal became even heartier...)

1920
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:47,428
(thanks to the visit of the world-renowned star.)

1921
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,552
(Inhaling)

1922
01:26:49,262 --> 01:26:51,991
(How did we make this?)

1923
01:26:51,992 --> 01:26:53,761
(I can't believe it.)

1924
01:26:53,762 --> 01:26:55,831
(It's tasty.)

1925
01:26:55,832 --> 01:26:57,532
(However, )

1926
01:26:58,002 --> 01:26:59,531
(the cost of a big meal...)

1927
01:26:59,532 --> 01:27:01,602
(is the endless dishwashing.)

1928
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:05,102
(Jung Jae, please wash this as well!)

1929
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:06,571
(Despite inviting a guest, )

1930
01:27:06,572 --> 01:27:08,612
(you won't buy a cup of coffee!)

1931
01:27:09,742 --> 01:27:11,111
(Will he be able...)

1932
01:27:11,112 --> 01:27:15,112
(to survive the netherworld?)
