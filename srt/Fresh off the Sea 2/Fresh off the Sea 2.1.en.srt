1
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:31,753
(Winter)

2
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,814
(The time when all living things withdraw momentarily)

3
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,723
(Despite the freezing cold, )

4
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:39,654
(there is one place that doesn't take a break.)

5
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:45,934
(Sea)

6
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,233
(Until the seasonal food items from the sea...)

7
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,744
(reach our table)

8
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:58,443
(Winter and spring)

9
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:01,684
(Let's delve into the story.)

10
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,253
(A new family member who will spend the second season together)

11
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:06,284
Hello.

12
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,794
(Awkward)

13
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,824
(She seems to be a bit nervous.)

14
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:18,734
(She's the leading actress in "The Tale of Lady Ok.")

15
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:25,674
(With her charisma, she became the character of her life.)

16
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:29,174
(The third sibling of Jung Ah's family is here.)

17
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,013
Today, you'll meet the female members only.

18
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,014
Yes. I heard that in advance.

19
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,014
(She'll meet the female members before meeting the youngest one.)

20
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:35,014
- Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:37,214
My goodness. Hello.

22
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,053
- Hello.
- Gosh, Im Ji Yeon.

23
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:41,223
(Park Jun Myun, second sibling)

24
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:43,224
You're looking beautiful.

25
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:45,523
I put on makeup.

26
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:46,524
(I put on makeup for the first meeting.)

27
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:49,664
I rarely get to look like this, so I put on makeup.

28
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,393
I enjoyed Fresh off the Sea since I was a fan.

29
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,363
Fresh off the Sea? I see.

30
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,964
You were so lovely on the show.

31
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,604
- Did you watch all of it?
- Of course.

32
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,403
You were so beautiful in Season One.

33
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:03,844
Don't be ridiculous. I was bloated all the time.

34
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,374
I only ate and slept.

35
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,644
(Let's see.)

36
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,943
- You're a bit shy, right?
- I'm so shy.

37
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,414
I have no shyness whatsoever.

38
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,753
- Is that so?
- I don't get shy.

39
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,154
Then what's this pose?

40
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:17,723
- It's an affectionate pose.
- Isn't that...

41
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:18,893
Isn't that the pose of a shy person?

42
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,154
I'm only looking at you.

43
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:21,594
- She's only looking at you.
- Her body is turned toward you.

44
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,334
- I see. Is that so?
- My body is turned toward you.

45
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:26,694
- I don't get shy.
- I see.

46
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,633
Upon hearing the news of Ji Yeon joining the show,

47
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,734
- I looked up everything.
- Really?

48
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,673
How do you eat with so much gusto?

49
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:36,203
- I enjoy eating.
- You eat with so much gusto.

50
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,243
It's well-known that you eat with so much gusto.

51
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:39,244
I eat a lot.

52
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,473
(Ji Yeon's appetite is well-known.)

53
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,244
I'm the one who eats a lot.

54
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,813
Gosh, it's my character.

55
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,583
I eat a lot too.

56
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,754
It'll be beyond your expectations.

57
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:52,724
You eat that much?

58
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,494
At most, how many bowls of rice do you eat?

59
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:57,364
Shall I be honest?

60
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:01,404
Big eaters don't count such things.

61
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:03,963
(Gulping)

62
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:08,174
I've never checked exactly how much I could eat.

63
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:10,474
(Let's see how much passion the big eater, Ji Yeon has.)

64
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:14,214
When in university, I became obsessed with ramen.

65
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,514
I worked part-time...

66
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,543
- at a ramen place...
- Really?

67
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,684
Because I wanted to eat it.

68
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,414
Then I became obsessed with burgers...

69
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,224
- and worked at a burger place.
- Really?

70
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,294
Did you work part-time in order to eat?

71
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,154
I worked part-time in order to eat.

72
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,793
Jung Ah is famous for making a big amount of food.

73
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:32,633
I absolutely love it. That was why I wanted to join this show.

74
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:33,634
(That was why she became the third sibling.)

75
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:36,163
Jung Ah, welcome.

76
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:38,174
- Hello, Jung Ah.
- Why are you so colorful today?

77
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,003
- Jung Ah, this is Ji Yeon.
- Ji Yeon.

78
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,243
You're Im Ji Yeon, right?

79
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:42,803
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon are close.)

80
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,474
- Apparently, she's a big eater.
- Yes.

81
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,143
Use a casual tone with Ji Yeon.

82
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,284
- That'll put Ji Yeon at ease.
- Yes. I'll call you "Big Sister."

83
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:49,943
Then I'll use a casual tone with you.

84
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:50,954
- Of course.
- Ji Yeon.

85
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:55,054
I might seem more like a brother than Jae Wook.

86
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,683
- Really?
- I think it'll be like that.

87
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:57,693
Yes.

88
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,554
(While Jun Myun and Ji Yeon become a bit closer)

89
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,364
- It looks delicious.
- Really?

90
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,923
Try the potato dish. It's tasty.

91
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:04,834
- It looks delicious.
- Long-arm octopus.

92
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:08,703
- It's so tasty.
- How should I eat it?

93
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,734
(It's tasty.)

94
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,834
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

95
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:12,233
(Her chopsticks...)

96
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,673
(don't stop...)

97
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,244
(moving.)

98
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,243
(Happy)

99
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,414
I picked out the presents.

100
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:23,914
It was so hard.

101
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,953
To be honest...

102
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,023
I love it, Ji Yeon.

103
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,024
(She falls for Ji Yeon, the big eater.)

104
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,224
She's still eating.

105
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,793
She doesn't disappoint. Ji Yeon is the best.

106
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,663
Even I put down my spoon.

107
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,394
(The woman who cooks a lot is highly satisfied.)

108
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:40,494
How does it feel to film the show with a new member?

109
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,263
How does it feel?

110
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,434
Did it seem like an interview?

111
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,734
I'm curious.

112
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,274
There's a lot of excitement for a new chemistry.

113
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,144
There's a lot of excitement. Yes.

114
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,574
I don't know much about variety shows.

115
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:56,443
As you film, do you get a sense that something will be funny?

116
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:57,653
Of course, I do.

117
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:58,853
(Of course, I do.)

118
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,054
(That's incredible.)

119
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:03,083
Do you also get a sense that something will be boring?

120
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,723
Do you think, "What on earth are they doing?"

121
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:05,794
Do you get angry as well?

122
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:07,764
- I mean...
- I don't know about that...

123
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:09,764
because everything I do comes out well.

124
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,734
It's true. Jung Ah, you haven't failed in anything.

125
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,033
- She doesn't disappoint.
- I'm not exaggerating. It's true.

126
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,134
(Jung Ah doesn't disappoint.)

127
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,403
How did you come up with the idea of Fresh off the Sea?

128
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,143
Don't senior citizens have a different vibe in each region?

129
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:26,373
What was the toughest one?

130
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,713
What do you like?

131
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:28,883
There isn't enough time, right?

132
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:30,744
Is there something I shouldn't do?

133
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,984
I'm so curious about which errands I'll get.

134
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:38,894
I can't cook, but I'm good at doing miscellaneous things.

135
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,494
I hope Jae Wook is the diligent type.

136
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,464
- Jae Wook seems to be attentive.
- I know.

137
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,534
- He's affectionate, right?
- He's affectionate.

138
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,934
- What is it?
- He's very polite.

139
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,474
He pays attention to grammar and spacing.

140
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,044
- He's the neat type.
- Yes.

141
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:58,913
- I watched the show he starred in.
- That's right.

142
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:02,514
He's funny. He has boyish charms.

143
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,853
He does cute things.

144
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,253
Have you listened to him sing?

145
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,413
- Does he sing?
- Is he a good singer?

146
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:08,583
He's an incredible singer.

147
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:09,753
Really? Where did he sing?

148
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:13,493
He has performed with ZICO.

149
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:14,594
And...

150
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:16,023
Jung Ah, you know everything.

151
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:17,894
You're like the CEO of his agency.

152
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,263
Seriously.

153
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,493
All right.

154
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,664
(They gathered around once more on a different date.)

155
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:25,934
The thought of meeting Lee Jae Wook makes me excited.

156
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:29,174
(Wiki Jung Ah is nervous as well.)

157
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:34,113
You look so lovely when you're nervous.

158
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:35,114
(She finds it cute that they're nervous.)

159
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:36,543
- Is it obvious?
- Yes.

160
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:37,813
- You guys...
- Does it show?

161
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,153
(Relax, Jun Myun.)

162
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:40,514
Is that so?

163
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:44,084
(The youngest one is finally here.)

164
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,064
(Looking cool in a long coat, the youngest one enters.)

165
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,235
(Broad shoulders)

166
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,205
(Are they here?)

167
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,834
- He's here.
- Hello.

168
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,635
- Hello.
- My goodness.

169
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,775
- Hello.
- Jae Wook, hello.

170
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,944
Hello.

171
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,415
(He enters with an amicable smile.)

172
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,645
(The proportions catch your eyes even when he's standing still.)

173
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,515
(The textbook example of the perfect friend's fashion)

174
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,724
(He can pull off everything from action to romance.)

175
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:12,324
(The global actor whose popularity is at its height, )

176
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,325
(Lee Jae Wook)

177
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,795
(Let's go and join Fresh off the Sea.)

178
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,195
(Staring)

179
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,794
Have you had a meal?

180
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,065
No. We'll have it now.

181
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,634
Food will be served since you're here now.

182
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,204
(The first meeting is too hard.)

183
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,005
- Is it your first time meeting him?
- Yes.

184
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,944
But he seems familiar since I looked him up so much.

185
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,815
(She feels like she already knows him.)

186
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,015
We gathered around and watched a video of you singing.

187
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,515
- We watched it together.
- You're a good singer.

188
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:41,555
You have a great voice.

189
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,155
- Thank you.
- Ji Yeon is...

190
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,224
(The older members like him.)

191
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,094
- All right.
- Let's drink a little bit.

192
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,495
(Clinking the glasses)

193
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,134
(The first meeting should come with a glass of alcohol.)

194
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,264
It's nice.

195
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,235
My goodness, look at this.

196
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,505
- It looks so tasty.
- It looks so tasty.

197
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,905
Amberjack is really tasty these days.

198
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,245
(Winter is the season of amberjack.)

199
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,314
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

200
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,684
Make a wrap.

201
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,685
(I'll give amberjack a try.)

202
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,955
(In that case)

203
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:13,614
Dip it in oil.

204
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:14,655
(He had picked up a piece of amberjack for himself.)

205
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,525
(He puts it on dried laver.)

206
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,624
(He adds radish sprouts...)

207
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,755
(and wasabi.)

208
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,294
(He dips it in oil.)

209
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:25,035
(Jung Ah, here you go.)

210
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,935
(My goodness)

211
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:28,305
(Eating)

212
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:30,605
(Look at the way he acts.)

213
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,874
It's tasty. Amberjack is tasty.

214
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,935
(Amberjack from Jae Wook is tasty.)

215
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,575
- It really tastes like tuna.
- Yes, they're quite similar.

216
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,414
- I see.
- It's tastier than tuna.

217
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,345
(Meanwhile, Jae Wook)

218
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,115
(This is for Jun Myun.)

219
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,655
(Shy)

220
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,455
Gosh, Jun Myun. It's okay.

221
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:54,925
(I'm melting.)

222
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:56,895
(Proud)

223
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,964
(Ji Yeon has a bite as well.)

224
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:01,335
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

225
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,734
Hurry up and eat. Why aren't you eating?

226
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,235
I think I need to drink a bit more.

227
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,775
He's nervous.

228
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,005
(His ears are red.)

229
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,214
(Glancing over)

230
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:13,675
(Peek-a-boo)

231
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,185
- Am I staring too much?
- No, Jung Ah.

232
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:18,655
(Jae Wook doesn't know what to do.)

233
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,185
(He cuts the octopus into bite-sized pieces.)

234
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,124
(He puts it in front of all the members.)

235
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,295
- This one? The skin...
- No, the crispy one.

236
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,994
(Afterward, )

237
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:31,534
(he takes a bite.)

238
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,634
- It's tough.
- I bet he's a good worker.

239
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,764
- That's my guess as well.
- Really?

240
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,935
I bet he's a better worker than me.

241
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,934
I've worked part-time, so...

242
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:41,344
- Part-time?
- Convenience store, Internet cafe,

243
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,044
pool hall, car wash...

244
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,244
I worked as a server at a wedding venue...

245
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,414
and a parking assistant.

246
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,784
I also worked at a fast food restaurant.

247
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:50,014
I helped the ladies in the kitchen...

248
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,785
when they were making side dishes.

249
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:53,054
(He's impressive.)

250
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,225
- He's trustworthy.
- He's a talented man.

251
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,425
I enjoy cooking for myself.

252
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,455
I don't think I get seasick.

253
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,565
I love driving.

254
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:04,125
- Can you build a fire well?
- Of course.

255
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:05,694
Can you touch fish?

256
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,195
I have confidence in such matters.

257
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,964
Do you know how to slice sashimi?

258
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,364
No. Shall I learn?

259
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:11,705
Really? Will you learn?

260
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,334
You're perfect.

261
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,345
(What does this perfect man want to do on the show?)

262
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,874
I want to be cherished by the seniors.

263
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,914
(I want to be cherished by the seniors.)

264
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:21,344
(The cherished youngest member with many talents is coming soon.)

265
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:23,444
Things will be done faster, right?

266
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:24,714
- Seriously.
- Yes.

267
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,385
We just need Ji Yeon to build a fire quickly.

268
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:27,884
Will Ji Yeon build a fire?

269
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,324
(The third sibling, Ji Yeon will build a fire.)

270
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,395
- The day passes fast, right?
- Yes.

271
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,924
We have a mission.

272
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,594
Using the food items we earned...

273
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,764
for our labor,

274
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,094
we make a meal.

275
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,165
(Cook and enjoy delicious seasonal food.)

276
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,035
We'll struggle so much.

277
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,974
- There's a lot of work.
- Since it's winter,

278
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:47,134
it won't be easy.

279
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:48,405
- Is that so?
- Yes.

280
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,944
(Winter)

281
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:53,174
Since it's winter, we should go to a ski resort.

282
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,745
- It'll be nice.
- A ski resort.

283
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,314
It'll be fun to go sledding. Right?

284
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,354
We can ride a burlap bag...

285
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,185
- down a snowy slope.
- A burlap bag for rice.

286
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,354
(He's already imagining it.)

287
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,695
A burlap bag for rice.

288
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,964
They're absorbed in their dreams.

289
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,495
We should let them dream.

290
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:14,064
We're infinitely happy. We're infinitely carefree, right?

291
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,104
(Will the carefree juniors' dream come true?)

292
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,465
We're always in a hurry because cooking takes a long time.

293
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,005
Are there tasks you think we'll get?

294
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:22,474
- Oysters.
- "We'll get these tasks."

295
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,505
- I bet we'll work on oysters.
- Oysters?

296
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:28,644
Will we go and catch shrimp?

297
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,615
- Shrimp?
- Isn't it caught in the deep sea?

298
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,985
That's right. I see oysters.

299
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,025
- Cockles.
- Cockles?

300
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:37,184
Will we dig up cockles at Beolgyo?

301
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:38,855
(The menu has the seasonal food items of winter.)

302
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,365
Won't we ride a boat once?

303
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,225
We won't ride a boat just once.

304
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,264
(After all, the title of the show is Fresh off the Sea.)

305
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,164
We have an announcement.

306
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,505
(An announcement?)

307
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:53,034
(It's nerve-racking.)

308
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:55,275
(The time has come.)

309
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,344
It's about the first ingredient...

310
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:59,915
you'll deliver fresh off the sea.

311
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,445
You're eating it right now.

312
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,255
(Is there a seasonal food item we'll deliver?)

313
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,624
(Plump steamed octopus)

314
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,184
(Crispy deep-fried pollack skin)

315
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:12,855
(Assorted sashimi with amberjack, rockfish, and halibut)

316
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:14,054
(Refreshing mulhoe with assorted seafood)

317
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,194
(Savory grilled rock cod)

318
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,664
(Which one could it be?)

319
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:19,665
The ingredient...

320
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,435
won't be revealed right now.

321
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,835
- Take photos.
- But...

322
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:26,935
- Jung Ah.
- Take photos.

323
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:28,174
(Okay, Jung Ah.)

324
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:29,175
Which one will it be?

325
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:30,404
- Anchovies?
- I guess we'll catch octopuses.

326
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,615
I guess we'll catch octopuses.

327
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,414
Take photos, Jae Wook.

328
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,815
- Jung Ah, I'll take them, but...
- We need to take photos.

329
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,144
We need to think about it.

330
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,785
We need to think about it at home.

331
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,285
- Seaweed?
- Seaweed?

332
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,985
Amberjack. Octopus and amberjack.

333
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:46,394
By the time we begin filming,

334
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:47,925
- it won't be the amberjack season.
- Really?

335
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,024
But we'll tell you...

336
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,935
which region you'll visit first.

337
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,635
- Really?
- Really?

338
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,205
- Already? Really?
- What has gotten into you?

339
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,375
- Really?
- Why are you being so nice to us?

340
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:04,745
The first region you'll visit to deliver food is...

341
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,745
- Gangwon Province.
- Gangwon Province.

342
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,314
Gangwon Province.

343
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,654
(Gangwon Province in the middle of winter?)

344
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:15,424
At Gangwon Province,

345
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:18,654
you'll meet us at 4am...

346
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:19,954
at the port.

347
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:21,395
(What?)

348
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,695
What?

349
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:25,435
(4am in the middle of winter in Gangwon Province?)

350
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,435
I wondered why they were being so nice.

351
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:30,865
(I can't believe it.)

352
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,635
- I should go the day before.
- Let's go two days before.

353
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,275
- Why would you do that?
- Two days before.

354
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:37,674
I'll go two days before...

355
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,845
and practice waking up at 4am the day before.

356
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:43,685
Jung Ah, it'll be hard if the trip becomes five days long.

357
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:46,184
I don't know what it'll be, but...

358
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,225
It can't be something we catch while sitting down.

359
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:50,455
I bet we need to use our entire bodies.

360
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,355
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

361
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:56,224
I bet we need to pull up the nets.

362
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,165
- Pull.
- Pull.

363
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,364
I bet fish scales will get all over our bodies.

364
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,264
- I can't believe these punks.
- Gosh, herrings are strong.

365
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,075
- I bet we'll become really dirty.
- Yes.

366
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,345
Gosh.

367
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,345
Nothing is easy in life.

368
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,844
- We can do it.
- Yes!

369
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,174
That's the kind of job we'll get.

370
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:15,844
(They have a hunch...)

371
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:19,584
(the delivery will be like that.)

372
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,255
(The delivery will be like that.)

373
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:23,885
(New season)

374
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,955
It's a big boat, like the one I saw in "Extreme Job."

375
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,195
It's endless.

376
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:31,124
(New location)

377
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,635
(New ingredient)

378
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:39,475
(New job)

379
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,574
It's heavy.

380
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,074
(And)

381
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,544
(New worker)

382
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,415
(Lee Jung Jae)

383
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,715
They're only working hard without saying a word.

384
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:57,054
(Because they're together, )

385
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:01,354
(they're happier.)

386
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:05,364
(Three sisters and a brother)

387
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,565
We should wear long underwear and attach body warmers.

388
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,535
(See you in Gangwon Province.)

389
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,505
(A month later)

390
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,145
Come here.

391
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:17,704
Are you ready?

392
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,045
Jung Ah.

393
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,044
- I slept like a log.
- I know.

394
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,855
- I felt refreshed when I woke up.
- That's good.

395
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,355
It's so windy.

396
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,125
- It's cold.
- It's freezing.

397
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,824
(Feeling like minus 15°C)

398
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,665
I can't believe this. It's so cold.

399
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:37,625
I have a runny nose.

400
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,994
- The sun hasn't risen yet.
- I know. What do we do?

401
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,235
(The boats are still docked.)

402
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,374
(On one side of the port, )

403
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,044
(there is an office with its lights on.)

404
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:51,775
- Is this it?
- I think so.

405
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,784
- Good morning.
- Hey.

406
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,044
(Good morning)

407
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,085
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

408
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,954
(What welcomes them are...)

409
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,155
(vibrant work clothes and...)

410
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,394
(sturdy winter boots.)

411
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,564
What are all these?

412
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:12,665
(Sniffling)

413
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:15,204
I wonder what you're going to ask us to do this time.

414
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,635
(What will you ask us to do?)

415
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,304
They have no idea what's waiting for them.

416
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:22,404
Ji Yeon and Jae Wook said it would be fun.

417
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,344
- They're so excited.
- They kept saying,

418
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:27,275
- "It would be so fun." - "It would be so much fun."

419
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,445
- Hi! Our youngest!
- Hi!

420
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,814
Hello.

421
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,185
(The one who is excited)

422
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,285
Did you sleep well?

423
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,555
I did.

424
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,055
You look like a snowboarder today.

425
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,164
- Everyone told me that.
- Yes, you look like a snowboarder.

426
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,325
- It looks like skiwear.
- Yes, it does.

427
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,495
(Goggles that you can see at a ski resort)

428
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:47,894
Look at your shoes.

429
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:51,305
You're already tall without those heels.

430
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:55,605
(The fishing-core that will hit the fishing industry this season.)

431
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,774
You look good.

432
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,074
(Jae Wook lives or dies by style.)

433
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,144
- You look so cute.
- We did our best...

434
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,545
to wear something cute.

435
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,115
Why are you scanning us?

436
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,044
You promised me not to be harsh on me.

437
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,285
What are you doing?

438
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:08,555
(Over the month, they became closer as they hung out together.)

439
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,884
Jung Ah, why is he so clingy?

440
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:11,925
(Becoming like real siblings)

441
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,165
Why are boys so clingy to me?

442
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,664
What?

443
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,165
Why hasn't Im Ji Yeon come yet?

444
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,534
(Im Ji Yeon is coming.)

445
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:23,865
Where are they?

446
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,575
Oh, they're over there.

447
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,575
(Running)

448
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:32,944
(Laughing)

449
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:34,274
Hello.

450
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,485
- Hi! Ji Yeon.
- Im Ji Yeon is here.

451
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,915
(Laughing)

452
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:40,215
Hi.

453
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:41,455
Good morning.

454
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,425
- Are you feeling good?
- Yes.

455
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:45,295
- She's cute.
- I'm feeling good.

456
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:47,195
Hello.

457
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,164
She looks so happy.

458
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,395
(Everyone gathered at Port Gonghyeonjin.)

459
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:55,305
(He's been waiting for something badly.)

460
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,004
What are we going to catch?

461
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,635
- Should we announce it?
- Yes.

462
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:00,705
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

463
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,274
I think I know what it is.

464
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,474
What's your guess?

465
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:04,575
- Octopus.
- I see.

466
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,544
- Is Gangwon Province known for it?
- Yes.

467
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,714
It is known for its fishing...

468
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:09,844
- of giant Pacific octopuses.
- Octopus?

469
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,015
Are we catching octopus?

470
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,084
I think we'll catch some fish.

471
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:16,585
You can get changed first if you need time to get ready.

472
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:19,095
- No. Just tell us.
- Please just say it.

473
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:23,124
Today, in Goseong, Gangwon Province,

474
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,795
the first seasonal food you will deliver is...

475
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:28,705
It's octopus, right?

476
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:30,964
- What is it?
- Drumrolls.

477
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:34,504
Actually, we don't know what it is.

478
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:35,645
What?

479
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,145
- What?
- What?

480
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,045
We can catch various marine ingredients,

481
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:43,245
so we rely on what the sea provides.

482
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:47,355
- Will it be different every day?
- Yes.

483
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,285
So, do we just get what we catch with a net?

484
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,754
- Move it a little this way.
- Move it.

485
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:55,824
No, let's do it this way. Let's do it slowly once again.

486
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:56,864
Okay.

487
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,394
(Stationary net fishery)

488
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,834
A stationary net fishery is...

489
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,965
a fishing method that uses fixed nets...

490
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:07,035
to capture fish entering the net.

491
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:13,645
(Pulling up the net filled with the caught fish)

492
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:19,354
It never gets boring because we get different things every day.

493
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,885
Each day feels different.

494
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,585
Magister armhook squid.

495
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,224
Codfish.

496
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,725
(Codfish)

497
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:29,625
Halibut.

498
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,964
Herring, flounder, and more.

499
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,264
(Pollack, rock cod, halibut, rockfish, octopus, amberjack)

500
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:38,475
(We could get all of them.)

501
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:42,105
(What will they come back with today?)

502
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,845
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, my gosh.

503
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,044
- What should we do?
- It has never happened before.

504
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,584
We have made numerous guesses.

505
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,084
But no one knows what it is.

506
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:54,655
Does this mean...

507
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,085
that our payroll can be changed?

508
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,694
Yes. If you catch nothing...

509
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,325
Can our daily payroll be changed?

510
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,165
That is what I'm worried about the most.

511
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,234
What should we do if we catch nothing?

512
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:06,464
We can catch a lot.

513
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,235
I'm worried that we might catch too much.

514
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,834
Depending on what you catch today,

515
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,005
- your meals...
- It will determine our menus.

516
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:17,345
How about having blanched octopus if we catch octopus?

517
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,144
- We'll do that.
- Octopus steak?

518
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,175
(Jun Myun is already thinking about the dinner menu.)

519
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,615
We'll discuss it after we catch them.

520
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,415
Our uniforms are so cute.

521
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,554
(Putting on the work clothes for the first time)

522
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,655
Where is mine?

523
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,824
- It's here.
- It looks warm.

524
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:32,955
(Smiling)

525
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:34,395
I'm excited.

526
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,295
You look so excited.

527
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:40,464
I thought you had some good news.

528
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,965
He thought she had some good news.

529
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:45,505
- I've never gone fishing on a boat.
- Of course not.

530
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,974
You keep getting in my way.

531
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,674
(Everything is fun to the new members.)

532
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:50,875
I'm so excited.

533
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:56,285
(She has no idea what's waiting for her.)

534
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:00,485
Jae Wook, should I wear my down jacket?

535
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:03,085
Wait, we forgot to put on body warmers.

536
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,194
Put on body warmers under your clothes.

537
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,155
Put on two under your armpits.

538
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,095
(Feeling like minus 15°C)

539
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,434
- It feels warmest under them.
- Under my armpits?

540
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,595
Yes. Put them there.

541
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,205
(Intimidating waves)

542
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,475
(Putting body warmers on feet)

543
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:21,135
(How do I do this?)

544
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:22,605
It's in the back.

545
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:23,875
Turn around.

546
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,615
Thank you.

547
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,715
(Heading out to fish in the freezing cold)

548
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:36,954
Are you okay?

549
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,254
(The cold wind can't stop their excitement.)

550
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,424
It'll be fun.

551
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,365
(They make Leader Yum smile.)

552
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,465
Are we getting on this boat?

553
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,295
The boat is big.

554
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,375
It's a big boat.

555
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,945
(Grand)

556
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,244
It's like the one...

557
00:21:58,245 --> 00:21:59,875
- I saw in "Extreme Job." - Really?

558
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,785
(Giant landing nets)

559
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:04,914
What do we do?

560
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:07,385
(The largest fishery boat ever in Fresh off the Sea)

561
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:09,884
(Getting well-prepared)

562
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:10,885
That's good.

563
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,625
(Jae Wook strides toward the boat.)

564
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:14,854
Get on.

565
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,925
(Getting on the boat with Jae Wook's assistance)

566
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,965
- Hello.
- Hello.

567
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:20,364
(Captain Yoo Kwang Hee)

568
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:21,965
- Hello.
- Hello.

569
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:23,464
(Am I going to fish?)

570
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,735
It'll be fun.

571
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,074
(Jumping)

572
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,204
It'll be fun.

573
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:30,344
Are you excited, Im Ji Yeon?

574
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:31,445
(She's so excited about fishing.)

575
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,615
(The youngest is also excited.)

576
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,814
- Have you been on a boat like this?
- What?

577
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:36,884
- Is it the first time?
- Yes, it is.

578
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:39,154
- I've never been on such a big one.
- Have you?

579
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,615
- We've never been on a large boat.
- Not like this big.

580
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,184
(Departing at 4:30am)

581
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:45,625
Let's go.

582
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:47,595
I'm nervous.

583
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,325
Aren't you nervous?

584
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:52,365
- Many emotions race in my mind.
- I know, right?

585
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,264
We're doing it on a cold day.

586
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,904
- She's right.
- It's cold.

587
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:57,705
(From summer to winter, the four siblings' second season)

588
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,104
It's cold. It'll be freezing out there.

589
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,675
(Heading to their first fishing)

590
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,915
(After the boat departed)

591
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,045
(Wobbling)

592
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,425
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my gosh.

593
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:22,465
(The waves of the East Sea welcome them.)

594
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:28,235
(Closing her eyes tightly)

595
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:30,505
(No!)

596
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:34,834
The waves are very heavy.

597
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:35,875
(The big boat is also swaying.)

598
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:39,715
(This is not real.)

599
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:49,085
(Having a hard time even before fishing)

600
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:54,455
I feel dizzy.

601
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,864
Jung Ah. Are you okay?

602
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,264
- Are you feeling dizzy?
- Yes, I am.

603
00:23:58,265 --> 00:23:59,965
- I'm also feeling dizzy.
- I feel dizzy.

604
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,164
Are you feeling okay?

605
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,335
Am I? Yes.

606
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:06,175
I really want to fish soon.

607
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:10,504
(The heavy waves aren't the only issue.)

608
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:11,805
It's cold.

609
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:18,245
(They can't even open their eyes in strong winds.)

610
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:24,755
(Feeling like minus 17°C)

611
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:28,194
Sea winds are strong.

612
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:29,725
(Harsh winter in the East Sea)

613
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:31,994
It's freezing. The winds are cold.

614
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:34,064
(It's been 10 minutes since departure.)

615
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:35,605
We're going quite far away, right?

616
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,104
Yes, you're right.

617
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:41,805
(Her face is already flushed from the wind.)

618
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:45,814
- We're going quite far away.
- The waves are so heavy.

619
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:46,815
They are.

620
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:52,315
(They face cold weather and heavy waves.)

621
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:57,425
(The new members are losing their smiles.)

622
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:01,925
(It's been 15 minutes since departure.)

623
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:06,235
(Feeling like minus 20°C)

624
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:10,635
(Becoming speechless in the cold and waves)

625
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:12,335
The water must be freezing.

626
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:18,205
(Sailing on the sea that looks like a dark sheet of ice)

627
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:21,675
(20 minutes have passed.)

628
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:25,345
(Beeping)

629
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:26,615
It seems we have arrived.

630
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,024
- They're getting busy.
- It seems we have arrived.

631
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:32,025
(The crew begins working as soon as they get to the fishery.)

632
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,154
Oh, my.

633
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:35,224
I think it's time to work.

634
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:37,065
(A fierce worksite like a battlefield)

635
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:41,435
(Nervous)

636
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:42,735
Listen.

637
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,304
Don't ever try something risky.

638
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:47,804
Don't move too far away from the boat.

639
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:49,075
(Their safety is Leader Yum's top priority.)

640
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:51,674
You can come over here now.

641
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,715
(Starting working at 4:50am)

642
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:54,215
I need one more person over here.

643
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,445
Please stand here.

644
00:25:57,285 --> 00:25:59,015
Something is coming up.

645
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:00,955
That's a net.

646
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,385
Oh, my gosh. It's cool.

647
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:04,924
It's coming up.

648
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,255
(Rushing to get in a position)

649
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:08,495
Lie down on your belly.

650
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:12,394
It won't be easy to grab it the first time.

651
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,795
(Lying on their bellies, side by side)

652
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:17,505
(Get ready.)

653
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,275
It's time to pull it. Please pull.

654
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:35,625
(On a boat swaying constantly from the waves)

655
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:38,555
(Pulling the net with all their strength)

656
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,295
I'm tired.

657
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:41,825
It seems there is a lot in there.

658
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:47,535
(The net is much heavier than they expected.)

659
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:49,335
(The waves make it feel much heavier.)

660
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:50,865
This isn't easy at all.

661
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,145
(Struggling)

662
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:57,945
(Come on!)

663
00:26:58,145 --> 00:26:59,915
(Pulling the net with all her strength)

664
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:01,615
It's so heavy.

665
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:05,684
There are fish! Oh, my gosh!

666
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:07,054
(Fish are being slowly pulled up.)

667
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:08,055
There are fish!

668
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:10,785
There are a lot of them.

669
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:14,894
There are squids.

670
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:17,364
(Countless squids in the net)

671
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:18,934
- Let's pull it for the last time.
- Yes.

672
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,095
(It's almost done.)

673
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,335
There are squids. Squids!

674
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,875
(The final spurt)

675
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:31,075
(Energy spikes after spotting fish.)

676
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:34,615
(Pulling the giant net all the way up)

677
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:37,584
- There are a lot of squids.
- Squids?

678
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:38,585
(Net pulling is completed.)

679
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,284
(Step 1: Net pulling)

680
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:46,655
(Step 2: Pulling up the fish)

681
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,625
(A big task that requires the use of a crane)

682
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,795
(Nervous)

683
00:27:56,365 --> 00:28:00,705
(Pulling up the net with a crane)

684
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:12,985
(The net is pulled close to the boat.)

685
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:16,485
(The spot that has a lot of fish)

686
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,625
Do I pull it?

687
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:21,655
(Lifting the fish by pulling the inner part of the net)

688
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,965
(Clenching his teeth)

689
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,335
(Pulling it up)

690
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:33,905
(They keep pulling it with heavy breaths.)

691
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,145
Look! There are fish!

692
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,515
(In the net which they worked hard to pull, )

693
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:44,985
(there are countless fish.)

694
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:51,825
(There are all sorts of fish.)

695
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:55,595
(Getting big ones first with a landing net)

696
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,625
Let's get fish now.

697
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:59,294
(Jae Wook is holding a landing net.)

698
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,095
- They're so big.
- Jae Wook! They're so big.

699
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:03,835
(Struggling)

700
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,075
(He got fish!)

701
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,515
(This is cool!)

702
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:16,984
- What is this?
- It's huge.

703
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:17,985
(A big codfish)

704
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:19,855
Jung Ah, we'll have codfish soup today.

705
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:22,955
- This is unbelievable.
- It's amazing.

706
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,584
Where did you hide?

707
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:25,585
Get only the big ones.

708
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:28,754
- It's exciting!
- Pull it. Keep pulling it!

709
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,724
Keep pulling it. Pull it!

710
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,225
(Using all their might)

711
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:34,295
Pull it!

712
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:37,935
(Cheerfully pulling up the net using their lower backs.)

713
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,275
- There are a lot of them.
- There are so many.

714
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,145
This is awesome.

715
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,574
Look at those fish.

716
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:49,315
(Half water and half fish)

717
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:55,685
(They released smaller ones below the size limit. )

718
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:02,294
- Oh, my gosh!
- There are a lot of fish.

719
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:03,725
(Three satisfied sisters)

720
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:06,935
(Jae Wook became the master of a landing net.)

721
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,364
(Getting them up without hesitation)

722
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:09,605
- It's awesome.
- Jae Wook!

723
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,274
Are you only getting this fish?

724
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:15,635
- Yes.
- Only the big ones.

725
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:17,844
Are you only getting the big ones?

726
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:20,415
(Putting the big ones like codfish in here)

727
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:22,945
(Jaw-dropping)

728
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:25,615
There is an octopus.

729
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:28,314
(Octopus?)

730
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,325
- It's an octopus.
- Octopus?

731
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:31,615
There is an octopus.

732
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:34,224
(Octopus?)

733
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,225
- It's an octopus.
- Octopus?

734
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,894
- There is an octopus!
- It's an octopus!

735
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:38,125
Please lift it up together.

736
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:39,795
(The size is huge.)

737
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:41,795
(Screaming)

738
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:44,294
- It's an octopus.
- It's so big.

739
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:45,295
This is huge.

740
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:46,905
(The landing net is bent because of its heavy weight.)

741
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,005
Look. It's big.

742
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:54,645
(Jun Myun can't pull it up alone.)

743
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,345
Oh, my! Pull it!

744
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:01,185
(Here comes the master of a landing net.)

745
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:05,315
(Finally, they pulled it up together.)

746
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,155
- This is crazy.
- It's huge.

747
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:08,854
(I told you we would get an octopus.)

748
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:09,855
We got an octopus.

749
00:31:09,895 --> 00:31:11,255
This is so big.

750
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:12,764
I can't lift it.

751
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,264
(This one startled everyone.)

752
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,264
(The giant Pacific octopus: In season from November to April)

753
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,695
This is really big.

754
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,504
(Jae Wook is lifting this big one.)

755
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,505
Come on.

756
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:23,835
I think we can put it on the floor.

757
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:25,874
Here we go.

758
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:26,875
(Trying to put it in the fishing net bag)

759
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:30,775
This is really strong.

760
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,415
Is it usually this strong?

761
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,915
Yes, it's typically that strong.

762
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:39,085
I put it all in.

763
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:43,095
(It's too heavy to carry, even with both hands.)

764
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,865
(Getting one wild octopus)

765
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:51,165
(Exhausted from battling a giant octopus)

766
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:55,134
(What is that?)

767
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:57,274
I've never seen such a thing.

768
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:59,405
(A giant landing net)

769
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,055
We're experiencing "Extreme Job" now.

770
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:21,824
After we lift and bring them, we pour everything here.

771
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,634
Then, we'll sort them out.

772
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:24,635
- I see.
- Okay.

773
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:25,635
(Sorting them manually by species)

774
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:28,265
(Fish are being poured down.)

775
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:29,305
Oh, my gosh.

776
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,645
(A lot of them)

777
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:36,315
(Making a fuss)

778
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:38,815
(Panicked)

779
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:40,684
We're going to sort the fish now.

780
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:42,655
(Step 3: Sorting the fish)

781
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,925
(After randomly getting fish, )

782
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,495
(they sort them by size and species.)

783
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:57,965
Can we eat this size of fish?

784
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,404
You can see a ruler over there.

785
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,165
We should release those under 35cm.

786
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,545
(They release those under the minimum size limit.)

787
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:09,215
(Here it is.)

788
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,115
- It's big enough.
- Is it? Then, do I put it here?

789
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,844
- Yes.
- No, it should go there.

790
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:14,845
Let's do it slowly once again.

791
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:17,384
- Pick this up?
- You can put the big ones...

792
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:18,654
- in the wooden box.
- Okay.

793
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:19,655
(Starting sorting them out)

794
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:22,185
Come on.

795
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:24,754
- Here.
- Come on.

796
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,295
(The fish keeps slipping out of her hands.)

797
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,265
(Grabbing the fish isn't an easy task for beginners.)

798
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:30,395
Grab it.

799
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,535
Gosh, this is really big.

800
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,764
(Screaming)

801
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:36,775
What do I do?

802
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:41,274
(At the aggressive movements of the fish, )

803
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,474
This one's really big.

804
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:44,214
(the shrieking doesn't stop on the boat.)

805
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:45,315
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

806
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:48,445
(Teary-eyed)

807
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:49,984
(Meanwhile)

808
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:51,115
They're huge.

809
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:56,525
(The youngest is grabbing the fish and getting things done.)

810
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,695
(He's shooting the fish into the boxes.)

811
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,565
Jae Wook's good at this.

812
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,765
(The youngest is working hard, while covered in seawater.)

813
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:10,605
(He can't be discouraged from his first time on a fishing boat.)

814
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:17,015
(A cool fish sorter)

815
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:20,514
(Groaning)

816
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:21,544
(Shrieking)

817
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:24,055
If it's hard for you to grab them by hand, use this.

818
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:25,755
All right.

819
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,355
(They've regained their peace of mind.)

820
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,365
(Once a box is filled with fish)

821
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:37,565
One, two. We'll do it together.

822
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:39,905
Put them in here.

823
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:42,975
(The fish are moved to the fish hold.)

824
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:48,475
(Codfish: In season from December to February)

825
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:53,614
- In this box, instead of codfish, - Yes.

826
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,644
- put fish like herrings.
- Okay.

827
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:56,785
Like these ones.

828
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:59,455
- Over here?
- Do herrings become gwamegi?

829
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:00,925
Yes, that's right.

830
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:04,255
Herrings.

831
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:05,855
- Put it...
- Yes.

832
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:07,964
(The four siblings are getting used to sorting the fish.)

833
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:09,435
This is a small one.

834
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,164
This one's out.

835
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:13,604
(At 6am, they've been working for 1 hour and 10 minutes.)

836
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:14,605
This one's out.

837
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,805
(But...)

838
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:25,115
(the youngest has gone pale in the face.)

839
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:27,544
I suddenly feel very seasick.

840
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:28,745
(What?)

841
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:30,484
Are you okay? Do you feel dizzy?

842
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:31,684
Out of the blue.

843
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:33,354
You must have used too much strength.

844
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,525
Sit down.

845
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:39,125
(On the constantly swaying boat, )

846
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:44,295
(he must have pushed himself too hard to do more than his share.)

847
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,304
The big one.

848
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:48,535
(But he soon gets back up and continues working.)

849
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:49,675
Goodness.

850
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:52,434
- You got this?
- Yes.

851
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,644
One, two, three.

852
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:55,175
(He's worried about Ji Yeon when he's the one who's seasick.)

853
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:03,284
This is a small one.

854
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,015
(The youngest tries to endure the feeling of nausea.)

855
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,554
Sit down.

856
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:08,824
(But)

857
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,155
(Concerned)

858
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:13,895
(The seasickness hit him.)

859
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,365
(Our poor youngest sibling)

860
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,935
(Is Jae Wook okay?)

861
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:24,435
(Not even the strongest man can win against seasickness.)

862
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:25,904
Gosh, it's huge.

863
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:27,245
(In a daze)

864
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:28,545
Gosh, this is ginormous.

865
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:30,545
Here, behind this.

866
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:33,814
(Jae Wook, I got this. You just relax.)

867
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,045
This is a huge one.

868
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:36,855
That is huge.

869
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,225
Things like jellyfish...

870
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,925
and dead fish go in there.

871
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,594
- Jung Ah, put jellyfish in here.
- These ones?

872
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:47,625
Yes, that's right. And dead fish too.

873
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:52,865
(He finally lies down.)

874
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,535
(I don't think I get seasick.)

875
00:36:56,235 --> 00:37:00,405
(Sisters, I think this is it for me.)

876
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,914
(Gosh)

877
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:07,215
(Shaking his head)

878
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:09,614
(The three sisters now have to cover for the youngest too.)

879
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:10,715
Out you go.

880
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:14,985
Dead fish go here.

881
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:16,955
- Dead fish go here?
- And jellyfish too. Yes.

882
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:27,405
(The fish hold is being filled with fish.)

883
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,475
(They're now quite used to the work.)

884
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:33,375
What's this?

885
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,244
Monkfish. Put it in here.

886
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:36,714
- Monkfish?
- Yes.

887
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,245
Watch your hands. Be careful of its mouth.

888
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:39,685
(Gasp)

889
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:43,154
- That's a monkfish?
- Yes, a monkfish.

890
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:44,214
(This is the first time they're seeing a live monkfish.)

891
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:47,054
- Look at its mouth.
- This is so cool.

892
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:48,985
(I want to see it too.)

893
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,195
Gosh. A squid.

894
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,024
We got a squid.

895
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,065
(Ji Yeon is excited.)

896
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:04,404
Ji Yeon, you all right? Do you feel nauseous?

897
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:06,245
(Yes.)

898
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:11,014
(Ji Yeon is seasick too.)

899
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:14,045
(Meanwhile, the youngest has been recovering from his seasickness.)

900
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,814
(He fights the nausea and rejoins the rest of the siblings.)

901
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:24,825
(It's as if they're passing the seasickness like a baton.)

902
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:26,225
Are you okay?

903
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,225
(Nodding)

904
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,695
Where's Ji Yeon?

905
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,495
- She's feeling seasick.
- She's seasick.

906
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:35,365
(Now Ji Yeon is battling against nausea.)

907
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:38,804
I think we can throw out the rest.

908
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:39,845
(They're almost done sorting through the 1st round of fish.)

909
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,645
- Gosh.
- Up.

910
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:43,774
(There's one more round left.)

911
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:45,044
Can you reach it? Can everyone reach it?

912
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:46,045
Yes.

913
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:51,015
(The boat is still rocking.)

914
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:54,384
I suddenly feel dizzy.

915
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:55,955
(Now Leader Yum isn't in good shape either.)

916
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,455
I'm feeling it again.

917
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,064
Here. Stare at the horizon...

918
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:02,564
- and you'll feel a bit better.
- Okay.

919
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:03,994
(A fisherman's tip: Staring at the horizon helps with nausea.)

920
00:39:03,995 --> 00:39:06,135
(Crawling)

921
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,405
(Jung Ah and Jae Wook attempt to beat the seasickness.)

922
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:13,675
(Let me join you.)

923
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,244
(With the cold and nausea, )

924
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:18,545
(working on the winter sea is tougher than they expected.)

925
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,415
(Their faces have gone pale...)

926
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:25,355
(with their cheeks red from the sharp wind.)

927
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:30,625
Hey.

928
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:33,565
(Ji Yeon is trying to communicate with the seagulls.)

929
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:36,265
(She's relieving her seasickness through the birds.)

930
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:39,395
(Smiling)

931
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,865
(Jung Ah is losing her grip because of nausea.)

932
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:44,304
The sun is rising.

933
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:46,105
(At 6:30am, they've been working for 1 hour and 40 minutes.)

934
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:47,844
That's amazing.

935
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,215
(The warm light from the sun is slowly coming up.)

936
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:53,345
(I can do this!)

937
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:56,215
Are you okay?

938
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:58,515
I'm okay.

939
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:02,995
(Jung Ah tries to pull herself together.)

940
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:05,725
It's coming.

941
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:07,894
It's coming.

942
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:10,264
(Get ready for the 2nd drop.)

943
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:11,434
Here it comes.

944
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:13,205
(In a daze, they prepare themselves to work.)

945
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,965
(Jae Wook gets up too.)

946
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,074
(Mouth gaping in shock)

947
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,874
Let's keep it up!

948
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:26,945
- Okay.
- Okay.

949
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:29,545
If you keep moving and working, you won't feel nauseous.

950
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,584
Take this, please.

951
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:34,725
(But I do feel nauseous.)

952
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:36,894
(Falling to the floor)

953
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,455
(Getting back up)

954
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:41,164
(Falling to the floor again)

955
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,495
(Getting back up again)

956
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:45,765
(Jae Wook uses all his might to beat his seasickness.)

957
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,304
One, two.

958
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:50,305
(They keep emptying the baskets without taking a break.)

959
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,474
- Gosh, these fish.
- Goodness, the herrings are strong.

960
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:56,714
(When the fish fight back)

961
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,545
Gosh, why are you moving around so much? Stay still!

962
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,015
(Jung Ah scolds them.)

963
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:03,085
- Hey, stay still!
- This is huge.

964
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:05,384
(Gosh!)

965
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:06,524
(Smiling proudly)

966
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,285
- All right. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

967
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:15,695
(They're now grabbing the fish with just their hands.)

968
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:19,565
Who would have thought I'd be this good at grabbing fish?

969
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:22,605
- We have to, though.
- Right, we have to.

970
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:26,404
I just feel so weird.

971
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:28,045
(They're experiencing growth without realizing it.)

972
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:30,175
Gosh, this one's really fast.

973
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:33,344
Gosh, this is...

974
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:36,044
(The fish she's talking about is a halibut.)

975
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:37,414
- A halibut.
- Gosh, a halibut.

976
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,514
(Jae Wook's face is so pale.)

977
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:39,654
- Gosh, a halibut.
- Put the halibut over here.

978
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:40,955
One halibut.

979
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:44,594
(They keep sorting the fish without a break.)

980
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:46,465
Wait, you don't belong here.

981
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:48,625
You should be over there.

982
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:50,734
(The piles of fish...)

983
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:51,835
Halibut.

984
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:54,165
(are now gone.)

985
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,204
(Into the fish hold they go.)

986
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:59,475
(Into the fish hold they go once again.)

987
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:02,205
- We're going to set free the rest.
- Okay.

988
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:04,044
We'll move them over there and throw them out.

989
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:06,244
(Exhausted)

990
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:08,585
We're throwing out the jellyfish and letting the small codfish go.

991
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:12,115
(They have completed one fishing ground.)

992
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:15,225
(Now, on to the next one.)

993
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:20,065
Gosh, they're coming with us.

994
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:27,764
(After handling fish for over two hours, )

995
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,205
The sun is up already.

996
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,635
(they finally get to look around and take in the view.)

997
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,244
This will be the final net of the day.

998
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:36,744
- Okay.
- Let's keep it up!

999
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:37,945
- Okay!
- Thank you.

1000
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:40,615
(Someone is puking!)

1001
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,254
(Retching)

1002
00:42:45,255 --> 00:42:47,124
Gosh, Jae Wook's seasickness is so bad.

1003
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,154
(His nausea is getting worse.)

1004
00:42:48,155 --> 00:42:49,655
Those two are going through it right now.

1005
00:42:50,855 --> 00:42:55,124
(In the endless swells of the East Sea, )

1006
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,494
(Ji Yeon, Jae Wook)

1007
00:42:56,495 --> 00:43:00,405
(the two newbies have succumbed to nausea.)

1008
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:04,175
Since it's winter, we could go skiing.

1009
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,004
Sledding could be fun too.

1010
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:08,205
(The two young people are pained by the gap between dream and reality.)

1011
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,175
(Lee Jae Puke, actor)

1012
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:14,585
(Im Ji Nauseous, actor)

1013
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:16,815
Goodness, our youngest siblings are struggling.

1014
00:43:17,715 --> 00:43:20,885
Gosh, Jung Ah. How will we eat this codfish?

1015
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,125
What should we make with it? Codfish soup?

1016
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:25,595
- Gosh, they're so big.
- I know.

1017
00:43:25,995 --> 00:43:28,325
I can't even hold them.

1018
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:32,135
This is amazing. The fishes...

1019
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,464
Time flew by so quickly that the sun's rising.

1020
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:36,834
Right. The sun's up.

1021
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:38,274
Yes, it's up.

1022
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:40,505
(The sun rose on the East Sea as they were working.)

1023
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,514
The sea feels different from how it does in the summer.

1024
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:44,645
- Totally.
- Yes.

1025
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:48,584
It feels vigorous.

1026
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,455
(It feels vigorous.)

1027
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:56,025
(The two older sisters take a mental picture of the sunrise.)

1028
00:43:56,895 --> 00:44:00,965
(Meanwhile, the last net of the day is being pulled up to the surface.)

1029
00:44:01,295 --> 00:44:02,764
Let's go.

1030
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,095
(Let's go, sister!)

1031
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:05,494
Let's pull it up!

1032
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:06,635
(You got this, Lee Jae Puke!)

1033
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,474
All right.

1034
00:44:14,475 --> 00:44:18,515
(Despite their seasickness, they use all their might to pull.)

1035
00:44:22,115 --> 00:44:24,855
(In fact, Leader Yum...)

1036
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:27,725
(is also struggling just like the rest of them.)

1037
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:30,925
(And the youngest can't even stand up properly.)

1038
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,995
- Let's pull.
- Okay.

1039
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:37,895
(But their bodies move automatically at the captain's signal.)

1040
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:47,404
(The last net of the day...)

1041
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:50,545
(is finally above the water.)

1042
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,875
This one caught squids.

1043
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:57,985
(From the net crowded with fish, )

1044
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:02,725
(they scoop out magister armhook squids.)

1045
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:09,225
(Working tirelessly)

1046
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:16,135
(Groaning)

1047
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,375
(Even though they're nauseous from seasickness, )

1048
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:26,785
(they're still diligently doing their jobs with the landing nets.)

1049
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:31,985
We have to let go of the small ones.

1050
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:33,355
Let go of everything except for the squids.

1051
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,605
(Once they're done scooping out the squids with the landing nets, )

1052
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:53,035
(it's time to sort out the fish again.)

1053
00:45:54,975 --> 00:45:57,274
(At 7:30am, they've been working for 2 hours and 40 minutes.)

1054
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:59,115
(Jae Wook is puking.)

1055
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:00,884
Are you okay? Gosh.

1056
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:02,545
(His seasickness is still going strong.)

1057
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:07,685
(But the youngest is enduring it, not wanting to burden the others.)

1058
00:46:08,025 --> 00:46:12,425
(Ji Yeon pulls herself together too.)

1059
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,295
(Once again, the container is filled to the rim with fish.)

1060
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:19,194
(No matter how much they see it, they're still in awe.)

1061
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:20,405
Here we go again.

1062
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:24,074
- Usually, none of our nets...
- Yes.

1063
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:26,004
- get any octopus.
- I see.

1064
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:28,645
But I guess you have good luck with fish.

1065
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,944
- We got an octopus today.
- Really?

1066
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:33,615
Gosh. We're flattered.

1067
00:46:34,245 --> 00:46:36,644
It's not every day we're able to see live octopus.

1068
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:37,855
A huge octopus.

1069
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:42,684
(On the sea that keeps giving, )

1070
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:47,265
(the four siblings work diligently.)

1071
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,465
- I need one of you to move this.
- Okay.

1072
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:54,535
One, two, three.

1073
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:08,645
(Silent)

1074
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,154
We're getting more and more quiet.

1075
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:14,485
(They're speechless.)

1076
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,784
Because we all feel dizzy.

1077
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:18,395
(Her cheeks are red from the cold wind.)

1078
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:24,835
(The only sound that can be heard is flopping fish.)

1079
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:30,875
(At 7:30am, they've been working for 2 hours and 40 minutes.)

1080
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,475
(Their bodies are getting stiff...)

1081
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:39,274
(and their dizziness and nausea are only getting worse.)

1082
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:40,485
This is insane.

1083
00:47:41,245 --> 00:47:43,785
(Jae Wook is stepping away for the 15th time.)

1084
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,355
(He's seasick for the first time, so he keeps zoning out.)

1085
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:51,595
Gosh, look at them.

1086
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:53,564
(But looking at the flopping fish boosts his energy.)

1087
00:47:53,565 --> 00:47:54,625
You brat.

1088
00:47:55,195 --> 00:47:56,835
Don't put squids here.

1089
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:58,895
Squids belong over there.

1090
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:01,105
- Let's empty this one.
- Okay.

1091
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,634
It's really strong.

1092
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:06,175
(They're now able to work on their own without instructions.)

1093
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,145
We're almost done.

1094
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:11,515
We're almost done.

1095
00:48:19,955 --> 00:48:21,585
Let's head back to shore.

1096
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,895
- Thank you for your hard work.
- It was nothing.

1097
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:28,695
Let's put the codfish you sorted out into the fish hold.

1098
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:30,195
The codfish you sorted out.

1099
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:36,434
- Oh, dear.
- Wait just a second.

1100
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,205
(The fish hold is about to overflow.)

1101
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:42,175
(The seagulls gather, hoping to steal a fish.)

1102
00:48:42,475 --> 00:48:45,975
(It's peaceful on the boat. Not even the engine can be heard.)

1103
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:51,385
(Now that the work is finished, Jae Wook feels nauseous again.)

1104
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:54,084
- Jung Ah.
- Yes?

1105
00:48:54,085 --> 00:48:55,984
(Clearing his throat)

1106
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:57,955
I don't think I'll be hungry for food.

1107
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,365
You're all out of energy, right?

1108
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:03,195
See? I told you.

1109
00:49:04,465 --> 00:49:05,694
(Let's head back to shore.)

1110
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,205
I'm so exhausted.

1111
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:11,935
Working at a fishery is no joke.

1112
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:13,905
Jae Wook was...

1113
00:49:14,045 --> 00:49:15,875
excited about dressing up for work.

1114
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:17,045
But now, he's...

1115
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,644
I was delusional.

1116
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,615
(Sighing)

1117
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:23,754
(We really were clueless.)

1118
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:24,884
Are you cold?

1119
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:26,855
(We really were clueless.)

1120
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:31,254
(But no matter how experienced they get, )

1121
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:32,955
(physical labor never fails to exhaust them.)

1122
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,765
- We caught a lot, right?
- We did.

1123
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,794
(They're finally back at the port.)

1124
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:41,105
- We're here!
- We're here.

1125
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,505
It's land.

1126
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:47,304
We're back.

1127
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:48,305
(Emotional)

1128
00:49:53,445 --> 00:49:56,785
(They step down to the ground for the 1st time in 4 hours.)

1129
00:49:57,815 --> 00:49:59,584
One, two. There you go.

1130
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:02,685
(Their first fishery operation comes to a close.)

1131
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:07,565
(The four siblings caught a variety of fishes.)

1132
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:11,165
(From magister armhook squids, a Gangwon Province specialty, )

1133
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:14,205
(to a giant Pacific octopus)

1134
00:50:17,005 --> 00:50:19,004
(Herring)

1135
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,904
(Codfish)

1136
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:22,804
(Monkfish, trout)

1137
00:50:22,805 --> 00:50:24,814
(Lumpsucker, halibut)

1138
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:26,375
(And rockfish)

1139
00:50:27,015 --> 00:50:30,415
(The sea's generous gift to humans)

1140
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:35,355
(We now wait for it to be delivered to our table.)

1141
00:50:35,555 --> 00:50:38,655
(What awaits the four siblings after their hard work is...)

1142
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:39,995
(Gosh)

1143
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,695
(Snack time)

1144
00:50:43,895 --> 00:50:45,564
- It's fish cake!
- Fish cake.

1145
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:46,635
(Guys, it's fish cake!)

1146
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,204
It's fish cake!

1147
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:49,365
(It's fish cake!)

1148
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,105
(Today, they eat their snack while watching the sunrise.)

1149
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:54,374
(The top winter snacks, fish cake skewers...)

1150
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,745
(and multteok)

1151
00:50:56,945 --> 00:50:59,715
This is about to be the best fish cake in the world.

1152
00:51:00,545 --> 00:51:02,544
(There's even hot soup to warm their frozen bodies.)

1153
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:03,755
This looks so good.

1154
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:06,555
Thank you for the food.

1155
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:08,624
Like this.

1156
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:09,985
(This looks so good.)

1157
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:11,625
We have to drink the soup first.

1158
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:15,195
(Pouring)

1159
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:20,165
(The youngest pours the soup into their cups with his frozen hands.)

1160
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:23,675
(Slurping)

1161
00:51:24,735 --> 00:51:26,235
Gosh, this is nice.

1162
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,044
The soup has a rich flavor.

1163
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,275
(The flavorful soup spreads warmth inside their freezing bodies.)

1164
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:35,045
Fish cake in the cold.

1165
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:40,625
(The hot soup is relieving the cold and nausea.)

1166
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:43,725
(This is great.)

1167
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:46,355
Let's try the fish cake.

1168
00:51:47,225 --> 00:51:48,225
(Blowing)

1169
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:49,264
Shall we?

1170
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:53,335
(Jung Ah takes a huge bite after blowing on it.)

1171
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:56,265
(Chewy)

1172
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,604
(The snacks are finger-licking good for the four siblings...)

1173
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:02,845
(who worked for hours since the crack of dawn.)

1174
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:06,445
(Jae Wook blows on a fish cake too.)

1175
00:52:11,655 --> 00:52:15,385
(It feels like a reward for all their hard work.)

1176
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:19,395
(He finishes it in one bite.)

1177
00:52:19,955 --> 00:52:21,125
(Yum)

1178
00:52:21,795 --> 00:52:23,425
This is really good.

1179
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:28,534
(The multteok's chewy texture makes it a delicacy.)

1180
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:30,804
(Chewy)

1181
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:33,675
(Hearing Jun Myun's words, Ji Yeon takes a bite too.)

1182
00:52:34,645 --> 00:52:36,945
(Eyes wide open)

1183
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:38,275
It's so good.

1184
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:41,145
(What?)

1185
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,414
(Ji Yeon takes another bite, )

1186
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,825
(but it's still very tasty.)

1187
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:49,524
- It's so good.
- That's smart.

1188
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:50,754
(Why is this so tasty?)

1189
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:52,995
(The chewy multteok is stimulating Ji Yeon's appetite.)

1190
00:52:53,095 --> 00:52:54,425
Is your eating show starting?

1191
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:58,995
I threw up all my stomach content on the boat.

1192
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,965
(And so begins her eating show.)

1193
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:07,905
(Ji Yeon is enjoying the snacks.)

1194
00:53:08,005 --> 00:53:10,005
I'll just have one more.

1195
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:15,345
(She puts little thought into it and eats for a long time.)

1196
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:17,955
(Glancing)

1197
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:20,484
(Jae Wook noticed Ji Yeon enjoying the multteok.)

1198
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:21,685
I see you like the tteok.

1199
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:23,555
This tteok is really good.

1200
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:24,725
Is it that good?

1201
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:29,265
(Taking a big chewy bite of multteok after her persuasion)

1202
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:30,835
It's tasty, right?

1203
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:32,064
This is my daily bread.

1204
00:53:32,065 --> 00:53:33,665
(The four siblings fueling up at the fish cake bar)

1205
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:36,205
I look quite messy right now, don't I?

1206
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:39,375
Your face is covered in muddy splashes.

1207
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:41,875
Is that so?

1208
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:45,375
(Before and after work)

1209
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:49,114
(The heavy traces of a long day at sea)

1210
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:50,115
You look cute, though.

1211
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:51,414
(You're the best.)

1212
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:52,415
I mean it.

1213
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,284
This is tougher than it looks.

1214
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:56,285
(A rough welcome to the first fishing duty)

1215
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:59,994
People who work in fisheries are truly amazing.

1216
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:02,124
- Yes, really.
- It really is impressive.

1217
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,934
And when we first started shaking anchovies,

1218
00:54:03,935 --> 00:54:05,235
- I almost cried.
- Exactly.

1219
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:07,734
It is completely different from what it looks like on TV.

1220
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:08,865
- Different?
- Yes.

1221
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,535
It looks like you don't get seasick anymore.

1222
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,744
Oh, my. I did get a bit seasick a while ago.

1223
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:17,345
I felt a bit seasick earlier, but I held it in.

1224
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:18,944
- I had no choice.
- You are amazing.

1225
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,015
She is, indeed.

1226
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,345
I'm experienced.

1227
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:24,255
(This is a real sea experience from Fresh off the Sea.)

1228
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:27,185
It has been a while since I was looked after like that.

1229
00:54:27,325 --> 00:54:29,524
You kept coming over to check on me.

1230
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:30,655
(Leader Yum kept an eye on the youngest at all times.)

1231
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:31,925
What about me?

1232
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:35,325
You kept disappearing. Weren't we struggling together?

1233
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:37,194
When I showed up, you vanished.

1234
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:38,635
When you came, I was gone.

1235
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:40,905
I was like, "Jae Wook, you okay?" And then...

1236
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:43,105
In the group chat, Jae Wook was like...

1237
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:45,234
"Can I show up looking cool?"

1238
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:46,675
"I'm thinking of wearing a coat."

1239
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:48,705
That thought popped into my head and made me laugh.

1240
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,815
(Jae Wook would have frozen out there.)

1241
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:53,375
(The fearless energy of a newbie)

1242
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,145
It was colder than I thought.

1243
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:56,245
- Right?
- Yes.

1244
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:57,414
- Right.
- I knew it.

1245
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:59,384
I expected it to be cold, but it was beyond what I imagined.

1246
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:01,284
At some point, I just gave up wiping my nose.

1247
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,285
Same for me.

1248
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,194
Your snot was frozen.

1249
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:05,994
- It was literally frozen.
- Right.

1250
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:07,265
(They both faced a tough first day at sea.)

1251
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:10,265
(So cute)

1252
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:14,364
Hold on. We need to record this.

1253
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:15,465
(Fumbling around)

1254
00:55:15,665 --> 00:55:17,275
(Photographer Park has returned.)

1255
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:18,734
- Jae Wook.
- Yes.

1256
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:19,804
(Selfie stick duty goes to tall Jae Wook.)

1257
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:21,645
- Ji Yeon, here...
- We are against the light.

1258
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:23,745
- Is it backlit?
- We need to turn around like this.

1259
00:55:24,015 --> 00:55:27,075
(Capturing the first memory of the new season in a picture)

1260
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:28,644
I may be smiling, but I am actually not.

1261
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:30,955
(The 4 siblings and 1st fishing duty in Winter 2025)

1262
00:55:32,555 --> 00:55:34,085
I wonder how much we earned today.

1263
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:38,095
(The eldest's top concern is keeping the siblings fed.)

1264
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:40,665
- You all worked so hard today.
- Yes.

1265
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:42,825
Please take this.

1266
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,095
This looks quite thick.

1267
00:55:45,795 --> 00:55:47,735
This feels so rewarding.

1268
00:55:47,835 --> 00:55:49,964
Gosh, these are all ten-dollar bills.

1269
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:51,475
(A thick envelope full of ten-dollar bills)

1270
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:54,745
(Let's see.)

1271
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:56,645
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1272
00:55:56,845 --> 00:55:58,275
- It looks quite a lot.
- It should be enough, right?

1273
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:00,844
- Twenty of them?
- One, two,

1274
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:03,184
- three, four.
- Three, four,

1275
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:05,184
- five, six, - five, six,

1276
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:07,115
- seven, eight, - seven, eight,

1277
00:56:07,355 --> 00:56:10,025
- nine, ten...
- nine, ten...

1278
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,024
Sixteen, seventeen,

1279
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:13,455
eighteen, nineteen.

1280
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:15,395
No, it is actually 200 dollars.

1281
00:56:15,396 --> 00:56:16,664
Two bills slipped past earlier.

1282
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,635
They slipped by? What happened to my fingers?

1283
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:20,435
- It's...
- Thank you.

1284
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,835
(So proud)

1285
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,574
Thanks for all your hard work in the cold today.

1286
00:56:26,575 --> 00:56:27,575
Thank you.

1287
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:29,474
(A gift from the captain for those who worked since dawn)

1288
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:31,215
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1289
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:33,515
Thank you. Thanks for the gift.

1290
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,044
This feels so rewarding.

1291
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:36,314
(Another emotional moment for him)

1292
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:37,615
- Let's open this.
- Can I open it?

1293
00:56:37,985 --> 00:56:39,184
Let's see what's in there.

1294
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:40,185
(What's inside?)

1295
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:42,984
(Carefully opening the first box!)

1296
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:44,494
- Squid.
- Oh, squid.

1297
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:45,895
- This is squid.
- Gosh.

1298
00:56:46,795 --> 00:56:48,464
Okay, the menu is stir-fried squid.

1299
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:49,465
That sounds good.

1300
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:51,765
- What?
- This is halibut.

1301
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:54,264
- Halibut and rockfish.
- There are halibut and codfish too.

1302
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:55,805
(Triple fish combo from the net)

1303
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,434
I'll make some stir-fried squid and spicy seafood stew.

1304
00:56:58,435 --> 00:56:59,575
That sounds delicious.

1305
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:04,645
(Over the dark midwinter sea of Gwangwon Province)

1306
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:08,085
(Seasonal ingredients hand-harvested by the members...)

1307
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:16,485
(went through an early morning auction.)

1308
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:20,095
(Full of freshness)

1309
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:28,105
(They are all delivered straight across the country.)

1310
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:31,035
I guess we should stop for groceries on the way back.

1311
00:57:31,775 --> 00:57:32,775
(The four siblings are headed to the market.)

1312
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:34,245
The market is just ten minutes away.

1313
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:36,175
- We'll do the shopping there.
- Okay.

1314
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:38,174
(Jae Wook, back to being the stylish young brother)

1315
00:57:38,175 --> 00:57:41,284
The smell is kind of lingering on me now.

1316
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:42,785
- Right? I can smell it on me.
- Yes.

1317
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:45,814
I think that was my first time...

1318
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:46,815
- handling that many fish.
- Yes, first time ever.

1319
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:51,555
By the end, I couldn't even tell if I was touching fish or what.

1320
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:54,395
(I just grabbed whatever I could.)

1321
00:57:55,065 --> 00:57:57,995
But seriously, I have only ever eaten it.

1322
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:00,164
This is really not an easy job.

1323
00:58:00,165 --> 00:58:01,165
That is so true.

1324
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:04,035
And we are making a meal out of what we caught ourselves.

1325
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:07,445
That's a special kind of experience.

1326
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:10,505
I'm excited for what we're eating today.

1327
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:13,644
We have to buy all the ingredients...

1328
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:15,414
- for the stir-fry ourselves, right?
- Yes.

1329
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:17,854
(Digging)

1330
00:58:17,855 --> 00:58:20,455
In case you want some seasoned vegetables...

1331
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:24,194
Do we need to add bean sprouts to the spicy seafood stew?

1332
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:25,755
Yes, bean sprouts and water parsley.

1333
00:58:25,855 --> 00:58:27,294
Bean sprouts, water parsley...

1334
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,595
- Cheongyang pepper.
- Cheongyang pepper.

1335
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:32,535
(Ji Yeon takes charge of today's budget.)

1336
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:34,935
What else do you add to stir-fried squid?

1337
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:36,505
We need to add carrots.

1338
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:38,374
- And...
- And eggs are a must.

1339
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,375
- Right?
- Correct.

1340
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:42,374
- Ground beef.
- Ground beef.

1341
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,674
- Ground pork.
- Okay.

1342
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:45,715
- Tomorrow morning, hamburger...
- Green onions and garlic, too.

1343
00:58:47,145 --> 00:58:48,915
Green onions, garlic...

1344
00:58:49,815 --> 00:58:51,614
We have all the seasonings, right?

1345
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:53,954
There should be gochujang and chili powder.

1346
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:55,955
- Can we buy some drinks?
- Of course.

1347
00:58:56,185 --> 00:58:58,195
(Happy)

1348
00:58:58,295 --> 00:58:59,795
- Can we buy some chips?
- Yes.

1349
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,195
Let's just spend the whole 200 dollars today.

1350
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,365
(All of them?)

1351
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:07,135
How about some jelly then?

1352
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,804
(So funny)

1353
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,375
This is cute. I feel like I am with my little cousin right now.

1354
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:14,174
We can spend money. We're working again tomorrow.

1355
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,405
(Let Ji Yeon do everything she wants.)

1356
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:18,075
(In the middle of making the grocery list)

1357
00:59:18,275 --> 00:59:20,444
- Is it here?
- There is a market next to it.

1358
00:59:20,445 --> 00:59:21,545
Thank you for driving.

1359
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:24,315
(The traditional market the four siblings visited...)

1360
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:28,225
(is filled with fresh vegetables grown in Gangwon Province.)

1361
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:32,155
(A place brimming with tasty local treats)

1362
00:59:33,055 --> 00:59:35,925
(A cozy spot, rich with the scent of everyday life)

1363
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:38,564
(They are headed to the vegetable store first.)

1364
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:40,665
The radish is nice.

1365
00:59:41,135 --> 00:59:43,835
How many radishes do we need? One for the radish salad.

1366
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:46,205
Three more? So four in total?

1367
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:47,604
Yes, four should be enough.

1368
00:59:47,605 --> 00:59:50,204
(Buying 4 radishes)

1369
00:59:50,205 --> 00:59:51,475
(Let's see.)

1370
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:53,615
(Checking off the grocery list)

1371
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,345
(Radishes, check)

1372
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:57,985
Excuse me, do you have scallions?

1373
00:59:58,385 --> 00:59:59,754
Can we have some scallions, please?

1374
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:00,955
(Manager Im on duty)

1375
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:02,225
(Scallion)

1376
01:00:02,955 --> 01:00:03,955
And carrots...

1377
01:00:05,055 --> 01:00:06,055
(Carrots)

1378
01:00:06,655 --> 01:00:07,695
What about onions?

1379
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:10,325
Can I get a tray of eggs, please?

1380
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,494
- Bungeoppang?
- Yes, bungeoppang.

1381
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:13,495
Right.

1382
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:15,164
Let's eat it in the car on the way.

1383
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:16,165
That sounds good.

1384
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:18,175
(Bungeoppang is the go-to-market snack.)

1385
01:00:18,335 --> 01:00:20,535
Excuse me, how much is the bungeoppang?

1386
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:23,045
Two dollars for three, a tray of six for four dollars.

1387
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:26,844
- Can we have 6, please?
- Would you like 6 of them?

1388
01:00:26,845 --> 01:00:28,115
- Four dollars?
- Four dollars.

1389
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:31,184
It's been forever since we saw a bungeoppang stall, right?

1390
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,185
Right.

1391
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:36,225
(Freshly baked bungeoppang on the spot)

1392
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,295
(It hits different when it's in a paper bag.)

1393
01:00:43,095 --> 01:00:44,095
This smells so good.

1394
01:00:44,465 --> 01:00:45,495
Here are six dollars back.

1395
01:00:46,365 --> 01:00:48,764
- Thank you. This is so cheap.
- Thank you.

1396
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:49,804
(Wrapping up the market run with warm bungeoppang in hand)

1397
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:50,905
It smells amazing.

1398
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:53,575
Jae Wook, take this.

1399
01:00:53,935 --> 01:00:55,305
(Sharing the bungeoppang evenly)

1400
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:57,405
- Thank you.
- It tells me to allow all these...

1401
01:00:57,505 --> 01:00:59,244
notifications for messages and all contacts.

1402
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:00,515
(Crunchy)

1403
01:01:01,515 --> 01:01:04,015
(Nothing beats bungeoppang in winter.)

1404
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:08,025
(Ji Yeon starts from the crispy tail.)

1405
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:09,825
(Crunchy)

1406
01:01:11,455 --> 01:01:12,455
(Crispy)

1407
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:13,624
(Bungeoppang ASMR)

1408
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:14,724
(Starting from the top)

1409
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:17,195
(The car is filled with the sound of crisp crunching.)

1410
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:19,095
This is so delicious.

1411
01:01:21,335 --> 01:01:23,335
(Jung Ah takes a bite, too.)

1412
01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:24,605
How is it this crunchy?

1413
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:26,405
- It's really good, right?
- Yes.

1414
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,505
- Crispy outside, moist inside.
- For real.

1415
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:30,875
- Gosh.
- It's so good.

1416
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:33,474
Why is this so crispy?

1417
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:35,615
(Speaking in dialect after one delicious bite)

1418
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,055
(She's so cute.)

1419
01:01:38,455 --> 01:01:40,214
Starting the day early...

1420
01:01:40,215 --> 01:01:44,084
messes with my head a bit.

1421
01:01:44,085 --> 01:01:46,195
Can you believe that it is only 10:30am?

1422
01:01:46,595 --> 01:01:47,894
(Let's see.)

1423
01:01:47,895 --> 01:01:49,164
(DJ Yum, debating the perfect track)

1424
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:50,225
Wait, what did you break?

1425
01:01:52,935 --> 01:01:53,935
Hello?

1426
01:01:55,065 --> 01:01:56,665
Yes, I am with Jae Wook right now.

1427
01:01:57,835 --> 01:01:59,505
You don't know Jae Wook? He's in "Alchemy of Souls."

1428
01:02:00,945 --> 01:02:02,645
(This song is...)

1429
01:02:02,745 --> 01:02:05,875
(his live performance of "Johnny," featuring ZICO.)

1430
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:07,345
Oh, him?

1431
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:08,345
(Him? Is he handsome?)

1432
01:02:08,685 --> 01:02:09,685
- Oh, well.
- Gosh.

1433
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:11,685
Oh, you mean that good-looking guy?

1434
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:14,285
Look, the ocean's in view.

1435
01:02:14,885 --> 01:02:18,255
(Bringing it up for no reason at all)

1436
01:02:18,555 --> 01:02:20,594
(Exciting)

1437
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:21,764
Jae Wook.

1438
01:02:21,765 --> 01:02:23,225
(Jae Wook's part is here.)

1439
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:25,664
(What are you up to right now?)

1440
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:28,004
(Are you sleeping? You're outside?)

1441
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:29,305
Gosh, Jae Wook.

1442
01:02:30,005 --> 01:02:31,475
Jae Wook.

1443
01:02:33,235 --> 01:02:35,304
I mean it. I really love it.

1444
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,305
Gosh, Jae Wook.

1445
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:39,315
(Shy)

1446
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:41,715
The way you pronounce the lyrics...

1447
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:43,915
is quite interesting and unique.

1448
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:45,884
That's embarrassing.

1449
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:47,415
"Because I'm bored."

1450
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:51,555
(Soon enough, they reached a quiet village in Sokcho.)

1451
01:02:51,795 --> 01:02:53,195
There's a place like this in Sokcho?

1452
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:55,465
- These are all hanok.
- Yes.

1453
01:02:56,965 --> 01:03:01,265
(Nestling in the arms of Mount Seorak)

1454
01:03:02,765 --> 01:03:05,775
(This place radiates the serene charm of traditional hanok.)

1455
01:03:06,805 --> 01:03:09,345
(Welcome to Sangdomun Stone Wall Village.)

1456
01:03:10,445 --> 01:03:14,215
(Charming little stones catch the eye at every turn.)

1457
01:03:14,845 --> 01:03:17,715
(A favorite resting spot for the neighborhood cats)

1458
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:20,655
(From warm, timeworn stone walls of the past)

1459
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:24,125
(There is a stone wall with beautiful colors...)

1460
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:28,065
(as well as a stone wall that shows the owner's favorite liquor.)

1461
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:32,995
(The members will stay here for a short while.)

1462
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:35,435
- Let's go.
- Let's get off.

1463
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:38,375
(The four siblings head toward the house they will stay at.)

1464
01:03:38,705 --> 01:03:40,634
- Doesn't it seem like Jeju Island?
- I know.

1465
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:42,805
Who knew such a place existed in Sokcho?

1466
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:46,715
(Pretty stone walls welcome them at the Stone Wall Village.)

1467
01:03:47,815 --> 01:03:48,815
(What?)

1468
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:50,384
- That's the house.
- We're here.

1469
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:52,485
Jung Ah, there are bicycles.

1470
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:55,285
- There are bicycles.
- You're right.

1471
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:57,255
Gosh, look at this.

1472
01:03:58,825 --> 01:04:00,354
(We put up a name plaque so that they'll find the place.)

1473
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:02,324
- It's so pretty.
- It's pretty.

1474
01:04:02,325 --> 01:04:03,424
(Ji Yeon is excited.)

1475
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:04,465
The gate.

1476
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:07,195
- Is that the house?
- Yes.

1477
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:10,064
(The gate opens for the new season of the show.)

1478
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:11,474
Welcome.

1479
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:12,475
(Welcome the Fresh House.)

1480
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:14,275
- How cute.
- It's so pretty.

1481
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:19,614
(At the end of the stone wall lies the Mount Seorak House.)

1482
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:23,685
(The four siblings enter the first house of the show.)

1483
01:04:23,785 --> 01:04:24,954
It's cute.

1484
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:25,955
(The third one is absorbed in the house.)

1485
01:04:26,015 --> 01:04:27,614
I can't believe it. My goodness.

1486
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,124
(Surprised)

1487
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,754
(Jung Ah spots something.)

1488
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:34,095
(She enters the place as if she's bewitched.)

1489
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,925
(Jung Ah is drawn...)

1490
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:39,264
(to the warm greenhouse that'll block...)

1491
01:04:39,265 --> 01:04:40,965
(the cold winds of Gangwon Province.)

1492
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:44,304
Jung Ah, we'll be really warm if we eat in here.

1493
01:04:44,305 --> 01:04:46,005
I think we can eat in here.

1494
01:04:46,035 --> 01:04:47,435
We'll be warm if we eat in here.

1495
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:49,675
It's incredible.

1496
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:52,914
Let's eat the dried radish greens.

1497
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:53,974
(The house is ready for winter.)

1498
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,785
It'll be tasty. Jae Wook.

1499
01:04:58,055 --> 01:05:03,925
(What kind of memories will the four siblings make?)

1500
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:07,355
My goodness.

1501
01:05:09,725 --> 01:05:11,025
How cute.

1502
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:15,065
(Quilted vests are hanging on the wall inside a small room.)

1503
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:17,535
(Jung Ah finds something in the front yard.)

1504
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:21,775
Did you see those slippers? They're so cute.

1505
01:05:22,275 --> 01:05:23,445
Look at them.

1506
01:05:23,805 --> 01:05:26,244
(She shares what's cute.)

1507
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:27,544
- I saw them as soon as I got here.
- Yes.

1508
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:28,685
They have our initials.

1509
01:05:30,785 --> 01:05:32,585
- All of our names start with J.
- We... What?

1510
01:05:32,915 --> 01:05:34,414
- How fascinating.
- All of our names start with J.

1511
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:36,055
(Jung Ah, Jun Myun, Ji Yeon, Jae Wook)

1512
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,824
(The four siblings are full of love.)

1513
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:40,655
(The four siblings unpack and take a short break.)

1514
01:05:42,465 --> 01:05:44,394
(Tired)

1515
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:46,935
I have no energy right now.

1516
01:05:46,995 --> 01:05:49,904
My undereye bags came down to my nose.

1517
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,174
(They can only laugh.)

1518
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:53,805
- Seriously.
- Why do you look so skinny?

1519
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:54,875
- What?
- Seriously.

1520
01:05:55,075 --> 01:05:56,104
(Haggard)

1521
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:57,544
- Hey, why did you...
- You became gaunt...

1522
01:05:57,545 --> 01:05:58,915
- in a single day.
- Weren't you well-built?

1523
01:05:59,945 --> 01:06:01,075
You threw up.

1524
01:06:01,315 --> 01:06:03,484
- You lost all the water.
- This isn't easy.

1525
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:06,015
There's no puffiness whatsoever. He's gaunt.

1526
01:06:07,585 --> 01:06:10,225
Jung Ah, why were we fine today? Why didn't we become seasick?

1527
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,854
- The waves were...
- I wasn't so fine.

1528
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:12,855
She was a bit seasick.

1529
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:15,095
- It just didn't show.
- But I overcame it.

1530
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:17,325
It's thanks to my experience.

1531
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,835
- You're cool.
- My goodness.

1532
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:21,235
You guys were amazing.

1533
01:06:21,405 --> 01:06:23,365
This is why every company wants an experienced worker.

1534
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,675
They don't want a new worker.

1535
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:29,544
Jae Wook and I didn't give up until the very end...

1536
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:31,274
despite all that throwing up.

1537
01:06:31,275 --> 01:06:33,315
- That's right.
- It's tenacity.

1538
01:06:33,415 --> 01:06:34,985
You guys were so cute.

1539
01:06:35,545 --> 01:06:37,414
I lied down with my eyes on the sky.

1540
01:06:37,415 --> 01:06:39,185
But when the crane moved,

1541
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:41,455
- I was like, "Let's go and work." - It was so cute.

1542
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,825
It was like a proper welcoming ceremony.

1543
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:47,495
- Seriously.
- Yes.

1544
01:06:48,095 --> 01:06:50,925
(What kind of work awaits them tomorrow?)

1545
01:06:53,365 --> 01:06:56,705
(On a rare occasion, Jung Ah takes a nap.)

1546
01:06:59,635 --> 01:07:02,445
(It was a good nap.)

1547
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:05,145
- The condiments.
- The condiments?

1548
01:07:05,415 --> 01:07:06,874
There are the usuals.

1549
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,545
(Heave-ho)

1550
01:07:08,985 --> 01:07:10,385
I need to check out the condiments.

1551
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:13,814
(She goes to the kitchen to check out the condiments.)

1552
01:07:13,815 --> 01:07:16,154
Let's see what we have. We need some seasonings.

1553
01:07:16,155 --> 01:07:17,484
All the seasonings are here.

1554
01:07:17,485 --> 01:07:18,524
(He already checked out the kitchen.)

1555
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:20,495
(I see.)

1556
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:23,965
(There's a seasoning pantry at a corner of the kitchen.)

1557
01:07:24,025 --> 01:07:26,495
(While Jung Ah checks out the condiments, )

1558
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,335
(she lands on the mattress.)

1559
01:07:35,975 --> 01:07:37,604
(Sweet)

1560
01:07:37,605 --> 01:07:38,975
- I'll doze off for a short while.
- Okay.

1561
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,584
(So that Jun Myun won't wake up, )

1562
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:44,815
(Jung Ah leaves the room quietly.)

1563
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,324
(Ji Yeon is tired, )

1564
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:52,755
(so she joins Jun Myun for a nap.)

1565
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:56,525
(The first work was intense for Ji Yeon.)

1566
01:07:57,825 --> 01:08:00,695
(She sleeps in the position of the letter T.)

1567
01:08:01,505 --> 01:08:04,035
(Entering)

1568
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,975
(Taking a photo)

1569
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:11,915
(Tiptoeing)

1570
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:14,785
(She finds a new subject.)

1571
01:08:16,345 --> 01:08:20,214
(Title: The Youngest Member's Nap)

1572
01:08:20,215 --> 01:08:22,154
(Title: The Youngest Member's Nap with the Perfect Angle)

1573
01:08:22,155 --> 01:08:24,455
(It's important to be stylish even when you sleep.)

1574
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:30,265
(Thus, the sweet afternoon passes.)

1575
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:34,465
Did you guys get some rest?

1576
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:37,404
- Look at this photo.
- What?

1577
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,805
(She answers with a photo.)

1578
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:40,435
(Laughing)

1579
01:08:40,505 --> 01:08:41,875
They slept like this.

1580
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:43,875
Ji Yeon slept in an active way.

1581
01:08:49,945 --> 01:08:51,014
(She's still half asleep.)

1582
01:08:51,015 --> 01:08:52,585
- Upload it to the group chat room.
- I did.

1583
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:53,755
Really?

1584
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,325
(Jung Ah comes out to the kitchen to find something to do.)

1585
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,994
A blender. We need to use this blender.

1586
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,325
Let's use it to grind the beans later.

1587
01:09:01,925 --> 01:09:04,695
(To grind the beans later?)

1588
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:06,664
Can we grind the beans there with water?

1589
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:08,265
Yes. We can grind them with water.

1590
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,664
(How will she use the beans?)

1591
01:09:09,665 --> 01:09:10,705
Then...

1592
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:13,635
(A month before the shoot)

1593
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:15,775
Suddenly, I had this thought.

1594
01:09:16,545 --> 01:09:18,115
Maybe we should make tofu.

1595
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:21,484
- Suddenly...
- Why would we make tofu?

1596
01:09:21,485 --> 01:09:23,084
I saw tofu.

1597
01:09:23,085 --> 01:09:24,085
(She saw tofu.)

1598
01:09:24,086 --> 01:09:25,784
I think it'll be fun...

1599
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:27,385
to make tofu on the show.

1600
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:32,255
What do you think?

1601
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:34,825
"Korean Cuisine and Dining" always shows tofu.

1602
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:36,264
(The avid watcher of the show becomes greedy.)

1603
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:37,395
Winter tofu.

1604
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:39,495
- Tofu isn't fattening either.
- That's right.

1605
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,135
(Keeping quiet)

1606
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,264
Winter tofu.

1607
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:45,004
- Jung Ah. Freshly-made tofu.
- We must eat tofu.

1608
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:46,035
(The younger members create more work.)

1609
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:49,345
I bet Jung Ah will prepare everything.

1610
01:09:50,445 --> 01:09:51,514
"How do you make it?"

1611
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:54,575
(That was...)

1612
01:09:55,485 --> 01:09:57,184
(when Jung Ah...)

1613
01:09:57,185 --> 01:09:59,885
(began making tofu at home.)

1614
01:09:59,955 --> 01:10:01,624
(Fresh off the Sea)

1615
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,284
(Jung Ah:)

1616
01:10:03,285 --> 01:10:04,484
(It's more difficult than I imagined.)

1617
01:10:04,485 --> 01:10:06,094
(It doesn't congeal easily.)

1618
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:07,324
(Jun Myun: Jung Ah, did you make it at home?)

1619
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:08,725
(Ji Yeon: Does that mean we'll be able to eat tofu?)

1620
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,735
(Jung Ah: I don't know. We'll have to give it a try.)

1621
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:14,095
(Thinking)

1622
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:15,935
So...

1623
01:10:16,205 --> 01:10:18,404
what you need to do is this. You'll put it in the cheesecloth...

1624
01:10:18,405 --> 01:10:20,605
- and squeeze hard.
- Squeeze.

1625
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:22,404
(Squeeze hard.)

1626
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:24,814
(Team Tofu members are synchronized.)

1627
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:26,975
(Now, )

1628
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,585
(shall we go and make tofu?)

1629
01:10:31,515 --> 01:10:33,184
(Before going out into the yard, )

1630
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:35,855
(Team Tofu members put on a coat.)

1631
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:41,765
(He gets to work.)

1632
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:45,495
(Jae Wook rinses...)

1633
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,265
(the soaked soybeans.)

1634
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:52,435
(Rubbing thoroughly)

1635
01:10:54,135 --> 01:10:57,105
(He discards the water carefully.)

1636
01:10:58,275 --> 01:11:00,675
(When his glasses come down, )

1637
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:03,085
(he puts them back up without touching.)

1638
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:07,354
(The fourth sibling of Fresh off the Sea...)

1639
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,125
(looks cool even when he works.)

1640
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,825
(The soybeans are rinsed.)

1641
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:13,325
(Stylish)

1642
01:11:15,595 --> 01:11:17,425
If you wait here, I'll bring it.

1643
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:20,264
(When he enters the house)

1644
01:11:20,265 --> 01:11:21,434
Heave-ho.

1645
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:22,635
(Shaking off the water)

1646
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,805
(After drying his hands, )

1647
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:27,005
(he dries his hair as well.)

1648
01:11:27,705 --> 01:11:31,545
(He brings a scoop on his way back.)

1649
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:32,675
Good.

1650
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,014
Please rinse it...

1651
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:36,685
- and bring it here.
- Okay.

1652
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:39,955
(He's everywhere.)

1653
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:43,555
(The stylish youngster works very diligently.)

1654
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:47,495
The size is nice.

1655
01:11:47,655 --> 01:11:49,125
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1656
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:54,235
(The tofu journey begins.)

1657
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:58,165
(She adds water to the rinsed soybeans.)

1658
01:11:58,905 --> 01:12:00,975
(Grinding)

1659
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:08,645
(The perfect teamwork)

1660
01:12:09,185 --> 01:12:10,945
(It's milky white.)

1661
01:12:12,915 --> 01:12:14,114
(The ground soybeans look milky.)

1662
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:15,155
I think it's done.

1663
01:12:17,725 --> 01:12:21,095
(It gets poured into the cheesecloth.)

1664
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:23,995
You're strong.

1665
01:12:24,665 --> 01:12:25,694
(The woman who's passionate about tofu, Jung Ah)

1666
01:12:25,695 --> 01:12:26,795
Really?

1667
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,004
- I need to squeeze out the water.
- Yes.

1668
01:12:30,005 --> 01:12:32,375
(Squeeze out the soybean water.)

1669
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:34,304
- Shall I squeeze it?
- Yes. Squeeze it.

1670
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:35,775
(Squeezing)

1671
01:12:36,045 --> 01:12:37,205
It smells like tofu.

1672
01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:42,715
It'll be much easier if you put it down and squeeze.

1673
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:44,414
Press it down.

1674
01:12:44,415 --> 01:12:46,055
(He presses it down.)

1675
01:12:47,715 --> 01:12:49,025
Jae Wook, your hands must be cold.

1676
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:51,255
(His hands are red.)

1677
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:53,125
But I like it.

1678
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,065
(The ground soybeans have a soft texture.)

1679
01:12:56,925 --> 01:12:58,765
(Struggling)

1680
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:01,135
How much should I squeeze it?

1681
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:03,935
Squeeze it until you can't anymore.

1682
01:13:05,835 --> 01:13:06,975
No matter how much I squeeze, more water comes out.

1683
01:13:09,345 --> 01:13:11,145
No matter how much I squeeze, more water comes out.

1684
01:13:11,815 --> 01:13:14,415
I think we should do it together. Since you're doing it alone...

1685
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,184
- I'll press it too.
- I'll take the left.

1686
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,554
- You take the right.
- Okay. Let's press it together.

1687
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:20,354
(When the task is too much for the youngest one, )

1688
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,525
(the third sibling steps in.)

1689
01:13:23,385 --> 01:13:26,125
- I'll twist it to the left.
- Like this?

1690
01:13:27,095 --> 01:13:28,925
I'm twisting it to the right. Are you doing it to the right too?

1691
01:13:29,695 --> 01:13:30,794
That's it.

1692
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:32,865
(Let's squeeze it.)

1693
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:39,235
(Ji Yeon is pretty strong.)

1694
01:13:39,305 --> 01:13:40,574
(Gosh!)

1695
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:41,745
It's nice.

1696
01:13:44,575 --> 01:13:45,914
(Ji Yeon's angry forearm muscles...)

1697
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:49,615
(squeeze the ground soybeans with no mercy.)

1698
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:51,144
(Did we finish it?)

1699
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:52,154
- Is this enough?
- Yes.

1700
01:13:52,155 --> 01:13:53,855
- That's enough, Ji Yeon.
- Did we squeeze too much?

1701
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:56,985
(They have a basin of soybean water.)

1702
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:58,124
Leave the soy pulp here.

1703
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,655
Let's pour out the soybean water.

1704
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:06,365
(Collect the soybean water.)

1705
01:14:07,795 --> 01:14:10,134
(Name: Soybean water)

1706
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:12,935
(Dream: Tofu)

1707
01:14:13,135 --> 01:14:14,634
(Looking around)

1708
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:15,945
Jung Ah, what do you want?

1709
01:14:16,205 --> 01:14:18,205
- The soy pulp...
- Okay.

1710
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:19,674
Will you throw it out?

1711
01:14:19,675 --> 01:14:21,244
- Will you throw it out?
- No, I'll freeze it.

1712
01:14:21,245 --> 01:14:22,845
- You'll freeze it.
- Yes.

1713
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:25,015
Jung Ah, how about a container like this one?

1714
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,755
- I can put it in a container.
- Can you put it in a container?

1715
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:30,185
But it's way too small.

1716
01:14:30,485 --> 01:14:31,724
- Is it way too small?
- It's way too small.

1717
01:14:31,725 --> 01:14:33,525
There's a lot.

1718
01:14:33,995 --> 01:14:35,995
(Heaped up)

1719
01:14:37,425 --> 01:14:40,694
(Move the soy pulp in the cheesecloth to a container.)

1720
01:14:40,695 --> 01:14:43,965
(My goodness)

1721
01:14:45,035 --> 01:14:46,205
It's like tofu.

1722
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:50,905
We'll use this soy pulp to make the kongbiji jjigae later.

1723
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:52,644
(Name: Soy pulp)

1724
01:14:52,645 --> 01:14:55,645
(Dream: Jjigae)

1725
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:58,044
Let's make it if we don't have soup tomorrow.

1726
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,285
Let's see what happens tomorrow.

1727
01:14:59,755 --> 01:15:01,485
We can't eat soybeans every day.

1728
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,085
(There's enough to do that.)

1729
01:15:05,295 --> 01:15:08,365
(Jung Ah grinds the soybeans over and over again.)

1730
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:09,865
(Heave-ho)

1731
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:10,865
All right.

1732
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:18,105
(There was a mountain of soybeans.)

1733
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:22,345
(They become rich soybean water with Jung Ah's touch.)

1734
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:25,514
(When the soybeans are smoothly ground, )

1735
01:15:25,515 --> 01:15:26,515
(it's the youngest one's turn.)

1736
01:15:26,516 --> 01:15:28,014
(His veins pop out.)

1737
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:29,915
(His arm muscles pop out.)

1738
01:15:30,385 --> 01:15:32,615
(The soybean water comes out.)

1739
01:15:32,815 --> 01:15:35,785
(After squeezing out the soybean water, )

1740
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:40,225
(they get a heap of soy pulp.)

1741
01:15:40,295 --> 01:15:41,925
It feels so nice.

1742
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:43,865
It's soft.

1743
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:47,535
(It's as soft as cream cheese.)

1744
01:15:49,935 --> 01:15:52,435
We'll have kongbiji jjigae so often.

1745
01:15:53,335 --> 01:15:55,604
(20 servings)

1746
01:15:55,605 --> 01:15:56,705
All done.

1747
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:00,615
(There's a lot, but it's fresh.)

1748
01:16:00,945 --> 01:16:03,314
- It's time to build a fire.
- A fire?

1749
01:16:03,315 --> 01:16:04,544
Yes. With the fire...

1750
01:16:04,545 --> 01:16:05,784
(Next step in the tofu journey)

1751
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:08,855
(Boil the soybean water.)

1752
01:16:10,325 --> 01:16:12,224
(While Team Tofu works hard)

1753
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:13,325
Ji Yeon.

1754
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:17,365
- Which basin should I use?
- A basin?

1755
01:16:17,465 --> 01:16:20,534
- We need a big basin.
- I'll take it out.

1756
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:21,805
No, that one is small.

1757
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:24,104
There aren't many big basins.

1758
01:16:24,105 --> 01:16:26,435
(Why are they looking for a big basin?)

1759
01:16:27,235 --> 01:16:28,404
It's here.

1760
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:29,975
(She wants to make seokbakji.)

1761
01:16:30,475 --> 01:16:31,505
(One radish)

1762
01:16:32,575 --> 01:16:33,715
(Two radishes)

1763
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:35,544
What should we do now?

1764
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,085
- Let's cut the radishes.
- Okay.

1765
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:38,885
These radishes are so nice.

1766
01:16:40,355 --> 01:16:42,184
(What happens after the radishes are peeled?)

1767
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:44,225
(Ji Yeon delivers them.)

1768
01:16:44,955 --> 01:16:46,355
Gosh, the radishes smell nice.

1769
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:51,895
(She prepares a cutting board on her own.)

1770
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:53,434
(Peeking)

1771
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:54,865
Coarse salt.

1772
01:16:55,505 --> 01:16:56,965
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1773
01:16:57,135 --> 01:16:59,705
(Cute)

1774
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,934
Let's cut the radishes.

1775
01:17:00,935 --> 01:17:02,475
I'll cut the radishes.

1776
01:17:04,505 --> 01:17:08,415
(She cuts it in half first.)

1777
01:17:08,585 --> 01:17:09,645
Like this.

1778
01:17:10,415 --> 01:17:11,515
Like this.

1779
01:17:12,115 --> 01:17:14,085
(Concentrating)

1780
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:16,655
- You get the idea, right?
- Yes.

1781
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:22,065
(She cuts it in half like Jun Myun.)

1782
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:28,765
(Her eyes are busier than her hands.)

1783
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:30,635
Bite-sized pieces.

1784
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:34,075
(Input)

1785
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:38,275
(Output)

1786
01:17:39,675 --> 01:17:41,445
- You're doing well, Ji Yeon.
- Yes.

1787
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:46,385
(The perfect output)

1788
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:48,755
All right. We're done.

1789
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:50,784
We don't need to make more, right?

1790
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:51,995
This is enough, right?

1791
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:53,694
It'll be best to cut them at once.

1792
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:55,625
(Shall I taste the radish?)

1793
01:17:56,725 --> 01:17:57,865
The radish is sweet.

1794
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:02,265
(It's sweet.)

1795
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:04,365
It's sweet because it's a winter radish.

1796
01:18:05,475 --> 01:18:08,645
It's so sweet. Jung Ah, the radish is sweet.

1797
01:18:09,045 --> 01:18:14,775
(The sweetness of the winter radish spreads in their mouths.)

1798
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:18,685
- Radishes are sweet in winter.
- They're sweet.

1799
01:18:20,015 --> 01:18:21,214
We need to salt it now.

1800
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:22,955
(They sprinkle coarse salt over the sliced radish.)

1801
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,955
(Mixing them evenly)

1802
01:18:27,595 --> 01:18:29,925
(Why is she wiping off salt?)

1803
01:18:30,695 --> 01:18:32,034
Do you want another piece of radish?

1804
01:18:32,035 --> 01:18:33,064
(Do you want another piece of radish?)

1805
01:18:33,065 --> 01:18:34,494
Didn't you salt it already?

1806
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,705
You're smarter than I thought.

1807
01:18:36,405 --> 01:18:38,504
(Mischievous)

1808
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,605
Impressive.

1809
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:42,075
(I'm watching you.)

1810
01:18:42,345 --> 01:18:45,475
(It's set aside for a moment to remove water.)

1811
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:47,375
What should we do now?

1812
01:18:47,775 --> 01:18:50,315
(Following)

1813
01:18:50,345 --> 01:18:52,114
- To water, - Okay.

1814
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:53,785
- we'll add glutinous rice flour.
- Okay.

1815
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:56,725
- We'll make a paste.
- Okay.

1816
01:18:56,825 --> 01:18:59,225
It should be thin like baby food.

1817
01:18:59,725 --> 01:19:01,964
- Please mix it...
- Okay.

1818
01:19:01,965 --> 01:19:03,794
So that there are no lumps.

1819
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:04,795
- Okay.
- Please do that.

1820
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:06,035
Okay.

1821
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:10,765
- I'll follow your command.
- Okay.

1822
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:14,575
(Output)

1823
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:17,004
(Watching carefully)

1824
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:19,515
- Please get rid of the lumps.
- Yes, ma'am.

1825
01:19:19,975 --> 01:19:21,174
For goodness' sake.

1826
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:24,115
If you can't even get rid of the lumps,

1827
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,854
how will you become the kimchi master?

1828
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:28,584
- This is heartbreaking.
- Seriously.

1829
01:19:28,585 --> 01:19:29,585
(It isn't easy to make the perfect seasoning.)

1830
01:19:29,586 --> 01:19:31,025
Watch out for the lumps.

1831
01:19:32,555 --> 01:19:35,365
(Her hands move like a blender.)

1832
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:37,595
You can stop now. That's good enough.

1833
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,764
There are no lumps.

1834
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:40,295
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1835
01:19:40,795 --> 01:19:43,305
Now, Ji Yeon, please work on this.

1836
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,804
Please cut scallions...

1837
01:19:45,805 --> 01:19:48,174
in the length of 4cm to 5cm.

1838
01:19:48,175 --> 01:19:49,375
Okay.

1839
01:19:50,605 --> 01:19:53,315
(5cm?)

1840
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:57,585
So 1cm, 2cm, 3cm, 4cm, and 5cm.

1841
01:19:58,515 --> 01:20:00,884
So 1cm, 2cm, 3cm, 4cm...

1842
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:02,184
(Passing)

1843
01:20:02,185 --> 01:20:03,355
Im Ji Yeon.

1844
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:06,154
Please cut scallions in the length of 3cm.

1845
01:20:06,155 --> 01:20:07,595
It was 5cm earlier.

1846
01:20:07,755 --> 01:20:09,525
- It's different each time.
- Okay.

1847
01:20:12,065 --> 01:20:15,465
(Cutting them in the length of 3cm)

1848
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:19,705
They need to be 3cm.

1849
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:21,104
All right.

1850
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:23,945
(Seasoning Park begins to move.)

1851
01:20:24,605 --> 01:20:26,844
(She adds a generous amount of chili powder.)

1852
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:30,045
Let's add a bit of minced ginger.

1853
01:20:30,485 --> 01:20:32,955
(A generous amount of salted shrimp)

1854
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:34,254
- One.
- One.

1855
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:35,985
(Sand lance sauce)

1856
01:20:36,255 --> 01:20:37,585
- Three.
- Three.

1857
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:40,625
You added three spoonfuls.

1858
01:20:40,925 --> 01:20:42,694
- Let's add four spoonfuls.
- Are you certain?

1859
01:20:42,695 --> 01:20:44,065
I'm not certain.

1860
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:47,735
- Okay.
- Mix them.

1861
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:50,734
Let's add some anchovy sauce as well.

1862
01:20:50,735 --> 01:20:53,635
Mixing the ingredients deepens the taste.

1863
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,775
(An interim check)

1864
01:20:57,845 --> 01:21:01,175
(I feel like something is missing.)

1865
01:21:03,585 --> 01:21:06,715
(Seasoning Park's secret ingredient)

1866
01:21:08,215 --> 01:21:11,755
(She adds a bottle of a yogurt drink.)

1867
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:14,395
Why do you add a yogurt drink?

1868
01:21:15,095 --> 01:21:16,124
It makes the dish tastier.

1869
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,225
(The reason is simple.)

1870
01:21:17,365 --> 01:21:18,795
Is it your know-how?

1871
01:21:18,935 --> 01:21:21,164
Well, it's an industry secret.

1872
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:22,404
- Really?
- Yes.

1873
01:21:22,405 --> 01:21:23,605
(Impressed)

1874
01:21:23,635 --> 01:21:25,804
I thought you had bought it to drink.

1875
01:21:25,805 --> 01:21:27,374
- It was for the seasoning.
- Come on.

1876
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:29,645
- Don't be like that.
- My goodness.

1877
01:21:29,745 --> 01:21:31,775
I had no idea.

1878
01:21:32,515 --> 01:21:34,674
(It isn't easy to follow the path of Seasoning Park.)

1879
01:21:34,675 --> 01:21:36,144
(Impressed)

1880
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:37,414
You're the best chef.

1881
01:21:37,415 --> 01:21:38,645
(You're the best chef.)

1882
01:21:38,855 --> 01:21:41,784
To this, we'll add the glutinous rice paste.

1883
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:44,785
- It completes the seasoning.
- I see.

1884
01:21:46,955 --> 01:21:48,325
(Tasting)

1885
01:21:51,195 --> 01:21:54,995
(Add the glutinous rice paste.)

1886
01:21:55,165 --> 01:21:57,305
Shall we add the glutinous rice paste?

1887
01:21:57,505 --> 01:21:58,764
No.

1888
01:21:58,765 --> 01:21:59,934
Okay.

1889
01:21:59,935 --> 01:22:01,304
It's a no-no.

1890
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:03,375
Don't do anything without asking me.

1891
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:05,574
Where did you want to add the glutinous rice paste?

1892
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:06,575
Here.

1893
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:07,945
It needs to be boiled first.

1894
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:09,714
Okay.

1895
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:12,754
You wanted to add it in an uncooked state, right?

1896
01:22:12,755 --> 01:22:15,215
You wanted to add this, right?

1897
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:18,224
Gosh, it would've been a disaster.

1898
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,755
(Gosh, it would've been a disaster.)

1899
01:22:20,455 --> 01:22:22,795
Please don't make any rash decisions.

1900
01:22:23,725 --> 01:22:24,994
(To the boiling broth, )

1901
01:22:24,995 --> 01:22:28,135
(she adds the uncooked glutinous rice paste.)

1902
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:32,134
(Then she cooks it over medium-low heat...)

1903
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:35,035
(until it becomes thick.)

1904
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:38,915
(Meanwhile, Team Tofu...)

1905
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:43,745
(is preparing a fire for boiling the soybean water.)

1906
01:22:44,245 --> 01:22:46,485
(Soybean water)

1907
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:49,725
(The second brazier)

1908
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:53,195
(The youngest members attempt to set up their first brazier.)

1909
01:22:54,695 --> 01:22:57,825
(I often go camping or glamping.)

1910
01:22:58,195 --> 01:23:01,935
(Jae Wook was confident in his ability to build a fire.)

1911
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:05,465
(He puts a brazier on top of the bricks.)

1912
01:23:06,205 --> 01:23:07,275
(Heave-ho)

1913
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:11,045
(He puts a brazier on top of a brazier.)

1914
01:23:11,475 --> 01:23:14,375
(The brazier tower is complete.)

1915
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:20,385
(Are you sure this is right?)

1916
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,255
(Am I doing it wrong?)

1917
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,895
(Blocked)

1918
01:23:27,055 --> 01:23:29,225
(This brazier should be used one at a time.)

1919
01:23:30,295 --> 01:23:31,325
You're right.

1920
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:33,465
Take one out.

1921
01:23:36,465 --> 01:23:37,465
One?

1922
01:23:38,035 --> 01:23:39,434
- Take the top one out.
- One?

1923
01:23:39,435 --> 01:23:40,435
Yes.

1924
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:42,344
Gosh, it's heavy.

1925
01:23:42,345 --> 01:23:43,345
(Two braziers)

1926
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:44,545
(I can't believe her.)

1927
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:46,314
What's this?

1928
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:47,445
(They're stuck.)

1929
01:23:48,175 --> 01:23:49,184
(Using her hands doesn't work, )

1930
01:23:49,185 --> 01:23:50,485
(so she uses her feet.)

1931
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,155
(Separating)

1932
01:23:54,515 --> 01:23:55,515
Put it on the top again.

1933
01:23:56,355 --> 01:23:57,355
- This one?
- Yes.

1934
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:58,355
(The dumb and dumber of the brazier)

1935
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:02,665
(Is it your first time setting up a brazier?)

1936
01:24:09,965 --> 01:24:12,535
(That's my place.)

1937
01:24:13,075 --> 01:24:14,834
We can put the caldron lid over here.

1938
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:16,004
(That's right.)

1939
01:24:16,005 --> 01:24:17,005
I'll put it there.

1940
01:24:17,006 --> 01:24:18,545
- Is everything okay?
- I think so.

1941
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,315
(The person who is in charge of tofu looks worried.)

1942
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:23,585
Hold on.

1943
01:24:23,586 --> 01:24:25,085
(Switching the caldron lid to the caldron)

1944
01:24:26,555 --> 01:24:29,584
(It's time to boil the soybean water.)

1945
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:31,155
The water should be weak for now.

1946
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,025
- Weak?
- Yes.

1947
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:34,025
(I got it.)

1948
01:24:34,225 --> 01:24:37,125
(Jae Wook waits for something.)

1949
01:24:37,225 --> 01:24:38,365
(Grinning)

1950
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:40,564
You're very frustrated, right?

1951
01:24:40,565 --> 01:24:42,404
- No. I think you're doing great.
- You can't fool me.

1952
01:24:42,405 --> 01:24:43,434
(They bicker even before building a fire.)

1953
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:44,435
Will you add everything?

1954
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,205
No.

1955
01:24:46,975 --> 01:24:49,245
(She delivers a heap of firewood.)

1956
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:55,415
(Bringing more firewood)

1957
01:24:57,115 --> 01:24:58,645
(Surprised)

1958
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:00,754
(Refilling the firewood endlessly)

1959
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:02,085
We need more firewood.

1960
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,055
Okay. Put it here.

1961
01:25:04,955 --> 01:25:07,125
Should I bring more? I should, right?

1962
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:10,724
Hey, you can't build a fire with that little firewood.

1963
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:12,765
You need to add more.

1964
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:14,265
Are you trying to build a house?

1965
01:25:14,965 --> 01:25:17,135
(The 3rd and 4th siblings are strict only to each other.)

1966
01:25:17,435 --> 01:25:19,675
(Thankfully, the firewood burns well.)

1967
01:25:20,675 --> 01:25:23,405
(Ji Yeon stares at the fire.)

1968
01:25:23,675 --> 01:25:26,445
Add a small piece whenever the fire dies down.

1969
01:25:27,015 --> 01:25:28,015
Okay.

1970
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:35,825
Hey, when do I add firewood? Do I add it when the fire dies down?

1971
01:25:37,185 --> 01:25:40,195
(Ji Yeon didn't hear him since she was focused on the fire.)

1972
01:25:41,755 --> 01:25:44,725
(She picks up firewood.)

1973
01:25:45,465 --> 01:25:46,834
(Should I add it...)

1974
01:25:46,835 --> 01:25:48,165
(or not?)

1975
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,875
Be honest. You want to add the firewood, right?

1976
01:25:55,035 --> 01:25:56,705
(She got caught.)

1977
01:25:56,905 --> 01:25:58,945
The fire became a bit smaller. Shall I add it now?

1978
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:01,645
But Jung Ah wanted low heat.

1979
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:02,745
Can you tell me what low heat is?

1980
01:26:04,515 --> 01:26:07,055
(Low heat)

1981
01:26:07,785 --> 01:26:08,955
All right. I'll add this only.

1982
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:12,155
(You're annoying.)

1983
01:26:12,595 --> 01:26:13,595
What's going on?

1984
01:26:13,855 --> 01:26:15,095
She keeps becoming sullen.

1985
01:26:15,455 --> 01:26:18,225
Jung Ah, Jae Wook keeps looking down on me!

1986
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:19,465
What's going on?

1987
01:26:21,235 --> 01:26:23,535
(Thankfully, the fire goes well.)

1988
01:26:24,065 --> 01:26:25,975
(Watching carefully)

1989
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:32,075
The heat is strong.

1990
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:35,074
- I need low heat.
- I told you not to add it.

1991
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:37,314
- I need low heat.
- I told you that it was high.

1992
01:26:37,315 --> 01:26:38,415
I'll take out some firewood.

1993
01:26:38,645 --> 01:26:41,515
I'll take it out.

1994
01:26:42,485 --> 01:26:44,885
(Running over)

1995
01:26:45,525 --> 01:26:46,694
(She returns with tongs.)

1996
01:26:46,695 --> 01:26:47,755
Take out a few pieces.

1997
01:26:48,355 --> 01:26:50,265
(Laughing)

1998
01:26:50,965 --> 01:26:52,634
(She hurriedly takes out a few pieces of firewood.)

1999
01:26:52,635 --> 01:26:54,495
- Is this enough?
- Take out one more piece.

2000
01:26:56,765 --> 01:26:57,765
Is this good?

2001
01:26:59,605 --> 01:27:00,875
Yes. I'll give it a go.

2002
01:27:02,205 --> 01:27:03,945
(Go to sleep.)

2003
01:27:04,705 --> 01:27:06,244
(He's dying to make a comment.)

2004
01:27:06,245 --> 01:27:08,075
I see that you're determined to be funny today.

2005
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:11,244
(High heat)

2006
01:27:11,245 --> 01:27:12,615
I'll end you later.

2007
01:27:15,155 --> 01:27:17,584
Why do you guys keep fighting while wearing the same clothes?

2008
01:27:17,585 --> 01:27:19,595
He keeps looking down on me, Jung Ah.

2009
01:27:20,595 --> 01:27:21,755
Hey, you should stir it.

2010
01:27:22,025 --> 01:27:23,225
Shall I stir it?

2011
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:24,395
We should take turns.

2012
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,935
(They're cute.)

2013
01:27:27,335 --> 01:27:30,265
(Despite everything, they work together.)

2014
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:33,835
It smells like a market. It's so nice.

2015
01:27:36,945 --> 01:27:39,414
Tell me when it's about to boil.

2016
01:27:39,415 --> 01:27:40,415
(They need to wait until it boils once.)

2017
01:27:41,815 --> 01:27:45,345
(Now, they need to leave it up to time.)

2018
01:27:47,355 --> 01:27:49,985
Once we add saltwater, it'll change in a fascinating way.

2019
01:27:50,855 --> 01:27:52,124
- Will it congeal?
- It'll change in a fascinating way.

2020
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:55,525
(Once it meets saltwater, it'll harden into tofu.)

2021
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:58,624
Since there's this much smoke, it should be boiling.

2022
01:27:58,625 --> 01:27:59,665
I know.

2023
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:02,264
It's taking a long time.

2024
01:28:02,265 --> 01:28:05,005
(There seems to be a problem.)

2025
01:28:05,682 --> 01:28:06,791
(Tasting)

2026
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:07,992
(Homemade tofu)

2027
01:28:09,162 --> 01:28:10,162
(It looks like they won't be able to eat it.)

2028
01:28:10,162 --> 01:28:11,162
(Laughing)

2029
01:28:11,892 --> 01:28:14,232
(Will they be able to salvage the tofu?)

2030
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:15,332
(Jung Ah, there's an emergency.)

2031
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,332
(I'm beginning to feel hungry.)

2032
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:20,101
(Seasoning Park is good...)

2033
01:28:20,102 --> 01:28:21,732
(at making food in bulk.)

2034
01:28:22,332 --> 01:28:25,072
(Seasoning Park's touch makes seokbakji amazing.)

2035
01:28:25,442 --> 01:28:27,442
(She has the golden touch!)

2036
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:29,641
(Another member with the golden touch, )

2037
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:30,912
(who cooks large quantities of food)

2038
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:32,681
(Stir-fried squid with the smoky flavor of Sokcho)

2039
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:33,682
The color is amazing.

2040
01:28:34,512 --> 01:28:36,422
(Spicy codfish stew with the spicy taste of Sokcho)

2041
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:38,322
(Jung Ah, they're the best.)

2042
01:28:38,822 --> 01:28:40,491
(Girls, )

2043
01:28:40,492 --> 01:28:41,991
(I'm so excited...)

2044
01:28:41,992 --> 01:28:43,562
(right now.)

2045
01:28:43,992 --> 01:28:45,962
(Generous older members and gluttonous younger members)

2046
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:50,031
(And...)

2047
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:53,031
(a pollack drying field...)

2048
01:28:53,032 --> 01:28:54,832
(that's too big)

2049
01:28:55,272 --> 01:28:56,471
(Drying the pollacks...)

2050
01:28:56,472 --> 01:29:00,041
(like this)

2051
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:01,042
(Drying the pollacks like this?)

2052
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:02,172
(My goodness)

2053
01:29:02,512 --> 01:29:04,541
(The members hang them up one at a time.)

2054
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:06,651
Stop right there!

2055
01:29:06,652 --> 01:29:07,911
(What's going on?)

2056
01:29:07,912 --> 01:29:09,182
(Startled)

2057
01:29:10,052 --> 01:29:13,022
(The atmosphere turns frigid in an instant.)

2058
01:29:13,722 --> 01:29:15,621
(A mysterious man commands the pollack drying field...)

2059
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:17,962
(with his gaze alone.)

2060
01:29:18,462 --> 01:29:20,331
(This is Pollack Game.)

2061
01:29:20,332 --> 01:29:23,832
(Would you like to join?)

2062
01:29:24,936 --> 01:29:26,936
