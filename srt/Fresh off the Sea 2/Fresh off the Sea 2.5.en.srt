1
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:21,025
(The place you can reach after a six-hour drive from Seoul)

2
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,135
(The place that's full of abalones)

3
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,335
(The place where all sorts of marine algae grow)

4
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,135
(The emerald-colored sea)

5
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:35,105
(Wando-gun, South Jeolla Province)

6
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,145
(At the end of the land, the members meet again.)

7
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:42,585
(In Wando, the place that's full of greens, )

8
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:45,314
(which ingredients...)

9
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:49,025
(will the four siblings work on?)

10
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:54,164
(Full of panting)

11
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:57,094
(Full of singing)

12
00:00:57,095 --> 00:01:00,035
(Full of food)

13
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,364
Let's go.

14
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:05,734
(Happy together in Wando)

15
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,005
I can't speak now.

16
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,604
(Just as spring approaches in March, )

17
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,915
(the members meet again at the Hwaheungpo Port, Wando.)

18
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:15,214
(A restaurant in front of the port)

19
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:17,015
(Sighing)

20
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:20,825
(The youngest member arrives first and waits for the sisters.)

21
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,324
(He looks quite troubled.)

22
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:24,925
I'm so worried...

23
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:26,925
about riding a boat.

24
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:31,835
Why did I say that I didn't get seasick during my first interview?

25
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,805
(Full of regrets)

26
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:36,834
(Laughing)

27
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:38,934
"Listen when I tell you to."

28
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,144
(Jun Myun and Ji Yeon appear with a hearty laugh.)

29
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,375
"Listen when I tell you to."

30
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,944
I'm into cooking these days.

31
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:49,484
- Will you show your skills? - I'll pull up my sleeves...

32
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,015
this time.

33
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,284
(Laughing)

34
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:54,725
Hey, where is the place? Is it here?

35
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,095
- I don't know. - Is it here?

36
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,325
What? Breakfast?

37
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,965
(Breakfast at the end of the land)

38
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,265
Hey.

39
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:09,735
- You're here. - Hi.

40
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,074
- Hello. - You're here, Jun Myun.

41
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,451
(The youngest one is happy to see the older members again.)

42
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:15,605
It was a long trip, right?

43
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:18,075
Wando is far.

44
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,185
- It's so far. - It's far.

45
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:22,315
- What will we do? - It's far.

46
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,614
- Have you been well? - Yes. Have you lived well?

47
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:26,684
- Your face looks nice. - Does my face look nice?

48
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,285
Your face looks nice too.

49
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:32,695
Guys, we don't have time to chat. We need to look around.

50
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,125
(I forgot.)

51
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,535
(Double eyelids of concentration)

52
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:40,234
I've been looking at it for a while. It has to be skate, right?

53
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,405
Skate?

54
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:46,035
(Skate is on one side of the menu.)

55
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:48,145
- Abalone. - Abalone?

56
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,414
Abalone ramyeon caught my eye.

57
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,615
(Abalone ramyeon)

58
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,184
It's ten dollars.

59
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,865
(Despite being ramyeon, it's ten dollars.)

60
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,984
(Glaring)

61
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:58,755
Yes. Abalone.

62
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:00,984
- Abalones are famous in Wando. - It's not what you want to eat.

63
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:02,184
(It's easy.)

64
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,455
Don't talk about what you want to eat.

65
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,624
We're trying to guess what our work will be.

66
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,201
(She's certain that it'll involve abalones.)

67
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,994
Last time, we went out to the sea on a big boat...

68
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:13,034
and caught a lot of fish.

69
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,504
So we'll go to a fishing farm this time.

70
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:16,505
What do you think?

71
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,935
(An experienced worker's hunch?)

72
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:22,445
- I put on a motion sickness patch. - Already?

73
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,274
(I'm an experienced worker now.)

74
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,685
- When? Today? - Did you put it on?

75
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,985
No.

76
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,185
Do you want to throw up again?

77
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,915
(Will Jae Wook throw up again today?)

78
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:36,084
You guys are like babies.

79
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,755
- Can't you guys manage without it? - Last week...

80
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,224
- Abalone. - Look forward to it.

81
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,995
Ji Yeon practiced cooking.

82
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:44,495
(Did you practice cooking?)

83
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:45,965
What did you practice making?

84
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,235
Well, various Korean dishes.

85
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,775
Look forward to it.

86
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,174
- Look forward to it. - When people practice cooking,

87
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,215
they usually reveal which dishes they've made.

88
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,714
(Motioning)

89
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,215
She practiced stir-frying.

90
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,554
- Did you practice stir-frying? - Ji Yeon is so cute.

91
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,584
Yes.

92
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:08,684
(While the younger siblings bicker, )

93
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,355
(the eldest sibling appears.)

94
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,095
Good morning.

95
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,364
- Welcome, Leader Yum. - Good morning.

96
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,565
Let's see.

97
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:20,264
(As soon as she sits down)

98
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,705
What should we eat?

99
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,005
(She always charges forward.)

100
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,505
We're seeing each other for the 1st time in 2 weeks.

101
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,205
We always message each other.

102
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:30,875
Didn't you miss us?

103
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,245
I missed you guys.

104
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,615
(Now they're used to the Thinking-type's reactions.)

105
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:39,984
I missed you guys.

106
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,285
(I mean it.)

107
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,094
- The two of you... - Yes.

108
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:45,855
- Hello. - Hello.

109
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,624
(Impressed)

110
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,735
(Surprised)

111
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,704
(In awe)

112
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,004
- It's a fish meal. - I know.

113
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,204
(Why are they so surprised?)

114
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,475
Hold on.

115
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:03,104
(This is a meal in Jeolla Province.)

116
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:06,614
I caught the fish and cleaned them.

117
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:09,314
This is a brown croaker. This is a sea bream.

118
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:10,515
This is a yellow croaker.

119
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:15,225
(They're dried by the sea wind in front of the restaurant.)

120
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,355
(They're tasty since she grills them upon receiving the order.)

121
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:22,625
(The 3-kind grilled fish set)

122
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,005
(Boiled broth gets poured over the soy sauce-marinated abalones.)

123
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,904
(The salty and sweet...)

124
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:34,375
(soy sauce-marinated abalones of Wando)

125
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,914
(The seaweed is seasoned with chogochujang.)

126
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,775
(Sprinkled sesame wraps up the dish.)

127
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,115
(Seasoned seaweed of Wando)

128
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:43,244
(Gamtae, roasted laver, seasoned laver)

129
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,754
(They can taste different kinds of Wando's seaweed.)

130
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:48,125
(Seasoned cockles, stir-fried anchovies)

131
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,824
(The hot and refreshing oyster and cabbage soup)

132
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:53,185
(There are also side dishes made with seasonal vegetables.)

133
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:56,835
(The meal of 19 dishes has the best ingredients!)

134
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,064
Enjoy the food.

135
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,735
- Okay. Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

136
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,335
I was so surprised.

137
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,075
(Shall I try the soup first?)

138
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:07,245
My goodness.

139
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,874
(Jung Ah finds something in the soup.)

140
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,115
There are oysters inside.

141
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:16,214
- Oysters? - Here. It looks so good.

142
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,815
(Cabbage soup with oysters)

143
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:21,885
(She tries a spoonful of the hot oyster and cabbage soup.)

144
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,655
- The soup is very tasty. - Yes.

145
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,535
(The aromatic oysters and cabbage create a harmonious taste.)

146
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,735
(Ji Yeon eats a plump oyster from the soup.)

147
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,705
- It's tasty. - It's tasty, right?

148
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:41,705
(How do the fishes from the sea of Wando taste?)

149
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:45,445
(Jun Myun picks up the entire yellow croaker.)

150
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,814
(She puts it on the rice.)

151
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:50,884
(Taking off a piece of the yellow croaker)

152
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:54,625
(She takes off a big piece and puts it in her mouth.)

153
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:57,325
It's so tasty.

154
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,065
(Jung Ah also takes a big bite of the yellow croaker.)

155
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:02,764
(Impressed)

156
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:03,965
- Is it tasty? - It's chewy.

157
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:06,265
- It's chewy. Yes. - Very.

158
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:09,334
(Impressed)

159
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,405
- Very. - Yes.

160
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,805
It's very chewy. It's like meat.

161
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,304
(The seasonal fish become chewy and savory...)

162
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,344
(after getting dried by the sea wind.)

163
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,075
I'll eat the fish.

164
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,485
Jung Ah, do you want to try an abalone?

165
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,084
- They must be marinated abalones. - Yes.

166
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,414
(Their next target is the specialty of Wando, abalone.)

167
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,855
(How does the abalone taste in Wando, the home of abalones?)

168
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,925
(His eyes go wide.)

169
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,224
(Gosh!)

170
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,325
It's no joke, right?

171
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:38,894
- How is it so tasty? - I know.

172
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:42,305
(The savory taste of soy sauce seeped into the chewy abalone.)

173
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,605
(What will Jung Ah's chopsticks grab?)

174
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:48,685
Let's see how dried laver tastes in Wando.

175
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:54,715
(Shall we eat it with white rice?)

176
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:57,045
The dried laver is very tasty.

177
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,355
(She eats another piece.)

178
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,554
(There's a reason why she keeps reaching for more.)

179
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,624
Hey, dried laver tastes different in Wando.

180
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,105
- Is it tasty? - How should I say it?

181
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,265
Is it savory?

182
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,194
- The piece is dense, right? - Yes.

183
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,335
(Jun Myun knows what's up.)

184
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:11,764
It's very firm.

185
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,264
(Wando's dried laver is thick and firm.)

186
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,865
(It's tasty by itself.)

187
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,834
(The crunchy texture fills the mouth.)

188
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,275
- Yes. - It'll be fun.

189
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:21,474
- Everyone should try it. - It's so tasty.

190
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:22,575
It's so tasty.

191
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,844
(The texture is different when you tear it up.)

192
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,715
(Let me try a piece.)

193
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:32,155
(What is up with this dried laver?)

194
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,625
- It's so tasty. - It's so tasty.

195
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:37,595
I'll be able to have a good meal only with dried laver and kimchi.

196
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,495
- Yes. The dried laver is tasty. - It's all I need.

197
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:44,295
(The tasty dried laver stimulates Ji Yeon's appetite.)

198
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:47,065
(Absorbed)

199
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,364
(Eating tofu)

200
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,274
(Eating anchovies)

201
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,745
(She tries hijiki that's quite far from her.)

202
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:55,645
(Eating)

203
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,574
(Seaweed too)

204
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,944
(She dips a bundle in chogochujang...)

205
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:01,845
(and eats it in a bite.)

206
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,415
(What's up with the seaweed?)

207
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,224
(She eats seaweed for the 2nd time.)

208
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,754
(This seaweed...)

209
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,454
(suits my taste.)

210
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:13,394
(Lastly, she cleanses her palate with aged kimchi.)

211
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:15,355
- All the side dishes are tasty. - They're tasty.

212
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,465
(Agreeing by knitting his brows)

213
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,734
(Jung Ah finds the younger ones cute for eating so well.)

214
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,804
Eat up.

215
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:25,204
(Clearing her throat)

216
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:28,644
Ma'am, would you give us more aged kimchi?

217
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,045
(She gets a refill on a side dish.)

218
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,574
- It's so tasty. - Really?

219
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,214
- Please enjoy it. - The aged kimchi is no joke.

220
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,814
- Please enjoy it. - Okay.

221
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,384
- Thank you. - Do you need more of anything else?

222
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:38,654
- Dried laver. - Please give us more dried laver.

223
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:39,884
Okay.

224
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,384
- This and this. - Okay.

225
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,554
(They get a refill for so many side dishes.)

226
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:45,724
Enjoy the seasonal ingredients. All of these are in season.

227
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,125
- Exactly. - Yes.

228
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,594
(All of them are tasty.)

229
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,864
All of them are tasty. By the way...

230
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,865
(By the way)

231
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,535
Among them, which one will it be?

232
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,605
(Which one is related to today's labor?)

233
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,275
(The candidates are as numerous as the number of the side dishes.)

234
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,245
Jung Ah, look.

235
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,145
The fish are a feint.

236
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,685
- I don't think it's fish. - The fish are a feint.

237
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,055
Think about what we did on Ganghwa Island.

238
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,455
We picked grapes.

239
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:18,194
The only clue we got was the raisins in a corner.

240
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,424
You remember that, right?

241
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:20,564
(A distant memory of betrayal)

242
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:23,295
(Clearing her throat)

243
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:27,035
(Detective Jun Myun's deduction: It can't be a fish.)

244
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,364
As for the abalones,

245
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,804
you just need to pick them up. There isn't much work.

246
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,704
- You don't think it's an abalone. - I don't think it's an abalone.

247
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:34,774
(Detective Jun Myun's deduction: It can't be an abalone either.)

248
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:35,845
It's what I think.

249
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,715
Cockles?

250
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,615
Cockles live in the mudflats.

251
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,945
- It can't be cockles. - Cockles?

252
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:43,815
The experienced workers are no joke.

253
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,615
It's nothing.

254
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,454
Seaweed?

255
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,525
(Can it be seaweed?)

256
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:50,854
Dried laver.

257
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:51,954
(Dried laver!)

258
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,364
(We're curious...)

259
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,265
(about our future.)

260
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,964
The place...

261
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:05,304
where you'll work to deliver seasonal food is...

262
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:08,605
(Where will we work today?)

263
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,375
an island called Soan Island.

264
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,545
(Soan Island?)

265
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:15,515
From here...

266
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,615
(From here?)

267
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:21,385
you need to go to Soan Island...

268
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,855
by a ferry.

269
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,564
It'll take one hour.

270
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,395
(1 hour)

271
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:36,935
(We need to take a ferry to go to work?)

272
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,434
One hour?

273
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:39,575
(It'll take 1 hour?)

274
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,544
(From Seoul to Wando, it was a 6-hour car ride.)

275
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,114
(A 1-hour ferry ride will get added.)

276
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:48,155
(The transportation time will be 7 hours in total.)

277
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,354
(A mysterious island)

278
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:56,585
(Soan Island)

279
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:58,594
(Blinking)

280
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:01,495
Please give me a medicine for seasickness.

281
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,694
Are you only telling us about the one-hour ferry ride?

282
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,095
(Aren't you going to tell us more?)

283
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,334
(Will we be...)

284
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:12,275
(okay?)

285
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,844
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

286
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,775
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

287
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,744
- It's so big. - Is that the ferry?

288
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,744
(The four siblings come out and look for the ferry.)

289
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:22,015
- Isn't that it? - I think it's that one.

290
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,954
- Gosh, it's very big. - It's so big.

291
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,255
(Gosh, it's very big.)

292
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,455
- They're waiting to get on. - I think so.

293
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:34,464
- This is a new experience, right? - That's right.

294
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,694
- Riding a big ferry? - Going to an island on a big ferry.

295
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,464
- It's our 1st time. - It's our 1st time.

296
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,905
(For the first time on the show, they go to work on a ferry.)

297
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,475
It'll be nice to go to Jeju Island.

298
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,644
- We can ride an airplane. - It'll be so nice to go there.

299
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,245
- Right? We can ride an airplane. - Yes.

300
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:53,915
(With high hopes, they get on the ferry to Soan Island.)

301
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,385
This is exciting.

302
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,755
(Exclaiming)

303
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,855
(The four siblings are very excited thanks to the ferry.)

304
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,284
It's so nice.

305
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:04,624
(My goodness)

306
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,724
The sea is so nice.

307
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,224
(The sea of Wando is better when it's seen from a boat.)

308
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,534
- The waves aren't so rough. - They aren't rough.

309
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:13,805
Compared to that time, the waves are weak.

310
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,805
(Sliding the door open)

311
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,574
- My goodness. - Gosh.

312
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:19,604
It's like a sauna.

313
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,505
- It's warm. - Gosh.

314
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,804
- I love it. - It's so warm.

315
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,445
(While the four siblings are excited about the fancy commute)

316
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:31,554
(Beeping)

317
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:34,455
(Whirring)

318
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:38,095
(The ferry is ready to set off.)

319
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,665
(It leaves the Hwaheungpo Port and sails to Soan Island.)

320
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,465
(Glancing over)

321
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,634
(Massaging)

322
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:49,834
It feels so good.

323
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:50,874
(Leader Yum gives the third sibling a massage.)

324
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,534
(The 3rd sibling gives the 2nd one a foot massage as a relay.)

325
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,705
Your feet are cute.

326
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,715
My feet are small.

327
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,914
(Jun Myun, massage my foot.)

328
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:03,745
(The youngest one sticks out his big foot.)

329
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:05,984
Seriously,

330
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:07,324
let's put our feet side by side.

331
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:09,424
- It's okay, Ji Yeon. - Our feet?

332
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,324
The size difference...

333
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,724
(Judging by the size difference, they're like the dad and daughter.)

334
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,285
- How are your feet so big? - How cute.

335
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:18,694
(The 3d sibling massages the 1st one's feet.)

336
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,935
(It feels so good.)

337
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:23,534
What should we do?

338
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,575
- Let's play a game. - Sure.

339
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:27,974
(A game?)

340
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:29,405
How about this one?

341
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:32,345
Something like this.

342
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,115
How does it work?

343
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,744
(The two younger siblings run out when their eyes meet.)

344
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:37,884
Here.

345
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,085
(The strong Ji Yeon versus The big-footed Jae Wook)

346
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,785
Why are your feet so big?

347
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,855
Why are your feet so big?

348
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,724
- Push with your feet. - Come on.

349
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:46,995
(Let me run away.)

350
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,125
You'll fly off.

351
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,265
Hey.

352
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:53,394
(They compete with seriousness even though it's nothing.)

353
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:55,764
(His face turns red.)

354
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:58,675
(Isn't that too fierce?)

355
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,044
(Fall over.)

356
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:04,215
(Come on!)

357
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,175
(Falling)

358
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,145
How are your feet so strong?

359
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,054
How are your feet so strong?

360
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,924
(Ji Yeon won.)

361
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,184
Let's have a match.

362
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,185
(Ji Yeon)

363
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:17,595
Hold this part.

364
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,855
Set, go.

365
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,524
(The two of them move their feet with fierceness.)

366
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,764
(Flustered)

367
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,894
- Your footwork... - It's no joke.

368
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:27,964
Jung Ah,

369
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,704
- what's up with your footwork? - My footwork...

370
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,574
(She throws Ji Yeon off with the footwork of Ronalso.)

371
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,375
- Footwork... - It's footwork.

372
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,475
Her fancy footwork...

373
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,544
(Yum-naldo's specialty is fancy footwork.)

374
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:37,814
- Footwork... Her fancy footwork... - It's footwork.

375
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,655
(It's a match between strength and technique.)

376
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,544
(The slapstick comedy ending)

377
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,284
(It's entertaining.)

378
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:46,554
I didn't push her.

379
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:47,755
(Laughing)

380
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,454
I'm exhausted.

381
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,895
I'm about to get a cramp in my feet.

382
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,924
- Jung Ah, let's get some rest. - Yes.

383
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,925
(They decide to get some rest before they arrive.)

384
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,895
I should look for a game.

385
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:01,165
(Ji Yeon wants to play some more.)

386
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,634
- You should get some rest. - Okay.

387
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:04,834
The day is long.

388
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,035
(The day is long.)

389
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:09,155
I should've rested when they told me to earlier.

390
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,265
I should've rested when they told me to earlier.

391
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:16,344
(Ragged breaths...)

392
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,515
(and complaints come out endlessly.)

393
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:23,725
(The legendary work of the four siblings)

394
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:27,565
(An impressive work that involves the big cranes and trucks)

395
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,865
I'm dying.

396
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,035
This is no joke.

397
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:35,575
(The ferry the 4 siblings are on sails for 1 hour.)

398
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:40,985
(It arrives at the Soan Port.)

399
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,385
The weather is so nice.

400
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:45,885
(What awaits the four siblings at Soan Island with a clear sky?)

401
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,484
We're here.

402
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,045
(What awaits the four siblings at Soan Island with a clear sky?)

403
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,094
- What sunlight. - Seriously.

404
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,135
- The weather is so nice. - The weather is so nice.

405
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:56,694
Shall we drive slowly?

406
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:57,894
- Okay. - That sounds good.

407
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:58,964
Let's go.

408
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,265
- Let's go. - Let's go.

409
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,965
How long is the drive from here?

410
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,805
- It's currently 57 minutes. - Just 10 minutes.

411
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,274
(My goodness)

412
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,315
- Look at the beautiful view. - It's so pretty.

413
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,474
Look at the color of the sea.

414
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,715
This place is so pretty.

415
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,245
Look at the color of the sea.

416
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:21,184
The water seems very clear.

417
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,825
This place is so pretty.

418
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,424
- It's so pretty. - Yes.

419
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,994
(The water sparkles under the sun.)

420
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:26,995
Seriously.

421
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,625
It'll be nice to navigate the island on a bicycle.

422
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,694
- This place is pretty. - It's pretty.

423
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,265
(The four siblings are on Soan Island.)

424
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,264
(It was one of the havens for the independence movement...)

425
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,375
(during the Japanese Occupation.)

426
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,705
(Many independence activists are from the island.)

427
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:49,685
(Even now, the Korean flags decorate the island 365 days a year.)

428
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:53,015
- It's a seaside village. - I know.

429
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:56,325
(They drive through the quiet Soan Island.)

430
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:59,095
What? Isn't that a mudflat?

431
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:01,524
- Isn't that a mudflat? - No.

432
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:02,995
- That's... - Isn't that a mudflat?

433
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:04,435
Oh, my.

434
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:06,464
- Hey. - What?

435
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,064
- What kind of a farm is that? - It's a farm.

436
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,535
- It's so cool. - It's an abalone farm.

437
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,374
- Is that an abalone farm? - It's an abalone farm.

438
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,144
Abalones are grown on boards.

439
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,844
- Really? - My goodness.

440
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,751
(Abalones grow in the floating cages inside the calm sea.)

441
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:21,545
(Will the four siblings work at an abalone farm?)

442
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,785
- I don't think it's an abalone. - There were abalones.

443
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:26,755
- My guess is hijiki or laver. - Yes.

444
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,924
Hijiki, laver, or seaweed.

445
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,285
- Something like that. - Yes.

446
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:37,325
(Which seasonal ingredient will the four siblings meet?)

447
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,794
I don't have a clue.

448
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,864
What if we get there and get diving suits?

449
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,064
(What if we get there and get diving suits?)

450
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:43,404
- How nice. - Oh, my.

451
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,935
I can't do that.

452
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,145
You're near the destination.

453
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,615
- What is it? - What can it be?

454
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,845
I honestly have no idea what we'll be doing.

455
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:56,884
What is it?

456
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,184
Mira fishing village...

457
00:18:58,185 --> 00:18:59,385
(Arriving with uneasy guesses)

458
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:02,435
Don't you think we'll be getting on a boat?

459
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,125
(Lee Jae Wook is afraid of getting on a boat.)

460
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,894
- Again? - What? Again?

461
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,095
(What sight awaits them?)

462
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,194
(Countless boats are anchored side by side on the sea.)

463
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,334
- What is this? - What could it be?

464
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,365
What's that?

465
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:14,905
(And...)

466
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,774
(there are giant cranes...)

467
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,334
I'm scared.

468
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,575
(of unknown purposes.)

469
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:26,575
(The four siblings head to the port after changing into work clothes.)

470
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,215
There are quite a few people here.

471
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:35,985
(Workers are busily carrying something.)

472
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:41,925
(What ingredient is waiting for the Fresh members today?)

473
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,234
It's laver.

474
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,135
Expecting around 110 bundles of laver.

475
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:52,305
- It's laver that hasn't dried yet. - I've never seen this before.

476
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,075
- Oh, my. - It's really pitch black.

477
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,314
(Today's seasonal ingredient...)

478
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,785
(has covered the boats in deep black.)

479
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:06,055
(The renowned laver of Soan Island)

480
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,555
(Cutting through the darkness that's like laver)

481
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:15,495
(Setting sail at 3am)

482
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:20,965
(Harvesting laver through the night at sea)

483
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:26,235
(Filling the boat to the brim with freshly gathered laver)

484
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,474
(Returning at 10am)

485
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:32,944
We'll begin the bidding.

486
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,245
Four bundles...

487
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:41,125
(Freshly harvested laver from dawn is auctioned right at the port.)

488
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,655
(Laver sold at auction is sent to land.)

489
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,254
(Today's task for the four siblings is...)

490
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:50,465
(laver unloading work.)

491
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,234
I have never seen such things.

492
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:54,581
- This is how it's done. - It's laver.

493
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:57,211
- You've never seen undried laver? - This is my first time seeing it.

494
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,335
So, this is what water laver looks like.

495
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:00,535
Welcome.

496
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,304
- Hello. - Hi.

497
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,444
Let's do our best.

498
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,475
- Okay. - Good luck.

499
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,544
- Good luck. - Good luck.

500
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,545
(Boarding with big dreams)

501
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,215
- Welcome aboard. - Yes.

502
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,984
- Hi. - Hello. Welcome.

503
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:14,554
- Hello. - Yes.

504
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,384
(Two people assigned to each boat)

505
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,195
Mr. Kim Dong Hoon...

506
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,154
Expecting around 70 bundles.

507
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,235
(Tension builds the moment they step onto the boat.)

508
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:25,364
(This is 14t per boat.)

509
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,205
(This is an incredible 28t in total.)

510
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,475
(All of this needs to be moved to land.)

511
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:34,805
Let's do our best.
- Okay. - Good luck.

512
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,004
(Laughing)

513
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,445
- We're good at what we do. - I see.

514
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:39,945
I like that.

515
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:41,685
(I like that confidence.)

516
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:43,985
(Since the auction just ended, )

517
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:47,485
(other workers are busily scooping up laver.)

518
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:49,324
Gosh, it's super slippery.

519
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:53,154
Expecting around 120 bundles.

520
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:54,555
(Gearing up before getting started)

521
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,224
- Let's give it our best. - Good luck.

522
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,235
Good luck.

523
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:03,365
(With a spirited shout, they begin raking.)

524
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:05,975
(Struggling)

525
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,175
(Groaning)

526
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:10,575
(Heavy)

527
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:14,785
(The seaweed is thick and sticky, making it hard to pull out.)

528
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:16,385
This is so heavy.

529
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:19,515
- This is way heavier than expected. - This is no joke.

530
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:22,884
This laver is really heavy.

531
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:25,395
(Even a single pull with the rake feels heavy.)

532
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,224
You have to put some real strength into it.

533
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,725
- Yes? - Press it down hard, like this.

534
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,435
Press it down hard, okay?

535
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,705
(Working hard)

536
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,605
Why is this thing so heavy?

537
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:42,044
It is supposed to be this heavy.

538
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,005
(The heavier it is, the deeper the rake goes in.)

539
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:48,715
(The rake alone weighs about 3kg.)

540
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:56,025
(The tangled laver needs to be pressed down with a heavy rake.)

541
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:01,024
(Raking is tough with the 3kg rake and all that laver.)

542
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:02,165
So much laver.

543
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:15,745
(They have to unload 14t of laver, which is an unimaginable weight.)

544
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:20,215
(Endless raking)

545
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,145
(Screaming)

546
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,615
- We can do it. - We can do this.

547
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,385
I can do it.

548
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:31,625
(I, Leader Yum, can do it too.)

549
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,494
You'll get a tasty reward soon. Good luck.

550
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:35,565
Okay.

551
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,424
If you want laver...

552
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,795
If you want laver, you can do it.

553
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,015
- The laver was really good. - It is delicious.

554
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,605
I have figured out the trick.

555
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,734
(Brimming with passion)

556
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:47,775
I will do it.

557
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,875
- I will do it. - You're good at this.

558
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:53,245
I will do it. Thank you.

559
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,384
Give me just one more, please.

560
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:56,385
(Passion)

561
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,585
You are really good.

562
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:58,685
I am really good.

563
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,225
(I'm in charge of the laver for the table.)

564
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:08,425
(Meanwhile, on the boat next door...)

565
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:10,394
- Let me give it a pull. - Okay.

566
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,695
Watch your step.

567
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,034
(Trying to pull the laver box)

568
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,504
Try doing it like this.

569
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,265
(Jun Myun tries pulling it first.)

570
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:19,075
Lift it like this first.

571
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,404
- Just leave it like this. - I can't do this.

572
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:22,405
I'll do it.

573
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,075
It's so heavy.

574
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,175
Let me do this.

575
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,514
(Jae Wook steps in.)

576
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,574
Gosh, you are good at this.

577
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:28,614
(Wobbling)

578
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:30,184
Oh, my. Good job.

579
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,255
Okay.

580
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,384
- So, lift it. Then flip it. - Yes.

581
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,255
You've already picked up the technique.

582
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:40,424
You are doing such a great job.

583
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,265
(Jae Wook is surprisingly strong and skilled.)

584
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:43,895
- One, two. - It is tough, isn't it?

585
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:45,465
It is really heavy.

586
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:49,164
(Shaking the pulled laver box into the sack)

587
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,205
Gosh, look at this.

588
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,875
(Groaning)

589
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,404
This is so heavy.

590
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:57,945
(Even two men struggle to lift it.)

591
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:00,944
How heavy is this thing?

592
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:02,614
(Each yellow box weighs...)

593
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,385
- It is 40kg. - What?

594
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,814
- Are you okay? - I'm good.

595
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,324
(I'm good with 40kg.)

596
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,384
- Shall I flip it over? - Yes.

597
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,024
Okay. Good job.

598
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:14,255
- You are so good at it. - This is no joke.

599
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:17,224
Gosh, Jae Wook.

600
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,471
(Jae Wook is showing some strength.)

601
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:19,795
You are good at it.

602
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:27,075
(It seems that 40kg is too much for Jun Myun.)

603
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:30,205
(In that case...)

604
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:32,544
Are you trying to move it with the rake?

605
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:33,615
- Yes. - Okay.

606
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,515
(Switching to raking)

607
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:45,355
(Jun Myun is raking, but with no results.)

608
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,835
At this rate, when are you going to finish it?

609
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:49,925
You need to pull it from a distance.

610
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:53,035
- Oh, my. - Like this?

611
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,465
(Pulling from a distance)

612
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,335
(Struggling)

613
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,274
(Struggling hard)

614
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:02,474
You need some technique.

615
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:04,474
You have to lightly hook it and pull.

616
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:07,315
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

617
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:10,144
When will you get it done at this rate?

618
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,385
Okay, let me do it.

619
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:17,785
(Not too deep, but not too shallow either)

620
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,024
It's all about technique when you scoop.

621
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:22,924
- It's then easier to pull it out. - Okay.

622
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,464
- And then pull it out perfectly. - I see.

623
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:25,465
Okay.

624
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,594
(As the locals showed her)

625
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:28,605
What's going on?

626
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:34,275
(In the midst of a lonely battle with the heavy laver)

627
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:39,614
(Folding and unfolding, over and over)

628
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:40,674
My back hurts.

629
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,145
(Her back starts to hurt.)

630
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:48,025
(The road ahead is long and difficult.)

631
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:53,295
Oh, my. Gosh, this is big.

632
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,594
(Jun Myun finally fills one box.)

633
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,525
Gosh. All right.

634
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,565
(Crying out)

635
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:03,564
(The laver of lament)

636
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:04,565
My nose is running.

637
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,504
(Jae Wook will handle the box.)

638
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,505
Okay. One, two.

639
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,544
(Filling the empty sack with the 40kg box)

640
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:12,545
One, two.

641
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,574
(Adding 1 more 40kg box)

642
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:15,584
One, two.

643
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:17,144
(Adding 2 more 40kg boxes)

644
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:19,584
(Adding 3 more 40kg boxes)

645
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:22,184
(Adding 4 more 40kg boxes)

646
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,185
One, two.

647
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:27,494
(Adding 5 more 40kg boxes)

648
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:31,195
(Adding 6 more 40kg boxes)

649
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,095
Oh, my.

650
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,365
- It's done. - Is this done?

651
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:38,155
- If you put in too much... - Is it going to be too heavy?

652
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:44,075
(The sack of laver is filled with 240kg at a time.)

653
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,615
(Sacks are filled before even realizing.)

654
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,855
Should we lift this up and continue?

655
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:56,385
Let's lift all 12 of these up.

656
00:27:57,525 --> 00:28:00,525
(A rope is coming down from the sky.)

657
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:04,225
(When the sacks of laver are stacked full, )

658
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:09,135
(it's the crane's turn to shine.)

659
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,505
- Like this? - Yes.

660
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,405
Four of them.

661
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,604
- Give it here. - Lay it down this way.

662
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,344
Slowly.

663
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:19,415
It's too much.

664
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:22,344
Put that down and lift it.

665
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:23,915
(Lifting it up)

666
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,725
(Sacks of laver that weigh 3t are lifted into the air.)

667
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:38,065
This is amazing.

668
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,435
(Impressed)

669
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:45,105
(The sacks of laver are being moved to shore.)

670
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:47,535
(Water is dripping from the laver.)

671
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,905
(Water is dripping from the laver.)

672
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:53,975
(They weren't expecting it at all.)

673
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,014
(Laver water is falling from the sky.)

674
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:57,145
Gosh.

675
00:28:58,415 --> 00:28:59,554
Be careful.

676
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:00,855
(What in the world?)

677
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,225
(Floating away)

678
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:06,845
It's like a laver-infused shower.

679
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,095
Let's call it the Wando laver-infused shower.

680
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:15,965
(The sacks of laver...)

681
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:23,874
(are placed on a large scale.)

682
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,315
(The scale)

683
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:31,445
(Once their weight is measured, the sacks of laver...)

684
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:37,025
(are loaded into a large truck.)

685
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,295
(Once a pile of laver that weighs 2.9t is taken away, )

686
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,495
One, two.

687
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:50,665
(they return to filling up the sacks.)

688
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,275
Two, three.

689
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,175
How is it going?

690
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:58,345
Good.

691
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:01,244
Two, three.

692
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:05,155
(He can still easily do more.)

693
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:09,525
What's your name?

694
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,055
- San. - San?

695
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,454
San, you're really strong.

696
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:14,754
(Jae Wook is working together with San.)

697
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:15,865
Two, three.

698
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,335
Here. You're good at this.

699
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:24,565
Gosh, you're good.

700
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:25,735
You should pull right now.
(Jae Wook feels proud to receive a compliment.)

701
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:27,835
One, two.

702
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:33,015
(While a local compliments Jae Wook, )

703
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:36,415
I think I'm quite good at this.

704
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,454
(Ji Yeon compliments herself.)

705
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:39,785
Gosh, okay.

706
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:46,225
(Strength Ji Yeon is putting the laver into the boxes.)

707
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:49,195
(Gosh)

708
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:52,494
(Exclaiming)

709
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:53,595
(Grunting)

710
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:54,834
(The physical labor is giving her bursts of adrenaline.)

711
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:56,205
Nice.

712
00:30:58,205 --> 00:31:01,975
(She speeds up along to her shouts.)

713
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:04,495
Ji Yeon, you're doing a good job.

714
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:07,115
(Full of energy)

715
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:10,385
Can you empty this out for me so I can keep going?

716
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:11,984
(40kg each)

717
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,015
(Surprised)

718
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,884
(An empty box)

719
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,125
Thank you.

720
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:23,465
(They're on the same boat but with different levels of energy.)

721
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:25,965
(Sighing)

722
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:30,865
(She keeps raking over and over.)

723
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:34,705
(The laver is too much for someone as weak as Jung Ah.)

724
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,814
(She has to use her arms to rake...)

725
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,214
(and her back to support herself, )

726
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,645
(as she uses her lower body to pull at the laver.)

727
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:51,855
(She's endlessly working out her entire body, )

728
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:58,065
(using all the muscles she normally doesn't use.)

729
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,494
(Shrieking)

730
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:03,011
(Jun Myun has a lot of muscles that she normally doesn't use.)

731
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:04,204
Gosh, my back.

732
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,685
(Jun Myun has a lot of muscles that she normally doesn't use.)

733
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:11,675
(Panting)

734
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,115
(Laughing)

735
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:16,843
(Panting)

736
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,453
(Laughing)

737
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:20,953
Your face is red.

738
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,552
- My face is red? - Here's some laver.

739
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:27,252
Gosh. You can't put laver on my face.

740
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:29,369
(She put laver on Jun Myun's face to help cool it down.)

741
00:32:29,393 --> 00:32:30,563
Goodness.

742
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,693
- How is it going? - Good.

743
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:34,963
Is it going well?

744
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,963
No, that's not...

745
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:39,973
Gosh.

746
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:41,603
(Panting)

747
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:44,772
(Groaning)

748
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:45,893
- You should pull... - Gosh.

749
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:47,743
Are you exhausted?

750
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:49,443
You seem so exhausted.

751
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,413
This isn't easy.

752
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,822
(Grunting)

753
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,952
(Struggling)

754
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:58,953
Darn it.

755
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,063
- All right. One, two, three. - Two.

756
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:06,193
We have to fill all of these up.

757
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,133
- Oh, dear.. - Goodness.

758
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:15,542
(Give me more laver)

759
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:19,642
Use your strength. Hurry up and pull. Fill the box.

760
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:22,583
(Rake deeper and deeper)

761
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,313
(Jae Wook is having a mental breakdown.)

762
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,053
(Fading away)

763
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:30,223
My back.

764
00:33:30,823 --> 00:33:31,823
It hurts so much.

765
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:33,492
(Today's memories will be unforgettable)

766
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:34,553
My back.

767
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:40,593
(They worked for 1 hour without taking a break, )

768
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,633
(but there's still more than half left.)

769
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:49,103
Gosh, I don't see an end.

770
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:52,973
- Let's hurry. - Okay.

771
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:55,882
- I can't work any faster. - You won't be paid.

772
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,042
You won't be paid.

773
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:58,213
Gosh, this is exhausting.

774
00:33:58,853 --> 00:33:59,853
Gosh.

775
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,123
It really is more than what I thought it'd be like.

776
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:08,623
(She's all out of energy.)

777
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,093
Gosh, this is insane.

778
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:14,592
My back hurts so much.

779
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:16,033
(Even Ji Yeon is getting exhausted.)

780
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,232
Jung Ah, does your back hurt too?

781
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,233
It does.

782
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,233
I guess I'm not the only one, then.

783
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,803
(She's quite exhausted.)

784
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:28,172
Goodness.

785
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:29,693
(Jun Myun has become limp like laver.)

786
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,213
Jun Myun, are you all right?

787
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:34,912
(No, I'm not.)

788
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:36,753
I don't think I'll be able to get up tomorrow.

789
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:39,134
My back hurts so much, it feels like it's about to break.

790
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,723
Gosh, this isn't an easy task.

791
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:43,193
(Screaming)

792
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:44,862
This is one of the most difficult works we've done.

793
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,562
(Loading and unloading 28t of laver is very difficult.)

794
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:48,523
This is the most difficult labor we've ever done.

795
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:51,663
It's hot, isn't it?

796
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:53,572
I should have worn lighter clothes.

797
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:56,373
I'm soaked in sweat right now.

798
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,102
(They're covered in sweat from hard work.)

799
00:34:58,103 --> 00:34:59,573
I usually don't sweat much.

800
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,282
San, let's go.

801
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,383
(Jae Wook tries to motivate himself and continues working hard.)

802
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:08,083
- Gosh, this is so heavy. - Two, three.

803
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:12,923
(But lifting 40kg boxes over and over isn't easy at all.)

804
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:19,663
(The young blood is eventually worn out too.)

805
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:23,103
- You're tired? - Yes, very.

806
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:27,333
This is why we were told to eat a lot.

807
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:31,043
I'm in trouble.

808
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,783
I should have taken a break when I could.

809
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:34,672
Gosh, I should have taken a break when I could.

810
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:36,213
(She's deeply regretting her choices.)

811
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,513
Jae Wook, you have to lie down on the boat later.

812
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:41,482
(We'll be sure to get some rest on our way back.)

813
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:43,203
- Later. - We won't be able to do anything.

814
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,853
One, two.

815
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:48,593
Catching fish was better.

816
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,522
- Catching fish was better? - Yes.

817
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,823
Have some water.

818
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,692
Okay. Water? You're giving us water too?

819
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:55,763
Thank you.

820
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:58,233
Thank you.

821
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,543
(Hydrating)

822
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:08,213
- You must be so tired. - No, I'm okay.

823
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:10,243
Gosh, thank you.

824
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:18,793
(An oasis in between heavy workloads)

825
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:23,063
(Gosh, that's better.)

826
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:30,503
(A sip of water is all it takes.)

827
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,233
I feel like the water tastes like laver.

828
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,113
Gosh, the women here are so strong.

829
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:42,413
We've been doing this every day...

830
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,682
for 40 years. It's natural to us now.

831
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:46,813
For 40 years? Gosh.

832
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:53,193
(The locals have been committed to this arduous labor for 40 years...)

833
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:59,163
(so that we can have fresh laver on our dinner table every day.)

834
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,593
I'm going to remember this every time I eat laver.

835
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:09,043
(This experience taught them about the hard work behind laver.)

836
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:10,243
Two, three.

837
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,913
- Let's keep up the good work. - Yes, ma'am.

838
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:16,382
- We got this. - We got this.

839
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,459
(Thanks to the local's cheer, Ji Yeon gets herself together.)

840
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,952
Nothing comes easy in life.

841
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:22,152
- Nothing comes easy in life. - Right.

842
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:23,153
(Wise words from the local)

843
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,623
Nothing comes easy in life.

844
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,193
Pull and pull.

845
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:31,063
(Pull and pull)

846
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:38,563
("Pull the Laver" by Son Jang Im)

847
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,233
Shake your buttocks as you work.

848
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,603
(Shaking)

849
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:47,063
- It's like we're working out. - Working out for our backs.

850
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:49,143
You have to exercise while you work.

851
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:53,853
(She's dancing to get rid of her back pain.)

852
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:56,783
Gosh. This work is hurting my back so much.

853
00:37:57,123 --> 00:37:58,453
Let's cheer ourselves on.

854
00:37:58,753 --> 00:37:59,822
- We got this. - We got this.

855
00:37:59,823 --> 00:38:01,099
- Honestly, we didn't... - Goodness.

856
00:38:01,123 --> 00:38:02,722
Say that wholeheartedly.

857
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:04,063
(I just want to dance around.)

858
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,462
I almost got too excited.

859
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,133
(Groaning)

860
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:13,303
(Raking passionately)

861
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:18,913
(They're slowly moving forward.)

862
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:21,373
(Sighing)

863
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:25,583
(Leader Yum is in need of the backache dance too.)

864
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:29,723
(She's drained of all energy.)

865
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:34,023
(Dragging)

866
00:38:35,823 --> 00:38:40,063
(The laver is too heavy for paper-thin Jung Ah.)

867
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:44,503
(Sniffling)

868
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:47,133
(Leader Yum is at her limit.)

869
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:48,532
Are you okay?

870
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:49,843
No, I don't think I am.

871
00:38:50,173 --> 00:38:51,743
(Ji Yeon gives her a quick massage.)

872
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,512
(Jung Ah falls to the ground.)

873
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,143
- Is your back okay? - No.

874
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:58,913
This job is intense.

875
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:04,123
Our team is definitely doing well.

876
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:08,353
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon's boat has a long way to go.)

877
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,623
(Taking a look to check)

878
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:14,233
(Walking over to them)

879
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,233
(Are they all right?)

880
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:20,973
Are you okay?

881
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,673
Jung Ah is not okay.

882
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:25,713
(At her limit)

883
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:29,543
(Jae Wook quietly picks up a rake.)

884
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:34,083
(Raking nonstop)

885
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:42,563
(Jae Wook works hard on Jung Ah's behalf.)

886
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:46,093
(Grunting)

887
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,163
(I should pull myself together.)

888
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,973
(Leader Yum motivates herself by watching her younger siblings.)

889
00:39:57,273 --> 00:40:00,013
(You've got this, Leader Yum.)

890
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:08,152
(Thanks to Jae Wook, )

891
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,523
(they are now toward loading the last of the laver piles.)

892
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:13,652
(They're almost at the end.)

893
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,563
We're nearing the end. I can see it.

894
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:18,933
(We're almost there.)

895
00:40:19,663 --> 00:40:21,232
Do I have a lot on my face?

896
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,432
(Do I have a lot on my face?)

897
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:23,832
Like on my nose.

898
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,702
(I'll wipe it off for you.)

899
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:27,833
(Just kidding!)

900
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,443
(Let me do the same for the other side.)

901
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,043
(They're adorable.)

902
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:37,513
You're still pretty with laver on your face.

903
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:40,063
You're too good-looking for that to get in your way.

904
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,983
(Jae Wook gets his revenge.)

905
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,222
(The younger members have fun with laver.)

906
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:48,653
Isn't she pretty?

907
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:51,092
Gosh, you're so pretty.

908
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,373
(Save some laver for your skin.)

909
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,893
Here.

910
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,703
No.

911
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:58,633
(Grinning)

912
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,332
(Let me get back to work.)

913
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,973
(Let me get back to work too.)

914
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:06,813
(Grunting)

915
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,643
(Working hard)

916
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:14,552
Are you okay?

917
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:15,822
(Are you okay?)

918
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:16,923
I'm okay.

919
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:20,493
- Are you exhausted? - I'm okay.

920
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,222
May I ask how old you are?

921
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:24,323
I'm 70.

922
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,033
Goodness.

923
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,793
I'm not exhausted at all.

924
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:33,873
(Even if I am, I won't let it show.)

925
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:38,473
At 2am, we come here to load the boats with laver.

926
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:41,643
- You came here at 2am? - Yes.

927
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:42,912
Goodness.

928
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:44,112
Does that mean...

929
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:46,483
you've been doing this since 2am?

930
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:50,752
We usually come back at around 7am.

931
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:53,353
(Every day, they work from 2am until the sun is high in the sky.)

932
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:57,122
(With the locals cheering them on, )

933
00:41:57,123 --> 00:41:59,333
(Jae Wook uses his last bit of strength.)

934
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:04,703
(Right next to Jae Wook, who won't give up, )

935
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:08,703
(is Strength Ji Yeon, )

936
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:13,143
(resilient Leader Yum, )

937
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,583
(and Jun Myun, who is as limp as water laver.)

938
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:21,913
(After using up all of their remaining strength together, )

939
00:42:22,853 --> 00:42:26,023
(they've reached the end.)

940
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,852
(Walking back to his boat)

941
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:31,623
(Jae Wook returns to his boat now that their paces are even.)

942
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,832
(The progress of this boat is almost near the end too.)

943
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,033
You're so good at this.

944
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:37,033
You might get sick later.

945
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:38,963
- Right? - Sick?

946
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:44,003
(Jae Wook still works hard until the end.)

947
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:51,243
(He rakes up every piece of laver hidden in the corners.)

948
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,513
There's not much left now.

949
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:56,753
I can do this.

950
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,483
I can do this.

951
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,022
I can do this.

952
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:01,193
(She's hyping herself up.)

953
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:05,763
(It's not over...)

954
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:07,292
You're too tall for this.

955
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,792
(until it's over.)

956
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,303
You're too tall to be under here.

957
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:12,703
Rake them in.

958
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,543
(His back is bent from his passionate labor.)

959
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:20,112
(Using all his strength)

960
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,512
Gosh, you're a real man.

961
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:22,612
(Laughing)

962
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,143
That's awesome.

963
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:27,553
(This is really the end.)

964
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:29,452
Get ready.

965
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:30,982
(Get ready.)

966
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,153
(Pulling out the very last box)

967
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:36,623
We have to make sure we rake everything.

968
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:39,833
(For 3 long hours, )

969
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:41,692
(they raked the laver...)

970
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:43,963
(and filled the sacks.)

971
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,502
(The boats were full of 28t of laver.)

972
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,743
(They have completed unloading them.)

973
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:51,872
Over there.

974
00:43:51,873 --> 00:43:53,273
(Once the sacks are tied up, )

975
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,342
(the last set of laver sacks is moved to shore.)

976
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,213
You did a great job finishing up.

977
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:02,352
(Goodbye, )

978
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:04,953
(last set of laver sacks.)

979
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:07,952
(All the laver has been removed from the boats.)

980
00:44:07,953 --> 00:44:11,223
Goodness. Thank you for your hard work today.

981
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:13,562
Please enjoy the snack we've prepared.

982
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,033
- The snack? - Yes.

983
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,162
The snack?

984
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:18,532
Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

985
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:19,932
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

986
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:21,933
(The arduous task of unloading the laver is over.)

987
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,443
You did a great job.

988
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:26,773
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

989
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:28,842
- Take care of yourselves. - Thank you.

990
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:30,513
- Thank you. - Thank you.

991
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,483
- We have so much respect for you. - Yes.

992
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:35,383
- You're amazing. - You're amazing.

993
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,173
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

994
00:44:38,483 --> 00:44:39,892
You did well.

995
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,552
- Thank you for your hard work. - You're about to cry.

996
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,722
- You're about to cry. - Thank you for your hard work.

997
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,022
Thank you for your hard work.

998
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:45,122
San!

999
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,933
(Goodbye)

1000
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:48,262
You did well, Jung Ah.

1001
00:44:48,263 --> 00:44:50,563
Goodness, this was the hardest one yet.

1002
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:52,832
It was so intense.

1003
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,202
(They finally finished unloading 28t of laver from the boats.)

1004
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:56,772
Thank you for your hard work.

1005
00:44:56,773 --> 00:44:59,293
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1006
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,213
(Sighing)

1007
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:05,683
(The four siblings finally return to shore.)

1008
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,783
Repeatedly sitting and standing is a struggle.

1009
00:45:09,183 --> 00:45:11,683
- My body is aching right away. - Right.

1010
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:13,222
- Gosh. - My body is...

1011
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:15,453
My entire body hurts already.

1012
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:17,023
Goodness.

1013
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:19,492
(They carry their worn-out bodies across the port.)

1014
00:45:19,493 --> 00:45:20,732
Which way are we going? That way?

1015
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:21,963
This way.

1016
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,363
Gosh, is that ramyeon?

1017
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:26,732
Did you say ramyeon?

1018
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:27,902
- It's ramyeon and gimbap. - Ramyeon and gimbap.

1019
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:28,932
Gimbap!

1020
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:31,042
- Gimbap! - Gimbap!

1021
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:33,172
(This is great!)

1022
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,743
How amazing.

1023
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:38,053
(A table full of food for the four hardworking siblings)

1024
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,452
Did the ladies make these?

1025
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:42,413
They put in a lot of effort into them.

1026
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,282
Goodness.

1027
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,759
(The ramyeon compliments the gimbap perfectly.)

1028
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:49,523
(Sweet and sour broth meets fresh water laver.)

1029
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:53,162
- It's cold laver soup. - It's a soup.

1030
00:45:53,163 --> 00:45:55,723
(The cold raw laver soup is perfect for quenching their thirst.)

1031
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,662
It's all made with laver.

1032
00:45:57,663 --> 00:45:58,733
(And water laver?)

1033
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:01,132
This is raw water laver.

1034
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,473
- Eating it raw. - Eating it raw?

1035
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:05,502
I tasted the laver while we were working...

1036
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:06,919
- and the texture was nice. - Right.

1037
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:08,912
- Goodness, thank you. - You all worked so hard.

1038
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:10,393
Thank you so much for your hard work.

1039
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:11,882
I made some pancakes.

1040
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:12,912
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1041
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:14,552
I made this with water laver. Enjoy.

1042
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:16,923
- You all deserve it. - Thank you for the food.

1043
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:21,493
(The thick pancake is full of water laver.)

1044
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:24,663
You'll never get to have ramyeon that tastes like this anywhere else.

1045
00:46:24,723 --> 00:46:27,732
Putting fresh water laver in it turns it into a delicacy.

1046
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:29,533
- Put the water laver inside? - Yes.

1047
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,702
- That sounds amazing. - It is.

1048
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:33,172
I was wondering what this was for.

1049
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,203
- It's for the ramyeon. - I see.

1050
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:36,902
I can't wait to taste it.

1051
00:46:36,903 --> 00:46:38,102
(Water laver ramyeon and water laver pancake...)

1052
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:39,343
(are Soan Island's delicacies.)

1053
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:41,813
- I've been wanting to try this. - Try what?

1054
00:46:42,073 --> 00:46:43,383
Sitting right by the port...

1055
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:45,112
- Really? - and eating ramyeon.

1056
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:46,812
You've wanted to do this? I see.

1057
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:47,883
(How adorable.)

1058
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:51,123
(I'll make a romantic ramyeon.)

1059
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,693
How many ramyeon packets should we use?

1060
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:56,693
- Three? - Let's put in four.

1061
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,383
Here, that makes it four packets.

1062
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:02,293
(They put in the right amount of seasoning for the amount of water.)

1063
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,262
(The familiar smell of ramyeon is so good.)

1064
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:06,602
The smell of a brand ramyeon.

1065
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,002
(The familiar smell of ramyeon is so good.)

1066
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:09,343
Let's hurry up and eat this.

1067
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,053
We'll take our time with the ramyeon.

1068
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,473
Thank you for the food.

1069
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:16,283
(They begin with the cold raw laver soup to satisfy their thirst.)

1070
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:18,882
The seasoned laver.

1071
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:20,012
(Jung Ah takes the first bite since she was dehydrated.)

1072
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:21,083
Nice.

1073
00:47:21,553 --> 00:47:24,383
(This is incredible!)

1074
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:27,553
(Ji Yeon takes a bite too.)

1075
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:28,722
It's so flavorful.

1076
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:30,693
(The flavor spreads through their tired bodies.)

1077
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:32,192
Jae Wook, try it.

1078
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:33,593
Gosh. Thank you for the food.

1079
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:36,102
- My hand is shaking. - It's shaking so much.

1080
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,403
(Jae Wook's hand is shaking.)

1081
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,673
- My hand is shaking. - It's shaking so much.

1082
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:42,603
My hand is shaking.

1083
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:45,043
- What's wrong with me? - His hand is shaking.

1084
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,642
You worked so hard.

1085
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:49,042
- I know. - He lifted heavy things, right?

1086
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:50,043
He did.

1087
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:51,483
(Cool)

1088
00:47:51,813 --> 00:47:55,353
(The cold raw laver soup is perfect after hard work!)

1089
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,423
(Jun Myun is getting a big piece of water laver pancake.)

1090
00:47:59,183 --> 00:48:01,322
- Yes. -Thanks.

1091
00:48:01,323 --> 00:48:02,423
(Eating it in one bite)

1092
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,633
(Savoring it with a full mouth)

1093
00:48:06,893 --> 00:48:09,533
(This tastes...)

1094
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:12,833
(Getting another big piece of water laver pancake)

1095
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:14,702
(Everyone needs to taste it.)

1096
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:15,703
Try this pancake.

1097
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:19,923
- The pancake tastes good. Try it. - It's tasty.

1098
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:23,513
It's so good.

1099
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:25,483
It's really savory.

1100
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:27,263
- It's really savory, right? - It is.

1101
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:30,283
This is really good.

1102
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,623
It has a lot of laver in it.

1103
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:39,063
(Tiredness from hard work fades away with savory water laver pancake.)

1104
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:44,562
(Enjoy laver after hard work.)

1105
00:48:44,563 --> 00:48:45,563
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

1106
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,003
- If they give us laver, - Yes?

1107
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:50,242
- let's make water laver pancakes. - Sure.

1108
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:51,843
- This is so good. - Yes, it's good.

1109
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:53,573
- I think we can make it... - Yes.

1110
00:48:53,574 --> 00:48:54,654
- with flour batter. - Yes.

1111
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:56,583
I'll make batter.

1112
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,983
Okay. Ji Yeon will be in charge of making batter from now on.

1113
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:01,813
Call me Batter Im.

1114
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:05,053
Batter Im.

1115
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:06,494
(Batter Im, Master of handmade food)

1116
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:09,993
(I'm looking forward to it, Batter Im.)

1117
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:12,763
Did they make this?

1118
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:13,863
It's amazing.

1119
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:17,033
(Having a piece of gimbap made sincerely)

1120
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:20,033
I wanted to have gimbap while working earlier.

1121
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:25,103
(While enjoying other dishes, the ramyeon is coming to a boil.)

1122
00:49:25,573 --> 00:49:27,113
(Glancing)

1123
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:28,773
Add the laver to it now.

1124
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:29,882
(Come on)

1125
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,913
- This is good. - Let's eat after adding it.

1126
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:34,113
Add it all. Just pour it.

1127
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:35,682
- All of it? - Yes. Pour it all.

1128
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:36,683
(Timing is crucial.)

1129
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:40,283
Let's eat ramyeon when it's slightly undercooked.

1130
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:42,822
Yes, generously.

1131
00:49:42,823 --> 00:49:44,362
(Half water laver and half ramyeon)

1132
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:45,892
- It looks good. - Yes.

1133
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:48,174
(Add it when the noodles are cooked and eat immediately.)

1134
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:50,762
Can I have just a little bit?

1135
00:49:50,763 --> 00:49:52,243
(I can't wait. Give me a little bit.)

1136
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,273
Just taste it for now.

1137
00:49:55,873 --> 00:50:00,243
(Is it just for the tasting?)

1138
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:05,113
(Soan Island's specialty, ramyeon with laver)

1139
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:13,853
Try it now.

1140
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:17,139
- I want it slightly undercooked. - I also like it that way.

1141
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:18,893
(Swallowing it)

1142
00:50:19,593 --> 00:50:20,593
Jung Ah.

1143
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:22,663
With laver, the flavor gets...

1144
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:24,262
- Is it good? - Yes, it gets more savory.

1145
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:26,583
(Unstoppable and rich savory flavor of ramyeon with laver)

1146
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:29,203
(For Ji Yeon)

1147
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:31,273
It's hot.

1148
00:50:31,703 --> 00:50:33,942
(Tasting the soup first)

1149
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:34,943
(So good)

1150
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,713
(Exhilarating)

1151
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:38,913
This tastes so good.

1152
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,613
Is it still undercooked?

1153
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:41,883
I like it a lot.

1154
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:48,153
It's slightly undercooked.

1155
00:50:48,154 --> 00:50:50,023
(It's gone after chewing 4 times.)

1156
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,832
(Refreshing)

1157
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:54,833
It was undercooked.

1158
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,762
- I can't eat it... - Is it really good?

1159
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,763
When it's undercooked.

1160
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:01,303
(Eating before feeling dizzy)

1161
00:51:01,673 --> 00:51:03,343
(Swallowing it in under a second)

1162
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,442
(It's good.)

1163
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:07,219
- It's chewy. - It tastes much better with laver.

1164
00:51:07,243 --> 00:51:08,243
It's amazing.

1165
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:09,613
- It's unbelievable. - So good.

1166
00:51:09,614 --> 00:51:11,943
(Unbelievably savory and spicy flavor)

1167
00:51:12,613 --> 00:51:15,513
(Healing physical pain from moving 40kg boxes)

1168
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:20,523
(The perfect pairing of ramyeon and green onion kimchi)

1169
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:25,123
(Will Leader Yum like it?)

1170
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:29,062
- It's good. - Isn't it?

1171
00:51:29,063 --> 00:51:30,163
(It suits Jung Ah's taste.)

1172
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:32,463
(Drinking)

1173
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,132
(The savory flavor makes her sit up straight.)

1174
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,502
- Ramyeon with laver is really good. - It's so good.

1175
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:39,819
(Jun Myun and Jae Wook are so into ramyeon.)

1176
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:42,813
(They both are swallowing it.)

1177
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,443
(Jung Ah is watching them eat.)

1178
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:47,082
Let me have it a bit more.

1179
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,083
(Getting a refill)

1180
00:51:48,853 --> 00:51:52,183
(Ramyeon with fresh laver flavor)

1181
00:51:53,053 --> 00:51:55,593
(Hard work gave them a big appetite.)

1182
00:51:56,053 --> 00:51:59,023
(I work because of this moment!)

1183
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:01,493
(Amazing taste)

1184
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,703
(Slurping)

1185
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,273
Jae Wook, just eat.

1186
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:10,702
I want to fill my bowl.

1187
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:12,943
(Generous amount)

1188
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:14,913
I want to eat more.

1189
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,073
Just keep eating yours. I can get it myself.

1190
00:52:18,443 --> 00:52:19,443
That's enough.

1191
00:52:19,913 --> 00:52:21,152
(Jun Myun returns to her seat, feeling satisfied.)

1192
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:23,182
This is... What, Jung Ah?

1193
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,183
(Laughing)

1194
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,323
You got it a lot.

1195
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:26,623
Did I?

1196
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:29,762
- We should eat a lot, Jung Ah. - She's cute.

1197
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:31,299
(When life gives you laver, eat a lot.)

1198
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:33,663
- Ramyeon with laver is really good. - It's so good.

1199
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,633
(Something came to her mind while eating)

1200
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:41,173
How challenging was the work today?

1201
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,319
- One of the most challenging works. - Was it?

1202
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:44,343
It was.

1203
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:46,183
It was the hardest work of all time.

1204
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:48,942
- Of all time? - Yes, for physical labor.

1205
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:50,759
(The hardest labor of all time, even for experienced members)

1206
00:52:50,783 --> 00:52:51,842
What if I can't wake up tomorrow?

1207
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:53,653
My back hurts a lot. I'm worried.

1208
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:55,783
(Healing it with gimbap)

1209
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:56,982
(When we are worn out)

1210
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:58,253
It tastes good.

1211
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:00,293
Should we get abalones, then?

1212
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:02,153
- Let's see how much we earned. - Okay.

1213
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:05,523
I think abalones are expensive. Can we get them?

1214
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,332
- Just buy four, then. - Jung Ah.

1215
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,662
- Only four? - I think...

1216
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,232
- Four abalones? - Jung Ah.

1217
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:11,233
Four abalones.

1218
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:12,663
We're having a guest tomorrow.

1219
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,503
- Why don't we serve... - Yes, we should.

1220
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:17,323
- abalones to a guest? - Four isn't enough.

1221
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:18,842
- Today... - We might work to pick...

1222
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:19,943
abalones tomorrow.

1223
00:53:21,113 --> 00:53:22,673
I don't think so.

1224
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:26,883
(Happy Ji Yeon, thinking of eating abalones)

1225
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:30,923
(Happy Jae Wook, eating ramyeon with laver)

1226
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:32,823
I'm so happy.

1227
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,293
(Exhaustion faded after enjoying delicious food.)

1228
00:53:38,763 --> 00:53:39,763
Thank you for your hard work...

1229
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,333
on collecting laver today.

1230
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:44,233
I'll give you daily pay for today's work.

1231
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:46,133
I'll get it.

1232
00:53:46,134 --> 00:53:47,502
(Jae Wook is getting it.)

1233
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:48,503
Thanks.

1234
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,942
- How much would we be getting paid? - Give it to me.

1235
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:53,349
(Reminding them of today's hard work)

1236
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,643
It seems thick.

1237
00:53:55,513 --> 00:53:57,643
(Is it thick?)

1238
00:53:58,513 --> 00:53:59,642
I hope they gave me a lot.

1239
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:01,583
(They might give us a lot.)

1240
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:04,823
- It's too little. - Yes!

1241
00:54:05,153 --> 00:54:06,393
- What? - It's too little.

1242
00:54:07,323 --> 00:54:10,222
Three, four, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1243
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:11,362
- Fifteen, sixteen. - Is it sixteen?

1244
00:54:11,363 --> 00:54:13,609
- Four times four is sixteen. - Forty dollars per person.

1245
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:14,693
I can't believe this.

1246
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:18,523
My back pain deserves more than 40 dollars.

1247
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:20,632
Isn't it supposed to be twice this? So, we went back and forth.

1248
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:21,703
Forty dollars?

1249
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:23,303
It's not easy.

1250
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:29,143
(Remembering all the labor)

1251
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:30,943
This is unbelievable.

1252
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:33,953
(My back was screaming in pain.)

1253
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:36,683
(It's not a happy smile.)

1254
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:39,283
It makes me think money is so valuable.

1255
00:54:39,723 --> 00:54:40,723
(Don't be disappointed just yet.)

1256
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:41,852
- Thanks for your hard work today. - I'll take it.

1257
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:44,162
Since four of you worked,

1258
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:45,339
I got some water laver for you.

1259
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:47,462
- Let's make pancakes with it. - Okay.

1260
00:54:47,463 --> 00:54:48,509
(Fresh water laver that you can have only here)

1261
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:51,262
Wando is famous for abalones.

1262
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:52,462
(Another gift! Abalones, Wando's specialty)

1263
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,932
- I also got abalones for you. - It's abalones!

1264
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:56,543
I hope you enjoy it.

1265
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:58,202
(Jun Myun is touched by abalones.)

1266
00:54:58,203 --> 00:54:59,242
Thank you.

1267
00:54:59,243 --> 00:55:00,642
- Thank you. - Thanks for your work.

1268
00:55:00,643 --> 00:55:02,672
- Thank you! - Thanks for your work.

1269
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:03,712
Thanks for your work.

1270
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,233
- We don't need to buy abalones. - No.

1271
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:06,983
Grilled abalone with butter!

1272
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,952
Come on. Can you get all of this...

1273
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:12,282
- in a frame? - All of this?

1274
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:13,692
- Yes, with ramyeon as well. - Okay.

1275
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:15,023
I'll be a Jimmy Jib.

1276
00:55:15,953 --> 00:55:17,892
- Is the ramyeon in it? - Of course.

1277
00:55:17,893 --> 00:55:18,993
(With abalones)

1278
00:55:19,623 --> 00:55:22,533
One, two, three.

1279
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:25,702
(The challenging third task was...)

1280
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:27,102
(also completed with gratitude.)

1281
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:28,133
One, two, three.

1282
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:31,702
(Unloading completed)

1283
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,343
(The water laver that was unloaded today)

1284
00:55:35,813 --> 00:55:41,153
(Undergoing a cleaning process at the processing plant)

1285
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:46,323
(Drying each sheet thoroughly)

1286
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:51,293
(After that, it turns into the dried laver we know.)

1287
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:55,232
(After a long journey, )

1288
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:58,003
(it comes to our dinner table.)

1289
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:03,573
(Fresh members are leaving Soan Island now.)

1290
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:06,673
- Get some sleep. - Yes.

1291
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:08,443
I feel like I'd faint.

1292
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:10,742
(When you all go to sleep...)

1293
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,842
I'll have some fun alone.

1294
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:14,212
No, Jung Ah.

1295
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:16,373
- Save your energy. - Sleep without worrying about me.

1296
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:18,952
Jung Ah, please save your energy.

1297
00:56:18,953 --> 00:56:20,292
I'm feeling recharged now.

1298
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,522
- I can't believe it. - I'm sorry.

1299
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:22,523
I can't believe it.

1300
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:23,893
I'll do nothing, then.

1301
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:27,763
- I'll look at my phone. - Jung Ah is always full of energy.

1302
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,633
It takes almost an hour. Get some sleep.

1303
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,472
We're boarding the boat in a car.

1304
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,879
(They're on board, listening to Jung Ah's advice.)

1305
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:36,742
- Good work today. - Good work.

1306
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,603
- Bye. - Good work today.

1307
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:42,873
(Fresh members entered the cabin with their weary bodies.)

1308
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:44,112
(Lying down)

1309
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:45,142
Step on my back.

1310
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:46,182
(Step on my back.)

1311
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:47,183
I'll do that.

1312
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:48,629
(Having back pain after raking hundreds of times)

1313
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:51,623
(Human massage ball)

1314
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:53,023
Can you step on me, Jae Wook?

1315
00:56:54,093 --> 00:56:56,293
(Grunting)

1316
00:56:57,593 --> 00:56:58,593
It feels good.

1317
00:56:58,594 --> 00:56:59,834
(Fresh Massage Parlor is open.)

1318
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:01,362
We suddenly worked too much.

1319
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:03,232
- We suddenly overused our backs. - You're right.

1320
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:04,962
(Feeling good)

1321
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,872
Yes, that's it. You should press that area.

1322
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:07,873
Oh, my gosh.

1323
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:10,173
(Stepping on Jae Wook's back like walking on a tightrope)

1324
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:13,142
(Satisfied)

1325
00:57:13,143 --> 00:57:15,973
(Massaging Ji Yeon to a rhythm)

1326
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:19,112
You're really good at it.

1327
00:57:19,113 --> 00:57:20,582
(Fresh Massage Parlor is closed.)

1328
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:21,583
Isn't it feeling good?

1329
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:26,022
(Feeling much better after getting a massage)

1330
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:27,023
Get some sleep.

1331
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:28,653
(Let me get some sleep now.)

1332
00:57:29,023 --> 00:57:31,563
(Ji Yeon, without back pain, )

1333
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:35,893
(goes to sleep next to Jun Myun, who fell asleep earlier.)

1334
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:40,103
(Staring)

1335
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:41,903
(Turning)

1336
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,343
They always sleep in the same position.

1337
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:49,612
Always.

1338
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:52,413
(Sleeping always in the same position)

1339
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:55,412
(Cute sisters)

1340
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:58,952
(A new photo of two sisters napping is added.)

1341
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:01,123
(Taking one more photo)

1342
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:04,793
(Sleeping sisters in Wando)

1343
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:09,033
(While getting some rest)

1344
00:58:10,263 --> 00:58:12,743
(The boat sails through the sea, following the morning route.)

1345
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:16,743
(Arriving at Hwaheungpo Port, where they met in the morning)

1346
00:58:18,973 --> 00:58:23,213
(Let's go home!)

1347
00:58:23,883 --> 00:58:26,812
I was told to go in...

1348
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:28,112
and get the laver inside,

1349
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:29,752
so I went in between the laver.

1350
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:30,982
- Inside? - Yes.

1351
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:33,653
I couldn't even move because it was so slippery.

1352
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:37,592
I got confused about whether I was holding laver...

1353
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:38,822
or I had become laver.

1354
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:40,233
(Which one is laver?)

1355
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,193
Jung Ah, I started to feel hungry.

1356
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:45,132
I ate a lot for lunch earlier.

1357
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:46,773
- With ramyeon? - Yes, and gimbap.

1358
00:58:47,173 --> 00:58:50,003
I had little appetite then because I was so tired.

1359
00:58:50,873 --> 00:58:55,813
(Remembering lunchtime)

1360
00:58:58,343 --> 00:58:59,443
What?

1361
00:58:59,613 --> 00:59:01,212
Carbohydrates make me happy.

1362
00:59:01,213 --> 00:59:02,912
(I haven't had it enough.)

1363
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:05,322
She's going to cook something with carbohydrates today.

1364
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:06,992
We're having pasta today.

1365
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:09,693
What did you say we'd have with pork belly?

1366
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:11,692
- Kimchi. - Fresh kimchi.

1367
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:13,433
Fresh kimchi. I need to make it.

1368
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:16,733
(Excited for today's seasonal dishes after hard work)

1369
00:59:17,703 --> 00:59:21,172
(They're out of downtown.)

1370
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:23,902
(Staring at the GPS map)

1371
00:59:23,903 --> 00:59:25,942
It looks like the house is by the sea.

1372
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:28,373
I think so. I can see it now. Look at the view.

1373
00:59:29,913 --> 00:59:31,312
It's beautiful.

1374
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:33,283
(The sea is at a distance.)

1375
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:36,923
(Getting close to the sea)

1376
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:38,753
I think the house is right by the sea.

1377
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:42,122
(Excited)

1378
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:43,392
(Exclaiming)

1379
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,722
- Oh, my gosh. - Where are we?

1380
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:47,733
Are you going to a vacation house or what?

1381
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:49,133
It's amazing, Jung Ah.

1382
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,662
(Wide ocean view)

1383
00:59:51,663 --> 00:59:54,033
- It's incredible. - This is so nice.

1384
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,842
It's so beautiful. I can see the sea as much as I want.

1385
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,743
(The beautiful coastal road feels like heading to a secret house.)

1386
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:03,983
(Picturesque view with mountain and sea)

1387
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:06,583
It feels like I'm at the edge of the land.

1388
01:00:09,783 --> 01:00:12,423
This is unbelievable.

1389
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:16,523
I will definitely go for a run.

1390
01:00:18,123 --> 01:00:19,962
Ji Yeon is excited about going for a run.

1391
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,733
(Happy)

1392
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:27,702
(The long coastal road is perfect for running.)

1393
01:00:27,703 --> 01:00:29,573
How come that tree looks like that?

1394
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:35,013
(Impressed)

1395
01:00:38,683 --> 01:00:44,083
(Passing under the mysteriously big tree)

1396
01:00:44,323 --> 01:00:46,553
How did they form a village like this?

1397
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:48,523
It's so beautiful.

1398
01:00:51,623 --> 01:00:54,233
(Surrounded by the beautiful South Sea)

1399
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:58,403
(With a small port)

1400
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:03,073
(Small fishing village in Wando, Yeongpung Village)

1401
01:01:04,143 --> 01:01:06,643
(Inside the village, there is a cluster of houses.)

1402
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:11,913
(There are also adorable friends.)

1403
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,323
(Winding shoreline)

1404
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,452
(A haven for seagulls…)

1405
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:23,093
(and migratory birds)

1406
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:27,763
(Workplace for the village people)

1407
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:34,533
(We're going to stay here for a while.)

1408
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:36,303
- Look at that. - Here we are.

1409
01:01:36,703 --> 01:01:39,173
- Get out. Thanks for driving. - Yes.

1410
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:43,312
- This place is... - I can't believe this.

1411
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:44,582
This place is so beautiful.

1412
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,223
(We'd better get out of the car quickly.)

1413
01:01:46,513 --> 01:01:47,712
(Opening the car door, following Jung Ah)

1414
01:01:47,713 --> 01:01:49,013
I can smell the sea.

1415
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:52,053
(Surprised)

1416
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:57,263
(Smelling the sea without thinking)

1417
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:00,492
It's seaweed.

1418
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:01,592
(The blue sea of Wando behind the waving seaweed)

1419
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,063
This is awesome.

1420
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:12,043
Can we look around before going home?

1421
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:16,443
Oh, my gosh.

1422
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:18,642
- This is just so beautiful. - Where is it?

1423
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:20,189
(Even more beautiful seen outside of the car)

1424
01:02:20,213 --> 01:02:21,452
Jung Ah, come here.

1425
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:23,452
(The beautiful view. And here she comes.)

1426
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,282
- Jung Ah, let's take a photo here. - Let's take a picture.

1427
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,022
(Photographer Yum?)

1428
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:29,552
- Did you just say to take a photo? - Yes. We should take a photo.

1429
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:32,422
- She rarely asks to take a picture. - Let's take a picture.

1430
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:33,692
She asked to take a picture.

1431
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:35,132
Look at this seaweed.

1432
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:36,573
(Even Jung Ah wants to take a photo)

1433
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:38,532
Here, in front of the seaweed.

1434
01:02:38,533 --> 01:02:40,409
- Stay there. I'll see how it looks. - All of us.

1435
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:42,509
We rarely get to take a picture in front of seaweed.

1436
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:44,843
- Come here, Jae Wook. - We should take a photo together.

1437
01:02:45,203 --> 01:02:46,772
(Huddling together)

1438
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:47,842
The seaweed should be in the photo.

1439
01:02:47,843 --> 01:02:49,083
(Fresh members and the seaweed)

1440
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:50,412
I can smell the sea.

1441
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:53,082
(A photo with the scent of the sea)

1442
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,213
Where is our house?

1443
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:58,852
- This is so pretty. - My goodness.

1444
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:00,552
(They discover a house with excitement.)

1445
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:01,923
I think it's that house.

1446
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:08,163
(Their house in Wando)

1447
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:12,933
It's so beautiful.

1448
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,172
(What?)

1449
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:17,503
The house is unique.

1450
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:19,572
The house is unique.

1451
01:03:19,573 --> 01:03:21,042
(Jae Wook is coming in.)

1452
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:23,573
(Surprised)

1453
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,852
(With the sea right in front of the house)

1454
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:29,682
This is the path to the house.

1455
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:31,383
(Waterfront house)

1456
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:34,922
It's really spacious.

1457
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:37,193
(It takes a while to walk across the yard.)

1458
01:03:37,663 --> 01:03:38,663
(Fresh House's yard)

1459
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:40,463
This house is awesome.

1460
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:44,102
It's really spacious.

1461
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:46,503
(A golden grass that resembles the house spreads out.)

1462
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:48,832
The house is so pretty.

1463
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,072
(Jun Myun loves the yard.)

1464
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:52,273
Let's go inside.

1465
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:54,313
What is this?

1466
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:58,112
(Exclaiming)

1467
01:03:58,113 --> 01:04:01,013
- I love our house. - I love it.

1468
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:04,523
(Exclaiming in each step)

1469
01:04:06,423 --> 01:04:10,193
(Woodtone interior)

1470
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:15,232
(The best part of the waterfront house)

1471
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:16,293
Unbelievable.

1472
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:18,102
We can see the sea from the yard.

1473
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:21,973
(Opening the wide windows reveals the yard overlooking the ocean.)

1474
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:23,672
This is...

1475
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:24,673
(From inside)

1476
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:27,112
- like a house in a TV series. - I know.

1477
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,472
It's a picturesque house.

1478
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:30,543
(Our picturesque house, even from outside)

1479
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:32,082
- This house is nice. - Yes.

1480
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,282
I love it.

1481
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:35,953
(What will happen at the waterfront house in Wando?)

1482
01:04:36,513 --> 01:04:37,982
(They are all looking out the window.)

1483
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:39,822
- Look over there. - Okay.

1484
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:41,853
(What are they looking at?)

1485
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:44,392
- Is that the thing? - No.

1486
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:46,792
- It's a barbecue grill. - Really?

1487
01:04:46,793 --> 01:04:50,293
- What? It is! - I think it is.

1488
01:04:53,703 --> 01:04:56,173
Let's have a barbecue using that today.

1489
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:57,703
There are charcoals.

1490
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:01,472
- Do you want to have a barbecue? - Yes. We make a fire on the grill.

1491
01:05:01,473 --> 01:05:02,713
- We can just grill it. - Sure.

1492
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:04,282
Let's have a barbecue...

1493
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:05,543
instead of boiled pork.

1494
01:05:06,113 --> 01:05:07,652
Are you going to take this out?

1495
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,912
(In a house like this, )

1496
01:05:09,913 --> 01:05:13,183
(the flower-patterned jacket is perfect.)

1497
01:05:14,793 --> 01:05:17,122
- Jung Ah. - You look so pretty in that jacket.

1498
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:18,923
- Isn't it cute? It's warm. - It is.

1499
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:23,563
There are all sorts of games to play.

1500
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,233
Are there?

1501
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,573
It looks fun.

1502
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:31,372
Can I open it?

1503
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:33,102
(What Ji Yeon picks is a sticky game.)

1504
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:34,413
How long is it?

1505
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:37,612
(Swinging the hand-shaped sticky)

1506
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:41,013
(It sticks like this.)

1507
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:43,082
(The sticky gives a thrill on her hand.)

1508
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,283
Hold on.

1509
01:05:46,983 --> 01:05:48,122
We'll pick this up.

1510
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:50,863
(Picking up the card on the floor)

1511
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:53,262
(The one who picks up the card first...)

1512
01:05:53,263 --> 01:05:54,732
(will be the winner.)

1513
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,462
Are we taking turns?

1514
01:05:56,463 --> 01:05:58,333
- We'll do it until we pick up. - Okay.

1515
01:05:58,563 --> 01:06:00,162
Since the two of us play...

1516
01:06:00,163 --> 01:06:03,803
(Dragging)

1517
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:09,543
Wait. You should put it in the middle.

1518
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:11,812
- Okay. - Come here.

1519
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,913
(Did you try to trick me?)

1520
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:16,583
We'll do it here.

1521
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,052
- Okay. - What about hitting the wrist?

1522
01:06:20,053 --> 01:06:21,593
The winner hits the loser's wrist.

1523
01:06:22,653 --> 01:06:23,963
Okay. Hit just once.

1524
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:26,693
Once? Okay. Once.

1525
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:28,762
Hit really hard, though.

1526
01:06:28,763 --> 01:06:31,102
Hit hard without mercy. I mean it.

1527
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:32,562
- Once? - This is the last round.

1528
01:06:32,563 --> 01:06:33,832
- Really? - It's really the last round.

1529
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,632
Really? Start.

1530
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:39,903
(Sticky battle between Ji Yeon and Jae Wook)

1531
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:47,213
(Slapping sounds are getting faster.)

1532
01:06:48,153 --> 01:06:51,422
(Swinging the hand-shaped sticky without a break)

1533
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,023
(Jun Myun is watching them.)

1534
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:57,793
- It's not that sticky. - You two look like fools.

1535
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:00,533
It's not that sticky.

1536
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:02,833
Mine is not that sticky.

1537
01:07:03,493 --> 01:07:04,503
It was close.

1538
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,532
(Watch it, Jun Myun.)

1539
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:07,702
Hold on.

1540
01:07:07,703 --> 01:07:10,132
(This is our battle.)

1541
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:14,572
(She's really into it.)

1542
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:16,312
(Moving forward)

1543
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:18,413
You can't come forward.

1544
01:07:23,783 --> 01:07:24,883
I almost got it. No!

1545
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:30,493
(Ji Yeon won.)

1546
01:07:32,623 --> 01:07:34,092
(Jae Wook lost.)

1547
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:35,363
I lost.

1548
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,202
(Hitting hard)

1549
01:07:39,203 --> 01:07:42,633
(Hitting him without warning)

1550
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:45,743
(Running away)

1551
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:51,282
I need to go to an emergency room.

1552
01:07:51,283 --> 01:07:53,483
Why? Did Jae Wook lose?

1553
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:55,752
Hit really hard, though.

1554
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:58,853
(He brought the disaster onto himself.)

1555
01:07:58,923 --> 01:08:01,292
- She's so mean. - I went easy on you.

1556
01:08:01,293 --> 01:08:02,793
- My goodness. - She's so mean.

1557
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:05,322
Don't act out in front of your older sister!

1558
01:08:05,323 --> 01:08:06,593
How are you so good at it?

1559
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:08,592
- Seriously. - I told you that I was good at it.

1560
01:08:08,593 --> 01:08:10,603
Ji Yeon is strong.

1561
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:13,733
(Since we're done playing, I'll clean up.)

1562
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:15,793
Are there many fun things inside?

1563
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:19,402
- It's a Polaroid camera. - It's a Polaroid camera.

1564
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:20,649
(While cleaning up, they find a Polaroid camera.)

1565
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:21,842
Are there films?

1566
01:08:21,843 --> 01:08:23,572
(Are there films?)

1567
01:08:23,573 --> 01:08:24,842
I'll take a photo.

1568
01:08:24,843 --> 01:08:26,213
(I'll take a photo of you guys.)

1569
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,682
(The older siblings strike a pose right away.)

1570
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:31,253
One, two, three.

1571
01:08:33,023 --> 01:08:34,622
Let's put it up on the fridge.

1572
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:36,593
(They want to see the warm hug for a long time.)

1573
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:39,422
(I'll take a photo of Jun Myun as well.)

1574
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:41,863
(She's looking for chopsticks.)

1575
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,703
(Jun Myun looks for chopsticks in an atmospheric way.)

1576
01:08:46,103 --> 01:08:47,572
Can we take photos...

1577
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:49,279
- and put them up on the fridge? - That's a good idea.

1578
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:51,303
- That's a good idea. - Can I do that?

1579
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:52,802
That's a good idea.

1580
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:55,143
(Which memories will fill their fridge?)

1581
01:08:56,343 --> 01:09:01,413
(They don't want to waste the perfect air of the afternoon.)

1582
01:09:01,953 --> 01:09:03,612
(She calls for Jung Ah quietly.)

1583
01:09:03,613 --> 01:09:05,583
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

1584
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:08,493
Do you want to have...

1585
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:10,422
- a cup of makgeolli? - Okay.

1586
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:11,722
- Okay. - Makgeolli.

1587
01:09:11,723 --> 01:09:13,793
(Jung Ah, do you want to drink some makgeolli?)

1588
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:16,992
- Do you guys want makgeolli? - Sure.

1589
01:09:16,993 --> 01:09:18,533
- Okay. - That's good. Then...

1590
01:09:19,603 --> 01:09:21,673
- Do you need help? - No.

1591
01:09:22,003 --> 01:09:23,532
- That's... - Yes.

1592
01:09:23,533 --> 01:09:25,173
(It's time to take out a drinking snack.)

1593
01:09:25,573 --> 01:09:29,373
(Jun Myun takes something out.)

1594
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:33,442
(It's what she made in Gangwon Province.)

1595
01:09:33,443 --> 01:09:37,353
(It's Seasoning Park's seokbakji!)

1596
01:09:39,453 --> 01:09:40,692
Let's try it.

1597
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:42,323
- My hands are clean. - Okay.

1598
01:09:43,023 --> 01:09:45,693
(Crunchy)

1599
01:09:46,093 --> 01:09:47,392
(Nodding)

1600
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:48,492
This is it.

1601
01:09:48,493 --> 01:09:49,693
(This is it!)

1602
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:51,302
(She gives him a piece of seokbakji.)

1603
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:52,402
I think it's nice.

1604
01:09:52,403 --> 01:09:53,883
(She gives him a piece of seokbakji.)

1605
01:09:55,873 --> 01:09:57,032
(Impressed)

1606
01:09:57,033 --> 01:09:59,072
- It's so tasty. - It has aged well.

1607
01:09:59,073 --> 01:10:00,203
(It's so tasty!)

1608
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:01,643
(The hyena waits for her turn.)

1609
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:04,183
- The seokbakji looks tasty. - I think it's okay.

1610
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:05,912
It looks delicious.

1611
01:10:05,913 --> 01:10:07,242
I think it came out well. It's refreshing.

1612
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:08,483
(It doesn't look just okay.)

1613
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:11,452
(Crunchy)

1614
01:10:11,453 --> 01:10:12,683
- Yes. - It's good.

1615
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:14,653
It has been aged well. It's perfect.

1616
01:10:15,223 --> 01:10:16,652
It's so tasty.

1617
01:10:16,653 --> 01:10:17,962
(She becomes serious because it's so tasty.)

1618
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,122
- Did it come out well? - Yes.

1619
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:20,863
- It's so tasty. - It's perfect now.

1620
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:22,962
It's just right.

1621
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:24,862
(She eats seokbakji with a serious facial expression.)

1622
01:10:24,863 --> 01:10:26,363
(This is dangerous.)

1623
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,102
Take a seat.

1624
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,502
(The makgeolli party begins in one perfect evening.)

1625
01:10:30,503 --> 01:10:31,672
Did you shake it?

1626
01:10:31,673 --> 01:10:32,772
- I shook it. - Okay.

1627
01:10:32,773 --> 01:10:34,772
(A bottle of makgeolli and a bowl of seokbakji)

1628
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,073
How is it so clear?

1629
01:10:37,243 --> 01:10:38,512
- Wando's makgeolli. - Yes.

1630
01:10:38,513 --> 01:10:39,643
We should try it.

1631
01:10:39,683 --> 01:10:42,053
Don't do that, Mr. Jae Wook.

1632
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,622
(Why would you pour yourself a drink?)

1633
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:46,663
- I love Jun Myun so much. - I'll pour you a drink.

1634
01:10:46,853 --> 01:10:47,992
(He's getting trained today as always.)

1635
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,033
- I love Jun Myun so much. - I'll pour you a drink.

1636
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,493
- I'll pour you a drink. - Mr. Jae Wook.

1637
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:55,493
Let's clink our cups.

1638
01:10:55,533 --> 01:10:58,002
I brought a Gen Zer's toast.

1639
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,203
That's good.

1640
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,532
Go ahead. A Gen Zer's toast?

1641
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:02,773
(A Gen Zer's toast?)

1642
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:04,303
I'll go,

1643
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,072
"A day like this..."

1644
01:11:06,073 --> 01:11:07,743
Then you'll go,

1645
01:11:07,773 --> 01:11:09,442
"Isn't common!"

1646
01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:11,082
- "Isn't common!" - Okay.

1647
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,559
- While doing the shoulder dance? - It isn't common.

1648
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,082
Isn't it nice?

1649
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:16,123
- "A day like this isn't common." - "Isn't common."

1650
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:18,099
- While doing the shoulder dance? - It isn't common.

1651
01:11:18,123 --> 01:11:19,482
- All right. - Here comes a toast.

1652
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:20,923
Ji Yeon will begin.

1653
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,752
A day like this...

1654
01:11:22,753 --> 01:11:24,762
- isn't common. - Isn't common.

1655
01:11:24,763 --> 01:11:26,263
- Isn't common. - Cheers.

1656
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:28,493
It's very Gen Z.

1657
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:31,032
(They taste the Wando makegeolli after doing the shoulder dance.)

1658
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,203
It's nice.

1659
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:35,172
- I think it's nice. - It's tasty.

1660
01:11:35,173 --> 01:11:37,103
(It's tasty.)

1661
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:38,773
It's...

1662
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:40,243
tasty.

1663
01:11:41,513 --> 01:11:45,142
(It's time to have a bite of Seasoning Park's seokbakji.)

1664
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:46,512
It has been aged well.

1665
01:11:46,513 --> 01:11:47,753
- It's refreshing. - Yes.

1666
01:11:49,383 --> 01:11:51,783
Jun Myun, this seokbakji is good.

1667
01:11:53,553 --> 01:11:54,992
(The refreshing drink and aged seokbakji make them happy.)

1668
01:11:54,993 --> 01:11:56,993
Isn't it tasty? It has been aged well.

1669
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,432
I'm hungry.

1670
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:03,362
(I'm hungry.)

1671
01:12:03,363 --> 01:12:04,632
It's time for dinner.

1672
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:06,363
(Me too.)

1673
01:12:06,633 --> 01:12:07,872
We didn't finish talking about it.

1674
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:09,193
- The barbecue... - That's right.

1675
01:12:09,473 --> 01:12:11,442
- Let's have a briefing. - I'll...

1676
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:13,442
The dish that takes the longest to make is...

1677
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:15,112
- Barbecue. - barbecue.

1678
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:16,312
Abalones.

1679
01:12:16,313 --> 01:12:18,342
Let's grill the abalones too. It won't take long.

1680
01:12:18,343 --> 01:12:20,043
We can grill the abalones last.

1681
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:21,852
- We need soup. - Soup.

1682
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:23,313
We don't have anything spicy.

1683
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:26,553
- Shall I make spicy tofu stew? - That's a good idea.

1684
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:28,492
- Today, laver is... - Laver.

1685
01:12:28,493 --> 01:12:29,733
- the main ingredient. - Laver.

1686
01:12:30,253 --> 01:12:33,363
We need to wash the laver to make the laver pasta.

1687
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:35,463
Will you make it on the cauldron lid?

1688
01:12:36,793 --> 01:12:38,002
It's Western food.

1689
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:40,109
(It's Western food in the style of Fresh off the Sea.)

1690
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:42,972
(In their own style, they'll cook...)

1691
01:12:42,973 --> 01:12:44,772
(the seasonal ingredients of Wando...)

1692
01:12:44,773 --> 01:12:47,103
(to make a Western meal.)

1693
01:12:47,473 --> 01:12:50,373
(Wando's seasonal garden party is coming soon.)

1694
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:56,252
(The blue sea becomes red due to the sunset.)

1695
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:59,323
(You become desperate for food during this time.)

1696
01:12:59,753 --> 01:13:03,093
(What kind of food are the neighbors making?)

1697
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:06,223
(Ms. Lee Seok Ja's house in Yeongpung Village)

1698
01:13:06,563 --> 01:13:08,192
Spring cabbage is in season.

1699
01:13:08,193 --> 01:13:09,563
It's the tastiest.

1700
01:13:10,193 --> 01:13:11,932
(Wando's spring cabbage is sweet and savory...)

1701
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:13,663
(thanks to the sea wind of winter.)

1702
01:13:13,733 --> 01:13:15,573
Homemade doenjang...

1703
01:13:16,773 --> 01:13:18,203
and oysters go in.

1704
01:13:18,803 --> 01:13:20,242
Then I add spring cabbage.

1705
01:13:20,243 --> 01:13:21,342
(Add spring cabbage that's in season.)

1706
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,713
(Boil the ingredients well.)

1707
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:27,112
(Add Cheongyang peppers for a spicy taste.)

1708
01:13:27,113 --> 01:13:30,683
(The spring cabbage doenjang soup is savory and aromatic!)

1709
01:13:30,713 --> 01:13:31,952
I add sweet potatoes.

1710
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,253
(Harvested sweet potatoes)

1711
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,052
I also add aged kimchi.

1712
01:13:35,053 --> 01:13:36,093
(Sour aged kimchi)

1713
01:13:37,423 --> 01:13:39,663
(Make a batter with the water laver that's in season.)

1714
01:13:40,933 --> 01:13:45,063
(Pan-fry a thick pancake.)

1715
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:49,832
(It's a dish that's sweet, salty, and savory.)

1716
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,672
I developed the recipe.

1717
01:13:51,673 --> 01:13:53,519
(Ms. Lee's kimchi and laver jeon featuring sweet potato)

1718
01:13:53,543 --> 01:13:56,143
I salted and dried them for a day.

1719
01:13:56,243 --> 01:13:59,313
Brown croakers are common in Wando these days.

1720
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:02,952
(Brown croaker is savory and flavorful...)

1721
01:14:02,953 --> 01:14:05,453
(when you pan-fry it in oil.)

1722
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:07,482
(The table of full of the scents of Wando)

1723
01:14:07,483 --> 01:14:09,153
(This is Ms. Lee's seasonal meal.)

1724
01:14:10,853 --> 01:14:13,663
(What's the Fresh members' seasonal meal for today?)

1725
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:15,693
Jun Myun, what should we do first?

1726
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,763
- We need to peel some garlic. - Okay.

1727
01:14:18,903 --> 01:14:22,372
Let's take these garlic bulbs.

1728
01:14:22,373 --> 01:14:23,673
(Peeling garlic bulbs)

1729
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:25,473
Let's do it on the bench.

1730
01:14:26,103 --> 01:14:27,543
There are so many.

1731
01:14:28,973 --> 01:14:30,343
Peel them and put them here.

1732
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,983
- Do we peel them like this? - Yes.

1733
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:41,253
- It stings. - Does it?

1734
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:43,793
- Is garlic supposed to be spicy? - Yes.

1735
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:47,323
(It's spicy for me too.)

1736
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:51,003
(A thought enters her head while peeling the spicy garlic.)

1737
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:52,833
We should've bought peeled garlic.

1738
01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:55,733
We should've bought peeled garlic, not minced garlic.

1739
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,973
I saw peeled garlic at the mart earlier.

1740
01:15:00,343 --> 01:15:01,573
It was my mistake.

1741
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:04,073
No, it wasn't.

1742
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:06,682
We can make the guest peel them tomorrow,

1743
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:07,753
so don't peel too many.

1744
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:11,423
- Let's be smart. - Okay.

1745
01:15:12,023 --> 01:15:15,953
(While the 2 garlic peelers get lazy...)

1746
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:18,223
- I'll get the fire going first. - Okay.

1747
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:21,132
(He'll get the fire going...)

1748
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:23,493
(on the barbecue grill.)

1749
01:15:24,063 --> 01:15:26,833
(He picks up the firewood first.)

1750
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:31,173
(He stacks them up on one side of the grill.)

1751
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,813
(Then he torches them.)

1752
01:15:43,983 --> 01:15:46,423
(Dying)

1753
01:15:46,783 --> 01:15:47,922
(My goodness)

1754
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:49,853
- It's too windy. - Right?

1755
01:15:50,093 --> 01:15:52,963
(The wind is so strong that it blows out the torch.)

1756
01:15:52,993 --> 01:15:56,093
- The wind is no joke today. - Why is it so windy?

1757
01:15:57,533 --> 01:16:01,133
(They were hoping for the warm spring weather.)

1758
01:16:01,873 --> 01:16:09,473
(The sea wind of Wando is scarier than they thought.)

1759
01:16:09,843 --> 01:16:13,383
(Don't look down on the sea wind of Wando!)

1760
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:15,153
(Sniffling)

1761
01:16:15,383 --> 01:16:19,053
(He's struggling due to the wind.)

1762
01:16:19,353 --> 01:16:21,153
(Behind Jae Wook who is trying his best, )

1763
01:16:21,423 --> 01:16:24,493
(Team Garlic is struggling as well.)

1764
01:16:24,563 --> 01:16:25,593
(The wind blows.)

1765
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,463
(The peels fly off.)

1766
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:31,762
(As soon as they peel garlic)

1767
01:16:31,763 --> 01:16:33,262
I need to peel garlic.

1768
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:34,333
(Bye)

1769
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:36,433
(Chuckling)

1770
01:16:36,434 --> 01:16:37,772
Due to the wind, the onion...

1771
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:39,773
The garlic peels are flying off.

1772
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:43,072
I think the garlic peels...

1773
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:44,993
will continue flying around in the neighborhood.

1774
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,813
The wind will carry the garlic peels.

1775
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:51,923
(The peaceful Yeongpung Village...)

1776
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:54,992
(will get attacked by the garlic peels.)

1777
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:57,022
- "What are these garlic peels?" - "What are these garlic peels?"

1778
01:16:57,023 --> 01:16:59,503
- "Where did they come from?" - "What are these garlic peels?"

1779
01:17:00,793 --> 01:17:03,232
- It's a mess. - It's a mess.

1780
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,532
Jun Myun, aren't those garlic peels?

1781
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:06,679
(Jun Myun, aren't those garlic peels?)

1782
01:17:06,703 --> 01:17:08,433
- Garlic peels. - Oh, no.

1783
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,103
I thought they were cherry blossoms.

1784
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:15,542
(The rolling garlic peels make them laugh.)

1785
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:17,143
(They're cute.)

1786
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:19,712
(Thanks to the spring wind, )

1787
01:17:19,713 --> 01:17:22,913
(they peel garlic bulbs merrily.)

1788
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:26,082
(Jae Wook torches the firewood with the lid closed...)

1789
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:28,393
(to block out the wind.)

1790
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:32,693
(He puts the grill next to the flame.)

1791
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:34,832
(He succeeded in starting a fire...)

1792
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:38,233
(in the barbecue grill!)

1793
01:17:38,803 --> 01:17:40,862
(The fire is going, so it's Jung Ah's turn.)

1794
01:17:40,863 --> 01:17:42,503
There's a knife here.

1795
01:17:43,933 --> 01:17:47,203
(She'll season the barbecue meat!)

1796
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:49,342
(She's generous, )

1797
01:17:49,343 --> 01:17:52,683
(so there are 4 strips of pork belly.)

1798
01:17:53,413 --> 01:17:57,083
(She scores the thick meat.)

1799
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:02,823
(Chef Yum makes preparations for the even doneness.)

1800
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:06,862
(She scores the meat thoroughly.)

1801
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:10,863
(It's time to go in the other direction!)

1802
01:18:11,203 --> 01:18:13,702
(She makes the criss-cross marks on the meat.)

1803
01:18:13,703 --> 01:18:15,303
- Will you season them? - Yes.

1804
01:18:16,603 --> 01:18:19,503
(This is how Chef Yum seasons the whole pork belly.)

1805
01:18:19,873 --> 01:18:21,942
- With mustard? - That's right.

1806
01:18:21,943 --> 01:18:23,143
(Mustard)

1807
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:27,743
(There's a reason why she puts mustard on the meat.)

1808
01:18:28,813 --> 01:18:31,723
So that the seasoning sticks well, I put mustard on the meat.

1809
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:36,823
(Next)

1810
01:18:37,253 --> 01:18:38,822
- Garlic powder. - Garlic powder.

1811
01:18:38,823 --> 01:18:41,293
(The captain of umami, garlic powder)

1812
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,333
Onion powder.

1813
01:18:43,334 --> 01:18:46,503
(An ingredient that'll add sweetness, onion powder)

1814
01:18:46,663 --> 01:18:47,802
(Then she picks up...)

1815
01:18:47,803 --> 01:18:49,433
(a bottle of red powder.)

1816
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:51,642
(An ingredient that'll add to the smoky aroma and color, )

1817
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,472
(smoked paprika)

1818
01:18:53,473 --> 01:18:55,242
(She massages in the 3 types of powder, )

1819
01:18:55,243 --> 01:18:57,189
(garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika.)

1820
01:18:57,213 --> 01:19:00,242
(This is Jung Ah's powder-covered whole pork belly.)

1821
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,883
Can you grind salt and pepper on the top?

1822
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:06,652
(Grinder Wook gets to work.)

1823
01:19:06,653 --> 01:19:08,353
(Laughing)

1824
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:11,123
(Jae Wook grinds peppers diligently.)

1825
01:19:12,463 --> 01:19:15,063
(I want to sprinkle more garlic powder!)

1826
01:19:15,663 --> 01:19:17,863
- Jae Wook. - My goodness.

1827
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,103
Poor Jae Wook.

1828
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:21,733
Is it because of pepper?

1829
01:19:22,173 --> 01:19:24,102
- No, garlic powder. - Garlic powder.

1830
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:26,672
- Garlic powder? - It keeps going to Jae Wook.

1831
01:19:26,673 --> 01:19:27,703
It's insane.

1832
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:29,313
(Coughing)
(Garlic powder and Wando's sea wind...)

1833
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:32,043
(make a deadly combination.)

1834
01:19:32,483 --> 01:19:34,183
- Oh, no. - Leave it as it is.

1835
01:19:35,513 --> 01:19:37,353
- It's ready, Jae Wook. - Okay.

1836
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:39,733
- Shall I get the barbecue started? - Yes.

1837
01:19:40,753 --> 01:19:42,352
I'll spread out the charcoal.

1838
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:43,833
(Let me do it before I add the meat.)

1839
01:19:43,923 --> 01:19:45,362
(Jae Wook makes preparations to get the barbecue started.)

1840
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,063
The fire is strong right now.

1841
01:19:48,233 --> 01:19:49,262
All right.

1842
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:51,163
(He pushes the firewood to the right.)

1843
01:19:53,403 --> 01:19:56,903
(The meat goes on the left side of the grill.)

1844
01:19:57,733 --> 01:19:59,573
I won't cook it with direct fire.

1845
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:01,642
It'll be better to give it a smoky aroma.

1846
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:02,643
(He'll cook the meat as if he's smoking it with heat!)

1847
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:03,973
Jae Wook enjoys camping.

1848
01:20:04,173 --> 01:20:05,983
I'm amazing at grilling meat.

1849
01:20:08,353 --> 01:20:11,953
(He places the meat on the grill perfectly.)

1850
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:15,423
(While Jae Wook grills the meat with passion, )

1851
01:20:15,893 --> 01:20:18,462
(Jung Ah takes out the abalones.)

1852
01:20:18,463 --> 01:20:19,623
(Oh, my!)

1853
01:20:20,363 --> 01:20:23,263
(King-sized abalones fill the box.)

1854
01:20:25,763 --> 01:20:27,003
(Oh, my!)

1855
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:29,733
Wando... Gosh, they're huge.

1856
01:20:30,703 --> 01:20:32,002
They're huge.

1857
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:34,342
They're huge and plump.

1858
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:36,089
(A king-sized abalone is as big as Ji Yeon's face.)

1859
01:20:36,113 --> 01:20:37,212
So fresh.

1860
01:20:37,213 --> 01:20:39,119
(She rubs them with a toothbrush to remove the impurities.)

1861
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:40,512
Jung Ah, it's so strong.

1862
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:42,652
- I know. It's sticking. - It's sticking.

1863
01:20:42,653 --> 01:20:43,713
(She switches to a spoon!)

1864
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,882
(It's time to remove the meat with a spoon.)

1865
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,052
This punk is strong.

1866
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:49,393
(This punk is strong.)

1867
01:20:49,853 --> 01:20:50,853
(Panting)

1868
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,523
(Struggling)

1869
01:20:54,623 --> 01:20:56,539
I'll try it. I just need to use my strength, right?

1870
01:20:56,563 --> 01:20:57,563
I'm exhausted.

1871
01:20:57,564 --> 01:20:58,803
(A new player enters.)

1872
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:00,033
It's strong.

1873
01:21:02,033 --> 01:21:03,033
(A former student athlete, Ji Yeon puts her back into it.)
You punk.

1874
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,902
Are abalones usually this strong?

1875
01:21:07,903 --> 01:21:09,223
(The abalone doesn't even budge.)

1876
01:21:13,213 --> 01:21:15,053
Why don't we grill them first?

1877
01:21:15,813 --> 01:21:16,813
I can't believe it.

1878
01:21:16,814 --> 01:21:18,829
(It hurts the pride of the former student athlete.)

1879
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:21,723
(It's a sturdy one.)

1880
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:25,993
(But Ji Yeon attacks it with persistence.)

1881
01:21:26,263 --> 01:21:27,692
Be careful not to cut your hands.

1882
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:30,433
(It budges a bit at a time.)

1883
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:32,263
I can't believe it. It's so strong.

1884
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:35,033
(Tearing off)

1885
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:38,903
(Ji Yeon tears off an abalone.)

1886
01:21:39,343 --> 01:21:40,843
Let's just cook four today.

1887
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:42,242
- Okay. - It's too hard.

1888
01:21:42,243 --> 01:21:43,363
- Let's eat one each. - Yes.

1889
01:21:44,513 --> 01:21:47,182
(Jung Ah joins again to clean the abalones.)

1890
01:21:47,183 --> 01:21:48,183
All done.

1891
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:51,152
(Halting)

1892
01:21:51,153 --> 01:21:53,782
Jun Myun, this is...

1893
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,592
your toothbrush.

1894
01:21:55,593 --> 01:21:57,393
(What is Jun Myun's toothbrush doing here?)

1895
01:21:58,123 --> 01:22:00,393
- You used my toothbrush... - I'm sorry.

1896
01:22:00,493 --> 01:22:02,693
To clean the abalones.

1897
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,132
An unused toothbrush.

1898
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,602
I should bring a new one.

1899
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,209
(Jung Ah went in search of a new toothbrush.)

1900
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:11,902
(And she picked...)

1901
01:22:11,903 --> 01:22:14,913
(Jun Myun's new toothbrush.)

1902
01:22:15,873 --> 01:22:18,243
I brought it because I liked the white color.

1903
01:22:19,343 --> 01:22:21,082
You can use my toothbrush. I have another one.

1904
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:22,913
I have another one too.

1905
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:26,283
I carry a toothbrush, okay?

1906
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:29,123
(Jun Myun, I'm sorry.)

1907
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:32,022
You need to remove this part of the abalone.

1908
01:22:32,023 --> 01:22:33,193
(Removing the abalone teeth)

1909
01:22:33,623 --> 01:22:36,693
(Then she rinses it with running water.)

1910
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:38,862
We cleaned four abalones.

1911
01:22:38,863 --> 01:22:41,303
(Thanks to Jun Myun's sacrifice, they cleaned four abalones.)

1912
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,633
Will you make gochujang jjigae?

1913
01:22:43,733 --> 01:22:44,973
Yes. Tofu jjigae.

1914
01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:47,503
It just contains tofu and green onions.

1915
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:52,082
(And Seasoning Park's seasoning)

1916
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:55,813
(Gochujang, salted shrimp, sugar, pepper)

1917
01:22:56,153 --> 01:22:58,683
(Seasoning Park's kick)

1918
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:00,922
There should be one spicy dish, right?

1919
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:03,243
(She adds spicy chili powder to the regular chili powder.)

1920
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:06,723
(She adds plain water to the seasoning.)

1921
01:23:06,863 --> 01:23:11,032
(Then she puts the pot on the burner Jae Wook set up.)

1922
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,632
Let's boil it quickly.

1923
01:23:12,633 --> 01:23:15,473
(But the dish looks a bit shabby.)

1924
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:17,932
Do you need help with jjigae?

1925
01:23:17,933 --> 01:23:18,942
(She feels like she should do something more.)

1926
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:20,303
- Me? - I'll help you with jjigae.

1927
01:23:21,073 --> 01:23:23,033
- Can you rinse the green onions? - Green onions.

1928
01:23:23,343 --> 01:23:25,783
- Can you slice them diagonally? - Okay.

1929
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:27,213
All right.

1930
01:23:27,783 --> 01:23:29,329
You know how to slice them diagonally, right?

1931
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:32,622
- Of course. - Of course. I'm sorry.

1932
01:23:32,623 --> 01:23:35,392
- I know how to slice diagonally. - All right.

1933
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:36,553
(Confident)

1934
01:23:37,523 --> 01:23:38,563
Diagonally.

1935
01:23:39,563 --> 01:23:42,163
Diagonally.

1936
01:23:43,433 --> 01:23:45,073
What do you think of my diagonal slicing?

1937
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,633
- My diagonal slicing. - Watch your thumb.

1938
01:23:49,473 --> 01:23:50,473
What do you think?

1939
01:23:51,373 --> 01:23:52,373
Answer me.

1940
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:53,803
(Chuckling)

1941
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:55,043
It looks nice.

1942
01:23:56,743 --> 01:23:59,443
It shows that I've done a lot of cooking.

1943
01:24:00,013 --> 01:24:01,283
My knife skills show that.

1944
01:24:03,453 --> 01:24:05,623
(Is that so?)

1945
01:24:07,853 --> 01:24:09,552
(Dr. Diagonal Slicing, Ji Yeon adds the green onions.)

1946
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:10,593
Well done.

1947
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:14,263
(She adds a spoonful of minced garlic.)

1948
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:17,293
(Is it a green onion soup?)

1949
01:24:20,563 --> 01:24:22,973
- Shall I add some cabbage? - No.

1950
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:25,573
If you add cabbage, it becomes the cabbage soup.

1951
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,673
The cabbage becomes the lead.

1952
01:24:29,813 --> 01:24:31,373
We can't make it the lead.

1953
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:34,282
- The lead... - Tofu is the lead.

1954
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:35,643
- We can't make it the lead. - No.

1955
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:40,223
(The lead, tofu, finally enters.)

1956
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:43,822
Let's boil it now.

1957
01:24:43,823 --> 01:24:46,693
(What will Seasoning Park's simple tofu jjigae be like?)

1958
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:50,292
(Meanwhile, in the front yard)

1959
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:51,633
What's going on?

1960
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,732
Why is there so much smoke?

1961
01:24:54,733 --> 01:24:56,003
(It's an emergency.)

1962
01:24:57,633 --> 01:24:59,902
(Amidst the thick smoke, )

1963
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:03,172
(the meat shows itself.)

1964
01:25:03,173 --> 01:25:04,173
(My goodness)

1965
01:25:05,243 --> 01:25:09,083
(A satisfied grunt comes out from the depth.)

1966
01:25:10,013 --> 01:25:13,253
(Jung Ah's special seasoning gave the meat a dark brown color.)

1967
01:25:14,883 --> 01:25:18,663
(Juice drips from the meat!)

1968
01:25:20,623 --> 01:25:23,933
(Is the inside getting cooked as well?)

1969
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:27,062
(Jae Wook wants to cut it and check.)

1970
01:25:27,063 --> 01:25:28,163
(Sniffing)

1971
01:25:30,103 --> 01:25:31,103
I'll slice it.

1972
01:25:32,973 --> 01:25:34,743
(Sighing)

1973
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:36,972
(What does his sigh mean?)

1974
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:39,843
- Jun Myun. - What?

1975
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:42,052
- Do you want to see how it looks? - Really?

1976
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:44,483
Jung Ah, the barbecue is almost done.

1977
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:45,853
- Really? - Yes.

1978
01:25:46,483 --> 01:25:49,293
(He's on standby to show it to Jung Ah.)

1979
01:25:49,593 --> 01:25:51,292
(Let's check out Jae Wook's barbecue.)

1980
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:52,763
It's getting cooked well.

1981
01:25:53,793 --> 01:25:55,093
(Impressed)

1982
01:25:55,993 --> 01:25:58,232
- The fire is so nice. - It's nice, right?

1983
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,313
(Jae Wook's incredible charcoal made this possible.)

1984
01:26:01,463 --> 01:26:02,472
This is great.

1985
01:26:02,473 --> 01:26:03,572
(The whole pork belly barbecue...)

1986
01:26:03,573 --> 01:26:05,119
(that's crispy outside and moist inside)

1987
01:26:05,143 --> 01:26:07,443
(This is my work.)

1988
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:10,112
(Jung Ah's powder seasoning...)

1989
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:13,543
(is getting seeped into the meat.)

1990
01:26:15,913 --> 01:26:18,923
(He checked that the meat was getting cooked.)

1991
01:26:19,323 --> 01:26:22,923
(He moves the meat so that it's over the charcoal.)

1992
01:26:25,163 --> 01:26:28,292
(He cooks it thoroughly with residual heat.)

1993
01:26:28,293 --> 01:26:29,892
We need to cook it a bit more.

1994
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:30,893
- Yes. - Now, it's a bit...

1995
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:34,133
(He cooks it thoroughly with residual heat.)

1996
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,869
(I'm hungry.)

1997
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,270
(I feel a bit dizzy.)

1998
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:42,579
(Are you hungry to the point of dizziness?)

1999
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:44,180
(Before Ji Yeon passes out, )

2000
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,686
(abalones grilled with butter go into their stomachs!)

2001
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:48,349
(The transformation of laver!)

2002
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,119
(Have you ever heard of it?)

2003
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,049
(Laver and cream pasta)

2004
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:54,149
(It makes them slurp the noodles...)

2005
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:56,020
(endlessly.)

2006
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,559
(Did you enjoy the laver and cream pasta?)

2007
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,130
(No! The members are still hungry for laver.)

2008
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:03,960
(They attempt to make the dried laver.)

2009
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,970
(However)

2010
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,670
(It's too thick.)

2011
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,550
(A man, who's crazy about laver, appears.)

2012
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,569
(The man who's crazy about laver)

2013
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,730
(The dried laver won't come out thick under my watch.)

2014
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,480
(Gosh, it's the laver purgatory.)

2015
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:21,049
(Who asked me to make dried laver with him?)

2016
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,649
(They escape the laver purgatory...)

2017
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:23,919
(and take on the second work.)

2018
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,449
(The milk of the sea)

2019
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,949
(Oyster)

2020
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,149
I...

2021
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,290
(I did a lot of work on a boat.)

2022
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:32,290
(Staggering)

2023
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:35,359
(The four siblings surrender...)

2024
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,699
(to the oyster harvest.)

2025
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,460
(Someone is here to save the four siblings!)

2026
01:27:40,485 --> 01:27:42,969
(Kim Jae Hwa...)

2027
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,500
(and Yoon Kyung Ho)

2028
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,570
(The experienced worker has an unrivaled form.)

2029
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,279
(Leader Yum's best student has charisma.)

2030
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,910
(Satisfied)

2031
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,250
(Unbelievable guests are coming.)
