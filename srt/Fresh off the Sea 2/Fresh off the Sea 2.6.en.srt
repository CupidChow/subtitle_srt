1
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,071
(They drove along the emerald-colored sea...)

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,981
(in search of seasonal food.)

3
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,041
(It really is a seaside village.)

4
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,180
(The second location, a peaceful seaside village in Wando)

5
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:29,220
(Gosh, my back aches!)

6
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,051
(What were the noises that broke the peace in Wando?)

7
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:33,651
Three. Let's go.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,320
(Something black covered the blue sea.)

9
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,431
(Water laver)

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,731
(Loading 28t of water laver)

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,301
(With all their might, )

12
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,271
(they raked the water laver.)

13
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:49,471
(But they couldn't escape the swamp of water laver.)

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,001
(Water laver rained from the clear sky.)

15
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,470
(How many kilograms is it?)

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,081
(A box weighed 40kg.)

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,681
(The intensity of labor was insane.)

18
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,151
(I can do it.)

19
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,351
(Grit your teeth and persevere!)

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,421
(Manly man)

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,850
(They succeeded in taking care...)

22
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,791
(of 28t of water laver!)

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,420
(To celebrate their success, )

24
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,891
(they decided to have a garden party!)

25
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,161
(The Western garden party opened.)

26
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,730
(Alchemist of the barbecue scene, )

27
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,031
(Chef Yum)

28
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,271
(A parade of 3-colored condiments)

29
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,640
(Leave the fire to me.)

30
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,710
(However)

31
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,171
(Dying)

32
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,780
(They didn't expect the scary sea wind of Wando!)

33
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,381
The garlic peels are flying in the wind.

34
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:33,850
(Wando's sea wind was strong.)

35
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,351
(Coughing)

36
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,851
(The difficulty level of cooking became high.)

37
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,591
(However, they refused to lose to the wind.)

38
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,820
(The thick smoke...)

39
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,961
(couldn't discourage Jae Wook.)

40
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,431
(Barbecued pork belly overcame the sea wind.)

41
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,401
(Proud)

42
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,731
(Round 2 was Strength Ji Yeon's war against the abalones.)

43
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,041
(Strength Ji Yeon prepared abalones...)

44
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:57,371
(by ripping them up.)

45
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,440
(Strength Ji Yeon won.)

46
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,840
(Then came Seasoning Park's spicy tofu stew.)

47
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:03,880
(It looked a bit empty.)

48
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,641
- Shall I add some cabbage? - No.

49
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,750
If we add cabbage,

50
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,581
it'll take the spotlight.

51
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,981
(Seasoning Park's tofu stew with tofu as the main ingredient)

52
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,991
(It's time for the dinner table that was earned through hard labor.)

53
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,191
Ji Yeon, I need this butter.

54
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:22,461
Cut a small portion I can use for these four abalones.

55
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,900
Cut it with a knife.

56
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,001
(While Ji Yeon cuts the butter)

57
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:29,030
- I'll grill the abalones. - Okay.

58
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,501
Abalones get cooked in no time.

59
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,641
(Cleaned abalones go in first!)

60
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:38,340
I've never seen such abalones.

61
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,251
(She marvels at the size of the Wando abalones.)

62
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,410
(Sprinkling pink salt)

63
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,851
(Sprinkling pepper)

64
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,121
(After seasoning them, )

65
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:49,720
Bring me butter.

66
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,361
(it's the perfect time to add butter!)

67
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,731
- Butter. - Yes. Add it to the pan.

68
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,131
(Once the big piece of butter melts)

69
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:01,501
It smells good.

70
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:02,870
Butter.

71
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,841
Jung Ah, the smell of butter is insane.

72
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,541
(Chef Yum's mouth waters.)

73
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,580
Jung Ah, it smells delicious!

74
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:12,611
(Jung Ah, it smells delicious!)

75
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:15,780
It's insane.

76
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:16,951
(What's more insane is...)

77
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,821
(how the dish looks when you baste the abalones with butter.)

78
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:27,491
(Chef Yum's fine dining skills)

79
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,230
(Ji Yeon watches it for a short while...)

80
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:34,570
(and runs away because it looks too delicious.)

81
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,601
Butter.

82
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:37,740
(My goodness)

83
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:38,971
The smell is everything.

84
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,571
(Savoring)

85
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,310
(This puppy got caught eating butter in secret.)

86
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,650
Butter is tasty.

87
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,151
(This puppy got caught eating butter in secret.)

88
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,321
(Savoring)

89
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,951
(She caught me.)

90
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:55,991
What?

91
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:57,121
Butter.

92
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,020
- Are you... - Butter.

93
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,731
- Are you eating butter? - Yes.

94
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,831
Even if you're hungry, it's too much.

95
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,230
Give me a plate where I can put these abalones.

96
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,201
(Abalone grilled with butter is complete.)

97
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:12,471
(Walking over with a plate)

98
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:15,540
Watch your hands.

99
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,241
(She puts the abalones with care on a pretty plate.)

100
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,981
Shall I put some parsley on the top?

101
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:22,211
That's a good idea. Sprinkle some parsley flakes.

102
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,851
(Sniffing)

103
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,421
Butter smells amazing.

104
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,320
(Abalone grilled with butter is bouncy when she cuts it.)

105
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,791
Let's cut it into bite-sized pieces.

106
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:34,291
It would've been nice to grill some more.

107
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,101
But we have meat today.

108
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,871
I understand your disappointment, but let's wrap up here.

109
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,370
- I'm disappointed, but... - But let's wrap up here.

110
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,401
(She finishes the dish by sprinkling parsley flakes!)

111
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:49,340
(She uses the in-between time to do the dishes.)

112
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,710
Gosh, I'm hungry.

113
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,181
(Gosh, I'm hungry.)

114
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,751
I feel a bit faint.

115
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,881
- Really? - Why am I hungry?

116
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,981
Are you so hungry that you feel faint?

117
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,351
(Serious)

118
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:02,891
Is the meat ready?

119
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,821
He's resting it on residual heat.

120
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,160
- He's resting it on residual heat. - Yes.

121
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,831
(The barbecue is 80 percent done and resting in residual heat.)

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,160
It's boiling now.

123
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,800
Yes, Jung Ah. It's complete.

124
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:12,930
(Tofu stew and abalone grilled with butter are 100 percent done.)

125
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,671
I just need to whip up fresh kimchi.

126
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:16,970
(Fresh kimchi)

127
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,971
(Seasoning Park just needs to whip it up.)

128
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:21,841
- Then we need to cook pasta. - Yes.

129
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:23,640
(We need to cook pasta and stir-fry the ingredients.)

130
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,310
Is this the only portable stove...

131
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,581
we have?

132
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,681
Let's cook pasta here.

133
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,050
I'll get the fire going,

134
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,281
- so stir-fry the ingredients there. - Okay.

135
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,721
(Thus, Jae Wook goes back to the firewood.)

136
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,461
(Lighting up the firewood for the second time today)

137
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:45,101
(He's totally used to it.)

138
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:49,201
(While Jae Wook lights up the firewood passionately)

139
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:53,371
Which pot should I use to boil pasta?

140
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:54,811
This one.

141
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,380
(It's a bit small.)

142
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,310
This one? How about this one?

143
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,581
- We need a pot... - Here.

144
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,150
That's this big.

145
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,181
(Jung Ah picks the double-extra large pot.)

146
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,781
(Let's add coarse salt...)

147
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,691
(and boil the water.)

148
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,191
(When it gets steamy)

149
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,330
I think we can add pasta now.

150
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,631
I'm going to add it now.

151
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,361
I'm not going to cook a lot of pasta.

152
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:22,070
(1 packet of pasta, 5 servings)

153
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,401
(2 packets of pasta, 10 servings)

154
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,141
- We have to. - Jung Ah, you're so generous.

155
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,611
We have to cook this much.

156
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,280
(Ji Yeon feels faint due to hunger.)

157
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,710
We should eat a lot.

158
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:33,811
(Ji Yeon feels faint due to hunger.)

159
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:36,250
We'll wrap up the pasta over there with the ingredients.

160
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,881
- Yes. It just needs to become soft. - That's right.

161
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,991
There was a term for it.

162
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:43,821
Al dente.

163
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,231
You...

164
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,030
You're good.

165
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:50,030
- Al dente. - You know what al dente is.

166
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,101
(See?)

167
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,431
Al dente.

168
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:54,831
(Impressed)

169
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:57,240
Will you boil it for a short period of time?

170
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,801
I'll boil it for one minute.

171
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,281
(They practically blanched the pasta.)

172
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,840
(Boil pasta for a short period of time...)

173
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,380
(and braise it in sauce so that it absorbs the sauce.)

174
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,611
I'll cook it now.

175
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:12,651
(Here comes the cauldron lid where pasta will be cooked.)

176
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,720
(She pours olive oil on the cauldron lid...)

177
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:23,061
(for a long while.)

178
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:27,701
(Next comes the minced garlic.)

179
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,940
I tend to add a lot of garlic.

180
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,441
(One bowl is the amount of garlic Koreans like.)

181
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,311
Isn't that a lot?

182
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:37,440
I like garlic a lot.

183
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:39,511
Garlic gives off a lot of flavors.

184
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:43,521
(She scrapes the bowl to add all of the garlic.)

185
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:48,090
Ji Yeon minced the cloves.

186
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:50,761
- Jung Ah, it smells sweet. - Yes.

187
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:54,391
Jae Wook, would you add some pasta water?

188
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,160
We need to add all of them anyway.

189
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,901
(Milky pasta water gets poured over the toasted garlic.)

190
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,630
Garlic smells good.

191
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:03,841
(The milky liquid looks like bone broth.)

192
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,470
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

193
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,141
- Bring me the water laver. - Water laver?

194
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,811
(Finally, the main ingredient appears.)

195
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,281
(Laver is typically eaten as a side dish for rice.)

196
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,980
Here's the water laver.

197
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,620
(It'll transform.)

198
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,091
It's my first time seeing such a dish.

199
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:26,731
(An ample amount of fresh water laver goes in.)

200
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,830
Ji Yeon, I need more water laver!

201
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:29,901
(Ji Yeon, I need more water laver!)

202
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:35,931
I can't believe we'll eat water laver. How luxurious.

203
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,271
- It's incredible. - Seriously.

204
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:40,911
I think it'll be delicious.

205
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,940
It must have so much umami.

206
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,540
(If you don't have water laver, )

207
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,311
(use dried laver soaked in water!)

208
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,950
Shall I make the fire stronger?

209
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,251
- No. - Is it okay?

210
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,481
It should be cooked over low heat.

211
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:57,761
(Cook it over low heat to bring out the rich taste of water laver.)

212
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,030
(When the water laver sauce gets reduced)

213
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,231
Bring the pasta.

214
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,630
The pasta is sticking to the bowl.

215
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,531
(It's time to add the pasta.)

216
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:11,101
(The pasta is still undercooked.)

217
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:13,840
- The pasta water? - Yes.

218
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,510
We need to cook it for a while.

219
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,911
(Chef Yum's secret involves braising the pasta over low heat.)

220
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,651
(Ingredient number 1 for umami: Chicken stock)

221
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,450
(Ingredient number 2 for umami:)

222
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:24,651
(Anchovy sauce is used to season the dish.)

223
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,590
You need to cook it over low heat until the sauce becomes thick.

224
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:30,160
- That's why you blanch the pasta. - It's like risotto.

225
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,861
- Yes. This is how you cook it. - I see.

226
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:34,090
(Braise the sauce so that the pasta absorbs...)

227
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:35,360
Now, you braise the sauce.

228
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,831
(the deep flavors of the water laver.)

229
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,870
(Meanwhile, Seasoning Park)

230
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,240
It'll be perfect with pork.

231
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,540
(It'll be perfect with pork.)

232
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,101
(Eating)

233
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:47,640
Fresh kimchi.

234
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,411
(I'll make fresh kimchi.)

235
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,150
(The red seasoning looks appetizing.)

236
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,180
(Seasoning Park's fresh kimchi seasoning:)

237
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:57,350
(Enough chili powder, a squeeze of oligosaccharide, )

238
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,850
(a spoonful of salted shrimp, )

239
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:03,090
(as much sesame as you want, )

240
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,931
(and a bit of sand lance sauce)

241
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,361
(Seasoning Park adds them through eyeball measurements.)

242
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,830
(Then she mixes them well with her small hands.)

243
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,270
Seasoning Park.

244
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,431
(Then she mixes them well with her small hands.)

245
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,301
Taste it before you go, Jae Wook.

246
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,541
- I came to taste it. - Nice.

247
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,070
(There's desire in his eyes.)

248
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,241
The seasoning...

249
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,911
I'll taste a small piece first.

250
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,021
(I haven't checked the seasoning yet.)

251
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:33,351
(Gulping)

252
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,591
(Her eyes are on him.)

253
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,131
(Flirting with fresh kimchi is new.)

254
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,270
Why are you teasing me?

255
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,331
(Why are you teasing me?)

256
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,501
Try it.

257
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,081
Is it good?

258
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,881
It's seasoned, right?

259
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,381
Perfect.

260
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,980
- Seasoning Park. - A little more.

261
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,081
(Seasoning Park's amazing fresh kimchi is complete.)

262
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,350
(Laver pasta is getting reduced.)

263
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,751
Gosh, my back.

264
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,590
My back aches.

265
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:11,060
(She groans as she stir-fries the pasta.)

266
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,291
(Massaging)

267
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:18,631
(She has worked on the pasta with a hunched back.)

268
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,201
I'll do it.

269
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:26,101
(She suddenly feels back pain and hands the work over to Ji Yeon.)

270
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:31,011
(Ji Yeon also leans over to stir the pasta.)

271
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,211
Why does my back hurt?

272
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:37,951
This posture feels oddly familiar.

273
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,021
I was wondering why my back hurt so much.

274
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,361
(Blaming the laver for the back pain)

275
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,131
It better be worth the pain.

276
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,771
(Laughing)

277
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,571
Did you add all the seasoning?

278
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,941
We need heavy cream.

279
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,370
Now the heavy cream goes in.

280
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:01,470
(Laver cream pasta)

281
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,811
This looks amazing.

282
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,780
It's starting to look good.

283
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:06,410
- It looks like risotto. - Yes.

284
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,351
(Savory laver meets smooth, rich cream.)

285
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,721
This would be perfect for dipping some baguette.

286
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,891
(That baguette...)

287
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:18,561
(is currently being toasted by the butter-loving one.)

288
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,660
I'm toasting the baguette.

289
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,961
(Butter-toasted baguette as garnish for the laver cream pasta)

290
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:24,901
The pasta is cooked, right?

291
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,530
Yes, it's all done now. We just need to plate it.

292
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:28,531
Should we plate it now?

293
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,971
Start by placing the noodles like this.

294
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,740
Then you just pour the sauce like this with a ladle.

295
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,941
- Like this? - Yes, and then...

296
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,481
- With a ladle... - Can you do this?

297
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,780
- What? - Can you do it?

298
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:39,781
I can't.

299
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,411
I can't plate it nicely.

300
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:43,951
Right.

301
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,580
That works for maybe 2 or 3 servings.

302
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,991
- Exactly. - But this is 12 servings.

303
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,020
We can't do that. Let's just plate it.

304
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,491
(That is true, though.)

305
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,990
- With this... - Taste is all that matters.

306
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:52,991
You are right.

307
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:59,561
(Chef Yum's cooking philosophy is all about generous portions.)

308
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:04,771
(A perfect swirl of noodles and laver)

309
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,771
Oh, my.

310
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,411
(That looks delicious.)

311
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,510
Can I add a little more to mine?

312
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,511
Yes.

313
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:15,911
(Asking for a refill before the first bite)

314
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,320
- Okay. - All four dishes are there?

315
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:19,321
Yes.

316
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:20,790
(After serving up an extra-large laver cream pasta)

317
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,791
- Ji Yeon. - Yes.

318
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,461
Wipe the sides of the plates clean and sprinkle chopped scallions.

319
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,790
(Yes, chef.)

320
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,961
Let's sprinkle chopped scallions.

321
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,971
Ji Yeon is sprinkling it so prettily.

322
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:39,171
(Serving up a generous portion of laver cream pasta in a giant bowl)

323
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,070
It's for the production staff. Let them have a taste.

324
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,540
(Sharing the deliciousness with the production staff)

325
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,741
Please have a taste.

326
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,711
(Feeling proud)

327
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,520
Let's slice the meat.

328
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,651
(Jae Wook finally opens the barbecue.)

329
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:57,291
(Dashing to the cutting board with the meat in hand)

330
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,431
(Impressed)

331
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,401
This is amazing.

332
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:04,960
That looks so good.

333
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,101
(Shall we hurry up and slice this amazing barbecue?)

334
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:15,010
Oh, my. It's red.

335
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,641
(The juicy barbecue is perfectly cooked.)

336
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:25,051
(It is too perfect to resist.)

337
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,621
(He can't help but take a bite.)

338
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:28,891
(Satisfied)

339
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,891
Ji Yeon.

340
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,691
(Giving a piece to our foodie, Ji Yeon)

341
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,731
This is so delicious.

342
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,401
Be careful.

343
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,201
I can't believe it.

344
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:42,731
It is so good.

345
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,341
It's cooked perfectly, Jae Wook.

346
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,071
- It's so good, isn't it? - Yes.

347
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,480
(Jung Ah and Jae Wook's masterpiece, )

348
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,481
(the seasoned pork belly barbecue is ready.)

349
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,680
This looks so delicious.

350
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,651
(It's another hearty seasonal dinner for the Fresh members.)

351
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:00,790
It's all finished.

352
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,461
(Chef Yum's Wando laver cream pasta)

353
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,421
- It's good, right? - It's really well-cooked.

354
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:06,561
I was surprised after just one bite.

355
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,660
I'm so thankful for this.

356
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,361
(Wando abalone grilled with butter)

357
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,360
This smells so good.

358
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,100
(The Western-style dinner meets Korean spicy tofu stew.)

359
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:15,131
It's spicy.

360
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,470
This is our Seasoning Park.

361
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,311
(Barbecue meets its soulmate, Seasoning Park's fresh kimchi.)

362
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,910
Gosh, this is amazing.

363
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:27,911
(The table is full of seasonal treasures from Wando.)

364
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,241
Gosh, this is amazing.

365
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:34,512
(The table is full of seasonal treasures from Wando.)

366
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:39,351
- Great job today, everyone. - Well done.

367
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,081
Cheers.

368
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,622
You all worked hard.

369
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:46,962
(Drinking)

370
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:53,032
(The very first sip lifts the mood.)

371
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:57,732
Gosh, that's some next-level fizz.

372
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:00,801
(That hits the whole body.)

373
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,242
- It's so good, right? - It really is.

374
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,242
- This is perfect for beer. - Thanks for the food.

375
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,682
(After all the hard work, this is the first dinner in Wando.)

376
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:15,382
(Starting with Jung Ah's slow-simmered laver cream pasta)

377
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:18,292
(Mouth-watering)

378
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:23,932
(Blowing gently)

379
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,132
(Slurping away)

380
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,172
This is seriously so good.

381
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:33,032
(Mouth-watering)

382
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:35,242
(Hungry and dizzy, Ji Yeon rolls up her sleeves.)

383
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,381
(Savoring)

384
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,382
(Impressed)

385
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,112
(Chef Yum also rolls it up and takes a bite.)

386
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:51,092
(They are moved by the incredible taste of the pasta.)

387
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,862
(Smiling)

388
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:56,562
(Chef Yum also likes it.)

389
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,192
(Jun Myun takes a big bite, too.)

390
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,832
(Not letting a single strand go to waste)

391
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:05,472
(Impressed)

392
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:07,302
(It's a taste that brings a smile to their faces.)

393
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,001
You made it so well.

394
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,042
(It's good, right?)

395
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:11,742
- I've never had it before. - Right.

396
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:13,912
Honestly, I didn't even know something like that existed.

397
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,312
- It's so delicious. - It really is.

398
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:19,282
It is my first time, too.

399
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,121
I have seen laver used for pesto before,

400
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,122
but making pasta like this...

401
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:24,092
(So you can make pasta with laver.)

402
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,591
- On low heat, nice and slow. - Yes.

403
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,162
(The key to laver cream pasta is simmering it slow for a long time.)

404
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,061
That's how the flavors really come together.

405
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:30,062
(That's the key for the laver to seep deep into the noodles.)

406
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:31,332
This is so special.

407
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,461
And it really is so good.

408
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,602
(This is unfamiliar, yet irresistibly savory.)

409
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:45,012
It's so delicious.

410
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,412
(The taste of Wando spreads through every bite.)

411
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,612
You can't really make this in Seoul, can you?

412
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:51,781
It's hard to find water laver there.

413
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:53,552
No. You can just use dried laver.

414
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,281
- Is that so? With dried laver? - Yes, just crush it up.

415
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,322
(It still tastes great with dried laver, too.)

416
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,152
(I'm definitely trying this.)

417
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,191
(While enjoying the pasta to the last bite, )

418
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,231
Here's some bread.

419
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:05,592
(a baguette is highly recommended.)

420
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:06,791
Dip it in the pasta sauce.

421
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,462
(You need to dip it in the pasta sauce.)

422
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:11,432
(Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside)

423
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,901
(Eating the pasta)

424
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:18,272
(Biting into the baguette)

425
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,281
(Placing the pasta on top of the bread)

426
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,282
This looks good.

427
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,582
(It tastes even better this way.)

428
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:30,321
(The savory laver cream sauce pairs perfectly with the baguette.)

429
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,491
(Savoring)

430
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:33,052
Pasta definitely goes better with bread than rice.

431
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,222
(Laver cream pasta and baguette are the perfect combo.)

432
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,932
(Where are Jae Wook's chopsticks headed next?)

433
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,702
(Picking up a piece of Jung Ah's seasoned pork belly barbecue)

434
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,172
Jung Ah, the seasoning is...

435
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:46,932
(Seasoning?)

436
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:51,272
It's seriously delicious. The one you made.

437
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,012
(Nodding along)

438
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:58,912
(It's cooked to juicy perfection with Jung Ah's special seasoning.)

439
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:02,422
(Popping it in the mouth)

440
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,491
(Savoring)

441
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:06,922
It's so tender.

442
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:11,032
(Savoring)

443
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:12,491
The meat is amazing.

444
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:13,662
- It's so good. - Seriously, it's incredible.

445
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:16,262
(It's unbelievable.)

446
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,832
Did you grill this meat for about an hour?

447
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:20,842
I grilled it for about an hour,

448
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,842
and then I let it cook through by keeping it inside.

449
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,542
When you season it like this,

450
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:28,342
it tastes great even without adding extra salt.

451
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,042
Right.

452
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:33,452
(Taking a bite of Seasoning Park's fresh kimchi instead of sauce)

453
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,592
(Crispy)

454
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:40,291
This fresh kimchi is good.

455
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,092
(Enjoying Jun Myun's refreshing and spicy fresh kimchi)

456
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,062
(Biting into the pork belly)

457
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:49,602
(Following with a bite of fresh kimchi)

458
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:53,602
(Wrapping the pork in fresh kimchi)

459
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,102
(Taking a combined bite)

460
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,911
- The meat is so good. - It's just so delicious.

461
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,511
(It's even tastier when eaten together.)

462
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,611
The kimchi is really good.

463
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:05,912
(It's time to try the warm, comforting stew.)

464
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,422
The soup is delicious. It's refreshing.

465
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:11,222
I just threw it together.

466
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,092
(Spicy and hearty tofu stew)

467
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,922
You can't have a meal without soup.

468
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,962
(Just when craving something spicy, the tofu stew comes in.)

469
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:23,162
(Jung Ah enjoys the soup and tofu at the same time.)

470
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,602
Having soup on the dinner table is a must.

471
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,702
(Jae Wook drinks the soup directly from the bowl.)

472
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,142
(Yum)

473
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:38,812
(Ji Yeon can't help but keep eating the spicy tofu stew.)

474
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:42,352
(It's time to try Wando's delicacy, abalone grilled with butter.)

475
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:45,192
(Jun Myun's eyes widen at the flavor.)

476
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:47,791
(The fact that she cleaned the abalone herself...)

477
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,522
(makes it taste even better.)

478
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,432
It's so good.

479
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:55,762
You like it? I'm glad.

480
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:58,231
Ji Yeon worked so hard today.

481
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:59,332
(Today was a day well spent.)

482
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:02,242
Tomorrow, when we wake up,

483
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,772
should we work out first? Do you want to go look around?

484
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,211
Let's go look around.

485
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:07,442
The path is so beautiful.

486
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,782
I think I've gotten used to this.

487
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,282
- To the show? - Yes.

488
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:13,211
- To living like this? - Yes.

489
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,681
(Jae Wook feels much more relaxed and comfortable...)

490
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:18,192
(about the time he spends with the Fresh members.)

491
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,452
At first, I felt overwhelmed.

492
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,622
But now, I enjoy my time here.

493
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,292
You have fun now.

494
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:29,632
- Yes, I learned to have fun here. - I got used to this pattern of...

495
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:33,002
(Having dinner together feels especially joyful tonight.)

496
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:36,041
I know we've only done fishing twice,

497
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:39,312
but when I see how the locals in the fishing industry work hard,

498
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,842
- I feel so appreciative. - They're amazing, right?

499
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:44,611
Earlier, I met a local who was 70 years old...

500
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:46,011
- working on the water laver. - Right.

501
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,082
(Jae Wook encountered an elderly worker on the boat.)

502
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,652
After I asked him his age,

503
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:51,592
I suddenly felt less exhausted.

504
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:53,251
(Nodding)

505
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:56,191
Fishery workers are really amazing.

506
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,992
Yes, they really are.

507
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,531
(Because they know how much work the workers put in, )

508
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,602
Gosh.

509
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:04,801
(today's meal with seasonal ingredients is extra special.)

510
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,432
Gosh, I love this vibe.

511
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:11,112
(Darkness has settled at Yeongpung Village.)

512
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,942
Gosh, I'm full. I'm done.

513
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,512
- The day passed by so fast. - What is this?

514
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:18,011
Let's take our time getting ready for bed.

515
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,882
- We have to clear the table too. - Clear the table.

516
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,952
(Right. The dishes.)

517
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:26,222
(The dishes...)

518
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,792
(have to be washed.)

519
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:33,092
(They don't feel like doing anything after all that arduous labor.)

520
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,462
(Thinking)

521
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,972
Let's have fun first.

522
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:40,641
Let's play a game to choose who will do the dishes.

523
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,042
- Let's do it right now then. - That...

524
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:43,772
We'll play a game and...

525
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,042
- All right. - clear the table in a good mood.

526
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,082
- Sounds good. - Sounds good.

527
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,142
Which game should we play?

528
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:52,551
- The sticky game. - The sticky game.

529
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:53,952
(The sticky game they played earlier!)

530
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:56,922
(The youngest members played it as soon as they returned home.)

531
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,091
(To play the game, you throw the sticky hand...)

532
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,092
(and the one whose sticky hand grabs the card first wins.)

533
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:02,322
There.

534
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:04,661
(Like this.)

535
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:05,832
- I had it. Gosh. - Gosh.

536
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:09,262
(Warning: It can get quite chaotic.)

537
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:11,331
Gosh, I'll probably end up doing the dishes.

538
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,731
I'm too bad at games.

539
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:13,732
(She has a bad feeling about this.)

540
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,912
(Facing the great sticky game, Jae Wook grew serious.)

541
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:21,442
- Are you finished eating, sisters? - Yes.

542
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:24,451
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for making the food.

543
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:25,552
(Now, let the games begin.)

544
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,282
Gosh, I'm nervous.

545
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,651
Only one person can fit by the sink anyway.

546
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:34,091
(Whoever loses has to do all the dishes alone.)

547
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,661
Give me one. Let's practice.

548
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,022
All right. Here, let's practice.

549
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:38,991
Like this.

550
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,392
You can just throw it like this.

551
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,062
Use the snap of your wrist.

552
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,932
- Right. - Yes. If you do that, you win.

553
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,902
(Snap)

554
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:52,012
If it lands here, it will stick.

555
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,741
Okay. Let's do this.

556
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:57,212
(The sticky game competition for dishwashing duty, Round 1)

557
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:58,751
(Whoever is...)

558
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:00,051
(the quickest...)

559
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,451
(to snatch...)

560
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:02,781
(the playing card...)

561
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:05,891
(will be free from dishwashing duty.)

562
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,422
(There's only one target.)

563
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,861
Time for the real thing. We'll throw at the same time,

564
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,091
- and whoever gets the card wins. - Okay.

565
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:13,632
- Get ready. - We're all doing it at once?

566
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:16,702
(Leader Yum Jung Ah)

567
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:18,931
- Get ready. - We're all doing it at once?

568
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:20,331
(The fiery youngest, Lee Jae Wook)

569
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:21,402
Okay.

570
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,272
(Clumsy player, Park Jun Myun)

571
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:27,242
(Former athletic student, Im Ji Yeon)

572
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,451
Begin.

573
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:34,022
(They're playing the game with dishwashing duty on the line.)

574
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:37,052
(Winning is the only way to escape doing the dishes.)

575
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,122
Gosh. Seriously...

576
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,422
(Who will win this round?)

577
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:44,631
(Jae Wook's sticky hand is the first one to land on the card.)

578
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:46,132
(Will he succeed?)

579
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,162
- Gosh. - Goodness.

580
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:50,001
- This is harder than it seemed. - Seriously...

581
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:52,001
(Jung Ah's sticky hand isn't landing on the playing card.)

582
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:54,202
(She's practically flinging it like a whip now.)

583
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:56,272
(Aggravated)

584
00:24:56,502 --> 00:24:58,312
(Let me hit it just once!)

585
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:01,012
(She accidentally hit her forehead.)

586
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:03,012
I don't want to do the dishes.

587
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:06,552
Let me be free. I don't want to do it.

588
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:08,252
(Jun Myun is repairing her sticky hand.)

589
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,992
(Meanwhile, the youngest member is carefully timing his throw.)

590
00:25:11,022 --> 00:25:12,921
Let me be free. I don't want to do it.

591
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:14,461
(His sticky hand stuck to the playing card.)

592
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:17,091
Let me be free. I don't want to do it.

593
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,632
(Jae Wook wins!)

594
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,131
(He's overjoyed by his victory.)

595
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,402
Who won? Jae Wook?

596
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:24,601
- Jae Wook, you're out. - My back hurt so much.

597
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:25,602
You're out.

598
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:28,202
(Jae Wook escaped from dishwashing duty!)

599
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,372
Gosh. Seriously...

600
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:33,012
- Next round? - Let me straighten this real quick.

601
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:36,512
(Ji Yeon is practicing.)

602
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:38,682
(Swinging with full force)

603
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:45,622
(Jung Ah is practicing her wrist snap with a loose grip.)

604
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:49,862
(The hand should be quicker than the eye.)

605
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:52,932
(She's channeling her inner gambler.)

606
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:54,361
(This time, I'm going to focus.)

607
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,602
- Okay. - Let's do this.

608
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:56,801
- All right. - Let's begin.

609
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:58,632
(The sticky game competition for dishwashing duty, Round 2)

610
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:00,301
Ready.

611
00:26:00,302 --> 00:26:02,571
(Watch carefully. It's now down to the sisters.)

612
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:03,642
Begin.

613
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:08,512
(Veins popping)

614
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,412
(Wrist snapping)

615
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:15,382
(Exciting)

616
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:17,351
(Focused)

617
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:18,821
(Laser-focused)

618
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:20,052
(She eyes the target and aims her sticky hand right at it!)

619
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,991
(What?)

620
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:24,692
(It was there, but now it's not.)

621
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,132
(With a consistent wrist snap, )

622
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:29,602
Jung Ah... Gosh.

623
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:32,871
(Jung Ah won by a hair.)

624
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:34,741
(I avoided the dishwashing duty!)

625
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:35,841
It's going to be me.

626
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,572
(Jun Myun lost by just 0.1 seconds.)

627
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:40,982
(Why can't I do this?)

628
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:44,482
Ji Yeon, I'll do the dishes.

629
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:47,111
(She says insincerely.)

630
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:48,182
No!

631
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:51,952
- That's not right. - No, I'll just do the dishes.

632
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:53,591
- I'm fine with it. - No. Wait.

633
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:54,592
(A competition is a competition.)

634
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:56,292
She says that as she gets into position.

635
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:59,292
(No hard feelings, Jun Myun.)

636
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:03,202
(Who will be stuck with dish duty?)

637
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:05,371
One, two, three.

638
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:06,532
(Will it be Jun Myun, the clumsy player?)

639
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:09,542
(Or Ji Yeon, who's especially athletic?)

640
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:11,312
One, two, three.

641
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:14,342
(Gosh!)

642
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:16,812
(Ji Yeon's competitive drive kicks in.)

643
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:18,752
(No way.)

644
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,382
(Please stick to the playing card, just once!)

645
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,682
You're aiming too far.

646
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:24,051
Stick onto the card!

647
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:25,892
You got this. You're almost there!

648
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:27,352
You're almost there!

649
00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:30,091
(Jun Myun is fighting back.)

650
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,862
Your aim is too far. Get closer to the card!

651
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:36,202
- Hey! - Hey!
(Gosh!)

652
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,872
- Get closer to the card! - It's neck and neck!

653
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:40,901
(You do the dishes!)

654
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:43,702
(You do it!)

655
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:45,412
- Gosh. - Stick it onto the card!

656
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:47,582
(It's not like they don't want to.)

657
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:50,082
Jun Myun, don't lose focus!

658
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,381
You're almost there!

659
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,382
(Attacking again)

660
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:55,582
(Who will be the winner of this intense game?)

661
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:59,052
(Who will manage to get away from dish duty?)

662
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:01,062
(Snatch)

663
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:04,332
(Ji Yeon won.)

664
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,562
(In despair)

665
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,701
It's Jun Myun!

666
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:10,532
That was so intense.

667
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:14,442
So that's how the game goes. Gosh, that was exciting.

668
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:15,801
- That was fun, right? - Yes.

669
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:16,872
I'll do the dishes, then.

670
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:19,671
Gosh, my back. I'll do it.

671
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:20,911
My shoulders hurt so much.

672
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,212
(The 2nd side effect of the game: Shoulder pain)

673
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,351
- I'll do the dishes. - They hurt.

674
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,782
Thank you for the food and the fun.

675
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:29,081
She swung this so hard that this moved to the side.

676
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,082
(The 3rd side effect of the game: A broken sticky hand)

677
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,122
Goodness.

678
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:33,652
(After the sticky game ended)

679
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:34,792
Give them to me.

680
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:38,162
I told you, Jung Ah. I'm bad at playing games.

681
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:41,201
Jung Ah is much better than I thought she'd be.

682
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:43,262
- Jung Ah is good at games. - I'm good at things like that.

683
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:48,102
(As promised, Jun Myun begins doing the dishes by herself.)

684
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:52,672
(She's a clumsy player of games, but she's an efficient dishwasher.)

685
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:56,442
(The dishes and the sink are now spotless!)

686
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:01,122
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah turns on the record player.)

687
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:04,652
(Michael Jackson is the perfect choice for cleaning.)

688
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:07,152
(Hey!)

689
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:09,492
(Dancing along to the song)

690
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:14,192
(A late-night cleaning concert)

691
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,102
(Jung Ah is adorable.)

692
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,472
(Jung Ah meticulously...)

693
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,171
(sweeps the space between...)

694
00:29:23,172 --> 00:29:24,342
(Jun Myun's legs.)

695
00:29:25,612 --> 00:29:28,182
(Even after she finished cleaning, )

696
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:32,411
(Jung Ah is still full of energy.)

697
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:35,281
(She looks for something else that will entertain them.)

698
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:37,252
Gosh, microphones.

699
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,151
(She found the karaoke machine next to the TV.)

700
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,552
There's a karaoke machine here?

701
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,722
Let's sing.

702
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:45,492
(Jun Myun hypes herself up by dancing.)

703
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:49,132
(Jae Wook turns on the karaoke screen.)

704
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:50,932
(Gosh!)

705
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,272
- Would you like to sing a duet? - Yes.

706
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:55,401
(A perfect song to liven things up is...)

707
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:58,211
- What about "Eve's Warning?" - We were thinking the same thing.

708
00:29:58,212 --> 00:29:59,442
(Just the title got them excited.)

709
00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:02,542
("Eve's Warning" sung by Jung Ah and Ji Yeon)

710
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:06,852
(The sound of birds in a jungle echoes throughout Wando.)

711
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,451
(Shaking her body)

712
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:10,382
(Her dance resembles the movements of a cultivator.)

713
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:14,092
(The newly formed pair dance while sitting on the floor.)

714
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:17,062
(A late-night concert)

715
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:19,061
(Left)

716
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,532
(Right)

717
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:24,202
(Spinning her head as if she's doing a sangmo performance)

718
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,741
(If you keep trying to trick me)

719
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,241
(As if you're the only one with tricks)

720
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:34,172
(The joyful duo of Fresh off the Sea)

721
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:37,182
(I can't keep this up)

722
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:40,252
(Stretching out the final note)

723
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:41,951
(Her next song...)

724
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:45,392
(is more sensual.)

725
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:47,792
(Jun Myun loves it.)

726
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,862
(Deeply immersed)

727
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:54,262
(Jung Ah is her backup dancer.)

728
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,531
(Like me, you have...)

729
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:58,902
(a lonely...)

730
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:05,342
(A sleepless night in Wando)

731
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:06,471
(Now, it's time for the youngest to sing a slow song.)

732
00:31:06,472 --> 00:31:07,841
I love this.

733
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:12,012
(Now, it's time for the youngest to sing a slow song.)

734
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:16,182
Don't you worry

735
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:18,722
(Already immersed in the song)

736
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:24,022
(Lip-syncing along)

737
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,802
(Swaying sideways)

738
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:34,232
(She's dancing as if she's skating on the floor.)

739
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,342
(Too immersed)

740
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:42,182
(Just let the past)

741
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:45,982
(Jung Ah is now dancing like an air dancer.)

742
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:49,881
(Fresh Karaoke is newly open for business.)

743
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:52,452
(At Fresh off the Sea, any song can be danced along to.)

744
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:55,922
(Help me, Jun Myun.)

745
00:31:56,762 --> 00:32:00,192
(Let's all sing together)

746
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:03,362
(They sound so good!)

747
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:05,731
(Pleased with their performance)

748
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:06,732
This next part is really high.

749
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:09,271
(Just)

750
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:11,542
(Let the past)

751
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:13,612
(Be the past)

752
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:20,151
(The air dancers are blissfully enjoying the singing.)

753
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:21,152
(Singing)

754
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:24,522
(Electrified by the performance)

755
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,492
("Open Concert" in Wando)

756
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:33,462
(Ad-libbing)

757
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,802
(Amazing)

758
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,201
Jun Myun harmonizing with me...

759
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:40,602
- instantly made me feel good. - I know.

760
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:41,871
She hypes you up right away, doesn't she?

761
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:42,942
(That's Soul Park for you.)

762
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,572
(The "Open Concert" in Wando comes to a close.)

763
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,942
You can go ahead and wash up. You must be so tired.

764
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,451
(It's now time to get ready for bed.)

765
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,782
(Ji Yeon walks into the room.)

766
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,451
After being out in the sun all day,

767
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,222
my pores look stretched.

768
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:00,892
Doing my nighttime skincare routine is a must.

769
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:03,462
(Pumping)

770
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:09,662
Gosh.

771
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:13,772
It's so moist. My skin is glowing.

772
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,401
Really? Let me try it.

773
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:17,572
Go ahead.

774
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:19,741
(Jung Ah and Jun Myun try the product.)

775
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:21,012
I'm going to use a lot of it.

776
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,811
(Tingly)

777
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,381
- Goodness. - This device is so small...

778
00:33:26,382 --> 00:33:27,752
that it would be convenient to carry it around.

779
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,051
- Goodness. - Goodness.

780
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,252
Being able to do this at home...

781
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,491
is amazing.

782
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:34,792
(The three women finish up their skincare together.)

783
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:37,491
(They lay out the bedding...)

784
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:40,432
(on the floor of the spacious living room.)

785
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:46,602
(It's finally time for the Fresh members to sleep.)

786
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:51,102
(It's getting bright outside at Yeongpung Village.)

787
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:54,912
(The morning sun casts a warm glow over the village.)

788
00:33:56,182 --> 00:34:01,452
(One by one, the villagers wake up and begin their day.)

789
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:05,351
(It's morning at the Fresh House too.)

790
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,451
(Current time: 7:30am)

791
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:08,921
(Waking up at the phone vibrating)

792
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,192
(Jung Ah wakes up instantly at the sound of her phone vibrating.)

793
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:16,902
(She gets up to get ready without delay.)

794
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:21,002
(At 7:32am, another alarm starts to ring, )

795
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,341
(which wakes Jun Myun up.)

796
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:26,442
(She crawls over to turn it off.)

797
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,112
(Is Jun Myun getting up too?)

798
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:32,512
(Her hair looks like water laver.)

799
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:39,621
(She lies back down.)

800
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:44,362
(Jun Myun's success in waking up right away was short-lived.)

801
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:48,161
(Are the others up?)

802
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:50,601
(It's no surprise to Jung Ah that they're still in bed.)

803
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,101
(Wake up.)

804
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:53,471
(Laughing)

805
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:55,702
(Good morning)

806
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:59,472
(Jun Myun cheerfully greets Jung Ah.)

807
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,282
- Wake up. - Okay.

808
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:05,411
You told me that if I woke up at 7:30am,

809
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:06,882
you'd wake up at 7:32am.

810
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:10,551
(Jun Myun’s day begins with her eldest sister’s nagging.)

811
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:11,692
- I'll go bring... - What?

812
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:14,422
Go back to sleep. You okay?

813
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:17,321
- Right. Jung Ah. - Yes?

814
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:18,992
How does your body feel?

815
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,562
I feel completely fine.

816
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,432
Jung Ah is amazing.

817
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:23,931
(The younger members are still half-asleep.)

818
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:26,031
(She's amazing.)

819
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:28,771
(While the younger members finally begin getting ready, )

820
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:33,142
(Jung Ah pulls back the curtains...)

821
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:35,612
(and checks the weather outside.)

822
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,652
(The weather is perfect for taking a walk.)

823
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:41,722
(Perfect weather)

824
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:42,881
Let's go.

825
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,522
We have to make food when we return.

826
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:46,952
I'm all ready.

827
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,959
I'm all ready.

828
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:54,099
(Let's take advantage of the nice weather and go on a morning walk.)

829
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,499
(In awe)

830
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,869
I can't believe this scenery is right in front of our house.

831
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:05,179
(They're greeted by this view as soon as they leave the house.)

832
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:06,548
- How is this in front of our house? - How is the sea...

833
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:09,019
right in front of our house? This is incredible.

834
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,748
It really is beautiful.

835
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:14,149
(It really is beautiful.)

836
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:16,558
Look.

837
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,819
(They're in such a good mood already.)

838
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,328
Let's stop here in the middle...

839
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:22,099
and take pictures with the sea in the background.

840
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:23,798
Like this?

841
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,128
(Photographer Park wants to take pictures as always.)

842
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,228
(They take selfies with the morning sun on their faces.)

843
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,439
And turn around. Quickly.

844
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:32,008
- Gosh, just take it from one angle. - Gosh.

845
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:36,278
- Goodness. - Gosh, let's take one with the sea.

846
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,638
(They're all smiling when the pictures are being taken.)

847
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,109
- That's it. - That's it. Let's go.

848
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,808
Gosh, Jung Ah.

849
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:43,279
(Photographer Park is pleased.)

850
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,349
The village is so pretty.

851
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:47,289
It's beautiful.

852
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,688
It's so peaceful here.

853
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:52,028
(Even unsentimental Jung Ah is in love with the serene village.)

854
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:53,059
Goodness.

855
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,858
(They're enjoying this relaxing morning.)

856
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,199
(Kick)

857
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:00,798
(Ji Yeon is bursting with energy as always.)

858
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,538
- Walk quickly. - How do you run?

859
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,699
How's your usual speed? Like this?

860
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,239
Stop.

861
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:14,049
(The trial lasted 5 seconds.)

862
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,518
Right? I think there are clams here.

863
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,049
(Ji Yeon is walking ahead of them without even realizing.)

864
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,749
Ji Yeon, I can tell you want to run.

865
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:22,358
- Go ahead. - Go run.

866
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,989
- We'll be walking behind you. - Go run and come back.

867
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:26,758
- We'll meet up again later. - Right. Go run and come meet us.

868
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,058
Go run and come meet us.

869
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,059
(Ji Yeon decides to go for a run around the village.)

870
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,628
(Let's go run.)

871
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,429
(She tightens her shoelaces.)

872
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:34,939
I'll go for a quick run then.

873
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,469
(Ji Yeon begins running by herself.)

874
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:45,879
(The path stretches out along the edge of the village by the sea.)

875
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,718
(It feels even more special...)

876
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,918
(since it's right in front of the Fresh House.)

877
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:55,789
(Ji Yeon gets to enjoy the scenery to the fullest as she runs.)

878
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:00,389
(Taking in the salty sea air)

879
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:03,098
I love it here!

880
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,359
(I love it here!)

881
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:09,268
(She instantly feels refreshed.)

882
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,569
This is nice.

883
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,239
The others have to try running along this path.

884
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,709
What a shame.

885
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:23,179
Why do you keep making me sad

886
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:25,989
The neighborhood is beautiful.

887
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:27,589
- Look at the houses. - Right.

888
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,859
- Gosh, how cute. - Gosh.

889
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:31,558
- They're showing their faces. - Goodness.

890
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,029
- One by one. - They look like twins.

891
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,759
- How cute. - Let's go and see them.

892
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:36,358
They're so cute.

893
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,129
(Bye, doggies.)

894
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:42,069
(See you.)

895
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,068
- That was great. - Did you have fun?

896
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:45,168
(Ji Yeon rejoins them after her run.)

897
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,439
- Yes, it was. - You ran through the breeze.

898
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:49,909
(Now it's time to head back home.)

899
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,479
What's this?

900
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,879
It's poop.

901
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,548
- Step on it. - You step on it.

902
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:56,318
- No, don't do that. - Gosh.

903
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,789
(The two younger members are poking fun early in the morning.)

904
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:02,589
What are we having for breakfast again?

905
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:04,389
- Kongbiji jjigae. - Right.

906
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:05,988
It's going to be so good.

907
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,289
It's perfect for this weather.

908
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,699
I'll cook as fast as I can.

909
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,559
(Squealing)

910
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,699
- They're so cute. - Look at these babies.

911
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,638
- They're wagging their tails hello. - They're not even barking.

912
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,138
Hello to you too.

913
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,868
Are you happy to see us?

914
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:21,208
- Come here. - How pretty.

915
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,879
You're so cute.

916
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,009
(Jung Ah is heading home to make breakfast.)

917
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:27,348
(I'm going home first.)

918
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,249
- Look at Jung Ah. - Jung Ah.

919
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:33,219
(They're rushing home as well.)

920
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,258
I'll prepare it after washing up.

921
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,429
- Water laver pancakes. - Pancakes?

922
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:40,028
Do you want me not to make batter?

923
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,328
Do you want to do it from scratch yourself?

924
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,559
- I'll do it myself. - Okay.

925
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,569
(Powerfully walking to make water laver pancakes)

926
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,639
Look at Ji Yeon. She's cute. Look at her back.

927
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,799
- Who's cute? - Ji Yeon.

928
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,668
(I see...)

929
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:53,709
(Laughing)

930
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:55,538
Im Ji Yeon.

931
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:56,909
(Being sassy)

932
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,378
- What was that? - What's wrong with her?

933
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,879
Is she trying to be cute or what?

934
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:04,549
(After a fun morning walk)

935
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:08,319
Go in and wash yourself, Ji Yeon.

936
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,459
I feel so refreshed.

937
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,428
(Feeling refreshed after going for a walk)

938
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:14,859
Feeling refreshed.

939
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:18,928
(Feeling exhausted after going for a walk)

940
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:19,929
I'm so tired.

941
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:23,769
No. I'm so tired. My back hurts.

942
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,369
(You won't die for that.)

943
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,409
(Jae Wook is coming in.)

944
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,978
(Enjoying a cup of coffee)

945
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:37,678
(Enjoying a cup of coffee?)

946
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,218
Do you need just one to make soup? Is one enough?

947
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,219
Yes.
(All he is thinking about is how to assist Jung Ah.)

948
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:47,029
(What is today's breakfast?)

949
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:48,758
(Yesterday afternoon)

950
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:50,999
Jung Ah, do I take this soy pulp out?

951
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,429
Soy pulp? Yes.

952
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,499
(The one they defrosted as soon as they got home)

953
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,269
(Jung Ah ground it herself.)

954
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,639
(Jae Wook squeezed it himself.)

955
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:03,179
(Soy pulp from Gangwon Province)

956
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:06,909
(They promised to make kongbiji jjigae back then.)

957
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,119
(We're having it in Wando!)

958
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:14,218
Jae Wook. We're going to cook on a grill mesh mat...

959
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:15,819
over the big fire.

960
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:17,719
- On a grill mesh mat? - Yes.

961
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,559
Okay.

962
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,089
(No problem.)

963
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,269
(Grill mesh mat on the brazier)

964
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:28,229
(Firewood is ready.)

965
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,269
(After bringing a torch, he's ready to make a fire.)

966
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:35,339
(Where is Jae Wook heading?)

967
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:36,678
I'll soak this in water.

968
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,009
(Is there anything I can do?)

969
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,179
(Jung Ah Junior stays right next to Jung Ah.)

970
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,349
Green onion.

971
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:44,149
- Green onion? - I think it's over there.

972
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,989
Is it thick? I need at least one thick one.

973
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:49,388
(When Jae Wook takes it out, Jung Ah washes it.)

974
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:52,459
(When Jae Wook sets things up, )

975
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,329
(Jung Ah cooks.)

976
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:58,259
(Is there anything else I can do?)

977
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,898
(Zoning out)

978
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,599
Has anyone seen chili powder?

979
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,239
Yes.

980
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,309
It's right here.

981
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:06,938
Do you need a spicy one? Or...

982
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:08,138
- Okay. - Just a regular one.

983
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,308
- Just a regular one. - Yes.

984
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,009
(Detailed questions asking about its use)

985
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,909
(Fast delivery is a given.)

986
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:16,618
I need water.

987
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,379
(When she needs water, he finds water.)

988
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,518
I need high heat.

989
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,889
- Do you want the highest heat? - Yes.

990
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:25,159
(When she needs fire, he makes a fire.)

991
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,189
(Jae Wook, the all-rounder who can do anything)

992
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:30,928
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah...)

993
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:34,469
(places all the seasonings for convenient use.)

994
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:37,639
(Cleaned vegetables)

995
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:40,239
(Kimchi that Jun Myun cut)

996
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,679
(A small countertop is set up.)

997
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:44,779
Is there anything I missed?

998
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:47,879
(Jung Ah is asking Jung Ah.)

999
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,779
Is there anything else you want to add?

1000
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,819
(Who are you talking to?)

1001
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,189
I was talking to myself.

1002
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:00,789
Black pepper.

1003
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,799
(Running away)

1004
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:04,599
Let's start it now.

1005
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,229
(Im Ji Yeon's...)
(long-awaited...)

1006
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,739
(debut as a chef in Fresh off the Sea)

1007
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:16,679
(What should I do first?)

1008
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:17,909
Water laver.

1009
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:20,279
Water laver.

1010
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,218
(Almost forgot the main ingredient)

1011
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:23,919
- Is this water laver? - Yes.

1012
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,718
You have to wash it. Bring it here. I'll wash it for you.

1013
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,319
- I'll try it. - Will you wash it?

1014
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,828
(A handful of water laver)

1015
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,328
I think we need about that much.

1016
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:37,229
- I think we need this much. - Yes, I think so.

1017
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:41,029
(Starting with washing water laver)

1018
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,069
Washing water laver.

1019
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:48,778
(But...)

1020
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:51,938
(something...)

1021
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:55,849
(is strange.)

1022
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:57,118
(Before washing and while washing)

1023
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,689
(Definitely increased amount)

1024
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:03,858
(The rule of Fresh members)

1025
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,558
It won't taste bad because I put too much water laver.

1026
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,528
- Of course not. - It's water laver pancakes.

1027
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:08,629
Just wash it clean.

1028
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:14,469
(After washing it clean)

1029
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,599
Squeeze it.

1030
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:20,909
(Using grip strength)

1031
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:27,149
(While Strength Ji Yeon is squeezing water laver, )

1032
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:31,179
(Jae Wook sets fire to the firewood.)

1033
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:34,349
(Starting to cook kongbiji jjigae)

1034
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:38,829
(Putting oil in the pan)

1035
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:43,398
(Stir-frying pork first)

1036
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,029
I love this sound.

1037
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,169
- Is it getting hot? - It's good.

1038
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,609
(When the pork is cooked)

1039
00:44:55,979 --> 00:44:57,208
Cooking wine.

1040

(Diced onions)

1043
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,148
(And)

1044
00:45:04,149 --> 00:45:06,189
(Singing Jae Wook's favorite song)

1045
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:11,918
(Shaking)

1046
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:14,389

1052
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:29,438
(Into red soup, )

1053
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:33,379
(white soy pulp goes.)

1054
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,119
(It looks like vanilla ice cream.)

1055
00:45:41,189 --> 00:45:44,259
(She stirs it well so it won't become lumpy.)

1056
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,589
(Kongbiji jjigae will taste more savory.)

1057
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,229
(It might not be enough.)

1058
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:59,769
(Chef Yum's secret is a generous amount of soy pulp.)

(Jung Ah's kongbiji jjigae is almost done.)

1065

(Boil it for a while until the soy pulp is cooked.)

1066
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,868
Jae Wook. What you're going to do is...

1067
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,929
dry laver with me.

1068
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:32,508
(The challenge of Jun Myun and Jae Wook)

1069

No, we can't. We should use a knife.

Yes.

What?

1195
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:41,648
If it's thick like this,

1196
00:51:41,649 --> 00:51:43,679
we may end up chewing it like gum.

(Laver-flavored gum)

1198
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:48,989
Then, we can just chew it like gum.

1199

- Should we? - Yes, of course.

1200
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:52,889
- When would we have such a thing? - Exactly.

1201
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:54,229
Unbelievable.

00:51:56,859 --> 00:51:58,028
About this much.

1205
00:51:58,029 --> 00:51:59,168
They say it'll be stuck if it's too thin.

1206
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,898
About this much. Let me try only this much.

1207

00:52:18,379 --> 00:52:19,519
Is that so?

1214
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:21,818
- I didn't put in a lot. - Okay.

(It's not easy to pass on his standard.)

1222
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:35,029
This is too thin.

1223
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:36,669
I didn't put much.

1224
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,899
Jun Myun, I don't think we can eat this.

1225
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:41,639
This is really thin. I didn't put much.

1226
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:43,779
I think you can even put less.

1227
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:45,409
- Putting less? - Yes.

1228
00:52:45,479 --> 00:52:47,208
I put the least amount.

1229
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,478
- The least amount? - Yes.

1230
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:49,619
I put only a tiny bit.

1231
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:51,519
Check it out.

1232
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:53,448
(How...)

1233
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:56,919
(about this time?)

1234
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:00,658
- It looks good. I think it's good. - Yes.

1235
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:02,159
(Finally, they made a nice sheet of laver.)

1236
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:04,429
Do you think that is good enough?

1237
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:08,329
I think we can make it even thinner.

1238
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:11,799
Do you think so?

1239
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:14,909
I don't think I can make it thinner.

1240
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:16,939
Because I need to use it up.

1241
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:20,109
- I was too honest. - Where should we eat?

1243

Let's try to make it really thin.

1244
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:28,449
- This is it. It's really thin. - Is it?

1245
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:30,919
It's almost see-through.

1246

00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,359
My back hurts when I laugh.

1250
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:44,269
(What about this sheet that Jun Myun was confident about?)

1251
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:46,408
(What do you think?)

1252
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:47,568
(Nodding)

1253
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:48,639
Is this it?

1254
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,879
(The 10th one finally satisfies Jae Wook.)

1255
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:56,349
(Shaping it nicely and carefully)

1256
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:01,889
(They keep making laver sheets.)

1257
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:07,389
(From unloading to drying, laver was made with their hearts.)

1258
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:10,399
- It's pretty. - Is it?

1259
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:13,468
If they had all dried up when we got back from work,

1260
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:15,268
it would be so touching.

1261
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:16,668
What if I shed tears?

1262
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:17,738
Then, you cry.

1263
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:19,339
(You should just cry.)

1264
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:20,769
You just cry.

1265
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:22,569
I'm going to cry, Jung Ah.

1266
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:24,209
I won't be able to eat laver.

1267
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,049
Because it's so precious.

1268
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:31,078
(With the 17th sheet, )

1269
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,378
(placing laver for drying is done.)

1270
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:35,189
- It's nice. - It feels so good to look at them.

1271
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,389
Good work.

1272
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,729
(It'll be dried in half a day.)

1273
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:46,199
(Ji Yeon begins to prepare the batter.)

1274
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:50,499
(Eyeballing it like Jun Myun does)

1275
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,599
(Putting it in a bowl)

1276
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,709
(Adding more)

1277
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:57,209
(Staring)

1278
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:59,509
(Am I doing it right?)

1279
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:01,478
I need to add some frying mix.

1280
00:55:01,479 --> 00:55:02,819
(Whispering)

1281
00:55:04,379 --> 00:55:05,518
Frying mix.

1282
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,548
(Im Ji Yeon's whispering cooking class)

1283
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:07,619
Frying mix.

1284
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,419
Then, add water.

1285
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:16,099
(Adding water to Ji Yeon?)

1286
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,628
(Cutting water laver)

1287
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:24,298
Cut the water laver into the appropriate size.

1288
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:25,769
(Cutting water laver with scissors)

1289
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:27,308
Mussels...

1290
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,508
(Cutting mussels too)

1291
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,878
(Cutting mussels with scissors too)

1292
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:32,909
Cut...

1293
00:55:34,149 --> 00:55:35,179
mussels.

1294
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:39,118
(It looks like cooking for a student living alone.)

1295
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,119
Maybe two?

1296
00:55:41,389 --> 00:55:44,289
(Cutting peppers with scissors too)

1297
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:46,929
(Finally, she's using a cutting board.)

1298
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:49,629
Just cut them as I like.

1299
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:52,599
(Laughing)

1300
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,429
Add it to the bowl.

1301
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,769
I'm going to cut green onions.

1302
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,009
(What's the matter?)

1303
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,419
Can I use scallions instead of green onions?

1304
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,688
Can I use scallions instead of green onions?

1305
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:18,159
(Worried)

1306
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:20,229
Both are green onions, after all. So, it'll be fine.

1307
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,428
Add scallions.

1308
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,329
(Adding scallions instead of green onions)

1309
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,268
Add cold water.

1310
00:56:28,269 --> 00:56:30,869
(It's all ready.)

1311
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:33,739
I can't believe I did it.

1312
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:36,138
This is my first time.

1313
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:37,679
(Call me Batter Im from now on.)

1314
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:41,749
I think it's ready. Done!

1315
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:46,319
(It's time to cook.)

1316
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:49,219
(Adding oil to the pan)

1317
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,789
(She waits until it gets hot.)

1318
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,758
(Jung Ah brings a basin for her to use as a table.)

1319
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:01,629
(She also brings a chair.)

1320
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:03,699
Thanks.

1321
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,738
- You can put pancakes here. - Yes.

1322
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:07,069
(She also brings a tray for pancakes.)

1323
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:09,709
(Caring and considerate)

1324
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:11,639
(I'll do my best.)

1325
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:16,349
(Chef Im scoops the first batter.)

1326
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:20,088
(One spoonful)

1327
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:23,159
(And one more spoonful)

1328
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:27,059
It's heart-shaped.

1329
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,428
It's a heart-shaped one for tasting.

1330
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:32,559
(Heart-shaped water laver pancake)

1331
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:36,999
(Nervous)

1332
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:40,509
(It's time to flip it over.)

1333
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:43,208
(The highlight of cooking pancakes)

1334
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,209
(Flipping over)

1335
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,339
It's hot.

1336
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:49,109
(Golden-brown color)

1337
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:51,979
(Happy)

1338
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:53,388
It's nice.

1339
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,989
(Proud)

1340
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:57,618
It looks good.

1341
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:00,029
(It looks great for now.)

1342
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:03,059
(Smiling)

1343
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,359
(Since it looks great, )

1344
00:58:06,729 --> 00:58:07,828
(all I have to do is keep making it.)

1345
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:10,399
Ta-da. It's good.

1346
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:14,308
(Heart-shaped water laver pancakes...)

1347
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:16,609
(made with Ji Yeon's heart)

1348
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:17,979
It's burning.

1349
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:19,709
Be careful.

1350
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:24,379
(Ji Yeon's heart could burn, as well.)

1351
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,148
- Is it going well? - Yes.

1352
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,519
- Does it taste good? - I don't know.

1353
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,389
(Impressed)

1354
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,259
Let me taste it.

1355
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:37,058
- Can I? - Sure. Try it.

1356
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:38,998
- I'm Seasoning Park. - I'm not sure about seasoning.

1357
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,999
Is that so? Come here.

1358
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:42,798
Taste this.

1359
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,539
(Tasting Ji Yeon's water laver pancake for the first time)

1360
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:47,909
How is it?

1361
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,339
(How does the water laver pancake taste?)

1362
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:53,779
- I think it's good. - Is it good?

1363
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,748
Is it good? Really?

1364
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:56,749
(Really?)

1365
00:58:57,679 --> 00:58:58,818
I guess it tastes good!

1366
00:58:58,819 --> 00:58:59,849
(You made it well.)

1367
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:02,719
(I guess it tastes good!)

1368
00:59:04,689 --> 00:59:05,719
It's good.

1369
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:07,658
- Ji Yeon, it's really good. - Really?

1370
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:08,888
- Yes. - I can believe this.

1371
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:11,158
I might be good at cooking.

1372
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:12,159
(I might be good at cooking.)

1373
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:14,368
It's unbelievable. Does it really taste good?

1374
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,739
(Heart-shaped water laver pancakes are a big success with good flavor.)

1375
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:19,138
I feel so proud.

1376
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,709
I didn't know that cooking for others would feel so good.

1377
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:28,109
(Ji Yeon's water laver pancake is nearly done.)

(Jung Ah's kongbiji jjigae)

00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:41,858
(You look like a new bride.)

1383
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:42,929
Today.

1384
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,959
- Is there one per person? - Yes.

1385

(Chef Ji Yeon's debut work, water laver pancake)

1386
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:53,138
(The breakfast for their 2nd day in Wando was made with care.)

1387
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:55,308
Thank you for the food.

1388
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:56,839
(They enjoy breakfast under the warm sunlight.)

1389
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:59,508
(They first try the hot kongbiji jjigae.)

1390
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:01,079
It contains so much meat.

1391
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:05,949
(A spoonful of the soft kongbiji jjigae...)

1392
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,749
(touches the depth of her heart.)

1393
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:12,058
It's tasty, Jung Ah.

1394
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:13,559
- It's so tasty. - It's nice.

1395
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:15,229
It's so tasty.

1396
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,629
It's tasty, right?

1397
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,069
It's the soybean we ground.

1398
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:23,869
(Steam comes out of the hot dish.)

1399
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:26,568
(Jung Ah's kongbiji jjigae...)

1400
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:27,908
It's so nutty.

1401
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:30,039
(contains a large amount of soy pulp.)

1402
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:33,508
(Jae Wook fell in love with the nutty kongbiji jjigae.)

1403
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,648
(After eating rice, )

1404
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:38,048
(he eats the jjigae.)

(After eating rice, )

1406
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,089
(he eats the jjigae and repeats the process endlessly.)

1407
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:44,958
- It's so tasty. - It's nice.

1408
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:46,759
(The hot soup makes her happy.)

1409
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:49,329
Kongbiji jjigae is the best for winter.

1410
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:50,729
Yes. It's perfect.

1411
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:57,099
(The person who cooked the kongbiji jjigae tries it.)

1412
01:00:57,499 --> 01:00:59,399
It's tastier thanks to the kimchi Jun Myun brought.

1413
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:01,269
(Proud)

1414
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:03,809
Kongbiji jjigae is so savory.

1415
01:01:04,509 --> 01:01:05,938
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah)

1416
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:07,509
- We made it. - Yes.

1417
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:10,419
(She rips off a piece of a water laver pancake.)

1418
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:12,879
(Eating)

1419
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,048
- The aroma of water laver is great. - What's great?

1420
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:18,719
The aroma of water laver. It's great.

1421
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:23,028
- It contains a lot of water laver. - I know.

1422
01:01:23,029 --> 01:01:24,099
(Thanks to the water laver, the taste is deep and rich.)

1423
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:28,328
- The mussels provide a kick. - That's right.

1424
01:01:28,329 --> 01:01:29,939
(The chewy mussels provide a kick!)

1425
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:31,798
The mussels are so tasty.

1426
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:33,909
(The mussels are so tasty.)

1427
01:01:34,709 --> 01:01:36,478
- Water laver pancake is a treat. - Yes.

1428
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:37,939
(Water laver pancake is a treat.)

1429
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,609
(She shoves it into her mouth.)

1430
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:44,649
It's so tasty.

1431
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,648
It's tastier than what we ate yesterday.

1432
01:01:47,649 --> 01:01:48,818
- Really? - Yes.

1433
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:50,458
- Do you see me in a new light? - It's so tasty, right?

1434
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:51,619
Not really.

1435
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:53,529
Admit that you see me in a new light.

1436
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:56,158
(Still, I'm happy.)

1437
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:57,458
(She's cute.)

1438
01:01:57,459 --> 01:02:00,029
Aren't you happy that people find it tasty?

1439
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:01,268
- Totally. - She's happy.

1440
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,529
I'm on cloud nine.

1441
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,098
My happiness level is at its max.

1442
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,099
(Her happiness level is at its max.)

1443
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:07,838
(Meanwhile, his back looks sentimental.)

1444
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,039
(Dazed)

1445
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:12,978
- What's wrong, Jae Wook? - What?

1446
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,948
I'm looking at the sea. It's so nice.

1447
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:16,009
I see. Keep looking.

1448
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,948
(The view from the table...)

1449
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:24,859
(is the sea of Wando.)

1450
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:27,629
- It was no joke. - The laver looks pretty.

1451
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:29,159
It looks so pretty.

1452
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:31,198
(They have homemade dried laver in the yard.)

1453
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,829
We worked hard to get water laver.

1454
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:39,699
The laver must've dried while we were working.

1455
01:02:40,109 --> 01:02:41,608
I'll make the wild chive sauce.

1456
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:43,439
We can toast the dried laver.

1457
01:02:43,979 --> 01:02:45,409
- We can dip it in the sauce. - Yes.

1458
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,809
- Let's dip it in the sauce. - I love it.

1459
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:51,649
What should we eat for dinner?

1460
01:02:52,479 --> 01:02:55,619
We'll need to see the ingredient at the workplace.

1461
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,418
Then we'll come up with the menu.

1462
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:58,689
(The dinner menu depends on today's work.)

1463
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:02,759
I really hope we won't need to sit down and get up today.

1464
01:03:03,229 --> 01:03:05,499
- It'll be nice to remain seated. - I'm so exhausted.

1465
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,429
(What could it be?)

1466
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:11,039
(What could be our future?)

1467
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:13,739
You should tell us now.

1468
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:15,208
- We'll tell you. - Okay.

1469
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:19,109
The seasonal food you'll work on today is...

1470
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:20,978
(Which ingredient...)

1471
01:03:20,979 --> 01:03:23,378
(does today's work involve?)

1472
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:27,018
It's one of the side dishes you had for breakfast yesterday.

1473
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:28,919
(They had it for breakfast yesterday!)

1474
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,058
(What did we eat...)

1475
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:33,189
(yesterday?)

1476
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:37,559
(Which one could it be?)

1477
01:03:38,429 --> 01:03:39,499
Abalone?

1478
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,269
Hijiki? Skate?

1479
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:42,999
We didn't have skate yesterday.

1480
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,969
Half-dried fish?

1481
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:48,468
The seasonal ingredient you'll work on today is...

1482
01:03:48,469 --> 01:03:49,669
oyster.

1483
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:51,009
Oyster!

1484
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:53,479
How do you harvest oysters?

1485
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:55,949
How do you harvest oysters? Will we go to a farm?

1486
01:03:56,979 --> 01:03:59,619
(In Wando, )

1487
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:01,948
(there are...)

1488
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:04,018
(as many water laver farms...)

1489
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:06,859
(and abalone farms...)

1490
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:10,929
(as oyster farms.)

1491
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,699
(Today, they'll harvest oysters.)

1492
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:16,199
In that case,

1493
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:17,839
oysters...

1494
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:20,269
should be grilled over charcoal.

1495
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,709
They'll taste amazing.

1496
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,379
(Yes, you're right.)

1497
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:25,509
We'll light up the charcoal.

1498
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:26,748
- Grilled oysters. - Yes.

1499
01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:28,909
We should make grilled oysters.

1500
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,778
- Let's get ready. - Okay.

1501
01:04:31,779 --> 01:04:34,549
(Let's go and harvest oysters!)

1502
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:37,458
(The four siblings get ready to go to the oyster farm.)

1503
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:39,219
- The outfit is cute. - Right?

1504
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:43,499
Seriously, harvesting water laver...

1505
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:46,158
was the most intense labor...

1506
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:47,968
I've done in my life.

1507
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:50,199
- We had the laver pasta yesterday. - Jun Myun.

1508
01:04:50,569 --> 01:04:51,699
Yes?

1509
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:53,938
I'm the type to take...

1510
01:04:53,939 --> 01:04:55,508
- a lot of supplements. - Okay.

1511
01:04:55,509 --> 01:04:57,978
I brought some for the members.

1512
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:00,408
I brought the supplements that suit...

1513
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:03,618
the members' ages and sexes.

1514
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:04,678
Is this mine then?

1515
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:07,019
The blue one is Jae Wook's.

1516
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:08,919
And...

1517
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:10,389
Well...

1518
01:05:11,019 --> 01:05:12,919
Are you sure you know my age?

1519
01:05:13,429 --> 01:05:15,428
- Hey, apologize. - This isn't for you.

1520
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:17,259
I just wanted to show it.

1521
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:20,129
- What's mine? - It's this one.

1522
01:05:20,229 --> 01:05:23,838
(Covering the age group)

1523
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,568
- Do I take it as it is? - It's nice...

1524
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,308
because you can look after your health in an easy way.

1525
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:30,109
I carry one packet at a time.

1526
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:32,879
I carry one packet at a time and take the supplements.

1527
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,509
- My goodness. - Should I take all of them?

1528
01:05:34,649 --> 01:05:37,319
Yes. It's nice to take them every day.

1529
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:39,378
Shall I take them?

1530
01:05:39,379 --> 01:05:40,588
(They take supplements before going to work.)

1531
01:05:40,589 --> 01:05:42,219
- It's convenient. - Yes.

1532
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:45,589
(It's time to look after their health.)

1533
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:49,529
- Thank you. - All right.

1534
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,128
I took multivitamins thanks to you.

1535
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:52,398
Let's stay healthy today as well.

1536
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:53,668
(They looked after their health.)

1537
01:05:53,669 --> 01:05:54,898
Let's go and work.

1538
01:05:54,899 --> 01:05:56,229
(It's time to go and work!)

1539
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:59,938
(Jae Wook styles his hair before going to work.)

1540
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:03,169
(Staring)

1541
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:05,608
- What? - Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

1542
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:06,778
- No! - I'll do it for you.

1543
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,378
- I'll do it for you. - For goodness' sake.

1544
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:09,478
I'm good at it.

1545
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:11,479
(It's impossible to beat your older sister.)

1546
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:12,878
Stay still.

1547
01:06:12,879 --> 01:06:14,288
(Stay still.)

1548
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:16,349
(Very satisfied)

1549
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:21,928
- What's this? - You know what this is.

1550
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:22,958
You know, right?

1551
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:24,098
(It's ruined.)

1552
01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:25,229
(Giggling)

1553
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:27,228
(I knew that this would happen.)

1554
01:06:27,229 --> 01:06:29,199
(They bicker today as well.)

1555
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:31,199
You don't know styling.

1556
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:33,909
You don't know styling.

1557
01:06:34,269 --> 01:06:35,839
I'll need to wear a hat because of you.

1558
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:37,378
It's ruined.

1559
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:38,679
(It's ruined.)

1560
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:40,578
Gosh, I wanted to look natural.

1561
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,008
(The natural styling failed.)

1562
01:06:42,009 --> 01:06:43,519
(I'll get back at her.)

1563
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:48,349
(Meanwhile, Wando Port)

1564
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:52,818
(One man is standing at the Wando Port.)

1565
01:06:52,819 --> 01:06:54,529
The weather is quite nice.

1566
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:56,828
(My goodness)

1567
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,029
It's the smell of the sea.

1568
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,199
What's in season these days?

1569
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:02,869
(This man is curious about Wando's seasonal food.)

1570
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:06,839
(His jawline is sharp enough to cut.)

1571
01:07:07,709 --> 01:07:10,409
(His romantic-looking eyes are full of sentimentality.)

1572
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:13,609
(Laughing)

1573
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:16,279
Should I keep standing like this?

1574
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:18,048
You told me that I'd be able to get some rest.

1575
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:19,119
(He's a shy man.)

1576
01:07:19,419 --> 01:07:22,649
(Actor Yoon Kyung Ho)

1577
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:24,788
(He received a lot of love for his performance...)

1578
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,158
(on "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call.")

1579
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:28,529
I'm Han Yu Rim, a professor of colorectal surgery.

1580
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:30,928
(He was in "Smugglers" with Jung Ah and Jun Myun.)

1581
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,428
(Go Min Si was in the movie too.)

1582
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:34,999
(Seasonal food)

1583
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:37,939
(It's seasonal food.)

1584
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:39,769
(Really?)

1585
01:07:39,939 --> 01:07:41,509
(My seasonal food!)

1586
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,879
(Actor Yoon Kyung Ho)

1587
01:07:45,339 --> 01:07:48,509
I met Ji Yeon briefly for work.

1588
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:51,649
It was a movie titled "Revolver."

1589
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:55,719
As for Jun Myun, I met her while filming "Smugglers."

1590
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,658
As for Jung Ah,

1591
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:00,688
there were "Intimate Strangers,"

1592
01:08:00,689 --> 01:08:03,329
"Cleaning Up" and "Smugglers."

1593
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:06,058
But it'll be my first time meeting Jae Wook.

1594
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:07,099
(Jae Wook is the only one he hasn't met before.)

1595
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:09,728
(He becomes shy again after talking.)

1596
01:08:09,729 --> 01:08:10,899
My goodness.

1597
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:12,838
Kyung Ho.

1598
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,108
(The shy Kyung Ho welcomes someone warmly.)

1599
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:16,138
My goodness.

1600
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:18,408
- Kyung Ho. - You're wearing cute clothes.

1601
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:21,849
(Actress Kim Jae Hwa)

1602
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,618
(Jae Hwa had the perfect teamwork with Jung Ah and Jun Myun...)

1603
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,519
(in the movie, "Smugglers.")

1604
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:29,319
(They were on a boat together.)

1605
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:32,219
(It's the price for the delivery.)

1606
01:08:32,389 --> 01:08:34,929
(My goodness)

1607
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:41,598
(In "The Tale of Lady Ok," she was Ji Yeon's soulmate.)

1608
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:45,468
(I should've visited the show before anyone.)

1609
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:47,509
(Jae Hwa)

1610
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:50,779
(Actress Kim Jae Hwa)

1611
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:52,938
- Gosh, we... - Let's go.

1612
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:54,579
Will we work here?

1613
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:57,719
How will we fool them?

1614
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:01,349
- I mean... - Where will we meet them?

1615
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:03,518
We talked on the phone yesterday.

1616
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,259
- I... - We had various plans.

1617
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,458
If you wear a mask...

1618
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:08,659
Even if you wear a mask, it'll be too obvious.

1619
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:10,998
- I'll wear a mask. - Okay.

1620
01:09:10,999 --> 01:09:13,129
- I'll pull up my hood. - Push down the cap.

1621
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:14,369
I'll do this.

1622
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:16,569
Am I hiding myself too much?

1623
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:19,139
- It's too obvious. Cover the eyes. - But...

1624
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,569
- Let me do this. - Okay.

1625
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:25,179
- Like this. - But...

1626
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,979
If I turn around...

1627
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:30,109
I can put my hands inside the clothes.

1628
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:33,019
(After a long rehearsal, )

1629
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:36,919
(they arrive at the place where they'll meet the members.)

1630
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,388
Hello.

1631
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:40,118
(Fan service)

1632
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:41,129
All right.

1633
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:44,429
- Gosh, I'll wear work clothes. - Oh, no.

1634
01:09:46,299 --> 01:09:47,329
This is fun.

1635
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,768
(They're excited about meeting the members.)

1636
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,868
I don't know what we're doing today.

1637
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:54,008
But we'll get caught first.

1638
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:55,009
(They put on clothes endlessly.)

1639
01:09:55,309 --> 01:09:57,038
(Struggling)

1640
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,008
Shall we just say hello?

1641
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:00,139
(Shall we just say hello and make an entrance?)

1642
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:05,179
(What kind of a plan do the two actors have?)

1643
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:06,949
- Harvest oysters? - Yes.

1644
01:10:07,489 --> 01:10:08,489
How will we do it?

1645
01:10:09,019 --> 01:10:12,059
How will we do it once we go out to the sea?

1646
01:10:13,089 --> 01:10:16,259
(Feeling nervous and excited, they set off.)

1647
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:18,559
Shall I connect to it?

1648
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:22,099
Of course, Jung Ah. We should listen to music.

1649
01:10:22,799 --> 01:10:25,069
(Which song does Jung Ah choose?)

1650
01:10:26,339 --> 01:10:28,209
- What is it, Jung Ah? - DEUX?

1651
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:29,509
Tashannie.

1652
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:31,608
Tashannie. It has been a while.

1653
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:32,609
("Warning" by Tashannie)

1654
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,408
(The song from their memories makes them cheerful.)

1655
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:36,509
(Bobbing her head)

1656
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:38,948
(The members' old-time favorite)

1657
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:41,049
(Controlled movements)

1658
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:44,019
(The one who consoled him)

1659
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,289
(When he shed tears because of you)

1660
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:47,559
(Was me)

1661
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:51,198
(Impressed)

1662
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,198
(It's obvious that she has been to the karaoke.)

1663
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,268
- Jung Ah. - Ji Yeon is all warmed up.

1664
01:10:54,269 --> 01:10:56,169
Ji Yeon is all warmed up. Seriously.

1665
01:10:56,939 --> 01:10:58,338
I'm on cloud nine since this morning...

1666
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,538
because I did a good job with the water laver pancake.

1667
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:01,968
- Why? - The water laver pancake.

1668
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:04,139
- Because it came out well? - She made it well.

1669
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:06,838
The water laver pancake was so good.

1670
01:11:06,839 --> 01:11:07,978
- Seriously. - That's right.

1671
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:11,078
Jung Ah, Ji Yeon should be independent now.

1672
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:12,079
Yes.
(You don't need to learn more.)

1673
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,688
Don't just prepare the ingredients. Make a dish at a time.

1674
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:16,689
I'll do that.

1675
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,689
(Ji Yeon, congratulations on getting a promotion.)

1676
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:23,929
(As they celebrate Chef Im's successful debut, )

1677
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:27,369
(the four siblings get closer to the workplace.)

1678
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:29,468
(However)

1679
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:32,799
Will the guest act when he or she enters?

1680
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:35,508
"Hey, you should work properly."

1681
01:11:35,509 --> 01:11:36,839
Will the guest do that?

1682
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:38,478
He or she will say a catchphrase.

1683
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:40,879
(She has had many experiences with the guests.)

1684
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:46,349
(At the wharf, people are getting ready for work.)

1685
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:52,259
(The staff members are getting ready busily.)

1686
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:54,988
(Camera director)

1687
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:56,129
All right.

1688
01:11:57,699 --> 01:11:58,799
What are you filming?

1689
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:01,799
Hello.

1690
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,898
(Oh, my! I see!)

1691
01:12:02,899 --> 01:12:04,238
He didn't know.

1692
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,639
(A real camera director got fooled.)

1693
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:07,569
My disguise is perfect.

1694
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:11,639
(Temporary camera director, Yoon Kyung Ho)

1695
01:12:12,309 --> 01:12:13,878
(Testing the camera)

1696
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:15,648
(Kyung Ho's camera)

1697
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:16,949
(Peek-a-boo)

1698
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:19,878
(Jae Hwa is disguising as an audio director.)

1699
01:12:19,879 --> 01:12:21,789
(The equipment adds to the details.)

1700
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:22,819
All right.

1701
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,919
I'll follow them.

1702
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:27,258
I'll do this.

1703
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,559
(They're disguised as staff members.)

1704
01:12:29,089 --> 01:12:30,828
If I don't get caught, I'll follow them...

1705
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:32,599
as they board the boat.

1706
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:36,099
If I don't get caught, I'll do this until the end.

1707
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:38,869
(Will he be able to keep himself from getting caught?)

1708
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:43,108
(All the preparations are over.)

1709
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,908
- I'm a camera director. - I'm an audio director.

1710
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:46,909
(On standby)

1711
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,549
I think it's obvious.

1712
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:49,978
A car is approaching.

1713
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:50,979
(Nervous)

1714
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:54,249
It must be that white car.

1715
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,049
(The members' car enters the port.)

1716
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:01,858
What awaits us?

1717
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:03,459
A boat does, my lady.

1718
01:13:04,029 --> 01:13:07,098
- Is that so? - Yes, my lady.

1719
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:09,199
(The members arrive without knowing anything.)

1720
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:11,969
They're coming.

1721
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,108
- Let's go. - Shall we go now?

1722
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:16,639
(They set off to the wharf.)

1723
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,409
They're coming.

1724
01:13:21,549 --> 01:13:23,649
The shock of the water laver hasn't subsided yet.

1725
01:13:23,749 --> 01:13:24,749
Seriously.
(They don't know that something more shocking awaits.)

1726
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:26,749
The oysters are here.

1727
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,319
(I, Yoon Kyung Ho, am here.)

1728
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:32,458
That must be it.

1729
01:13:32,459 --> 01:13:33,859
(Kyung Ho's camera)

1730
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:36,359
Two members per boat?

1731
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:38,559
Will we get divided up?

1732
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:40,429
The boats are small.

1733
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:42,969
Let's go.

1734
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,139
(10 seconds before meeting the members)

1735
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:53,439
I think they're filming Ji Yeon.

1736
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:02,949
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon get closer.)

1737
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:06,018
(Director Yoon is here.)

1738
01:14:06,019 --> 01:14:07,019
(Looking around)

1739
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,759
- Hello. - Which boat should we board?

1740
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:11,529
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon only think about work.)

1741
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:15,569
(Will Director Yoon board the boat this way?)

1742
01:14:16,269 --> 01:14:18,239
(You can do it, Yoon Kyung Ho!)

1743
01:14:18,469 --> 01:14:21,139
(Jung Ah is right in front of him.)

1744
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:22,908
Which boat...

1745
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:24,508
(I, Yoon Kyung Ho, will get on the boat.)

1746
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:25,539
Hey!

1747
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:30,409
(Kyung Ho's camera)

1748
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:32,679
- What? - Yu Rim!

1749
01:14:34,089 --> 01:14:35,789
- Yu Rim! - What?

1750
01:14:36,749 --> 01:14:38,888
(The screen turns blank...)

1751
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:41,229
(like Kyung Ho's head.)

1752
01:14:41,529 --> 01:14:43,659
(Yu Rim is flustered.)

1753
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,259
Aren't you Professor Han Yu Rim?

1754
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:49,468
(Me? You're mistaken.)

1755
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:50,969
(Panicking)

1756
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:53,338
(Director Han Yu Rim is at the end of the cliff.)

1757
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:54,339
- Look. - What?

1758
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:59,978
(Kyung Ho's camera)

1759
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:01,149
Seriously.

1760
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:03,809
(He's Professor Han Yu Rim!)

1761
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:06,478
Yu Rim!

1762
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:07,789
- Yu Rim! - You're mistaken.

1763
01:15:08,889 --> 01:15:10,389
People tell me that I look like him.

1764
01:15:10,689 --> 01:15:11,788
(I'm Yoon Kyung Ho.)

1765
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:13,288
You came all the way here.

1766
01:15:13,289 --> 01:15:15,158
- Hello. - Kyung Ho.

1767
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,628
- Kyung Ho. - Hello.

1768
01:15:16,629 --> 01:15:17,799
(This wasn't the entrance I had in mind.)

1769
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:19,729
I got caught too quickly.

1770
01:15:21,569 --> 01:15:22,969
How did I get caught right away?

1771
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:25,068
- Seriously. - I got caught too quickly.

1772
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:26,639
I made a lot of preparations.

1773
01:15:26,769 --> 01:15:28,209
Seriously.

1774
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:30,678
I wondered what Jung Ah was talking about.

1775
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:32,608
- I got caught too quickly. - Did you spot him?

1776
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:34,048
Yes, I did.

1777
01:15:34,049 --> 01:15:35,979
(He got caught by the first sibling with quick wits.)

1778
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:38,748
- You lost weight. - I've always looked this way.

1779
01:15:38,749 --> 01:15:39,949
I just look bigger on the screen.

1780
01:15:40,989 --> 01:15:42,089
It's all fake.

1781
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,259
- You're so handsome. - You're too kind.

1782
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:47,459
Ji Yeon.

1783
01:15:47,929 --> 01:15:49,688
- Congratulations. - You're too kind.

1784
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:52,098
The actor on "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call..."

1785
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:54,228
- who's very popular these days, - He's very popular.

1786
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:55,529
- Yoon Kyung Ho came. - Yes.

1787
01:15:55,699 --> 01:15:56,699
It's nice to meet you.

1788
01:15:57,399 --> 01:15:59,239
(Jae Hwa, I'm sorry that I got caught.)

1789
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:00,669
What are we doing today?

1790
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:02,038
- Today... - Oysters.

1791
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:03,069
- Oysters? - We'll harvest oysters.

1792
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:05,179
Yes. Wando is known for its oysters.

1793
01:16:06,339 --> 01:16:09,379
(Director Kim watches them.)

1794
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:12,019
(They have no idea that Jae Hwa is here.)

1795
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,649
Which boat shall we board?

1796
01:16:15,349 --> 01:16:17,659
(She carefully waits for the right time.)

1797
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,459
Before boarding the boat,

1798
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,059
we'll check the audio equipment.

1799
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:24,228
- Then we'll go. - Board the boat.

1800
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:26,458
(Jae Hwa approaches them.)

1801
01:16:26,459 --> 01:16:27,599
The audio equipment...

1802
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:31,469
(She succeeds in approaching Jung Ah.)

1803
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:34,368
What are you looking for? It's here.

1804
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:35,839
(Jae Hwa is so nervous that she looks for it on her back.)

1805
01:16:36,469 --> 01:16:37,708
I was born in 1980.

1806
01:16:37,709 --> 01:16:38,909
- In 1980? - Yes.

1807
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:40,649
It's here. Isn't it working?

1808
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:43,549
It's here. Hold on.

1809
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:45,578
What? What is it?

1810
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:47,049
- What? - It's...

1811
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,089
(Peeking)

1812
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:57,259
This is insane.

1813
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,259
Who is it?

1814
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:01,898
- Hey. - Say that it's someone you know.

1815
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:04,039
- A staff member you know. - I met someone I know.

1816
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:08,069
Hey, I met someone I know.

1817
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:12,039
Say that I'm a staff member you worked with a long time ago.

1818
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,348
- Who is she? - Hey, I met someone I know.

1819
01:17:16,349 --> 01:17:17,519
- Who is she? - Why are you crying?

1820
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:20,948
Why are you crying?

1821
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:22,588
- What? - A staff member you worked with.

1822
01:17:22,589 --> 01:17:23,589
(Jung Ah joins in on the hidden camera prank.)

1823
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,389
(Actress Yum mode is on.)

1824
01:17:26,759 --> 01:17:28,129
- Have you been well? - I guess...

1825
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:30,828
- What is it? - I guess they go back many years.

1826
01:17:30,829 --> 01:17:31,899
What's going on?

1827
01:17:32,299 --> 01:17:33,629
I'm tearing up too.

1828
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:36,469
(Passionate acting)

1829
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:38,399
- Who is she? - What's going on?

1830
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:39,799
What did they work on?

1831
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:41,738
Things like this make me cry.

1832
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:42,809
- What's going on? - Why are you crying?

1833
01:17:48,249 --> 01:17:53,718
Hello!

1834
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:55,919
Hey, Kim Jae Hwa!

1835
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,119
(Covering her mouth)

1836
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:01,729
Hey! What's going on?

1837
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:05,959
Hey! Gosh, Jung Ah!

1838
01:18:08,129 --> 01:18:10,968
- Kim Jae Hwa! - Hello.

1839
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:13,798
Gosh, my Mak Sim.

1840
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:15,139
(Jae Hwa hugs Ji Yeon without a word.)

1841
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:17,708
- Hello. - Hello. It's nice to meet you.

1842
01:18:17,709 --> 01:18:20,078
Mak Sim.

1843
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,678
(She's so happy that she bursts out in tears.)

1844
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,209
It's good to see you.

1845
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:25,649
- It's good to see you. - Why are you guys crying?

1846
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:26,849
It's good to see you.

1847
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:28,149
(The accomplice of the prank becomes emotional as well.)

1848
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:30,719
- Jung Ah. - It's good to see you.

1849
01:18:32,019 --> 01:18:34,018
(The guest traveled a long distance without hesitation.)

1850
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:35,288
I can't believe it.

1851
01:18:35,289 --> 01:18:36,628
We came together.

1852
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:39,399
- Why are you crying? - Seeing Jung Ah cry...

1853
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:41,799
- I burst into tears. - Why are you crying?

1854
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:43,728
- Why are you crying? - The cold sea wind...

1855
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:45,268
- is making me cry. - They're so strange.

1856
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:46,438
- The cold sea wind... - I can't believe it.

1857
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:47,639
- is making me cry. - Hey.

1858
01:18:48,109 --> 01:18:49,639
My Mak Sim.

1859
01:18:51,139 --> 01:18:52,139
I can't believe it.

1860
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:53,578
I was nervous.

1861
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:57,049
I didn't think that Kyung Ho would get caught.

1862
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,379
He said that he'd board the boat.

1863
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,419
He said, "If you get caught first..."

1864
01:19:01,589 --> 01:19:03,518
- I told her not to snitch. - Take it off.

1865
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:04,988
- I can take it off now. - I can't believe it.

1866
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:06,258
(Jae Hwa came with Kyung Ho.)

1867
01:19:06,259 --> 01:19:07,958
They came together.

1868
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:09,788
Jung Ah, since you were crying, I thought...

1869
01:19:09,789 --> 01:19:11,228
she was a staff member you'd known for years.

1870
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:12,458
- Really? - Seriously.

1871
01:19:12,459 --> 01:19:13,459
(Jung Ah ended up contributing to the hidden camera prank.)

1872
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:18,198
It's our 1st time to have 2 guests.

1873
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:19,768
Seriously. It's our first time.

1874
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:21,508
- Thank you for coming here. - Thank you so much.

1875
01:19:21,509 --> 01:19:23,708
Mak Sim. My Mak Sim.

1876
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:25,708
(Goo Deok and Mak Sim meet again.)

1877
01:19:25,709 --> 01:19:28,608
We'll work hard, so leave things to us today.

1878
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:29,908
- Really? - Yes.

1879
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:32,948
- Work was so hard yesterday. - Seriously.

1880
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:34,118
It was intense.

1881
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:35,388
In any case, let's work together.

1882
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:37,288
- Let's get on the boat. - Okay.

1883
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:38,558
- Let's work. - Let's do that.

1884
01:19:38,559 --> 01:19:39,588
- Wipe your tears. - How should we do it?

1885
01:19:39,589 --> 01:19:42,128
We hoped that you'd come.

1886
01:19:42,129 --> 01:19:44,059
- Really? - Jae Hwa.

1887
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:46,999
- Jae Hwa! - It'll be fun today!

1888
01:19:48,429 --> 01:19:49,969
- It's so nice. - Let's eat tasty food today.

1889
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:51,768
- Seriously. - It'll be fun.

1890
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:52,838
- All right. - Let's go.

1891
01:19:52,839 --> 01:19:54,739
- Kyung Ho, come this way. - Okay.

1892
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:56,208
- Let's go. - Which one should we board?

1893
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:57,369
(Let's go and harvest oysters.)

1894
01:19:59,179 --> 01:20:00,538
- Hello. - Hello.

1895
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:02,808
- We're in your care. - Hello. Welcome.

1896
01:20:02,809 --> 01:20:06,118
Thank you for coming all the way here.

1897
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:08,218
- Thank you. - Today...

1898
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,348
Sinji Island is famous...

1899
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:12,459
- for its oysters. - Okay.

1900
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:13,688
(Sinji Island)

1901
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:16,229
(Sinji Island is Wando's small and beautiful island.)

1902
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:20,029
(At the clean sea by Sinji Island...)

1903
01:20:21,299 --> 01:20:24,269
(is an oyster farm of an incredible size.)

1904
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:26,868
(If you look inside)

1905
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,839
The sea is very clean.

1906
01:20:30,469 --> 01:20:32,308
The water flows well.

1907
01:20:32,309 --> 01:20:33,309
(You'll see the flowers of the sea that are in bloom.)

1908
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:36,509
They're tasty now. They're in the best state.

1909
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:38,849
Oysters bloom like flowers.

1910
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:45,419
(When you open the oysters that have bloomed like flowers, )

1911
01:20:46,019 --> 01:20:48,789
(you'll get food that's full of nutritions and flavors.)

1912
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:52,829
(The milk of the sea, oysters will show itself.)

1913
01:20:55,599 --> 01:20:58,869
(The treasure of Sinji Island, oyster)

1914
01:20:58,899 --> 01:20:59,899
(Escorting)

1915
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,609
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

1916
01:21:02,209 --> 01:21:03,708
- Would it be rude... - Go ahead.

1917
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:05,179
- to call you by your name? - Of course not. Call me that.

1918
01:21:05,409 --> 01:21:06,478
(Smiling)

1919
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,508
My Mak Sim!

1920
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:10,978
- Mak Sim. - My lady, have you been well?

1921
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:13,818
- Mak Sim! - I missed you so much.

1922
01:21:13,819 --> 01:21:16,848
Gosh, you look terrible.

1923
01:21:16,849 --> 01:21:18,418
I'll help you.

1924
01:21:18,419 --> 01:21:20,388
- Gosh. - I became a slave again.

1925
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,129
Did you get a new husband?

1926
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:24,858
(Many things have changed.)

1927
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:26,528
It'll be so much fun.

1928
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:28,768
- Jung Ah has sharp eyes. - Seriously.

1929
01:21:28,769 --> 01:21:30,398
I didn't know what to do,

1930
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:31,598
so I untied her clothes.

1931
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:33,398
Then she lifted my cap.

1932
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:36,108
Jung Ah was like, "Someone keeps untying my clothes."

1933
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:37,609
She said that.

1934
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:40,108
I was like, "What's going on?"

1935
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,109
(The hidden camera prank made everyone laugh and cry.)

1936
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,409
It was touching.

1937
01:21:43,609 --> 01:21:45,478
(The boat is getting ready to leave.)

1938
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:48,618
- She's older than you. - I know that.

1939
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:49,688
All right.

1940
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:50,718
(Kyung Ho helps Jun Myun with her gear.)

1941
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,189
- Would you lengthen it? - My goodness.

1942
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:55,589
- Do it to the end. - No.

1943
01:21:55,959 --> 01:21:57,828
Mr. Kyung Ho, I'll use a casual tone.

1944
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,159
- Please go ahead. - Okay.

1945
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:01,268
Just call me Kyung Ho.

1946
01:22:01,269 --> 01:22:02,469
- Okay. - Hold on.

1947
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:03,899
(He's ready.)

1948
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,269
- Let's go. - What should I do?

1949
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,669
(Warm up your body, Kyung Ho.)

1950
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:12,838
(They set off to harvest oysters.)

1951
01:22:12,839 --> 01:22:14,409
Hello.

1952
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:17,279
Hey.

1953
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:20,449
We'll get going first.

1954
01:22:20,879 --> 01:22:23,018
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1955
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:25,018
All right. Harvest many oysters.

1956
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:27,418
Work a lot.

1957
01:22:27,419 --> 01:22:28,428
(Smiling)

1958
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:30,258
- We'll go this way. - Bye.

1959
01:22:30,259 --> 01:22:31,928
All right. See you later.

1960
01:22:31,929 --> 01:22:33,658
- Honey. - Work hard.

1961
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,428
- Honey, work well. - Honey.

1962
01:22:35,429 --> 01:22:36,699
Honey, bye.

1963
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:41,339
This is the best weather.

1964
01:22:41,809 --> 01:22:43,038
- Thank goodness. - It's amazing.

1965
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,838
Let's go and harvest oysters.

1966
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:46,109
(Weather helps them with the oyster harvest.)

1967
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,478
- It's nice. - Yes.

1968
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:50,608
- It's nice indeed. - Yes.

1969
01:22:50,609 --> 01:22:52,518
The green onion kimchi looked so tasty.

1970
01:22:52,519 --> 01:22:53,819
She's an amazing cook.

1971
01:22:54,249 --> 01:22:57,548
I just assist her and make the side dishes.

1972
01:22:57,549 --> 01:22:59,318
- When you taste... - That's the hardest work.

1973
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:01,629
- Jung Ah's food... - Jung Ah's cooking skills...

1974
01:23:02,059 --> 01:23:03,889
- are well-known. - Seriously.

1975
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:06,898
- Sikhye too. - I feel pressured.

1976
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:07,929
- Hey. - Yes?

1977
01:23:10,269 --> 01:23:12,368
You're my... My goodness. Seriously.

1978
01:23:12,369 --> 01:23:14,969
I was going to make sikhye today. My best student came.

1979
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:17,938
Shall I help you again?

1980
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:19,138
He and In Sung are...

1981
01:23:19,139 --> 01:23:20,708
- my best students. - That's right.

1982
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,748
My goodness.

1983
01:23:21,749 --> 01:23:23,508
(Best students 1 and 2)

1984
01:23:23,509 --> 01:23:25,819
(On "Unexpected Business 3,")

1985
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:29,118
(they learned Jung Ah's sikhye recipe.)

1986
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:30,818
(Say a few words to Yum Jung Ah.)

1987
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:31,819
He'll cry again.

1988
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,959
(Kyung Ho made sikhye successfully.)

1989
01:23:34,929 --> 01:23:37,929
(Jung Ah's sikhye was a big hit in the US.)

1990
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:40,428
- Jung Ah, seriously. - We'll make kabocha sikhye today.

1991
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:41,798
- Kabocha sikhye? - Yes.

1992
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:44,899
Kabocha sikhye? I see. I've seen it once.

1993
01:23:45,839 --> 01:23:48,768
- I know the mixing process. - That's right.

1994
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:50,638
I can add hot water and mix the ingredients.

1995
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,639
My goodness.

1996
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:52,808
That's good.

1997
01:23:52,809 --> 01:23:53,809
(Let's look forward to the kabocha sikhye.)

1998
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:56,408
Are all of these a part of the oyster farm?

1999
01:23:56,409 --> 01:23:57,479
It seems that way.

2000
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,018
It's impressive.

2001
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:01,889
(They ride the boat for a while.)

2002
01:24:03,449 --> 01:24:05,958
All right. We've arrived at the workplace.

2003
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:07,119
- Okay. - Okay.

2004
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:12,128
- This place is cool. - Yes.

2005
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:13,399
(The captain hooks the rope where the oysters are attached.)

2006
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:16,098
(The members get ready to work.)

2007
01:24:16,099 --> 01:24:18,038
- Spread it out. - Okay.

2008
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:19,299
(They spread out the net first.)

2009
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:23,038
(They get ready to work without being told what to do.)

2010
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:24,068
Here.

2011
01:24:24,069 --> 01:24:25,138
(Glancing over)

2012
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:27,948
(Kyung Ho looks at the members and sets things up.)

2013
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:29,779
(What should we do next?)

2014
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:32,619
(The remote is on.)

2015
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:37,119
(The pulley pulls up the rope.)

2016
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:39,789
(My goodness)

2017
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:42,759
(The rope gets pulled up slowly...)

2018
01:24:43,129 --> 01:24:45,829
(and reveals what was hidden inside the sea.)

2019
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:53,099
(The treasure of Sinji Island, oyster)

2020
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:56,309
(Oh, my!)

2021
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:58,708
(There is a big amount of oysters.)

2022
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:02,309
These are the oysters we grow at Sinji Island.

2023
01:25:04,009 --> 01:25:06,549
(Oyster)

2024
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:10,888
(They marvel at the grandeur of the oyster waterfall.)

2025
01:25:10,889 --> 01:25:12,389
Look at them.

2026
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:16,729
(The sight just makes him chuckle.)

2027
01:25:17,799 --> 01:25:20,598
Hold the sickle with your right hand and cut it.

2028
01:25:20,599 --> 01:25:22,168
- Okay. - Hold the rope.

2029
01:25:22,169 --> 01:25:23,298
(While one person holds the top of the rope)

2030
01:25:23,299 --> 01:25:26,038
Pull it like this.

2031
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:28,269
- It's easier for two people. - Like this.

2032
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:31,208
- Okay. - They shouldn't break, right?

2033
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,978
You need to be careful.

2034
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:34,338
It's understandable since you lack experience.

2035
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:37,108
- I see. I should hold it like this. - Pull it together.

2036
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:38,449
- Okay. - Go ahead.

2037
01:25:38,919 --> 01:25:40,578
They need to be washed anyway.

2038
01:25:40,579 --> 01:25:41,589
(The experienced worker, Leader Yum picks up the hose.)

2039
01:25:42,219 --> 01:25:44,349
(She washes them cleanly.)

2040
01:25:44,959 --> 01:25:46,459
(Cutting)

2041
01:25:47,259 --> 01:25:49,029
(Jun Myun cuts the rope so that it's easier to wash them.)

2042
01:25:49,489 --> 01:25:50,629
One, two.

2043
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:51,859
- It's long. - There you go.

2044
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,729
That's how you do it. One, two.

2045
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:55,069
It's long.

2046
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,569
You learned in no time.

2047
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,269
- Of course. - All right.

2048
01:25:59,899 --> 01:26:02,269
(Jung Ah works without a word.)

2049
01:26:03,269 --> 01:26:06,109
(She washes off mud on the shells.)

2050
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:08,878
- How cool. - I know. It's fascinating.

2051
01:26:08,879 --> 01:26:10,148
(Jae Hwa and the younger members begin to pull up the oysters.)

2052
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:11,719
- We use the pulley. - I see.

2053
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:14,118
- Let's go. - Here it comes.

2054
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:15,718
(Their eyes are fixed.)

2055
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:17,618
(Gasping)

2056
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:19,959
(Screaming)

2057
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:22,028
(Cutting)

2058
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:23,627
(With one swing of the sickle, )

2059
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:25,238
(they subdue the oysters.)

2060
01:26:25,538 --> 01:26:27,267
(However, )

2061
01:26:27,268 --> 01:26:28,907
(there's no end to their work.)

2062
01:26:28,908 --> 01:26:30,307
(Pull!)

2063
01:26:30,308 --> 01:26:32,138
(I'm too scared to pull them up!)

2064
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:33,737
(It's too early to surrender to the oysters!)

2065
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:35,507
(Here are the oysters.)

2066
01:26:35,508 --> 01:26:37,278
(Until they become faint, )

2067
01:26:37,548 --> 01:26:39,318
(they shuck oysters!)

2068
01:26:39,518 --> 01:26:40,577
(Do we need to shuck everything in order to go home?)

2069
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:42,148
(A mountain of oysters)

2070
01:26:42,618 --> 01:26:43,987
(This man is busy even at home.)

2071
01:26:43,988 --> 01:26:45,818
(There isn't enough.)

2072
01:26:46,218 --> 01:26:48,358
(Sikhye Yum's number 1 student)

2073
01:26:48,588 --> 01:26:50,387
(He's serious about sikhye.)

2074
01:26:50,388 --> 01:26:52,998
(Teacher Yum is satisfied with the helpful assistant.)

2075
01:26:53,358 --> 01:26:54,567
(But one thing distracts her best student.)

2076
01:26:54,568 --> 01:26:55,667
(Gosh, you keep doing this!)

2077
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:57,698
(You distract me with music and make me dance!)

2078
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,097
(The DNA of good cheer gets awakened.)

2079
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:01,367
(Dance more.)

2080
01:27:01,368 --> 01:27:03,408
(Okay.)

2081
01:27:04,138 --> 01:27:05,437
(They open a live music cafe.)

2082
01:27:05,438 --> 01:27:07,078
(Backup dancers, Kim Jae Hwa and Park Jun Myun)

2083
01:27:07,778 --> 01:27:10,548
(The emperor of the nostril ballad, Yoon Kyung Ho)

2084
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,447
(I can tell that you're lip-syncing!)

2085
01:27:12,448 --> 01:27:14,418
(He can do live music as well.)

2086
01:27:14,948 --> 01:27:17,017
(The sentimental night...)

2087
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:18,717
(Moved)

2088
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:21,858
(of the Fresh off the Sea Retreat is coming soon.)
