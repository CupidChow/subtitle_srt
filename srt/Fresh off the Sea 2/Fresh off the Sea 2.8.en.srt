1
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,355
(The second work in Wando)

2
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:19,156
(Oysters)

3
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:20,596
(Groaning)

4
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,896
(It wasn't easy.)

5
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:25,136
(They fought against about 150kg of oysters.)

6
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:27,111
(The four siblings struggled.)

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,336
(Staggering)

8
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,876
(I'm too scared to pull them up!)

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,245
(For the four siblings who were exhausted,)

10
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:35,076
(the guests decided to step forward.)

11
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,546
(Guys, watch carefully.)

12
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,786
(The professional worker, Jae Hwa appeared.)

13
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:41,986
(Cutting)

14
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:43,956
(A dependable ally for the four siblings)

15
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:45,716
(Grinning)

16
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:47,326
- There you go. - Rinse it with water.

17
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:50,326
(The true seaman, Kyung Ho appeared.)

18
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:53,426
(A true seaman doesn't run from the 150-kg oyster bed.)

19
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:55,226
(Amazed)

20
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,095
(Thanks to the professional workers,)

21
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:58,365
(they got a mountain of oysters in 2 just hours.)

22
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,736
(They had to shuck the oysters they harvested.)

23
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,906
(Finding the opening is no joke.)

24
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,405
(The work was no joke,)

25
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,476
(but they got it done.)

26
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:11,416
(Kyung Ho was busy even in the house.)

27
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,946
(Leader Yum's number 1 student)

28
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:17,515
(Jung Ah and Kyung Ho made kabocha sikhye together!)

29
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:18,516
(Oh, my!)

30
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,856
(Mastering sikhye)

31
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:23,855
(Hold on. I know this melody.)

32
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,925
(I can't focus on work!)

33
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,265
(I can't do this.)

34
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,096
(I can't suppress the urge!)

35
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:32,196
(The professional workers partied like there was no tomorrow!)

36
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,136
(The two dancers brought good cheer to the Fresh House.)

37
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:37,076
(That's so funny.)

38
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:40,206
(Someone please stop him.)

39
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,506
(It was time for the four siblings to show them!)

40
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,476
(By the rule, it's 1 ttukbaegi per person.)

41
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,916
(Jung Ah's oyster rice soup with a lot of seaweed)

42
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,845
(The fish master fried...)

43
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:50,886
(the sweet and sour sea bream.)

44
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,686
(The Fresh members grilled oysters and abalones.)

45
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,186
(A meal for the precious guests who shook up the Fresh House)

46
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,055
(Those who worked hard,)

47
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,856
(enjoy the food.)

48
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,796
(It's so tasty!)

49
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,166
(This is Fresh off the Sea.)

50
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,096
(And don't forget!)

51
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,536
(The Fresh members are planning a surprise birthday party.)

52
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:11,105
(They purchased the pancake mix for the birthday party!)

53
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,106
(Where's Jung Ah?)

54
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:15,176
(Yes.)

55
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,016
(That was close.)

56
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,086
(Will they be successful with the surprise birthday party?)

57
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,116
(Around the time their stomachs become full,)

58
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,286
(Jung Ah is deep in thought.)

59
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,326
What will we do tomorrow?

60
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:28,886
Firstly,

61
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,295
- let's give people sikhye. - That's right.

62
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,025
- At the senior community center? - Yes. The elders.

63
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,125
(Distribute sikhye to the elders!)

64
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,226
What else should we do?

65
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:39,235
If it rains, we should eat a snack in here.

66
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:40,935
- Shall we make jeon? - We can take among ourselves.

67
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:42,666
- Let's make kimchi jeon. - That's a good idea.

68
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,575
Let's keep the door open and listen to the rain.

69
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,736
- That's a good idea. - Yes.

70
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,475
(Hold on.)

71
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,476
(If it rains)

72
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,916
(His eyes shift.)

73
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,016
We'll need to see what happens.

74
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:55,046
(For them to prepare a surprise birthday party,)

75
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,316
(Jun Myun needs to go out.)

76
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:57,916
(Glancing over)

77
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,626
(Trying to think of a plan)

78
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:04,025
Then someone should go to the mart.

79
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,366
- Why? - We'll need assorted seafood.

80
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,496
- That's right. The packet. - We need squid and such.

81
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,595
Let's just make it with kimchi.

82
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,295
- It'll still be tasty. - It won't be tasty.

83
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:13,606
Let's go to the mart together, Jun Myun.

84
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,505
Tell me about your life.

85
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,435
- Jun Myun should go. - You guys should go on a date.

86
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,675
- Why? - The three of us should go.

87
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,345
All right. I'll go and buy assorted seafood.

88
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,375
If it rains, I'll go and buy it.

89
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,875
- Buy other things too. - If it rains...

90
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,945
- Okay. - Jun Myun, buy us coffee too.

91
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,916
Okay. But why do I need to go?

92
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,055
Why did I get the task?

93
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,815
- You're busy managing. - That's right.

94
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,185
So you should go outside...

95
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:36,055
and enjoy a date with an unfamiliar man.

96
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:39,126
(The unfamiliar man with undeniable charms)

97
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:41,696
I don't really want to go on a date with Kyung Ho.

98
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,665
- I mean... - It's pretty different...

99
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,035
- from when Jung Jae visited. - Jung Ah.

100
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,066
It's very different.

101
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:49,035
Kyung Ho, don't watch the show.

102
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:52,606
(Laughing)

103
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:56,616
Jung Ah, let's play a game to pick who'll do the dishes.

104
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:58,175
Okay. Let's do that.

105
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,346
Let's play a game.

106
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:02,015
Let's see who sends it the furthest.

107
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:03,215
- Like alkkagi? - Yes.

108
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:04,255
- Let's try it. - Okay.

109
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,915
It isn't like that. No matter what...

110
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,425
- She'll take responsibility. - To make the game fun...

111
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:09,525
(The most number of dishes...)

112
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,955
(in the history of the show)

113
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,055
(The dishwashing purgatory)

114
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,325
It won't be easy.

115
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,826
There are so many dirty dishes.

116
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,036
(Who will be...)

117
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,866
(the one to fall...)

118
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:23,006
(into the dishwashing purgatory?)

119
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,176
Let's write our names so that we don't get confused.

120
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:26,645
Let's write our last names.

121
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,246
(Rules of the game)

122
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,016
It went over the line.

123
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,616
The cap can be on the starting line.

124
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:35,416
The one who sends it the furthest will be exempt.

125
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:36,956
(If your cap falls off, you'll go to the very bottom!)

126
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,455
What if multiple people make their caps fall off?

127
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,356
- Then they'll have a round. - A new round?

128
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,056
- No helping with the dishes. - That's right.

129
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,795
- We really don't help. - Also,

130
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:48,165
you can't start 30 minutes later.

131
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,835
As soon as you lose, you need to get up...

132
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:50,836
and do the dishes.

133
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:52,595
- Don't say anything. - Don't say anything.

134
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,036
Gosh, I'm nervous.

135
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:55,306
All done.

136
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,175
- I can't stand it. - Play or lose,

137
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:58,236
- rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

138
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,305
(Kyung Ho and Ji Yeon win!)

139
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,806
It's between us now.

140
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,975
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

141
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,145
(Rock versus scissors)

142
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,045
(Kyung Ho wins!)

143
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,085
- Now, - Will you go last?

144
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:09,815
- I'll go last. - Decide on the order.

145
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:11,815
(Jae Wook, Jae Hwa, Ji Yeon,)

146
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,786
(Jung Ah, Jun Myun, Kyung Ho)

147
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,886
Number one.

148
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,056
Get your cap.

149
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,495
Good luck.

150
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:20,525
(Jae Wook gives it a go!)

151
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:21,595
(The first player is nervous.)

152
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,396
It's annoying to watch him warm up his fingers.

153
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:24,896
(Whatever!)

154
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,336
(He puts his hope into his fingertips.)

155
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,706
(I did well.)

156
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,976
(He got his cap in a royal seat from the very beginning!)

157
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,846
It should've fallen off.

158
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,015
Someone can hit that cap...

159
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,886
and make it fall off.

160
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,786
(My cap, please hang in there!)

161
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,015
(The second player with charismatic eyes,)

162
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:47,986
(Jae Hwa goes next!)

163
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,455
(Hyena Jae Hwa is out to get Jae Wook.)

164
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:53,225
It went over the line.

165
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,365
- It shouldn't go over the line. - Right.

166
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,665
(The starting line is very important.)

167
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,836
(Hyena Jae Hwa is back on.)

168
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:00,436
(I can't watch this.)

169
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:03,336
(Jae Hwa, there's determination in your eyes.)

170
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:05,676
(Here comes Hyena Jae Hwa's cap!)

171
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:08,875
It's okay.

172
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,616
(Gosh, Jae Hwa)

173
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,886
It's okay. Well done.

174
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,485
- It's okay for now. - At this rate...

175
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,055
- It didn't fall off. - I relaxed my fingers...

176
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,485
since I flicked too hard earlier.

177
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:22,286
(A relieved bow)

178
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,826
What should I do? I'm so nervous.

179
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,296
(Why is she so nervous about flicking a cap?)

180
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,436
Oh, no. I really don't want to do it.

181
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,165
(Me neither.)

182
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,005
(Jae Hwa, Jae Wook)

183
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,606
(She did pretty well.)

184
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,906
Not bad.

185
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,206
So far, Jae Hwa is in last place.

186
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:43,316
(The 4th player sits down without hesitation.)

187
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,146
(Checking the target)

188
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,286
(Landing)

189
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,185
(It's in the safe zone.)

190
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,186
- What am I going to do? - You know...

191
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:55,925
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

192
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:57,755
(Jun Myun goes next!)

193
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:58,996
(Gulping)

194
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,095
(Yesterday, she experienced the dishwashing purgatory.)

195
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,995
(I can't do it again!)

196
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:07,035
(Aiming)

197
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,236
Jun Myun, you went over the line a bit.

198
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:10,635
(He makes sure everyone's on the starting line.)

199
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,476
- You're good now. - Jun Myun, flick a bit hard.

200
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,746
(It's highly likely that Jae Hwa will place last.)

201
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:15,905
You went over the line a bit.

202
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,816
(Jun Myun's guard is down!)

203
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,445
- You're good now. - Jun Myun, flick a bit hard.

204
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:21,515
(A good whisper?)

205
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:23,786
(An evil whisper?)

206
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,515
My fingers are weak right now.

207
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:26,586
(What will become of Jun Myun?)

208
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,025
(A strong shot!)

209
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,055
(Crying)

210
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,095
(Jun Myun, Jae Hwa)

211
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,126
(Falling off)

212
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,236
(Happy)

213
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,996
(Sad)

214
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,236
Jun Myun's cap fell off.

215
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,865
- It felt off. - Jae Hwa's cap fell off.

216
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:45,306
- No, Jun Myun's cap fell off. - No, Jun Myun's cap fell off.

217
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,476
Really?

218
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,746
Two days in a row?

219
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,476
- I see. - Oh, no!

220
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,315
Jun Myun, I guess it's in your fate to do the dishes.

221
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:53,286
I can't believe it. What kind of fate is that?

222
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,815
- What should I do? - You know,

223
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,616
I'm honestly sorry.

224
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,356
I'll appear cheap to do it halfheartedly.

225
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:02,655
I'm nervous.

226
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,756
(Make a careless shot, Kyung Ho.)

227
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,726
(Jun Myun's fate depends on the last cap.)

228
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,166
(Will she do the dishes for two days in a row?)

229
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,896
(Will his cap fall off and save Jun Myun?)

230
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:14,965
I'm nervous.

231
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:17,635
(Jae Wook, Jun Myun, Jung Ah, Ji Yeon, Jae Hwa)

232
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:18,806
I'll do it.

233
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,676
(Not cheap)

234
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,075
- Thank you for your hard work. - I'll do it.

235
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,346
- Yes. I'll do it. - Oh, no.

236
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,216
(It's okay.)

237
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,485
Oh, no. She became it two days in a row.

238
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,986
- Jun Myun is bad at games. - That's right.

239
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:32,886
Jun Myun.

240
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:37,096
(They feel bad for some reason.)

241
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,355
Forget it.

242
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,126
(With familiarity, she enters the dishwashing purgatory.)

243
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:43,595
- Jun Myun, wear the gloves. - All right. Okay.

244
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:44,796
- Wear an apron too. - That's right.

245
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:50,306
(She accepts the result and begins to do the dishes.)

246
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,706
(Jae Wook comes wearing gloves.)

247
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,246
I'll organize them.

248
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:58,516
(He stealthily approaches Jun Myun and helps her.)

249
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,885
(Everyone joins forces...)

250
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:07,286
(to help Jun Myun at the Fresh House.)

251
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:15,526
(The big pile of dirty dishes...)

252
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,295
(gets cleaned up.)

253
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,396
I'm done with this.

254
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,506
All done.

255
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:22,406
Thank you for your hard work.

256
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,205
- It's okay. - Well done.

257
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,705
My goodness.

258
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:26,945
- Jung Ah. - Be better at games.

259
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,005
- It's okay. - I'll give you a massage...

260
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,445
for the frozen shoulders.

261
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:33,516
(The night deepens in Wando.)

262
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:37,716
(Jung Ah begins the final process for the kabocha sikhye.)

263
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,915
(Checking the rice cooker)

264
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,485
When did we begin?

265
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,555
- It was 7:05pm. - It was 7:05pm, right?

266
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:44,596
(The floating rice means that the fermentation is done!)

267
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:48,526
(Boil the fermented sikhye over low heat and skim off foam.)

268
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,665
(Thinking of the elders in the neighborhood,)

269
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,396
(she makes sikhye with care.)

270
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:53,765
Here.

271
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,065
(Once the sikhye bubbles,)

272
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,135
- Here. - Be careful.

273
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:59,135
(the rich kabocha puree gets added.)

274
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:00,806
It'll be so rich.

275
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,406
Good.

276
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,715
(My goodness)

277
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,515
- It'll be so rich. - It's totally undiluted.

278
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,046
(It's totally undiluted.)

279
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:09,246
Do you take the pot off the heat?

280
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:11,615
It began to boil, right?

281
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:14,055
I'll take the pot off the heat after about a minute.

282
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,255
(Much effort and time go into the kabocha sikhye.)

283
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,126
After that, it'll be set aside.

284
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:23,366
(The boiled kabocha sikhye gets cooled down outside.)

285
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:27,006
(Jae Wook covers it with a towel so that rainwater doesn't go in.)

286
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,336
(Once they're done with the kabocha sikhye)

287
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,475
Shall we have a glass of beer?

288
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,645
- That's a good idea. - Let's spread it out.

289
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,706
It'll be nice to do that.

290
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,116
I'll add rice cake.

291
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,846
(They plan to make tteokbokki.)

292
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:46,716
(Taking after Jung Ah, she adds a lot of rice cake!)

293
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:50,196
(They prepared cabbage ahead of time.)

294
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,825
(A heap of cabbage)

295
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:53,996
All right.

296
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,695
(A heap of fish cake)

297
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,965
That's right.

298
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,795
(A heap of fish cake)

299
00:10:58,796 --> 00:11:01,305
Ji Yeon sent me a photo of the tteokbokki she made.

300
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,136
It looked like...

301
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:06,035
- she could sell it. - Really?

302
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:08,376
(I'll hurry up and make tasty tteokbokki.)

303
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:11,445
(Cheongyang pepper powder, soy sauce, pepper, minced garlic)

304
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,546
(She adds condiments without hesitation.)

305
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,616
(She adds all the sausages.)

306
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,986
(Pouring in the sausages)

307
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:23,956
(It already looks amazing.)

308
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:28,096
(Then she boils it down.)

309
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,536
The color is no joke.

310
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,065
(Jae Wook tastes it.)

311
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,605
(Nervous)

312
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,235
(The taste is electrifying.)

313
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,106
(The spicy and piquant taste hit his taste buds.)

314
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,576
(You can't beat the red flavor in the middle of the night.)

315
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:43,916
(People rush over to check out Ji Yeon's cooking skills.)

316
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:45,646
You added a generous amount of the ingredients.

317
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:47,916
(A generous-looking dish)

318
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,016
(Would you like some red flavor?)

319
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,856
(Then she adds sweetness.)

320
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,185
(Ji Yeon's red-flavor tteokbokki stimulates the appetite.)

321
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:57,626
It smells delicious already.

322
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,025
(Holding tight)

323
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,166
I made a simple dish.

324
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:06,535
When else will I enjoy such a time with you guys?

325
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,265
Doing the dishes...

326
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,465
Is tteokbokki in the frame?

327
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:10,675
Yes, it's in the frame.

328
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:11,835
Good.

329
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,006
All right.

330
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,145
- Thank you for your hard work. - Don't mention it.

331
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,276
- We'll enjoy it. - Okay.

332
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,445
The thing is, my son...

333
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,015
(Chef Ji Yeon tries the dish.)

334
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,355
- Really? - It's like that.

335
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:26,255
- We... - How about tomorrow?

336
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,325
(I think it's okay.)

337
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:29,856
Weak. It's weak.

338
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,056
Jae Wook said he wouldn't be able to open his eyes tomorrow.

339
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,395
- You know, - That's how tasty it is.

340
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:35,725
bloating...

341
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:36,895
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

342
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:40,095
(I don't care about bloating.)

343
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,206
Ji Yeon will become good at cooking soon.

344
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,575
- It's just that she doesn't cook. - Right.

345
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:47,845
(It's a bit spicy for Jae Wook.)

346
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:48,846
It's so tasty.

347
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,275
- It's mine. - What?

348
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,076
(This is so good.)

349
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,186
(What does Chef Yum think?)

350
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,655
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

351
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:01,356
(She tries the rice cake as well.)

352
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,226
Ji Yeon will become good at cooking soon.

353
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,596
- It's just that she doesn't cook. - Right.

354
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,995
(Chef Yum announced that Ji Yeon would make progress.)

355
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,996
It's so tasty.

356
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,166
It's like the tteokbokki you pay money for.

357
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,806
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

358
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,406
It's my favorite level of spiciness.

359
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:20,036
It tastes like it contains more ingredients, not just cabbage.

360
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,576
I love cabbage.

361
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:23,815
- It goes well with tteokbokki. - It's the best combination.

362
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,316
(It's tastier because it contains a heap of cabbage.)

363
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:27,186
I keep eating more. I'm in trouble.

364
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,986
- My eyes will be shut tomorrow. - It'll be the same for everyone.

365
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,416
May I wear sunglasses?

366
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,986
It'll be funny if all of us wear sunglasses.

367
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,356
That's a good idea.

368
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:39,155
- Sunglasses. - "Let's see..."

369
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,996
"why they're wearing sunglasses."

370
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,596
- Incredible. - It's spicy, right?

371
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,996
- You're sweating. - Do you need tissue paper?

372
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,335
- I want to keep eating. - Yes.

373
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,605
- It's tasty. - Give it to him.

374
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,706
Seriously.

375
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,375
Did you add starch syrup at the end?

376
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:54,705
(Where are the wet wipes?)

377
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,105
- Starch syrup? - The last ingredient.

378
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,515
- I added a bit of allulose syrup. - Hold on.

379
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,846
Who put pancake mix in here?

380
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:05,615
(They were preparing for the surprise birthday party.)

381
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:06,815
(Hurry up and hide it.)

382
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:07,855
(They bought pancake mix without letting Jun Myun know.)

383
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,696
(They hid it hurriedly in the drawers.)

384
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:14,165
(They didn't expect Jun Myun to find it.)

385
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,796
I don't know. It was there.

386
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:17,595
(Let's see.)

387
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,165
We bought pancake mix earlier.

388
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,265
Why did we buy it?

389
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,306
(The surprise birthday party faces the 2nd crisis.)

390
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,236
(Everyone becomes startled.)

391
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:25,676
Did you buy pancake mix?

392
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,706
(They scratch their heads when they lie.)

393
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:30,006
Kyung Ho, did you buy it to eat pancakes for breakfast?

394
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,176
(Kyung Ho, you should take the fall for it.)

395
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,485
(I see what I need to do.)

396
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:36,515
I wanted to eat it with coffee in the morning.

397
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:38,286
Will you make pancakes tomorrow?

398
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,686
- Yes. - Okay.

399
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,186
- Then... - Will you really make it?

400
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,226
It must be because I talked about the sweets.

401
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,756
Why did you hide it? You could've just told me.

402
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:47,825
I didn't hide it.

403
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,266
I hid it.

404
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,435
Kyung Ho and I had a quarrel...

405
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,806
because he wanted to eat it.

406
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:56,706
At our age, cooking matters.

407
00:14:57,336 --> 00:15:00,476
We should be cautious with sugar and carbohydrates.

408
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,946
But you're saying that while eating tteokboki.

409
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,745
(Will the surprise birthday party be a success?)

410
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:07,216
I did say it while eating tteokboki.

411
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:10,286
- I got it. - Let's listen to So Ra's song.

412
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,855
(Impromptu voice imitation)

413
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,355
(Fresh Vinyl Bar is back.)

414
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:16,386
Okay, let's get into some music.

415
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,695
- So, this is Lee So Ra's... - What is it?

416
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,666
- This is something you might like. - This?

417
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,396
- How is it? - Yesterday.

418
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,196
(Yesterday)

419
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,776
(Kyung So Ra's powerful singing)

420
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:32,375
(When I look away)

421
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,206
(VIP seat from the living room)

422
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:37,516
(Please forget me)

423
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,246
Your lip-syncing is way too obvious.

424
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,446
I am singing for real.

425
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,526
(Singing live to melt the cold audience)

426
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,055
(Pleading with a heartfelt live performance)

427
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,956
(Adjusting the mic volume)

428
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:54,865
(Today)

429
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,995
- Look at him. - Use your nostrils.

430
00:15:56,996 --> 00:16:00,196
(Channeling all souls through the nostrils)

431
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:01,465
(Me?)

432
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,606
(This is why you should not leave for the bathroom mid-performance.)

433
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:05,405
(Why are you so late?)

434
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,176
(Overflowing with emotion)

435
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:09,205
(What were the lyrics again?)

436
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,206
He doesn't know the lyrics.

437
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,515
(What matters is an unshakable performance.)

438
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,546
He needs to cover his mouth.

439
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,486
(The audience is fully satisfied.)

440
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:20,485
(A flawless finale that captivates the entire audience)

441
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:21,786
This is so good.

442
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,596
- Everybody! - One, two, three...

443
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:27,526
("The Blue in You" by Lee So Ra)

444
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:31,036
(The final-day energy of a college retreat)

445
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,305
(Getting lost in the moment)

446
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,306
(Jae Wook's camera)

447
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:40,376
(The hidden harmony of the Fresh members)

448
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:43,676
(This needs to be filmed.)

449
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:52,416
(Perfect duet)

450
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:59,526
(The Fresh members' night ripens with a chorus of voices.)

451
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,826
(Blowing)

452
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:01,895
(Impromptu talent show)

453
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,365
What a dramatic finish.

454
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,896
(Closing with Kyung Ho's playful charm)

455
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,865
- This is so good. - I love it.

456
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,805
- This group singing is everything. - It's just so good.

457
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,945
- I love it. - You're all so full of energy.

458
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:16,506
You eat that much and work so hard.

459
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:20,446
If I don't release the energy, I feel restless at night.

460
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,185
- It's all part of the process. - Yes, I am just digesting it.

461
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:23,385
(The group singing was the real digestif.)

462
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,056
- Okay, cheers. - Let's toast.

463
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:26,856
(Clinking glasses)

464
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:28,656
Let's drink.

465
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:33,456
(After that burst of energy...)

466
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,295
Jae Hwa.

467
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:39,335
(Is this a blood sugar spike?)

468
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,336
Sleep on a mat.

469
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:43,266
- It's time to wrap things up. - Hey, off to bed you go.

470
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:44,806
I was so happy.

471
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,745
- I had a great time. - I'm really sad it's over.

472
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:49,745
- I know. - I want to talk all night long.

473
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,216
I wish we could stay together a bit more.

474
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,776
We have plans tomorrow, though.

475
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:54,616
Good night.

476
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,086
- Good night. - Bye.

477
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,785
- Sleep well. - See you in the morning.

478
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,416
(A special night in Wando is growing deeper with togetherness.)

479
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,155
(The lively night has come to an end.)

480
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,796
(The morning quietly arrives.)

481
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:12,636
(A gentle rain is falling over Yeongpung Village.)

482
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,376
(On the wet soil, someone is already busy greeting spring.)

483
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:22,946
(And someone else begins the day just like any other.)

484
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:27,176
(What will the Fresh members' day look like?)

485
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,215
Is this coffee?

486
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,416
Yes, do you want some?

487
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:35,825
It might be strong. I put in two.

488
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:36,856
I put two in mine as well.

489
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,056
What should we do?

490
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,126
Jun Myun's birthday cake.

491
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:45,266
(Jun Myun's birthday party planning meeting)

492
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,766
She's like a detective.

493
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,106
But why did she go through all of that?

494
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:53,675
Why did she open that?

495
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,876
(The Jun Myun pancake mix incident)

496
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,515
I totally panicked. That scared me so much.

497
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,716
(Still burning with anxiety)

498
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:04,756
Jun Myun seemed like she was half-awake.

499
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,556
She might start suspecting us.

500
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:12,355
(Being careful)

501
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:13,596
(A loud thump)

502
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:16,566
(I hope Jun Myun is still sleeping.)

503
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,066
(Peeking out)

504
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:21,695
(Peeking out)

505
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:28,265
(She is peacefully sleeping.)

506
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:31,275
(Feeling relieved)

507
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,505
But...

508
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,675
Honestly, the table setting will look so plain.

509
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,215
I want to set things up better if she's out for a while.

510
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:43,115
(Hoping to set a proper birthday meal for Jun Myun)

511
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:46,054
(We got caught with the pancake mix, too.)

512
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:47,355
Should I go get a cake?

513
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,055
Sure. I'll stay here making seaweed soup.

514
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,195
I'll go get the cake with Jae Wook.

515
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,905
(Sneaking out to get a cake for Jun Myun)

516
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:04,235
(Checking on the target's movements)

517
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,345
(The target is asleep without a clue.)

518
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:10,945
What do we do?

519
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,315
How should we plan this?

520
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:19,685
(Will the birthday mission for Jun Myun succeed?)

521
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,655
- I'll go wash up first. - Okay.

522
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,895
(The two wrap up their secret mission talk.)

523
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,765
(Waking up)

524
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:32,465
(The star of the day wakes up.)

525
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,765
(Jung Ah has finished preparing first.)

526
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,375
Jae Hwa. Wake up.

527
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,545
Where is this place?

528
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,045
(Groaning)

529
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,915
(Waking up Jae Hwa with some stretches)

530
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:50,085
(Tidying up the bedding)

531
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,015
(Doing the dishes)

532
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:56,025
(Taking out the recycling)

533
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,894
(Another busy morning for Leader Yum)

534
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,065
What should I do with them? Should I go wake them up?

535
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,765
(Looking sleepy)

536
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,345
(Jae Wook wakes up.)

537
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:18,245
(Is it time to get up?)

538
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,414
(Opening the door first after waking up)

539
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,285
- Are you up? - Yes?

540
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,385
Are you up?

541
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,584
Did you sleep well?

542
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,125
(Everyone is up.)

543
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,295
Did you write the poem?

544
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:37,194
- No. What should I do? - What?

545
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,164
What now? Did you write yours?

546
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,565
I didn't write one either. I have to write it now.

547
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,705
So you are thinking about that poem right now.

548
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,504
I'll think about it, too.

549
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,335
(An urgent problem has come up right from the start of the day.)

550
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,775
- I'm not even good at writing. - Me neither.

551
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,545
(Focusing intently on Jun Myun's birthday poem)

552
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,585
(Sliding into view)

553
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:57,785
I came to wake you up.

554
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,654
I was just waking up.

555
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,585
- I don't know how to write a poem. - I was writing one.

556
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,825
(Pouring out the struggles of creation)

557
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:05,895
Wait a moment.

558
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,925
(Checking outside cautiously)

559
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,294
(Carefully closing the door)

560
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,965
Ji Yeon and I got up early this morning to plan things out.

561
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,634
(Captain Yum's briefing for Jun Myun's birthday operation)

562
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,034
Okay, Jae Wook. You go out with Ji Yeon.

563
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,675
Because we got caught with the pancake mix yesterday,

564
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,405
it feels pointless to make it now.

565
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:24,944
- Just go buy a cake. - Okay.

566
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:28,445
Go to the bakery and get the cake.

567
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:32,285
In the meantime, I'll take Jun Myun out with Jae Hwa,

568
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,824
pretending it's a date.

569
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,924
- Jae Hwa is... - If any of us are left,

570
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,525
- then take her out at that time. - There'll be some time left, right?

571
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,425
How about being out for about 30 minutes?

572
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,265
That's plenty of time. I can quickly make the seaweed soup.

573
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,594
If it goes over an hour, she might get suspicious.

574
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,835
(Let's carry out the mission perfectly.)

575
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,135
(Jung Ah returns to the main house.)

576
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,975
(Good luck, everyone.)

577
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,944
Jun Myun, I want to put this here.

578
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,275
Could you help me with it?

579
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,614
I need to pour the sikhye into the bottle.

580
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,585
It's too heavy for me to do alone.

581
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,885
Let me help you with that.

582
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,324
Here, catch.

583
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:10,854
Put it over there.

584
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,354
- Don't use your back. - The bottles.

585
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:14,265
(Jae Hwa lifts it up with ease.)

586
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,495
(Squatting while holding the heavy pot)

587
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,235
(Squatting properly while setting it down)

588
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:24,274
(After lining up the lids)

589
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:25,574
(Gripping the handle)

590
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:27,745
(This is a flawless squat posture.)

591
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,804
I got the power

592
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:30,805
(Thanks to Jae Hwa, the squat master,)

593
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:34,385
(the kabocha sikhye packing is all set.)

594
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:36,485
Jun Myun, take a look at this color.

595
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,415
- Gosh. - It's amazing, right?

596
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,654
There's a ton of kabocha in here.

597
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,655
- Can I try some? - Yes, I'll give you some.

598
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,994
(Tasting the sikhye before packing)

599
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,965
- Put this in the freezer. - Oh, my.

600
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,424
It tastes great. It's so delicious.

601
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,925
- It's full of flavor, right? - Yes.

602
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:54,305
(It's packed with kabocha for a deep, rich flavor.)

603
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,235
(In that case,)

604
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,235
(I want some too.)

605
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,575
(He walks over to Jung Ah with his cup.)

606
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,575
(Drinking)

607
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,145
(That post-shower sikhye goes down so smooth.)

608
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,585
(Gosh)

609
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:11,984
It's still good warm.

610
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,514
- What? - It's still good warm.

611
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:14,955
(Is it?)

612
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,784
Watch your hand.

613
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:19,024
(Ji Yeon rushes over after hearing about the sikhye tasting.)

614
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,325
- Gosh, I love the smell of kabocha. - Yes, the warmth...

615
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,095
(She takes in the aroma first before taking a sip.)

616
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:27,395
- It's so good. - Right?

617
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,365
It's not even cold, but it's still so good.

618
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,375
(Yum's sikhye will taste even better when it's cold.)

619
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,035
Gosh, I love the clean taste.

620
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,605
(Ji Yeon loves the deep and clean flavor of the sikhye.)

621
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,945
(The sikhye apprentice also drinks the sikhye he helped Jung Ah make.)

622
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,385
(Nodding in appreciation)

623
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,645
(What do you think?)

624
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,915
(He's speechless.)

625
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,985
Kyung Ho, did you sleep well?

626
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:52,125
(My face isn't even puffy.)

627
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,994
(He's so funny.)

628
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,495
I love your hat, Jun Myun.

629
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:58,995
I'm wearing it for you.

630
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,665
For you.

631
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,435
(Kyung Ho feels shy.)

632
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,175
My Jun Myun...

633
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:08,675
has fallen for Kyung Ho.

634
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:12,745
(He is indeed an irresistible man.)

635
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,845
(Yum's sikhye with its golden glow...)

636
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:20,285
(is stirred thoroughly and divided into single bottles.)

637
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:23,525
(Made with care)

638
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,425
- They will love these. - This is...

639
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,295
The sikhye is beautiful.

640
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:32,735
Let's leave these outside to cool down.

641
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:38,035
(Plop)

642
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,335
(The sikhye bottles are put in cold water to cool down.)

643
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:45,345
(Yum's sikhye is ready to be given out to the local elderly!)

644
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,215
Gosh, it's raining.

645
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,545
Jun Myun, it's raining.

646
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,155
It is.

647
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:58,825
(A light drizzle falls over Wando this morning.)

648
00:25:59,055 --> 00:26:00,895
Let's eat spicy kalguksu.

649
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,565
Spicy kalguksu?

650
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,835
(Let's make spicy kalguksu, a dish perfect for this rainy day.)

651
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,734
(Today's breakfast is spicy kalguksu!)

652
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,374
(Really?)

653
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,635
(That sounds amazing.)

654
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:17,875
(Jung Ah fills the pot with water.)

655
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:20,945
Let's try using this today.

656
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,745
Throw in some large-eyed herring.

657
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:26,255
(And add in a few broth packs for a deeply flavorful broth.)

658
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,225
(They will boil the broth over high heat.)

659
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,025
Now, it's time to prepare the ingredients.

660
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:37,295
(Jung Ah is about to prep the carrots first.)

661
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:40,135
(Glancing around)

662
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,064
Has anyone seen the vegetable peeler?

663
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,175
- The vegetable peeler? - Not now.

664
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:46,634
(Whispering)

665
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:50,205
I haven't seen the vegetable peeler anywhere since yesterday.

666
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:51,915
Go after breakfast.

667
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,114
(They suddenly stop talking.)

668
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:55,645
Give me a second. The vegetable peeler...

669
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,185
I found it!

670
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:59,054
(Pretending nothing happened)

671
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,084
All right.

672
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,485
How many potatoes are you using?

673
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:02,885
I'm going to use all four.

674
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,995
Yes, the more potatoes the better.

675
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:06,855
- Of course. - And zucchini.

676
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,764
- I'll peel all of these right now. - Okay.

677
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:09,824
Four potatoes.

678
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,294
Wash these two zucchinis for me. And this onion.

679
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:13,965
(They start prepping the vegetables that the birthday girl likes.)

680
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,265
What do you need me to do?

681
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,134
- What can I help with? - Nothing. I got this.

682
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,335
- Really? - Yes.

683
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,205
What should I do, then?

684
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:23,645
What should I do?

685
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,275
Nothing?

686
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,645
Nothing?

687
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,484
(Walking out of the kitchen)

688
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,785
(Kyung Ho isn't needed for anything.)

689
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:33,015
(Glancing around)

690
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,684
Why are they making me do this? I'm trying to do it,

691
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,024
but I can't even think of what to write.

692
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,925
(I can't even think of what to write.)

693
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:40,554
You can't do this alone.

694
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:44,595
(He's writing a birthday poem in the room behind Jun Myun's back.)

695
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:47,864
(Meanwhile, Jun Myun and Jung Ah are sitting side by side...)

696
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,605
(while cutting the ingredients.)

697
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,135
(Chef Yum is in charge of making the spicy kalguksu.)

698
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:53,534
- You're putting in carrots too? - Yes.

699
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:55,874
(She's chopping carrots, potatoes,)

700
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,345
(and onions.)

701
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,815
(Next to her, Seasoning Park...)

702
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:04,415
(is cutting the bottom of a spring cabbage.)

703
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:06,584
(Seasoning Park's tip: If you make a square cut...)

704
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,855
(pull out the core, the leaves separate easily.)

705
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,384
Are you going to make spring cabbage pancake?

706
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,555
No, a side dish...

707
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,095
- to eat with the kalguksu. - Fresh kimchi?

708
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:18,995
(While she cuts up the leaves into bite-sized pieces,)

709
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,165
(the broth is slowly coming together.)

710
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,235
I think it will start boiling in about two minutes.

711
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:28,305
(Let's see.)

712
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:30,575
- This is... Jung Ah. - Yes?

713
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:33,015
- The abalone. Jae Wook. - Yes.

714
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:36,685
(They grilled abalones for dinner last night.)

715
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:40,415
(They didn't finish all of them because there was so much food.)

716
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:43,324
(Let's keep them.)

717
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:45,194
- Should we put them in the fridge? - Yes.

718
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:47,594
If it rains tomorrow, we have to stay indoors and make food all day.

719
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:51,265
(That's how the abalones ended up back inside the fridge.)

720
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,135
Jae Wook, I need you to do something.

721
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:57,464
It's leftover abalones.

722
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,035
(You have to make a side dish using the leftover abalones.)

723
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:00,674
Make whatever you want. Make it tasty.

724
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:01,675
(Do whatever you want, Jae Wook.)

725
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:04,075
We have too many eggs left too.

726
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,875
I'm craving eggs.

727
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:09,784
Should I make a rolled omelet?

728
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:10,815
That sounds great.

729
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,914
Let's make a rolled omelet.

730
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:14,925
(Today, Ji Yeon is in charge of making the side dishes.)

731
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,785
Can you make a rolled omelet with abalones?

732
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,154
You're in charge of the abalones.

733
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:20,655
Stop trying to make me use up the abalones.

734
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,394
What?

735
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,365
(The side-dish makers are trying to intimidate each other.)

736
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,795
- We have too many eggs... - Jae Hwa and...

737
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:29,065
- Where's Yoon Kyung Ho? - Where did they go?

738
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:32,505
Yoon Kyung Ho and Kim Jae Hwa. What are you up to?

739
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,401
Yoon Kyung Ho and Kim Jae Hwa. What are you up to?

740
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:39,323
What?

741
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:40,793
I was just...

742
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,632
You should be out here...

743
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:46,133
working instead of lounging around.

744
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:50,273
I thought I wasn't needed for anything.

745
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:52,743
- You didn't call... - Where's Kim Jae Hwa?

746
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:54,872
Just a second.

747
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,113
(Jae Hwa rushes out of the room.)

748
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,782
- There are noodles in the fridge. - Yes.

749
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:00,112
Get rid of the excess flour for me.

750
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,113
Okay.

751
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,682
There are quite a lot of noodles. Are we using all of these?

752
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,122
- Yes. - All of these?

753
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:06,482
- Yes. - Jae Hwa.

754
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,222
- What? - Just do as you're told.

755
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,322
All right.

756
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:10,493
(A word from a true friend)

757
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:14,663
Gosh. This is going to be so good.

758
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:19,463
(While Jae Hwa gets the excess flour off the noddles,)

759
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:22,503
(Jung Ah takes out the broth packs from the pot.)

760
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:24,973
(She then begins adding sauces to the broth.)

761
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:28,342
(Gochujang)

762
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:30,372
(Doenjang)

763
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,483
(Potatoes and carrots)

764
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,783
Gosh, it smells spicy.

765
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:38,183
- It's perfect for this weather. - Yes.

766
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:41,023
(Some anchovy fish sauce to bring out the savory taste)

767
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:44,493
(A generous shake of pepper for a spicy kick)

768
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,193
When do you think we'll be able to set the table?

769
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:50,462
I want to add the noodles right on time.

770
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:52,503
(The noodles don't take long to cook.)

771
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:55,632
- Are you busy? Can you... - No, I'm not.

772
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,503
- I'm making a rolled omelet. - I see.

773
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,172
(I'm trying to finely chop the vegetables.)

774
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,803
(Chopping)

775
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:02,713
How should I chop them?

776
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:06,983
- Chop them? - Yes.

777
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,513
I wouldn't say chop.

778
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:12,323
- More like mince. - Yes, mince.

779
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,153
How do I mince?

780
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,752
Just keep cutting them into pieces.

781
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:18,323
Just keep chopping?

782
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:22,163
(The first step to mincing: Shredding)

783
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:26,603
(He skillfully turns the flat side against the cutting board.)

784
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,033
(Peeking over)

785
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,972
I see, like this.

786
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,173
Yes. Watch your hand, though.

787
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,413
(She thinly slices the carrot into pieces of even thickness.)

788
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:40,743
(She puts one into her mouth...)

789
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,082
(and then starts shredding.)

790
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,553
You're good at this.

791
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,323
Good. Now give them to me.

792
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:48,792
I'll do that part.

793
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:49,793
(Mincing...)

794
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:51,823
(is my specialty.)

795
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,622
(He's cutting with the precision...)

796
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,793
(of a former university hospital professor.)

797
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,732
Ji Yeon, I'll put the pieces in one bowl.

798
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,903
- Okay. - Yes.

799
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,803
(In the meantime, Ji Yeon is cracking eggs into a bowl.)

800
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,402
(As many eggs as Ji Yeon wants)

801
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:07,673
Ten eggs!

802
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:12,013
(She whisks the eggs until well mixed.)

803
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:14,343
About this much.

804
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:15,953
Salt and pepper.

805
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,412
And if there's any kind of fish sauce...

806
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,623
- Tuna fish sauce. - All right.

807
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,323
And a little bit of salted shrimp.

808
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:26,023
You're good at this.

809
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,593
- Thank you, Kyung Ho. - No problem.

810
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,032
I'm looking forward to the rolled omelet.

811
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,633
(Ji Yeon's rolled omelet is going smoothly with Kyung Ho's help.)

812
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:35,903
(Inhaling deeply)
(Sighing)

813
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,243
(In contrast, the youngest member feels overwhelmed with his task.)

814
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:43,212
(He's just tapping at the cutting board.)

815
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,883
The abalones smell like...

816
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,113
salmon. Smoked salmon.

817
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:52,483
- They do. - What should I do with them?

818
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:54,623
Right?

819
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:57,422
The abalones smell like smoked salmon.

820
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,492
(The abalones still carry the smoky aroma...)

821
00:32:58,493 --> 00:32:59,563
(from yesterday's charcoal grill.)

822
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,663
I'm worried that this smell will still linger.

823
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:03,462
- When you... - Even when I cook with them.

824
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:04,563
(Thinking)

825
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:07,663
What if we add these to the fresh kimchi?

826
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,503
Kind of like a salmon salad.

827
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,232
Add what? The abalones?

828
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,573
(Smoked abalone spring cabbage salad?)

829
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:15,112
- In the spring cabbage kimchi. - I don't think...

830
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:17,113
(No.)

831
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,013
Jae Wook, what if you use these?

832
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:21,582
- Strawberries? - Yes.

833
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,853
How can I cook abalones and strawberries together?

834
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,183
Goodness.

835
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:27,853
It's not like I'm...

836
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,323
She thinks he's a cast of "Culinary Class Wars."

837
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,223
He just happens to be wearing black today.

838
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:36,292
I feel like Jae Wook would do a great job.

839
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:38,363
(The abalone-spoon chef, Jae Wook, is consumed by anxiety.)

840
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:43,132
(He still takes on the challenge.)

841
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,433
I'll try my best.

842
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:49,843
(First, he checks the refrigerator.)

843
00:33:50,743 --> 00:33:55,013
(He chooses white wine.)

844
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:59,453
(He cuts the abalones into bite-sized pieces...)

845
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:04,553
(and tosses them into the pan.)

846
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,463
(The abalone-spoon chef then uses his secret weapon.)

847
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,662
(He showers the abalones with white wine for the smoky aroma.)

848
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,803
It smells great.

849
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:17,833
(Jae Wook stir-fries the abalones until the alcohol evaporates.)

850
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,272
(Butter)

851
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:23,143
(Soy sauce)

852
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:26,943
(Fire Jae Wook does what he does best.)

853
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:33,523
(With masterful snaps of his wrist, he adds a smoky touch to the dish.)

854
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:35,792
(He then sprinkles a bit of sugar.)

855
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,493
The butter smells amazing.

856
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:44,693
(He stir-fries the abalones as if he's caramelizing them.)

857
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,733
(Taking a bite)

858
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,103
Of course.

859
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:50,433
(Jae Wook blows on a piece to cool it down...)

860
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:51,942
You should try this.

861
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:54,003
(and puts it in Jun Myun's mouth.)

862
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:57,473
It's good. Excellent.

863
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:01,143
You look like an actual chef from behind, Jae Wook.

864
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:04,113
Gosh, today's meal is going to be great as always.

865
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:07,853
Ji Yeon, did you whisk the eggs?

866
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,953
Yes, I just have to roll it.

867
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:12,963
You have to help me with the rolled omelet.

868
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,593
(Of course, I will.)

869
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:19,503
(She turns on the stove.)

870
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,472
I'm looking forward to this.

871
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:23,603
(Waiting to help out)

872
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:27,372
(I can't believe I'm making a rolled omelet!)

873
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:29,073
(Laughing)

874
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:30,572
Let me try.

875
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:34,183
(She calmly pours the egg onto the pan.)

876
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,183
You left out all the vegetables.

877
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,422
What do I do?

878
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:43,623
(The bowl is full of vegetables.)

879
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:45,593
The egg is just scented with vegetables.

880
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:46,923
It's a vegetable-scented omelet.

881
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:48,093
Goodness.

882
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:50,862
How do I fix this?

883
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:53,832
(With Jae Wook's assistance, she adds the vegetables.)

884
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,703
- This is funny. - Here.

885
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:59,303
(Now all she has to do is start rolling the edge of the egg.)

886
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:06,812
Right! We have that pan.

887
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:08,853
(Right! We have that pan.)

888
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,013
We have this pan!

889
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:16,593
(The square omelet pan will make it less difficult.)

890
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,263
(The square pan would have been better to use,)

891
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:23,393
(but she already poured the egg mix into the circular pan.)

892
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:24,763
(What should we do?)

893
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,103
What should I do?

894
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,433
Let's just scramble this.

895
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:31,133
You want a rolled omelet, right?

896
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,303
Move the square pan onto the fire.

897
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,242
(Is Jae Wook trying to make scrambled eggs instead?)

898
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:37,743
How is that going to turn into a rolled omelet?

899
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,383
(Just trust me.)

900
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:45,083
(Move the scrambled eggs into the square pan...)

901
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,583
- And you flatten it out? - Yes.

902
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:49,523
I don't think it will roll.

903
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:54,863
(Pour the leftover egg mix in between the scrambled eggs...)

904
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:59,633
(and let the eggs cook like that.)

905
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,472
You did it!

906
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:04,273
(They will become one solid piece, making it easier to roll.)

907
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,943
What do I do now?

908
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,413
- Do I roll this? - Yes, roll it.

909
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,983
We're looking at the inside, anyway.

910
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:17,453
(She's using two spatulas.)

911
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:21,283
Yes. That's it.

912
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,152
- This is it? - Yes, that's it.

913
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,153
(She's completely focused.)

914
00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:28,022
I'm doing it

915
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,733
Yes, now roll. That's it.

916
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:32,762
It's going to burn if you keep it over the fire any longer.

917
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:34,332
Turn down the heat for me.

918
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,503
(Frantic)

919
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,642
Hang in there.

920
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:39,643
(Ji Yeon rolls the omelet down to the edge of the pan...)

921
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:42,443
(and pushes it back up.)

922
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:46,343
(She pours the remaining egg mix into the pan.)

923
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:48,343
Just keep on rolling like earlier.

924
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,913
- All right. - Wait, I'll hold it for you.

925
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,483
Flip it.

926
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:55,753
- Yes, that's it. - Nice.

927
00:37:56,623 --> 00:37:57,692
- Yes, that's it. - Nice.

928
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,392
(She finished the rolled omelet with Jae Wook's perfect assistance!)

929
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:00,563
Nice.

930
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:02,093
Nice.

931
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,793
That looks so good.

932
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:05,163
- I'll put it down. - Yes.

933
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:07,303
(Exclaiming)

934
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:09,473
- You have to cut it later. - I will.

935
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:11,173
I'll do the cutting. Okay.

936
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:13,703
(Seeing the way Ji Yeon reacts makes Jae Wook feel proud.)

937
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,142
I'm so proud of myself.

938
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:17,843
(The younger members did a great job making the side dishes.)

939
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:19,942
Since when did fresh kimchi taste this good?

940
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:21,083
This is how it's supposed to be.

941
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:23,512
It's so good.

942
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:24,613
It's all done.

943
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:32,023
(The table is full of the side dishes they prepared together.)

944
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:35,093
Ji Yeon successfully made the rolled omelet.

945
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:37,133
Jae Wook helped me.

946
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:39,333
See? You can do anything if you try.

947
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,563
(Excited)

948
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:45,573
(Now all that's left to finish is the spicy kalguksu.)

949
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,943
(Jung Ah is waiting for the broth to boil.)

950
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,872
(Inside the red broth,)

951
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:53,812
(the potatoes are slowly becoming translucent as they cook.)

952
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,213
Is this enough?

953
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:57,612
(She then grabs the noodles, from which Jae Hwa removed excess flour.)

954
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,083
That one.

955
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:02,723
(She puts the noodles into the broth!)

956
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:09,193
(The noodles fall into the red broth like a waterfall.)

957
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,162
Pour in the vegetables.

958
00:39:11,163 --> 00:39:13,663
(The pieces of zucchini, onion, and green onion are all added too.)

959
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:16,373
Gosh, this smells great.

960
00:39:24,413 --> 00:39:25,513
(In awe)

961
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,813
It's a huge portion indeed.

962
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,083
(The pot is crammed with ingredients.)

963
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:32,153
It's only breakfast, but doesn't it look amazing?

964
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:35,853
(It looks amazing, but the pot looks like it's about to burst.)

965
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,923
- There are a lot of noodles. - I see.

966
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,062
(That makes sense...)

967
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:42,362
(because it's enough noodles for 12 people,)

968
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,632
(and there are 4 potatoes and 1 carrot inside.)

969
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,763
(On top of that, 2 zucchinis, 2 onions, and 1 green onion.)

970
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:51,273
(All of those ingredients are now in this pot.)

971
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:53,742
It's enough to feed about 12 people.

972
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:55,613
Park Jun Myun will be eating a lot of the noodles.

973
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,442
The noodles release starch as they cook,

974
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:00,943
so they keep sticking to the bottom.

975
00:40:01,283 --> 00:40:02,513
I'll keep stirring it.

976
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,193
Ever since the work we did yesterday,

977
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:12,862
my back hurts.

978
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:14,293
(My back hurts.)

979
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,733
The others that worked two days must be in even more pain.

980
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:20,662
(As he grunts from soar muscles,)

981
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:24,233
(he continues to stir the spicy kalguksu.)

982
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:31,343
(He tends to the pot seriously, as if he's making herbal medicine.)

983
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,523
(The combination of starch from the noodles and the spicy broth...)

984
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:44,123
(is turning into spicy kalguksu with thick and savory soup.)

985
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,393
Can I taste it to see if it needs more seasoning?

986
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:49,233
(Slurping the broth)

987
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:51,232
Gosh, it's good.

988
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,833
(Of course, it is!)

989
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:56,933
(Jung Ah takes a bite to check on the noodles.)

990
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:58,533
(Yum)

991
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,303
Do we add the eggs later?

992
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:01,842
Yes, we can.

993
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:02,913
(To finish off, whisked eggs are poured into the broth.)

994
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:08,713
(To prevent the eggs from becoming part of the broth,)

995
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:19,023
(Jung Ah stirs the pot gently, and the spicy kalguksu is complete!)

996
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:21,993
- It's time to use your strength. - Okay.

997
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:23,992
One, two.

998
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,062
(Lifting up the pot)

999
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,233
All right.

1000
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,463
(Gosh!)

1001
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:28,872
- It's on its way. - Gosh!

1002
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:30,303
It's coming inside. Let's give it a round of applause.

1003
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:33,002
(Here comes the VIP.)

1004
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,072
(Gosh)

1005
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,103
That looks great.

1006
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:39,313
(Spicy kalguksu, the VVIP, specialized in rainy weather)

1007
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:42,753
(Everyone is welcoming it wholeheartedly.)

1008
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,452
Jung Ah, this is amazing.

1009
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:47,582
(The bowl is filled with hot spicy kalguksu.)

1010
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,623
It smells great.

1011
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:54,622
(Gosh)

1012
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:55,963
This is going to taste great.

1013
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:58,262
Where are the dried laver flakes?

1014
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:00,163
I'll do it.

1015
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:05,073
Do you want this many laver flakes?

1016
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:06,303
Enough to make it look even more appealing.

1017
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,213
- Like this? - That's perfect.

1018
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:14,242
Kyung Ho, bring me more bowls,

1019
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,513
so we can all taste it before it gets soggy.

1020
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,183
The staff should eat too.

1021
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,222
Gosh, my mouth has been watering for a while now.

1022
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:22,453
(Proud)

1023
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,093
I had a small bite earlier.

1024
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:27,563
- Did it taste good? - Yes. I can't get over it.

1025
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,332
This is going to be so good.

1026
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,202
(A breakfast perfect for the rainy day)

1027
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:34,033
Gosh, my mouth has been watering for a while now.

1028
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:37,103
(The spicy kalguksu has a rich broth and lots of vegetables.)

1029
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:40,103
(The spring cabbage fresh kimchi is like spring's aromatic gift.)

1030
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,943
(The abalone stir-fry with soy sauce and butter is sweet and savory.)

1031
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:46,013
(And that's not all.)

1032
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,543
Ji Yeon, are you going to cut this for us?

1033
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:48,853
I am!

1034
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:51,653
(Running over)

1035
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:52,953
- Are you going to cut it? - Are you doing a cutting ceremony?

1036
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:55,392
I'll begin the cutting ceremony.

1037
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:56,653
(Ji Yeon's performance for the rolled omelet begins now.)

1038
00:42:57,423 --> 00:43:00,022
(Singing)

1039
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:02,463
(Will you come?)

1040
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:07,833
(The rolled omelet cutting ceremony is quite solemn.)

1041
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:11,403
(Modest)

1042
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,643
(She cuts each piece with care.)

1043
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:20,313
(She suddenly becomes embarrassed.)

1044
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:23,413
(Laughing)

1045
00:43:23,753 --> 00:43:26,023
(Even the rolled omelet looks modest.)

1046
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:28,282
- Nice. That's a nice decoration. - Not bad, right?

1047
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:29,352
It's great.

1048
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,423
(Decoration)

1049
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:31,623
(Happy)

1050
00:43:31,893 --> 00:43:34,393
(Ji Yeon's rolled omelet has been cut nicely.)

1051
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:38,692
(A hearty breakfast in Wando)

1052
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:41,133
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1053
00:43:42,473 --> 00:43:45,132
- If there's too much... - There's more.

1054
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,302
(The expectations are the highest when they stir the noodles.)

1055
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:48,373
My goodness.

1056
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:50,643
(The first bite brings nervousness.)

1057
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:52,142
(Should I eat the noodles?)

1058
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:53,713
(They're hot.)

1059
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:58,083
(Let's eat them.)

1060
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:00,683
(Impressed)

1061
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,022
The spicy kalguksu is tasty.

1062
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:03,023
- Really? - Yes.

1063
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,222
(The taste makes him want more.)

1064
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:09,963
(Slurping)

1065
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:12,703
The noodles are soggy, right?

1066
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:14,903
- It's tasty. - Really?

1067
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:16,973
Spicy pasta.

1068
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:21,073
- It's tasty. - It's good even when it's thick.

1069
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:22,513
It's so tasty.

1070
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:24,873
(Slurping)

1071
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,383
(The taste is rich.)

1072
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,613
Jae Wook, isn't it too spicy for you?

1073
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:31,613
It's tasty.

1074
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,693
(Doenjang and gochujang made the rich and spicy soup.)

1075
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:40,763
(Jae Hwa sweeps her hair back in an elegant way.)

1076
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,833
(She hums in approval right away.)

1077
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,263
(The taste surprises her for the second time!)

1078
00:44:47,763 --> 00:44:48,763
Is it tasty?

1079
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:51,933
(Jung Ah likes vegetables.)

1080
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:56,173
(She eats vegetables first.)

1081
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,582
(She wraps up the noodles and eats them.)

1082
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,313
(Satisfied)

1083
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,182
(The secret behind the deep taste)

1084
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:05,552
It contains a lot of potatoes.

1085
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:06,622
That's right.

1086
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,623
(A heap of vegetables)

1087
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,222
(Tasty spicy kalguksu...)

1088
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:11,223
(needs tasty kimchi.)

1089
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:13,163
Fresh kimchi is so tasty.

1090
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:14,793
(Proud)

1091
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,232
- Did you make it just now? - Yes.

1092
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:18,903
(She made fresh kimchi with spring cabbage.)

1093
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:20,833
(Impressed)

1094
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:22,103
It's tasty.

1095
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:25,102
I like that it isn't salty.

1096
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:26,742
(Since it isn't salty, it suits Jung Ah's taste.)

1097
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:29,473
- She really is Seasoning Park. - Seasoning Park.

1098
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:31,542
(She becomes embarrassed.)

1099
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:33,842
- The fresh kimchi is tasty. - Yes.

1100
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:35,443
Jun Myun's kimchi is always tasty.

1101
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:39,253
(Let me taste the rolled omelet I made.)

1102
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:41,823
(Thick)

1103
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:47,092
(Let me taste my student's rolled omelet.)

1104
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:49,363
- It's a bit... - What?

1105
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:51,462
- It's a bit salty. - Is it a bit salty?

1106
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:53,403
Yes. I was talking about the rolled omelet.

1107
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:54,603
The rolled omelet?

1108
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:56,472
(Putting it back down)

1109
00:45:56,473 --> 00:45:57,473
(I see.)

1110
00:45:57,933 --> 00:46:00,102
- Is it salty? - Yes, it is.

1111
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:01,173
(Stern)

1112
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,243
I didn't know.

1113
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:07,012
It's salty. I shouldn't have added salted shrimp.

1114
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:08,082
- Did you add salted shrimp? - A little bit.

1115
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,412
- You shouldn't have done that. - A little bit.

1116
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:10,413
To where?
- Rolled omelet. - Rolled omelet.

1117
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:13,983
(Disheartened)

1118
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:15,282
Rolled omelet.

1119
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:17,223
(Let's see if it's salty.)

1120
00:46:17,453 --> 00:46:20,093
(Nervous)

1121
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:22,122
(My goodness)

1122
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,193
The rolled omelet is good.

1123
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:25,763
It's perfect for rice.

1124
00:46:27,633 --> 00:46:29,373
(Relieved)

1125
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,733
- She made it for the first time. - Yes. While it's a bit salty...

1126
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,103
- She did well. - She did well.

1127
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:34,403
It's hard to make it like this.

1128
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:36,613
Your cooking skills improved a lot, Ji Yeon.

1129
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:38,272
- Me? - Yes.

1130
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:39,783
Jung Ah, I think Ji Yeon is good.

1131
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,283
Cooking is fun these days.

1132
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:46,383
(Thanks to the teachers, Ji Yeon enjoys cooking these days.)

1133
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:49,852
(She tries the abalone stir-fry with soy sauce and butter.)

1134
00:46:49,853 --> 00:46:52,323
(Savoring the dish)

1135
00:46:52,723 --> 00:46:54,693
Yes. Try the abalone dish.

1136
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,163
Jae Wook saved it.

1137
00:46:58,493 --> 00:46:59,703
- My goodness. - It's tasty, Jae Wook.

1138
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:01,332
- You saved it. - Did he save it?

1139
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,333
- It's tasty. - Really?
- Yes. - It's tasty.

1140
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,903
(The youngest member has golden hands.)

1141
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:08,243
- Did he save it? - Yes.

1142
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:10,873
(Let's see if he saved the dish.)

1143
00:47:12,683 --> 00:47:13,713
It's tasty.

1144
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:16,813
Let me try the abalone dish.

1145
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:19,782
(The man who cooked abalones yesterday)

1146
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,252
- The abalone dish is nice. - It's tasty.

1147
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:22,693
Jae Wook, the abalone dish is nice.

1148
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:27,623
(Salty and savory abalone stir-fry with soy sauce and butter)

1149
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:30,993
(The man who cooked abalones today takes a bite.)

1150
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:34,303
(The young members' side dishes...)

1151
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:39,143
(get shared by everyone.)

1152
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:41,402
(Clear)

1153
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:42,473
(Taking the crumb)

1154
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,743
(The young members' side dishes were a big success.)

1155
00:47:46,843 --> 00:47:48,683
(Meanwhile, Jae Wook)

1156
00:47:48,843 --> 00:47:51,183
(He shakes his arm once.)

1157
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:54,553
(The vacuum cleaner of spicy kalguksu)

1158
00:47:55,353 --> 00:47:58,053
(After eating a lot of noodles,)

1159
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:02,633
(he resets himself with spring cabbage fresh kimchi.)

1160
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:05,832
(He uses a spoon...)

1161
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,833
(to wrap up.)

1162
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:11,133
It's so tasty, Jung Ah.

1163
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:13,702
I finished the noodles.

1164
00:48:13,703 --> 00:48:15,643
(He quickly cleared the noodles.)

1165
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:16,813
Thank goodness.

1166
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:18,413
(Chef Yum feels proud.)

1167
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:21,743
(He eats the remaining soup and vegetables.)

1168
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:24,183
(Then he looks out the window.)

1169
00:48:24,783 --> 00:48:29,153
(The spring rain stopped.)

1170
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:32,322
(Now, we have work to do.)

1171
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,662
When sikhye becomes cold after breakfast,

1172
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,493
let's visit the elders.

1173
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,833
Should we stay in the house after breakfast?

1174
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:46,703
After visiting the senior community center,

1175
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:49,472
Ji Yeon and Jae Wook should go out and buy...

1176
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:51,273
- the frozen assorted seafood. - The frozen one.

1177
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:53,682
As you come back, buy some tasty coffee.

1178
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:54,842
- We'll get coffee. - Okay.

1179
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:56,312
Jung Ah, I'm craving coffee.

1180
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:57,713
(They also need to get Jun Myun's birthday cake.)

1181
00:48:57,813 --> 00:49:00,082
(Tasty coffee)

1182
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,153
- Okay. - Pancake goes well with coffee.

1183
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,393
- Jun Myun. - I'm sorry.

1184
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:07,062
You said you wouldn't make it. You said you'd take it.

1185
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:09,563
- I won't make it. - But I want to watch you make it.

1186
00:49:09,663 --> 00:49:10,663
What?

1187
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:12,632
- You want to watch him make it? - You want to watch me make it?

1188
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,502
- Yes. - Jun Myun can be persistent.

1189
00:49:14,503 --> 00:49:17,803
Jun Myun, you're too obsessed with me.

1190
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:18,933
No.

1191
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:21,642
Jun Myun isn't easy.

1192
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:23,273
Why would I become obsessed with you?

1193
00:49:23,613 --> 00:49:25,012
You'll be in trouble if you watch me make pancakes.

1194
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:26,383
You won't escape my charms.

1195
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:29,043
You aren't difficult, right?

1196
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:31,853
She likes men who are smart and difficult.

1197
00:49:31,953 --> 00:49:34,053
(She likes bad men.)

1198
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,822
(Smart and difficult?)

1199
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:38,793
- You aren't difficult, right? - Then I'm ignorant and soft.

1200
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:43,762
Jun Myun, he's ignorant and soft. What do you think?

1201
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:45,233
- I'm very soft. - Yes.

1202
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,803
(Jae Wook bursts out laughing.)

1203
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,563
- You think? - Yes.

1204
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:50,332
He's the furthest from her ideal type.

1205
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,342
- Oh, no. Kyung Ho. - Oh, no.

1206
00:49:53,343 --> 00:49:54,903
You shouldn't have said anything.

1207
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:58,072
Seriously.

1208
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:00,143
(Depressed)

1209
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,143
What should we do...

1210
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:04,782
with the dishes today?

1211
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:06,053
Let's play another game.

1212
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:07,483
- A different game? - Yes.

1213
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:10,253
- I won't play games. - I'll play for you.

1214
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,993
(I feel bad for the second-oldest sister.)

1215
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:17,932
In that case, to be honest,

1216
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,163
- Jun Myun should be exempt. - Let's leave her out.

1217
00:50:19,803 --> 00:50:21,463
I'm 100 percent sure that you'll be it again.

1218
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,803
Then I'll do the dishes again.

1219
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:24,403
- You can be the judge. - No.

1220
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:27,703
(That's right. It's Jun Myun's birthday.)

1221
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:31,873
(Thus began the project to keep Jun Myun from doing the dishes.)

1222
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:33,242
Still,

1223
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,512
- I must play the game. - Yes.

1224
00:50:34,513 --> 00:50:35,683
(My pride won't let me sit out.)

1225
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,852
(We're ready to exempt you!)

1226
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:41,923
- If you lose... - Let's say I lose again,

1227
00:50:42,323 --> 00:50:43,653
I'll think about it.

1228
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:45,962
(My goodness)

1229
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,823
- There aren't many dishes today. - Shall we play...

1230
00:50:48,863 --> 00:50:50,693
- Shall we play the Game of Wits? - Okay.

1231
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:53,102
- Do you want to try it? - Let's have a practice round.

1232
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:54,703
- Shall we have a practice round? - One!

1233
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:59,672
- One! - No. We need to begin.

1234
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:01,543
We need to say the slogan.

1235
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:03,773
(Her competitive side came out.)

1236
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:05,513
- Let's begin. One! - Two!

1237
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:06,983
(Laughing)
- Three! - Four!

1238
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:08,983
Five!
(She gets the dishwashing duty.)

1239
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,912
You need to say it quickly.

1240
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:13,783
I think Jun Myun will lose again.

1241
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:15,853
Jun Myun, what are you going to do?

1242
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:20,193
(Will she fall into the dishwashing purgatory again?)

1243
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:22,692
Jun Myun, why are you crying?

1244
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:23,693
(What am I going to do?)

1245
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,133
Jun Myun, shall I teach you how to win?

1246
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,103
Yes.

1247
00:51:28,104 --> 00:51:29,333
(Please teach me.)

1248
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,232
- You should start the game. - Really?

1249
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:33,442
- Go, "Game of Wits! One!" - That's right.

1250
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:34,443
Start the game.

1251
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:37,112
- Shall I begin? - "Game of Wits begins now."

1252
00:51:37,113 --> 00:51:40,613
Game of Whats...

1253
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:44,413
How can you be so bad at it?

1254
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:47,822
- "Game of Whats." - "Game of Whats?"

1255
00:51:47,823 --> 00:51:49,522
If you say, "Game of Whats," you'll lose.

1256
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,993
(Get your wits together.)

1257
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,063
- It's the actual round. - Is it the actual round?

1258
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:01,502
- I'm ready. - Game of Wits begins now.

1259
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:02,503
- One! - Two!

1260
00:52:02,504 --> 00:52:04,073
- Three! - Three!

1261
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:05,972
- What happens now? - We play rock-paper-scissors.

1262
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:07,272
Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.

1263
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,802
(Rock versus scissors)

1264
00:52:08,803 --> 00:52:09,813
Rock-paper-scissors.

1265
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,292
- I am ground, the game starts now - I am ground, the game starts now

1266
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:27,293
I'll begin.

1267
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:29,222
- Plum, four. - Plum, plum, plum, plum.

1268
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:31,093
- Nice. - Plum...

1269
00:52:31,763 --> 00:52:34,462
(She attacked herself.)

1270
00:52:34,463 --> 00:52:35,972
You're Plum.

1271
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:38,773
(Plum has no intention to win.)

1272
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:41,943
There aren't many dirty dishes, so shall we wash them together?

1273
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:44,642
Shall we wash our own dishes?

1274
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:46,812
- No. - All right.

1275
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:48,812
(Sad)

1276
00:52:48,813 --> 00:52:51,112
After eating, we can...

1277
00:52:51,113 --> 00:52:53,653
- Only one can stand at the sink. - That's right.

1278
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,822
Shall we just decide quickly with rock-paper-scissors?

1279
00:52:56,823 --> 00:52:58,052
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1280
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,762
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1281
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,192
(Rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors)

1282
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:02,623
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1283
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:04,693
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1284
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:06,562
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1285
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,803
(Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock)

1286
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:10,302
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1287
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:11,703
(Everyone...)

1288
00:53:11,903 --> 00:53:13,302
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1289
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:15,343
(played paper.)

1290
00:53:16,313 --> 00:53:18,813
(A small rock challenged them.)

1291
00:53:19,043 --> 00:53:20,483
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1292
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:22,443
What's this?

1293
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,413
- How scary. - You know...

1294
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,123
Her face became so red.

1295
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:31,452
She's crying because she's so happy.

1296
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:32,823
- It's so funny. - She's so happy.

1297
00:53:33,163 --> 00:53:34,163
(My goodness)

1298
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:37,133
How did that happen?

1299
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:41,003
- At this point, I'm scared. - It seems impossible.

1300
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:44,402
I think dishwashing is in your fate.

1301
00:53:44,403 --> 00:53:45,473
(Is she possessed by an evil spirit?)

1302
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,943
(Jun Myun, welcome.)

1303
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,143
How is this possible?

1304
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:53,512
When something like this happens,

1305
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:55,042
- I think of it as the divine will. - That's right.

1306
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:57,213
- You should do it happily. - Yes.

1307
00:53:57,813 --> 00:54:00,252
"Jun Myun." It's a message from the above.

1308
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:03,123
"You'll do the dishes today."

1309
00:54:04,593 --> 00:54:06,122
Can I just do the dishes? I don't want to do it.

1310
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:07,922
- I mean, I want to do it. - Okay.

1311
00:54:07,923 --> 00:54:10,633
- Yes. She shouldn't test her fate. - That's right.

1312
00:54:11,263 --> 00:54:12,363
Seriously.

1313
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,232
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1314
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:15,302
Thank you for the food.

1315
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:16,432
(The breakfast was full of laughter and chills.)

1316
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:17,932
- Let's go. - It was so funny.

1317
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:19,073
I guess it's fate.

1318
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:20,773
It was so funny.

1319
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:22,942
- It was amazing. - Let's be grateful...

1320
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:26,583
for Jun Myun who does the dishes.

1321
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:28,443
Seriously.

1322
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,552
You should play games with your husband at home.

1323
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:32,683
(My goodness)

1324
00:54:34,283 --> 00:54:35,482
That's so funny.

1325
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:37,153
(Thankfully, there aren't as many dishes as yesterday.)

1326
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,492
Jun Myun, should I throw away these strawberries?

1327
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:41,062
- No, they're... - Are they edible?

1328
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:42,622
- Yes, eat them. - Would you like one?

1329
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:43,663
Yes.

1330
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,993
(Putting a strawberry in her mouth)

1331
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:47,003
(Kyung Ho puts one in his mouth.)

1332
00:54:47,563 --> 00:54:49,732
(He roots for her with a strawberry.)

1333
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,203
That's another dish to wash.

1334
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:56,773
(While everyone does a different chore,)

1335
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:03,013
(she quickly gets done with washing the dishes.)

1336
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:07,653
(I'm done with washing the dishes. I won't lose next time.)

1337
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:10,752
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

1338
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,023
(Thank you, Dishwashing Park!)

1339
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:13,763
It isn't raining now.

1340
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:15,223
Let's pack sikhye.

1341
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,062
We need to pack sikhye.

1342
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,193
(They cooked down the sikhye.)

1343
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:25,733
(He wipes the bottles carefully as they're for the elders.)

1344
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:29,713
- They're cold, right? - Yes, it's nice.

1345
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,713
Shall we take out the ones in the fridge?

1346
00:55:32,013 --> 00:55:33,183
What do you think?

1347
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:36,083
- Gosh, it's no joke. - It's cold.

1348
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:39,353
(The sikhye is ready.)

1349
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:42,483
- Let's go, guys. - Let's go.

1350
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:45,053
- Are we walking there? - Yes.

1351
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:47,422
Then let's alternate carrying the bottles.

1352
00:55:47,423 --> 00:55:48,423
(Carrying sikhye, they set off for the senior community center.)

1353
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,632
(They line up in pairs.)

1354
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:54,403
It's so funny that we're lining up in pairs.

1355
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:57,673
I feel like...

1356
00:55:57,973 --> 00:55:59,902
- there's an important event. - An event.

1357
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,502
We're going to a meeting.

1358
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:03,442
- Yes. We're going together. - Something big has happened.

1359
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,272
I have something to say to Sun Ja's mom.

1360
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:07,182
That's right. Let's go and give her a piece of our mind.

1361
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:08,183
(They suddenly begin a skit.)

1362
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,283
Let's go!

1363
00:56:10,553 --> 00:56:11,983
Honey, you shouldn't interfere.

1364
00:56:12,183 --> 00:56:13,552
(Laughing)

1365
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:15,253
Just listen to the head of the village.

1366
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:21,362
Gosh, why does that house have so many dirty dishes?

1367
00:56:21,363 --> 00:56:23,433
- It's never-ending. - Our hands are always wet.

1368
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:27,133
You guys never help me.

1369
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,363
What was that, honey?

1370
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,772
She has two families.

1371
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:32,972
(Apparently, Jun Myun has two families.)

1372
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,572
In one house, she does the dishes.

1373
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:37,342
In the other house, she doesn't do the dishes.

1374
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:39,643
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

1375
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:43,183
Jung Ah, I got the duty today.

1376
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:46,422
Don't stare at them, okay?

1377
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:47,953
(He keeps going with the skit until the end.)

1378
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:50,223
There are many people.

1379
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,693
- Look at the shoes. - Yes.

1380
00:56:52,423 --> 00:56:54,123
It's quite noisy.

1381
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:57,593
(They open the door carefully.)

1382
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,233
- Hello. - My goodness.

1383
00:57:00,803 --> 00:57:02,262
- Hello. - Welcome.

1384
00:57:02,263 --> 00:57:03,373
It's nice to meet you.

1385
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:06,033
- It's nice to meet you. - Come over here.

1386
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,373
- They're playing Go-Stop. - Yes.

1387
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:10,413
They're playing Go-Stop for pennies.

1388
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:12,943
- We came to say hello. - Okay.

1389
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,242
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1390
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,712
We're having a good stay in the village. Thank you.

1391
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:17,713
(We're resting well in the beautiful village.)

1392
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:18,983
We...

1393
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:22,452
We made some sikhye and brought it.

1394
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:24,722
I don't know if you like kabocha sikhye.

1395
00:57:24,723 --> 00:57:26,192
My goodness.

1396
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,522
(The elders pour it into cups.)

1397
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:29,392
We made kabocha sikhye.

1398
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:30,893
(The Fresh members deliver them.)

1399
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:33,503
(A smile is a part of the service.)

1400
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:35,062
Cheers.

1401
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:37,802
(Cheers)

1402
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:39,473
- It's nearly done. - Yes.

1403
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:41,502
- It isn't too sweet. It's good. - Yes.

1404
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,113
- I didn't add much sugar. - It isn't too sweet.

1405
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:46,743
(It suits the elders' taste.)

1406
00:57:47,883 --> 00:57:50,483
(Getting a refill right away)

1407
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,122
Thank you for enjoying it.

1408
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:54,123
(She feels proud since they like it.)

1409
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:56,553
Is it tasty?

1410
00:57:58,323 --> 00:57:59,763
Your name was Mi Pung.

1411
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:02,663
Mi Pung? Ma'am, do you remember Mi Pung?

1412
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:05,563
- Oh, my. - I just remembered the name.

1413
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:06,762
Oh, my.

1414
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:08,362
That's right. I'm Mi Pung.

1415
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:09,973
(Thank you for recognizing me.)

1416
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:13,673
- I see. It's fascinating. - It's cute.

1417
00:58:14,243 --> 00:58:15,803
- Stop it. - Come on.

1418
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:19,573
Mo!

1419
00:58:22,243 --> 00:58:24,383
(Mi Pung is lucky.)

1420
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:27,022
(She gets mo 2 times in a row!)

1421
00:58:27,023 --> 00:58:29,552
- What's this? - You get to go again.

1422
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,493
You should marry a man in this village.

1423
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:32,853
- Shall I do that? - Yes.

1424
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,163
I'll make the best daughter-in-law. I'm good at yutnori.

1425
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:38,533
Please gather around. Please sit closer.

1426
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:42,363
One, two, three.

1427
00:58:43,473 --> 00:58:46,133
(March 8, 2025, with the elders of Yeongpung Village)

1428
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:48,203
Please stay healthy.

1429
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:50,743
- Please stay healthy. - Please stay healthy. Thank you.

1430
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:53,682
- Come again next year. - We had a lot of fun. Thank you.

1431
00:58:53,683 --> 00:58:54,912
I almost didn't recognize you since you had blended in.

1432
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:56,312
- Right? I was hiding. - Yes.

1433
00:58:56,313 --> 00:58:57,682
Thank you for your hard work.

1434
00:58:57,683 --> 00:58:58,882
- Okay. - Thank you.

1435
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:00,352
- We had a lot of fun. Thank you. - Thank you.

1436
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:01,553
Bye.

1437
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:04,623
- It was nice to see them enjoy it. - I know.

1438
00:59:04,853 --> 00:59:06,292
- They enjoyed sikye too. - Yes.

1439
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,193
- They kept getting refills. - They really enjoyed it.

1440
00:59:09,663 --> 00:59:11,692
We can taste it too, right?

1441
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:13,663
Yes. There's some left.

1442
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,672
It's nice to see them in a group.

1443
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:19,603
I know. Their clothes were colorful.

1444
00:59:21,073 --> 00:59:22,403
There isn't much sunlight today.

1445
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:23,942
- I know. It's cloudy. - There isn't much sunlight.

1446
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:26,243
Yesterday, the sun was strong.

1447
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,182
It's cloudy.

1448
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:30,613
(We shouldn't forget about Jun Myun's birthday party.)

1449
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:33,012
I don't know how...

1450
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:35,053
I'll have time to make seaweed soup.

1451
00:59:35,753 --> 00:59:36,952
(Ji Yeon diverts her attention with small talk.)

1452
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:39,052
- Three days have passed already. - I know.

1453
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:41,022
Shall we go and buy coffee and cake right away?

1454
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:42,062
Yes.

1455
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,532
- Ji Yeon and Jae Wook... - What?

1456
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:45,862
- should go right away. - We'll do that.

1457
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:49,433
- We'll buy coffee and things. - Coffee.

1458
00:59:50,273 --> 00:59:51,303
Is there bread?

1459
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,273
Something like cake.

1460
00:59:54,473 --> 00:59:56,543
I'll buy various things.

1461
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,273
(Jung Ah?)

1462
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,212
- Shouldn't we turn left? - Cream cake.

1463
01:00:02,213 --> 01:00:04,113
Which way is it? Do we go straight?

1464
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:05,782
Jung Ah, do we go straight?

1465
01:00:05,783 --> 01:00:07,322
(She just stares into the distance.)

1466
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:08,823
- Turn left. - Go straight.

1467
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:10,423
As soon as I lie down...

1468
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:12,852
- Forget about caffeine. - Jun Myun.

1469
01:00:12,853 --> 01:00:14,392
(We didn't get caught, did we?)

1470
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,562
I don't think so.

1471
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:17,032
She's so quick-witted.

1472
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,592
- No, she doesn't know. - No?

1473
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:19,593
(It's nerve-racking to fool Jun Myun.)

1474
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:21,602
Shall we leave right away?

1475
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:23,102
- Yes. You and I... - Leave right away.

1476
01:00:23,103 --> 01:00:25,073
will go to the car and set off.

1477
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:29,043
- Have a nice trip. - Buy something tasty.

1478
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:32,613
Did you hear that? For goodness' sake.

1479
01:00:33,313 --> 01:00:36,413
Jun Myun is so scary that I can't do anything.

1480
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,912
- She didn't figure it out, did she? - No way.

1481
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:40,653
Cake is the most common dessert.

1482
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:42,953
- Right? She didn't mean anything. - We have to think of it that way.

1483
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:46,123
(They set off to buy a cake.)

1484
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,792
Jung Ah, shall we go inside?

1485
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:49,022
- Let's go inside and... - Let's go inside and play.

1486
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,133
What should we do to play?

1487
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:52,733
We have free time until the young ones come back.

1488
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:55,362
Kyung Ho, do you want to sing?

1489
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:56,872
There's the karaoke machine.

1490
01:00:56,873 --> 01:00:58,803
Shall we do that? It'll help with digestion.

1491
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,803
There's this song.

1492
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:02,772
"The Fairy of Shampoo."

1493
01:01:02,773 --> 01:01:04,073
(Glancing over)

1494
01:01:04,813 --> 01:01:06,683
(To cook seaweed soup,)

1495
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:09,513
(Jun Myun needs to go outside and Jung Ah needs to stay inside.)

1496
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:13,683
(What's a good way to stay in the house?)

1497
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:17,853
Time is passing.

1498
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:19,522
Hold on.

1499
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:20,863
(She yawns on purpose.)

1500
01:01:22,523 --> 01:01:24,592
- You should get some sleep. - Okay.

1501
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:27,503
- Take a pillow. We'll hang out. - I need to take a nap.

1502
01:01:28,203 --> 01:01:29,932
- Lie down until coffee comes. - Okay.

1503
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,373
I'll go and lie down. Why am I suddenly so tired?

1504
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:35,172
You woke up too early after going to bed late yesterday.

1505
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:36,173
(The birthday girl is worried.)

1506
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:39,113
(She lies to Jun Myun and leaves the living room.)

1507
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:43,183
(The operation begins.)

1508
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:45,612
What are you saying?

1509
01:01:45,613 --> 01:01:46,823
(Now, they need to go outside with Jun Myun.)

1510
01:01:47,053 --> 01:01:48,783
- Jun Myun, we... - Jun Myun, we...

1511
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:51,052
Shall we go somewhere...

1512
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:52,722
- while Jung Ah takes a nap? - Where?

1513
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:54,323
Shall we go for a walk?

1514
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:56,292
(Shaking her head)

1515
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:57,863
- Or... - You guys should go without me.

1516
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,762
Jun Myun, shall we go outside?

1517
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:01,133
Go without me.

1518
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:03,532
- What will we do by ourselves? - Go without me.

1519
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,003
- We've talked a lot. - Yes.

1520
01:02:05,703 --> 01:02:08,243
You guys should go without me. Go without me.

1521
01:02:09,843 --> 01:02:11,072
Go without me.

1522
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:12,112
(Let's please go outside.)

1523
01:02:12,113 --> 01:02:13,682
My energy got drained this morning.

1524
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:15,213
Playing those games made me tear up.

1525
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:19,713
Shall we sing a duet song?

1526
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:23,392
(The grasshopper wants to sing instead of going outside.)

1527
01:02:23,393 --> 01:02:24,623
What was that song by Lee Moon Sae?

1528
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:28,222
Let's sing it since we'll part soon.

1529
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:29,223
Okay.

1530
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:30,833
Honey.

1531
01:02:31,463 --> 01:02:32,893
We'll part ways today.

1532
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:35,262
(How will we go outside?)

1533
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,603
You did the dishes.

1534
01:02:37,073 --> 01:02:39,433
(Absorbed)

1535
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:40,943
You know the song, right?

1536
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:46,113
(They can't ask Jun Myun to go outside.)

1537
01:02:48,643 --> 01:02:53,113
(Their throats just become hoarse.)

1538
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:57,193
(Feeling sad)

1539
01:02:57,623 --> 01:03:01,063
(I might just fall asleep.)

1540
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:06,733
(Singing passionately)

1541
01:03:08,403 --> 01:03:11,103
(Satisfied)

1542
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:13,742
That's how you sing.

1543
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:14,773
(Is she satisfied now?)

1544
01:03:14,973 --> 01:03:17,542
- The lyrics are a bit sad. - Yes.

1545
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,943
The soul is no joke.

1546
01:03:19,443 --> 01:03:20,742
She wrote words with water on the table.

1547
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,082
"On the table, you wrote with water."

1548
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,413
"Goodbye, my love."

1549
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,953
(The feeling type becomes sentimental.)

1550
01:03:26,353 --> 01:03:28,983
(This won't do.)

1551
01:03:29,253 --> 01:03:31,923
(Kyung Ho, you guys should go out.)

1552
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:35,293
(It's an emergency.)

1553
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:37,233
(Reading the room)

1554
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,163
(The control tower feels troubled.)

1555
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,463
(Jun Myun goe to the restroom for a second.)

1556
01:03:43,873 --> 01:03:45,272
(Getting up)

1557
01:03:45,273 --> 01:03:46,273
(Go out!)

1558
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:50,413
We need to go outside with Jun Myun.

1559
01:03:50,813 --> 01:03:52,543
(What?)

1560
01:03:53,273 --> 01:03:55,583
(Hurry up and take her outside.)

1561
01:03:55,813 --> 01:03:57,383
(Okay!)

1562
01:03:57,983 --> 01:04:00,053
We need to go outside before the younger ones come back.

1563
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:01,723
She needs to cook seaweed soup.

1564
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:04,552
Let's go.

1565
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:05,753
We don't have much time. We need to hurry.

1566
01:04:06,393 --> 01:04:07,923
A cream cake and...

1567
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:11,592
I'll load the car with coffee.

1568
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:12,962
- I'll get the flowers. - Okay.

1569
01:04:12,963 --> 01:04:14,233
(They purchase flowers as well.)

1570
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:16,973
Okay. Let's hit the road right away.

1571
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:18,803
We're in a hurry for some reason.

1572
01:04:19,433 --> 01:04:21,543
- Hey, I got a call from Jun Myun. - Why?

1573
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:24,813
I don't know. She asked me where we were.

1574
01:04:24,873 --> 01:04:26,913
We need to hurry up and soak dried seaweed.

1575
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:29,243
Is Jung Ah home alone?

1576
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:32,113
(No, they're together.)

1577
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:36,023
- Jun Myun, there's one more car. - What?

1578
01:04:36,183 --> 01:04:38,392
- What? - There's one more car.

1579
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:39,553
If you don't feel like walking,

1580
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:41,662
- shall we go out for a drive? - Okay.

1581
01:04:41,663 --> 01:04:43,062
- Do you want to go out? - Yes.

1582
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:44,763
Let's go. Let's go for a walk.

1583
01:04:45,793 --> 01:04:46,963
- Let's go outside. - Okay.

1584
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:49,733
Will Jung Ah be okay?

1585
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,532
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

1586
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:52,602
Let's go outside.

1587
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:54,203
(I'll be okay if you go outside.)

1588
01:04:54,843 --> 01:04:57,213
- Thanks for coming with us. - It's the least I can do.

1589
01:04:58,043 --> 01:05:01,443
Whose idea was it to write with water?

1590
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:02,683
That part was so good.

1591
01:05:03,553 --> 01:05:05,153
What? That song...

1592
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,523
(Getting up)

1593
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:14,223
(Shall I get started?)

1594
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,762
You guys didn't walk...

1595
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:18,392
- along the coast yesterday, right? - No.

1596
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:21,532
(They must complete making the seaweed soup...)

1597
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:24,233
(and hide the cake.)

1598
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,343
(They'll fail if they run behind.)

1599
01:05:27,743 --> 01:05:30,543
(It's a match of speed.)

1600
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:33,073
She won't stay outside for long.

1601
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:35,483
(She crosses the wide front yard...)

1602
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:38,553
(and hides inside the greenhouse just in case.)

1603
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,123
Sesame oil!

1604
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:42,483
(Running)

1605
01:05:42,653 --> 01:05:44,323
(Glancing over)

1606
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:46,623
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1607
01:05:47,723 --> 01:05:50,363
(Running at full speed)

1608
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,062
That's right.

1609
01:05:52,063 --> 01:05:55,403
(She crosses the front yard many times.)

1610
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:59,133
(Jung Ah struggles by herself.)

1611
01:05:59,703 --> 01:06:01,973
(She can't get caught.)

1612
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:04,943
(She can't run late.)

1613
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:06,573
- Let's take a selfie. - Let's take it together.

1614
01:06:06,743 --> 01:06:07,843
Together.

1615
01:06:08,183 --> 01:06:11,713
(Her hands work faster than usual.)

1616
01:06:12,153 --> 01:06:13,922
(Seasoning the dish thoroughly)

1617
01:06:13,923 --> 01:06:16,453
(Spilling)

1618
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,753
(It won't be a problem if it ends up being tasty.)

1619
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:21,823
Gosh, my back aches.

1620
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:25,233
(While Jung Ah puts her entire body to work,)

1621
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:29,563
(the youngest members reach the entrance of the village.)

1622
01:06:30,773 --> 01:06:33,072
What? I got a text. I got a text from Kyung Ho.

1623
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,243
- What did he say? - What's this about?

1624
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:37,642
"Ji Yeon, Jung Ah needs to cook seaweed soup."

1625
01:06:37,643 --> 01:06:39,712
"Why don't you tell Jun Myun..."

1626
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:41,583
"that you guys are coming this way?"

1627
01:06:42,013 --> 01:06:43,312
(What does that mean?)

1628
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:44,382
Now?

1629
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:46,752
"Ji Yeon, Jung Ah needs to cook seaweed soup."

1630
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,222
(She reads it again since she doesn't understand.)

1631
01:06:48,223 --> 01:06:50,123
- "Why don't you tell Jun Myun..." - What? It's Ji Yeon.

1632
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:55,692
- It's nice. Actually... Be careful. - What?

1633
01:06:55,693 --> 01:06:57,033
- It's Ji Yeon. - Go.

1634
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:58,592
(What?)

1635
01:06:58,593 --> 01:07:00,262
(She's right.)

1636
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:01,933
(It's Ji Yeon.)

1637
01:07:03,303 --> 01:07:04,472
(The younger members and Jun Myun meet on a singular path.)

1638
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:05,872
- It's nice. Actually... Be careful. - What?

1639
01:07:05,873 --> 01:07:07,203
- It's Ji Yeon. - Go.

1640
01:07:07,443 --> 01:07:08,472
Hold on.

1641
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:11,043
(This situation wasn't in the scenario.)

1642
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:12,372
What should we do? Hold on.

1643
01:07:12,373 --> 01:07:14,143
(A cake is riding in the back.)

1644
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:16,312
- Go. - I mean...

1645
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:17,853
(Come here.)

1646
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:22,223
- I'll get off. - Get off.

1647
01:07:22,453 --> 01:07:23,593
Jun Myun!

1648
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:25,223
Jun Myun!

1649
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:27,562
- Did you buy everything? - Yes, we did.

1650
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:29,322
- Did you buy everything? - We bought bread...

1651
01:07:29,323 --> 01:07:31,132
- and coffee. - Okay.

1652
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:32,692
- Drop by at the house. - Let's take a photo.

1653
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:34,103
- Let's take a photo together. - Okay.

1654
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,602
(I need to pass now.)

1655
01:07:36,603 --> 01:07:37,932
- Let's take a photo. - Let's take a photo together.

1656
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:38,973
- Okay. - Okay.

1657
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,802
- Go. - He...

1658
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:43,102
He needs to use the restroom. Go.

1659
01:07:43,103 --> 01:07:45,273
- I'll go to the house. - Okay.

1660
01:07:45,573 --> 01:07:46,773
We'll be back soon.

1661
01:07:47,783 --> 01:07:49,812
(He manages to keep his cool.)

1662
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:52,113
(Panting)

1663
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:55,383
(He quickly drives away.)

1664
01:07:56,383 --> 01:07:57,523
They're here.

1665
01:07:58,393 --> 01:08:01,593
(The cake gets delivered safely.)

1666
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:05,263
We ran into Jun Myun, so Ji Yeon got off...

1667
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,062
to keep her from seeing the cake.

1668
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,233
(Let's hide the cake first.)

1669
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:13,803
(He moves fast despite his shoulder injury.)

1670
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:16,543
(How is the seaweed soup coming along?)

1671
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:20,283
(It's becoming a rich soup.)

1672
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:23,983
(She just needs to add more water and boil over high heat.)

1673
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,323
Become tasty.

1674
01:08:29,253 --> 01:08:31,122
(Team Stroll went to the end of the land.)

1675
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:32,623
That's good.

1676
01:08:33,023 --> 01:08:34,122
All right. Let's go.

1677
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:35,123
- Jun Myun. - Jun Myun.

1678
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:36,322
- You should get a photo taken. - No. It won't be necessary.

1679
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:37,592
- Jun Myun. - It won't be necessary.

1680
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:38,892
- Go ahead. - Follow me.

1681
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:40,833
- Go ahead. - Jun Myun, come on.

1682
01:08:40,963 --> 01:08:42,002
Okay.

1683
01:08:42,003 --> 01:08:43,263
(5 minutes before returning to the house)

1684
01:08:44,073 --> 01:08:46,073
(Jae Wook prepares the speakers.)

1685
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:48,003
I'll go out when you play the music.

1686
01:08:48,403 --> 01:08:49,542
(When Jae Wook plays the music,)

1687
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:50,712
(Jung Ah will appear with seaweed soup.)

1688
01:08:50,713 --> 01:08:51,772
(Loud)

1689
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:53,373
(My goodness)

1690
01:08:53,513 --> 01:08:55,443
Gosh, that was so loud.

1691
01:08:55,813 --> 01:08:58,413
(The loud speakers are ready.)

1692
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:02,423
I hear them.

1693
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:03,723
They're coming.

1694
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,393
They're here.

1695
01:09:06,123 --> 01:09:09,393
(2 minutes before reaching the Fresh House)

1696
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:10,992
(The cake...)

1697
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:13,363
(is set up.)

1698
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:15,462
(Identify something that's wrong with the picture.)

1699
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:17,502
(Answer)

1700
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:18,673
Am I insane?

1701
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:22,643
(Things almost got ruined.)

1702
01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:24,612
- There was someone like that - There was someone like that

1703
01:09:24,613 --> 01:09:28,083
(The birthday set is ready.)

1704
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,783
(The preparations are over.)

1705
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,753
(Come on, Park Jun Myun.)

1706
01:09:38,623 --> 01:09:40,963
(20 seconds until they reach the house)

1707
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:45,263
(Will they be able to fool Jun Myun until the very end?)

1708
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,103
(They arrive at the house.)

1709
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,543
Jae Wook, we're back.

1710
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:56,672
Did you buy coffee?

1711
01:09:56,673 --> 01:09:58,343
(Hush. Jung Ah is inside.)

1712
01:09:58,573 --> 01:10:00,582
- Jung Ah is still sleeping. - Really?

1713
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,012
She must be tired.

1714
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:03,953
I don't think that's it. When I saw her earlier,

1715
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:05,783
she groaned as she woke up.

1716
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:07,523
Let's go to the bench.

1717
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:09,052
- The bench? - If we go inside,

1718
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:11,252
- we'll be too loud. - Really?

1719
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,253
Where's the bread?

1720
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:13,592
- Bread. - Jun Myun, let's eat bread.

1721
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:14,693
- Okay. - Yes.

1722
01:10:14,993 --> 01:10:17,092
Let's have a bread party.

1723
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:19,293
(She has a matchstick ready.)

1724
01:10:19,533 --> 01:10:20,663
Thank you.

1725
01:10:21,803 --> 01:10:23,733
(Checking the location)

1726
01:10:25,573 --> 01:10:26,902
I want cream bread.

1727
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:28,203
(Shall I get moving?)

1728
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:31,643
(Eating the cream bread)

1729
01:10:33,073 --> 01:10:34,183
Come over here and eat.

1730
01:10:34,713 --> 01:10:36,682
- Come. Why are you standing there? - Okay.

1731
01:10:36,683 --> 01:10:38,953
I couldn't use the restroom.

1732
01:10:39,553 --> 01:10:40,723
To be honest,

1733
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:43,082
I'm not in the best condition.

1734
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,153
Go ahead and eat.

1735
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,123
Do you want to take medicine for gas?

1736
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:48,692
(Don't be like that, Kyung Ho.)

1737
01:10:48,693 --> 01:10:49,893
It's okay, Kyung Ho.

1738
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,832
- There's one left. - It's okay.

1739
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:53,862
(Jung Ah continues to wait.)

1740
01:10:53,863 --> 01:10:54,963
Is that your pose...

1741
01:10:55,403 --> 01:10:57,173
for waiting to use the restroom?

1742
01:10:58,203 --> 01:10:59,932
- Not really. - No?

1743
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:00,973
It's just that...

1744
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:04,713
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

1745
01:11:06,973 --> 01:11:08,482
Food that has been cooked by other people is tasty.

1746
01:11:08,483 --> 01:11:10,242
Jun Myun, there's tastier bread.

1747
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:11,383
What's that?

1748
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:15,153
(We prepared tastier bread,)

1749
01:11:16,483 --> 01:11:18,693
(birthday cake.)

1750
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:20,963
What's this?

1751
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:28,933
(Rushing over)

1752
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:30,603
- What's this? My goodness. - What?

1753
01:11:30,903 --> 01:11:32,103
What's this?

1754
01:11:39,413 --> 01:11:40,582
Oh, my.

1755
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:41,913
(Surprised)

1756
01:11:42,743 --> 01:11:43,912
(The birthday set that overcame many hardships enters.)

1757
01:11:43,913 --> 01:11:45,482
The candles shouldn't go out.

1758
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:47,083
(The birthday set that overcame many hardships enters.)

1759
01:11:47,923 --> 01:11:50,283
Oh, my. This is driving me crazy.

1760
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:53,822
Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday

1761
01:11:53,823 --> 01:11:55,623
(After feeling flustered for a moment,)

1762
01:11:57,133 --> 01:12:00,503
(her eyes turn teary.)

1763
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:02,863
- Jun Myun is crying! - Why?

1764
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:05,372
- The candles are going out. - Oh, no.

1765
01:12:05,373 --> 01:12:06,833
- Hurry up. - Hurry up and blow them out.

1766
01:12:07,203 --> 01:12:08,303
Blow them out.

1767
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:10,942
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

1768
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:12,112
- Why... - Happy birthday, dear Jun Myun

1769
01:12:12,113 --> 01:12:13,643
(It definitely is an upbeat situation.)

1770
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:14,912
Make a wish.

1771
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,342
- Gosh. - Why are you crying?

1772
01:12:16,343 --> 01:12:19,583
(But she becomes emotional.)

1773
01:12:22,223 --> 01:12:23,252
Jun Myun.

1774
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:25,523
(Jun Myun, why are you crying?)

1775
01:12:25,593 --> 01:12:27,962
Blow out the candles. Congratulations.

1776
01:12:27,963 --> 01:12:29,463
Jung Ah.

1777
01:12:29,923 --> 01:12:31,762
My birthday isn't until much later.

1778
01:12:31,763 --> 01:12:32,992
(She didn't imagine it...)

1779
01:12:32,993 --> 01:12:34,233
(because her birthday was three days later.)

1780
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:38,373
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1781
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:41,203
Thank you so much.

1782
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:43,073
How cute.

1783
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:45,113
- Gosh, I... - You're crying.

1784
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:47,212
It wasn't yesterday.

1785
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:49,613
It isn't tomorrow. It isn't the day after tomorrow.

1786
01:12:50,483 --> 01:12:53,483
Fresh off the Sea members, thank you.

1787
01:12:54,553 --> 01:12:56,353
Thank you. I love you guys.

1788
01:12:59,193 --> 01:13:01,063
It's no wonder you kept telling me to go out.

1789
01:13:02,193 --> 01:13:03,933
I hated the idea of going out.

1790
01:13:04,133 --> 01:13:06,332
You're so quick-witted.

1791
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,162
You even found the pancake mix yesterday.

1792
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:10,972
We were supposed to turn it...

1793
01:13:10,973 --> 01:13:12,402
- into a cake. - I had bought it instead of a cake.

1794
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,373
Why did you open the drawer?

1795
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:16,742
Earlier, she suddenly said that she wanted cake.

1796
01:13:16,743 --> 01:13:17,772
This is insane.

1797
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:20,713
- Thank you so much. Seriously. - Happy birthday.

1798
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:23,142
I can't believe it. I cried this morning too.

1799
01:13:23,143 --> 01:13:24,283
I'm crying all day long.

1800
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:25,982
Thank you so much.

1801
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:27,783
- We prepared something else. - What is it?

1802
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:33,393
We wanted to give you a present, but there was nothing.

1803
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:36,793
So we wrote a poem each.

1804
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:39,562
We did it yesterday.

1805
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:40,732
(When did they write a poem?)

1806
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:44,473
These poems are nothing grand, but we'll read what we wrote.

1807
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,072
- Please sit down. - Jun Myun, sit down.

1808
01:13:46,073 --> 01:13:48,242
Jun Myun, sit here to listen to the poems.

1809
01:13:48,243 --> 01:13:50,102
Guys, I was so busy making seaweed soup...

1810
01:13:50,103 --> 01:13:51,312
- that I couldn't write a poem. - That's right.

1811
01:13:51,313 --> 01:13:53,572
- Jung Ah, thank you. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1812
01:13:53,573 --> 01:13:54,613
(The seaweed soup is more than enough.)

1813
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,582
Jae Hwa suggested the idea first.

1814
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,013
- I'm the most excited about hers. - No.

1815
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:01,683
- She enjoys writing poems. - No.

1816
01:14:05,523 --> 01:14:06,853
(Nodding)

1817
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:10,293
"Another Name of Yours."

1818
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:13,593
(The feeling-type mode comes on and makes her cry.)

1819
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:19,033
Is Jun Myun your fake name?

1820
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:20,943
Is Jun Myun your fake name?

1821
01:14:21,743 --> 01:14:25,373
Jun Myun, I only read the title.

1822
01:14:26,143 --> 01:14:27,982
(This feeling type's tear ducts are broken.)

1823
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:29,512
- Oh, no. - I'll begin again.

1824
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:30,712
I'm sorry.

1825
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:32,753
(I'm sorry.)

1826
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:34,853
Oh, no.

1827
01:14:35,723 --> 01:14:38,722
- It's so heartwarming. - Oh, no.

1828
01:14:38,723 --> 01:14:40,792
"Another Name of Yours."

1829
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:41,793
(She tries reading it again.)

1830
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:43,293
"Love."

1831
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:48,163
"When I look at you, I realize that I can feel love."

1832
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:50,603
"Cuteness."

1833
01:14:51,373 --> 01:14:53,273
"You make me feel love..."

1834
01:14:53,603 --> 01:14:55,743
"with your cuteness."

1835
01:14:56,903 --> 01:15:00,073
"And one thing I can't miss is your dedication."

1836
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:03,783
"I don't know how you give yourself so selflessly."

1837
01:15:04,953 --> 01:15:07,523
"And today, your name is Blessing."

1838
01:15:08,123 --> 01:15:10,083
"Happy birthday."

1839
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:12,993
"Let's stay together always."

1840
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:16,023
"Your name is Park Jun Myun."

1841
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,902
- It's so cool. - I love you.

1842
01:15:20,903 --> 01:15:22,633
I love you. It was so nice.

1843
01:15:23,763 --> 01:15:25,402
I'll go next.

1844
01:15:25,403 --> 01:15:26,833
(Kyung Ho is up next.)

1845
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:30,403
(Becoming absorbed)

1846
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:32,373
The title is...

1847
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:36,582
"Did You See Her?"

1848
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:37,783
("Did You See Her?" by Yoon Kyung Ho)

1849
01:15:38,213 --> 01:15:40,683
(I can't watch this.)

1850
01:15:41,383 --> 01:15:42,923
"Did you see her?"

1851
01:15:44,223 --> 01:15:46,793
"She faced the rough sea wind with a smile."

1852
01:15:47,393 --> 01:15:49,493
"In the middle of the unfamiliar sea,"

1853
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:52,533
"she harvested oysters without a complaint."

1854
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:56,963
"With her small hands that were bloated..."

1855
01:15:57,063 --> 01:15:58,403
"from shucking oysters..."

1856
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:00,202
"Bloated!"

1857
01:16:00,203 --> 01:16:03,503
"She flicked a bottle cap to avoid doing the dishes."

1858
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:08,043
"Please don't lose."

1859
01:16:08,483 --> 01:16:10,483
"Everyone tried to help,"

1860
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:13,082
"but she lost again..."

1861
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,323
"in a match of rock-paper-scissors for dishwashing."

1862
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:18,092
- That's so funny. - "Is it a sign from the sky?"

1863
01:16:18,093 --> 01:16:19,152
This is driving me crazy.

1864
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:21,393
"She cried due to happiness."

1865
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:23,593
"Did you see Dishwashing Park?"

1866
01:16:24,763 --> 01:16:25,833
That's insane.

1867
01:16:26,693 --> 01:16:29,703
Since I didn't have much time, I rushed through the conclusion.

1868
01:16:30,233 --> 01:16:32,673
"Ah, I saw her."

1869
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:37,673
"The beautiful woman who was hidden behind many nicknames."

1870
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:40,173
"I saw Park Jun Myun."

1871
01:16:41,883 --> 01:16:44,212
Seriously, he's a poet.

1872
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:45,582
- He's a poet. - How cool.

1873
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:47,723
One of my ancestors is...

1874
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:50,253
Kosan Kosan Yoon Seon Do.

1875
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:53,423
He wrote "Eobusasisa."

1876
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:55,963
Yoon Kyung Ho.

1877
01:16:57,123 --> 01:16:58,133
Jae Wook is next.

1878
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:03,833
"Park Jun Myun..."

1879
01:17:04,173 --> 01:17:06,073
- The title is "Park Jun Myun..." - "To Me, You Are."

1880
01:17:07,073 --> 01:17:08,073
That's the title.

1881
01:17:08,074 --> 01:17:09,843
(It's stylish.)

1882
01:17:10,473 --> 01:17:12,012
"You're my seasoning."

1883
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:14,982
(You're my seasoning.)

1884
01:17:14,983 --> 01:17:16,512
"You make my tongue dance."

1885
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:18,513
(You make my tongue dance.)

1886
01:17:18,683 --> 01:17:19,983
"You're my photographer."

1887
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:23,053
"You make me dance before the camera."

1888
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:26,523
"You are my inspiration."

1889
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:30,593
"What kind of inspiration will you give me next?"

1890
01:17:32,593 --> 01:17:33,792
(A praise for Jun Myun)

1891
01:17:33,793 --> 01:17:35,803
- It was a work of art. - It was cool.

1892
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:39,433
This is so funny, sad, and touching, Jung Ah.

1893
01:17:41,103 --> 01:17:43,072
I thought about Jun Myun as I wrote this.

1894
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:44,213
(Last poem)

1895
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:48,643
Title, "She's the Most Charming."

1896
01:17:49,043 --> 01:17:50,883
(She becomes emotional again.)

1897
01:17:51,353 --> 01:17:53,953
"She has many moles on her body."

1898
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:56,523
"They're her moles of charms."

1899
01:17:58,023 --> 01:17:59,353
"Moles of charms."

1900
01:17:59,893 --> 01:18:01,793
"She's like laver."

1901
01:18:02,563 --> 01:18:06,063
"Sometimes, she's simple. Sometimes, she's glossy."

1902
01:18:06,493 --> 01:18:08,802
"She's like laver of Wando."

1903
01:18:08,803 --> 01:18:10,833
(She's like laver of Wando.)

1904
01:18:11,073 --> 01:18:12,972
"She's like an oyster."

1905
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:15,073
(She's like an oyster.)

1906
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,812
"Inside her hard shell is her soft flesh."

1907
01:18:18,813 --> 01:18:21,013
- It's nice. - "She's like an oyster."

1908
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:24,313
"Like laver and oyster,"

1909
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:27,053
"Jun Myun is full of nutrition the more I get to know her."

1910
01:18:27,753 --> 01:18:31,322
"Since I have severe anemia,"

1911
01:18:31,323 --> 01:18:34,023
- "I must eat laver that's is..." - She has severe anemia.

1912
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,592
"I must eat laver that's marine algae..."

1913
01:18:36,593 --> 01:18:38,363
"and oyster that's rich..."

1914
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,862
"in zinc and iron."

1915
01:18:39,863 --> 01:18:41,102
Hold on. Are you reading an encyclopedia?

1916
01:18:41,103 --> 01:18:43,102
(Unexpected information on health)

1917
01:18:43,103 --> 01:18:44,103
That's so funny.

1918
01:18:44,104 --> 01:18:46,433
"Laver and oyster that are essential to me."

1919
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:51,013
"Jun Myun is essential to me like laver and oyster."

1920
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:56,113
"Jun Myun, you're like laver and oyster to us."

1921
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,453
"Happy birthday. We love you."

1922
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:01,423
Thank you.

1923
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:02,483
(Moved)

1924
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:05,423
Thank you. Seriously, I can't believe it.

1925
01:19:05,523 --> 01:19:07,563
I can't believe it.

1926
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:09,993
Thank you so much.

1927
01:19:10,363 --> 01:19:12,262
- I didn't even imagine this. - It was fun.

1928
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,292
I can't believe it.

1929
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:15,403
The past 3 days and 2 nights have been nerve-racking.

1930
01:19:16,033 --> 01:19:17,972
Gosh, stop crying.

1931
01:19:17,973 --> 01:19:20,602
I want to stop crying. What's up with me today since this morning?

1932
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:22,572
Jun Myun, eat some bread and seaweed soup.

1933
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:24,342
- Jung Ah made it. - You should eat the seaweed soup.

1934
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,343
My goodness.

1935
01:19:26,113 --> 01:19:27,942
Thank you so much, Jung Ah.

1936
01:19:27,943 --> 01:19:30,613
- How cute. - I've never received such a gift.

1937
01:19:30,713 --> 01:19:35,253
Seriously. I've never received such a birthday present in my life.

1938
01:19:36,123 --> 01:19:38,993
Jung Ah, the seaweed soup is tasty. It's so tasty.

1939
01:19:39,093 --> 01:19:40,793
Jung Ah, thank you so much.

1940
01:19:42,623 --> 01:19:43,792
(Sobbing and laughing)

1941
01:19:43,793 --> 01:19:44,932
What's funny this time?

1942
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:48,502
(She laughed until she cried.)

1943
01:19:48,503 --> 01:19:50,702
I couldn't finish my poem.

1944
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:51,732
(Jung Ah couldn't finish her acrostic poem.)

1945
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:55,003
"People, clap and wish Jun Myun a happy birthday,"

1946
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,772
- She got stuck at M. - "Just a little food got prepared,"

1947
01:19:58,773 --> 01:20:00,273
"but let's have fun."

1948
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:02,413
M.

1949
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:07,653
Meanwhile... I tried to think of a word.

1950
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,752
- "Meanwhile." - She said that nothing worked.

1951
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:14,253
You know, it was nice. The house was rowdy.

1952
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:17,163
It was so nice to have friends over.

1953
01:20:19,263 --> 01:20:21,763
(2 weeks later)

1954
01:20:24,673 --> 01:20:27,472
(Early morning)

1955
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:30,103
(One village in Boryeong)

1956
01:20:31,543 --> 01:20:35,413
(Everyone is still asleep.)

1957
01:20:35,883 --> 01:20:39,813
(One person walks down the quiet country road.)

1958
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:52,033
(The four siblings are fast asleep.)

1959
01:20:53,093 --> 01:20:56,403
(A mysterious woman visits the Fresh House.)

1960
01:20:58,133 --> 01:20:59,572
(Peeking)

1961
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:01,803
Hello.

1962
01:21:03,243 --> 01:21:05,873
(The third guest, Actress Kim Hye Yoon)

1963
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:08,382
(Keeping her steps quiet,)

1964
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:10,743
(she approaches the door.)

1965
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:14,423
(Tiptoeing)

1966
01:21:17,383 --> 01:21:19,393
(She infiltrates the house stealthily.)

1967
01:21:20,253 --> 01:21:23,823
(It's quiet inside the house.)

1968
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:34,903
(She checks out the women's room first.)

1969
01:21:42,343 --> 01:21:44,453
(Tossing and turning)

1970
01:21:51,093 --> 01:21:54,193
(She goes back to sleep.)

1971
01:21:56,793 --> 01:21:59,533
(She calms her heart.)

1972
01:22:04,163 --> 01:22:06,573
(Mom)

1973
01:22:10,873 --> 01:22:12,013
What?

1974
01:22:14,343 --> 01:22:16,513
(Hye Yoon!)

1975
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:18,183
Hello.

1976
01:22:18,853 --> 01:22:21,053
Hye Yoon, what are you doing here?

1977
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,153
(What?)

1978
01:22:24,723 --> 01:22:26,522
(Did Jung Ah's daughter visit early in the morning?)

1979
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:28,893
(Hye Yoon is coming to the show.)
