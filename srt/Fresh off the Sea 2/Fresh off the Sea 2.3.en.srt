1
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,904
(The four siblings caught...)

2
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,275
(the fresh seasonal ingredients.)

3
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,445
(They poured in the ingredients.)

4
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,115
(Then they stir-fried them.)

5
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:26,795
It looks like a restaurant dish.

6
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:30,485
(The stylish youngest member debuted as a sashimi slicer.)

7
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,195
(Ji Yeon became a rookie assistant.)

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,025
You failed.

9
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,094
That's... No!

10
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:39,394
(In that case, )

11
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,235
(how about this?)

12
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:42,595
No.

13
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,605
(The third sibling will continue to challenge herself in cooking.)

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,834
(The 4 siblings' 1st seasonal meal)

15
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:50,374
- It's unbelievable. - It's unbelievable.

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,545
It's fresh!

17
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:53,475
(This is it!)

18
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,515
(The first dinner was peaceful.)

19
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:59,685
(But an announcement broke their peace!)

20
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:04,484
(We're going to Daegwallyeong tomorrow.)

21
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,354
(A pollack drying yard...)

22
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,255
(that's 26,446m² big)

23
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,125
(What awaited the four siblings...)

24
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,794
(were the netherworld of pollack...)

25
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,494
(and...)

26
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:16,935
Do they really not know?

27
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:21,135
(The world-renowned star who visited secretly, Lee Jung Jae)

28
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:23,245
How should I surprise them?

29
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:27,145
(What's Jung Jae's plan to fool the four siblings?)

30
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,285
This must be the place.

31
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:31,944
- Is this the place? - Yes.

32
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,015
(Is this the place?)

33
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,655
- This is the place. - Look from here to the end.

34
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:40,825
(It's so long that you can't see the end.)

35
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,365
(Shocked)

36
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:48,264
The pollacks stretch to the bottom.

37
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:49,435
This is unbelievable.

38
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:54,135
(The family's car enters the white field of snow.)

39
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:58,375
Shouldn't we move around in a car?

40
00:01:58,605 --> 00:01:59,945
We're here.

41
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:03,415
(Feeling shocked by the scale, they get off the car.)

42
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,684
(A field of snow is stretched out before them.)

43
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,385
My goodness.

44
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:15,155
Jung Ah, I can't see the end.

45
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:18,224
I never thought that I'd come to a pollack drying yard.

46
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,994
I want to know how many pollacks are getting dried.

47
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,334
How did they hang up all of those pollacks?

48
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,695
(The place is about 26,446m² big.)

49
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,434
I never thought that the pollacks would overwhelm us.

50
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,075
- Seriously. - Isn't it overwhelming?

51
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:30,175
- The pollacks overwhelmed us. - The pollacks overwhelmed us.

52
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,374
I underestimated the pollacks.

53
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,815
This is no joke.

54
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,175
How...

55
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:37,815
(My goodness)

56
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,925
Gosh, it must be freezing since the snow doesn't melt.

57
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,554
It's so cold here.

58
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:50,695
I know.

59
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,595
(Hold on a second.)

60
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:57,004
(Looking around)

61
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,934
- Hello. - Hello.

62
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,005
(Is there a guest?)

63
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:04,304
- Hello. - Hello.

64
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:05,944
(People are working busily at the pollack drying yard.)

65
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,715
- Hello. - Hello.

66
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,685
I'm Song Ho Seob, the owner of the pollack drying yard.

67
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:12,844
Hello.

68
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,715
- Hello. - Hello.

69
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,324
Daegwallyeong...

70
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,555
is the coldest place in Gangwon Province.

71
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,995
That's why it produces the tastiest pollacks.

72
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,794
The pollacks don't come out right unless it's cold.

73
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:28,355
(They endure the rough winds and snow.)

74
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,204
The fresh fish must get dried...

75
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,975
as they freeze and thaw repeatedly.

76
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:36,945
(Then they become the tender and plump pollacks.)

77
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,944
(Daegwallyeong is nature's fridge, )

78
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:40,715
(so it's perfect for drying the pollacks.)

79
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,744
(Thus, the four siblings' task of the day is...)

80
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,785
(hanging up the pollacks.)

81
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:51,355
(It might seem like an easy task.)

82
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,954
(But you need to bend down 60 times...)

83
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,424
(to fill up a log with 120 pollacks.)

84
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,194
For every log you fill up,

85
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,834
you'll receive four dollars.

86
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,095
- Four dollars? - Four dollars?

87
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,504
(4 dollars per log)

88
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:08,405
(It's an arbitrary wage that's different from the usual.)

89
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:12,775
(Come to think of it.)

90
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:20,785
(Workers are hanging up the pollacks here and there.)

91
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:35,165
(One man looks suspicious.)

92
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,875
(Lee Jung Jae, pollack drying yard worker)

93
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:46,305
(He put a lot of effort into the disguise.)

94
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:50,945
(He works like an experienced worker.)

95
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:54,555
(A delicate touch)

96
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:58,125
(Actually, )

97
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:02,924
(when the four siblings arrived, )

98
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:10,135
(Jung Jae was by their side from the start.)

99
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,575
(Jung Ah's view)

100
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,335
(He didn't seem out of place.)

101
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,975
(His disguise and touches were perfect, )

102
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:24,945
(so they didn't recognize him despite the close distance.)

103
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,654
(Not knowing about the guest, the siblings focus on the work.)

104
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:29,855
Let's give it a go.

105
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,724
All right. Let's delve into it.

106
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,205
(Four siblings, let's delve into it!)

107
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:37,165
(Glancing over)

108
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,834
(Hiding behind the pollacks, he studies them.)

109
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,435
(Jung Ah and Jun Myun take care of the 1st floor.)

110
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:45,335
Jae Wook, go up there and give me a hand.

111
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:48,075
(Hopping)

112
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,644
Hold on.

113
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,674
Good.

114
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,745
(Human crane)

115
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,044
Ji Yeon, isn't the floor slippery?

116
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,545
- Is it okay? - It's okay.

117
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:02,115
(The four siblings get ready to work.)

118
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:05,925
(Jung Jae gets ready to surprise them.)

119
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:10,265
(Hiding his face with the pollacks)

120
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:12,495
All right.

121
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,694
Lift it up on your side.

122
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:16,805
(The youngest members puts up a log first.)

123
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:20,005
(Then they open a pack of pollacks.)

124
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:22,835
But...

125
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,675
Is this how you hang them up?

126
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,744
(Cheating)

127
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,674
Ji Yeon, adjust the gap.

128
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:30,885
I'll hang them up quickly.

129
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,754
(When Jae Wook hangs up the pollacks, )

130
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,785
(Ji Yeon adjusts the gap.)

131
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:39,285
(They divide up the tasks on the 2nd floor.)

132
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:42,524
(The siblings hang up the pollacks without talking.)

133
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:45,195
(Jung Jae)

134
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:49,465
(Jung Jae waits for the right time with bated breath.)

135
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,205
(Things are disorderly.)

136
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:57,144
(Is this the time?)

137
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,405
(Hiding)

138
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:05,485
(Jun Myun suddenly comes near Jung Jae.)

139
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:09,485
(She looks around the drying yard carefully.)

140
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:14,755
(Red light, green light)

141
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:21,265
(I'll hang up the pollacks.)

142
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,475
(Nervous)

143
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:32,575
(Red light, green light)

144
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:37,615
(The game suddenly begins in the middle of the drying yard.)

145
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,255
(Glancing over)

146
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,695
Come on in.

147
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,524
(Turning off the Young Hee mode)

148
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,395
Where are the pollacks?

149
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:52,664
(She's only interested in the pollacks.)

150
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,935
- Will we get them? - Yes.

151
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:57,705
(Young Hee gets back to work.)

152
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:04,005
(The four siblings begin to hang up the pollacks in earnest.)

153
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:09,045
(I really need to do it now.)

154
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,244
(Everyone...)

155
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,485
(is focused on work.)

156
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:21,695
(It's time to surprise them.)

157
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,425
Don't hang them up there!

158
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,665
- Freeze! - What?

159
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,205
- Freeze! - What's going on?

160
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,004
Freeze!

161
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,445
(Freeze.)

162
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,945
(What's going on?)

163
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:42,545
Freeze!

164
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,245
- What? - Freeze!

165
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:46,684
(Jung Jae!)

166
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,685
(Who do we have here?)

167
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,725
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

168
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,354
(Lee Jung Jae, Actor...)

169
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,524
(and pollack drying yard worker)

170
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,464
(What is he doing here?)

171
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,895
(Jung Jae, your prank was too much.)

172
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,805
Freeze!

173
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,975
I can't believe it.

174
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:10,844
- Hello, I'm a fan. - It's nice to meet you.

175
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:13,915
(Jun Myun's face suddenly turns red.)

176
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,445
I had no idea. Hello.

177
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:18,385
(It's nice to meet you.)

178
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:19,485
It's nice to meet you.

179
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:22,885
(Is this a TV or a pollack drying yard?)

180
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:25,031
Jae Wook, is it your first time meeting Jung Jae?

181
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,325
Yes, it's my first time.

182
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:29,995
I can't believe it.

183
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:31,794
(Moved)

184
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,195
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

185
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,364
Gosh, my nose is runny.

186
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,534
- Yes. It'll keep being that way. - It'll be insane.

187
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:41,604
(You can't underestimate the coldness of Daegwallyeong.)

188
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,035
- You're working hard. - Yes.

189
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,944
You startled me. I can't believe it.

190
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,914
(Not even coldness and a runny nose could stop his mischievousness.)

191
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,444
- "Freeze!" - Hey.

192
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,945
- Hey. - Jung Jae, when did you arrive?

193
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:55,115
I arrived in the morning.

194
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:56,454
I arrived in the morning.

195
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,455
You began hanging up the pollacks right away.

196
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,854
(Mr. Pollack is meticulous.)

197
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,025
That's so funny.

198
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,024
(Until he yelled "Freeze,")

199
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,124
Freeze!

200
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,295
(Jung Jae filled up a log with pollacks.)

201
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,664
My goodness.

202
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:10,665
(By the way)

203
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,835
Hang them up.

204
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:15,134
- I can't believe it. - Do you guys work every day?

205
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:16,174
- Every day. - Every day?

206
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,455
We do different tasks every day.

207
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,144
(Fresh Labor Troupe)

208
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,814
- Gosh. - Every day is a different job.

209
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:21,815
This is no joke.

210
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,484
(Joining in naturally)

211
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,545
They told me that I had to go to Gangwon Province.

212
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:28,884
I was wondering what they would make me do.

213
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:30,925
So you came without even knowing what the work was.

214
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,595
I only ever saw you in a tuxedo.

215
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,975
This is a whole new side of you.

216
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:39,495
Is that outfit really supposed to look cool?

217
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:40,795
I don't know.

218
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:46,365
(He quietly works as Mr. Pollack, wearing a chestnut hat.)

219
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:49,975
(Thinking)

220
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,445
(Feeling awkward)

221
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:54,775
I am Park Jun Myun.

222
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,014
- Of course, I know you. - It is truly an honor.

223
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,045
Not at all.

224
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:01,331
- Nice to meet you. - It is my first time meeting you.

225
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,924
Right. We could have met before.

226
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,425
- Yes. - I know.

227
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:07,594
And here we are, meeting at a pollack drying field.

228
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,595
(Of all places, we meet at the drying field.)

229
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:13,535
(Passing by)

230
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,395
(Excuse me, Avocado.)

231
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,535
I mean...

232
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,905
If there are three women,

233
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:26,845
it might be a bit...

234
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,396
uncomfortable for Jae Wook, like when using the bathroom.

235
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,845
We don't distinguish between men and women anymore.

236
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,924
- We don't distinguish anymore. - No more distinction?

237
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,454
(We are just one family.)

238
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,454
It might feel a little awkward at first,

239
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,165
but you'll warm up in no time.

240
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,195
(The Fresh members are getting along with no divide.)

241
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,665
(Meanwhile, they are busy hanging pollack on the 2nd floor.)

242
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,975
(Clearing a box in a flash)

243
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,675
Well...

244
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:01,475
Mr. Freeze.

245
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:03,885
Mr. Freeze.

246
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,784
- Mr. Freeze. - Yes?

247
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,284
Could you put up some pollacks?

248
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,285
Okay.

249
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,725
"I have done this task before."

250
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,165
(Laughing)

251
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:21,534
(Pollack requested from the 2nd floor)

252
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,435
Oh, my.

253
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,904
- Gosh. - Thank you.

254
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:26,905
(Delivering)

255
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:28,605
(Rubbing his nose)

256
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,045
I should bring this up, too.

257
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,985
(It's heavy enough to make even an adult man struggle.)

258
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:42,355
- Gosh. - Thank you.

259
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:48,855
(The youngest members get back to work after the pollack delivery.)

260
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,595
They are really working hard.

261
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:56,495
Oh, my.

262
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,505
(Gathering strength)

263
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:05,875
Gosh, I messed up.

264
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,274
Jung Jae.

265
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,515
(Feeling sorry)

266
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:11,314
I should do this here.

267
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,995
(The torn box goes down to the 1st floor.)

268
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:15,214
(Another box is delivered.)

269
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,085
- Thank you. - Thank you.

270
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,925
(Tossing the empty box)

271
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,325
(Dragging along)

272
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,394
Everyone is really working hard.

273
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:32,334
(Hard workers on the 1st floor)

274
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:33,364
They really do work hard.

275
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:34,935
- Look. - Okay.

276
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:38,705
We get four dollars for each log like this.

277
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:39,905
- Four dollars? - Yes.

278
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,545
At four dollars each, well...

279
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:45,791
- That should cover some groceries. - Of course. We can buy it.

280
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:48,955
(With one log done, they earn 4 dollars.)

281
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:53,055
(Rolling the next log)

282
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:54,455
Let's start.

283
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:57,365
(Opening the next box)

284
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:00,864
Let's hang it here.

285
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,064
(Hanging two by two neatly)

286
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,065
Okay.

287
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,904
(Hanging the pollack)

288
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,975
(Hanging more)

289
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:17,285
(Endless cycle)

290
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:19,985
Make sure it doesn't fall.

291
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,254
- Yes. - I'll give it to you.

292
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,175
(It takes hanging 120 fish to complete one log.)

293
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:29,925
You don't talk much. You just work so hard.

294
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,525
Is it because you need to make four dollars quickly?

295
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:35,365
Yes.

296
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:39,764
(The head of the household is serious about earning money.)

297
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,935
- But... - We should finish the work quickly.

298
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,255
We need to finish quickly and go have some fun.

299
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,275
(Fresh members work hard and play hard.)

300
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,615
(The 2nd floor is working hard, too.)

301
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:56,985
(Time for a quick dive into the pollack magic)

302
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:02,395
(Hanging the pollack)

303
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:07,035
(Jae Wook is picking up the tempo.)

304
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,535
(Even as it speeds up, the spacing remains consistent.)

305
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,181
- You're quite good at this, right? - What?

306
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,405
You are quite good at this.

307
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,575
- I think this suits me. - Exactly.

308
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,475
(Staring at the pollack non-stop)

309
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:25,015
You somehow look like a pollack, don't you?

310
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,825
- You're quite good at this, right? - What?

311
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,035
You are quite good at this.

312
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,245
- I think this suits me. - Exactly.

313
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,115
(Staring at the pollack non-stop)

314
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,645
You somehow look like a pollack, don't you?

315
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,115
- What? - Nothing.

316
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:42,955
What did you just say?

317
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,424
You think I look like a pollack?

318
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,895
(They are always too busy teasing each other.)

319
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:52,094
You know, I was a bit slimmer when I got off the boat yesterday.

320
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:53,934
You looked exactly like this back then.

321
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:55,655
- I looked like a pollack, didn't I? - Yes.

322
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,365
You really looked like this.

323
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,005
(Like this?)

324
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,475
(When you feel seasick, look at Pollack Wook for a moment.)

325
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:06,775
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

326
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,575
Doesn't it look like Jae Wook?

327
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,965
Where can you find such a handsome pollack?

328
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:13,184
- Oh, my. Jung Ah. - Gosh.

329
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,254
(The oldest is always on the youngest's side.)

330
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,455
You are so reliable.

331
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,685
You're the only one on my side.

332
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:23,295
Should you be thankful or not when eating pollacks from now on?

333
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,371
Now, whenever I eat pollacks, all I can think of is you.

334
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,894
I know. How could we ever forget this moment?

335
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:29,215
We'll think of this day every time we eat pollacks, right?

336
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:32,735
It's not that. It's because you said I looked like a pollack.

337
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:34,604
What are you talking about?

338
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,105
(What are you talking about?)

339
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,875
If we do this, it'll be three boxes now.

340
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:42,715
Do we have to calculate that, too?

341
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:45,045
Is there no one to calculate it for us?

342
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,215
We have to calculate it with each other.

343
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,385
Thoroughly.

344
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,795
Are you worried you'll miss out? Or get less?

345
00:16:55,595 --> 00:17:00,425
(Thoroughly drying pollack on the 1st floor)

346
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,705
(The total work on the 1st floor amounts to 24 dollars.)

347
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:11,275
(Entering the 2nd floor after the work on the 1st floor)

348
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:12,405
They are going up.

349
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:15,844
(They came up next to the youngest.)

350
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:16,845
Hold on.

351
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,485
I'm scared.

352
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,485
(Being careful)

353
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:23,785
I'm scared.

354
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,955
(Jung Jae is escorting the next in line.)

355
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:28,025
Thank you.

356
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,854
Do you prefer climbing up with your knees?

357
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,224
- Yes, I can do it. - Okay.

358
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,595
(Crawling up)

359
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:37,365
(Crawling slowly)

360
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,404
Thank you.

361
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,334
(Climbing successfully)

362
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:43,335
Are you okay?

363
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,405
We are okay.

364
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:48,675
(Fresh members met on the 2nd floor.)

365
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:51,815
(He is now familiar with hanging the pollack.)

366
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,061
I'll organize the pollack and give it to you.

367
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,785
(Taking out the pollack to hang easily)

368
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,984
(Receiving it)

369
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:59,585
(Hanging it)

370
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,955
(Speeding up with division of labor)

371
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,324
(Pollack machine in motion)

372
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,494
(Giving it)

373
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,795
(Hanging it)

374
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:10,194
(Giving it)

375
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:11,505
(Hanging it)

376
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:16,375
(The work speed has increased thanks to Jung Jae.)

377
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,904
One box cleared.

378
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:20,051
(Leader Yum gets excited as the speed picks up.)

379
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,075
(Exiting)

380
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,685
I think we can start pushing it.

381
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,385
(A stick is completed in an instant.)

382
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:32,085
(But...)

383
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:33,984
(Sighing)

384
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,095
- Give it here. - Yes.

385
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:37,525
(Groaning)

386
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,664
(The sounds of pain keep slipping out.)

387
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,665
(Groaning)

388
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:46,465
Seriously...

389
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,175
- This is going to be painful. - Yes.

390
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,105
Is there any hurt pollack?

391
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,005
Gosh.

392
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,815
(Communication errors due to fatigue)

393
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,815
- These are moves I'm not used to. - Your muscles might hurt.

394
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:04,455
(It's a tiring task that requires constantly bending the waist.)

395
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:06,755
Here.

396
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,195
It's getting hot.

397
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,965
(Taking off the jacket)

398
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:18,735
(Thanks to Jung Jae the human hinge, they're working much faster.)

399
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:21,035
We're working very fast right now.

400
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,245
It's because Jung Jae is handing us the pollacks.

401
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:25,895
That's why we're working so fast.

402
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,305
- We're done. Let's push. - We're done?

403
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,444
(They finished four logs in no time.)

404
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:32,684
All right.

405
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,585
(How many did they finish?)

406
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:38,754
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You did eight logs.

407
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,924
(The youngest siblings are working on their eighth log.)

408
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,755
You know, 4 times 8 is 32. They made 32 dollars.

409
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:44,595
How many did we do down there?

410
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,995
Maybe eight. Nine, ten, eleven,

411
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,165
twelve.

412
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,794
(Doing the math)

413
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,305
Gosh, we have a long way to go.

414
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,804
- I... - How much is your goal?

415
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,375
I want to make pork backbone stew today.

416
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,745
(The reason Jung Ah was in such a rush)

417
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,814
- Pork backbone stew? - Yes.

418
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,045
We have to buy pork backbones.

419
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,415
That sounds great.

420
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,354
(The more they work, )

421
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:15,255
(the better the pork backbone stew will be.)

422
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,295
Hang the pollacks. Let's get rich today.

423
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:21,165
- We'll splurge on gummies, okay? - Okay.

424
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:24,235
We have to work hard to eat gummies.

425
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:27,305
(For pork backbone stew, )

426
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:32,505
(they diligently hang the pollacks.)

427
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,855
As we get more exhausted, we're not saying anything.

428
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:38,945
Gosh, this isn't easy.

429
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,955
Come and eat snacks.

430
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,185
- Are you okay? - Yes.

431
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:45,224
- Snacks? - Yes.

432
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,455
(Let's take a break while eating snacks.)

433
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,995
These are steamed buns. Aren't these steamed buns?

434
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:53,695
(Today's snack is served in the cold at the pollack drying field.)

435
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,835
(Steamed buns are winter's signature snack.)

436
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,474
(With cups of buckwheat tea to warm their bodies)

437
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,505
Gosh.

438
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,674
(The main dish of today's snack)

439
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:07,715
Okay.

440
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:11,514
It's potato ongsimi.

441
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:13,796
(Potato ongsimi made with potatoes from Gangwon Province)

442
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,485
"Freeze!" Whose idea was it?

443
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,365
Did you come up with it on your own?

444
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,154
I was so...

445
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,995
I was startled when he yelled all of a sudden.

446
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:27,895
- I was like, "Why is he..." - What?

447
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:31,204
I thought it was the foreman.

448
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,965
- I thought it was the foreman too. - Right.

449
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,405
(Proud)

450
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,535
Do you cook?

451
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,045
No, I don't.

452
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:43,415
I can make a dish that's typical of a single man living alone.

453
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:45,115
What is it?

454
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:47,005
Just throwing this and that into a pot.

455
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,485
- Just throwing in everything? - Yes.

456
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:50,814
- Like in ramyeon. - Yes.

457
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:51,955
(Jae Wook can relate.)

458
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:54,995
- Give us an example. - For example,

459
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,494
sometimes, my mother...

460
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,364
brings me the seaweed soup she made.

461
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:04,094
In there I put potatoes, broccoli, carrots...

462
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:05,235
In seaweed soup?

463
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,665
That's amazing.

464
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:09,634
And tofu. I throw in everything I have in the fridge.

465
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:10,635
- In seaweed soup? - Yes.

466
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:11,704
Does it taste all right?

467
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,845
Well, I'm not eating it for the taste.

468
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:16,375
(I just eat to eat.)

469
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,644
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

470
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:19,714
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

471
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,885
Thank you for the food.

472
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:24,031
- Thank you for the food. - This is going to be good.

473
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:26,125
(She takes a bite of the chewy potato ongsimi.)

474
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:29,195
(The youngest takes a bite of it too.)

475
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,565
(Savoring it)

476
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,965
(The potato ongsimi is even warming up Mr. Freeze.)

477
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:43,435
Gosh, the ongsimi is good.

478
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:46,045
The texture is very chewy.

479
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,975
- It's chewy. - It's chewy.

480
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,615
(Gosh)

481
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,484
It was cold last night.

482
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:58,285
(He takes another bite with a piece of refreshing and crunchy kimchi.)

483
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:03,695
(The warm soup is melting the cold away.)

484
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:08,035
(She takes a bite of a steamed bun with sweet red bean paste inside.)

485
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:10,494
(The youngest is eating a steamed bun too.)

486
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:12,235
(Frozen)

487
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,505
(But he's frozen in place next to Mr. Freeze.)

488
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,815
Are you happy you get to sit next to Jung Jae?

489
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:18,945
(Yes!)

490
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,145
(Chuckling)

491
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,015
Do you know how old he is?

492
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:23,745
(Let me think.)

493
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:24,845
Is he 28?

494
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,715
(What?)

495
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:28,254
(Mr. Freeze guessed my age correctly!)

496
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:29,355
Are you 28?

497
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:31,285
- I'm 28. - Are you 28?

498
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:34,395
(My guess was correct.)

499
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,624
(Thanks to the eldest, )

500
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,825
(the youngest and Jung Jae were able to break the ice.)

501
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:43,995
(Meanwhile, Ji Yeon is using both hands to eat her steamed bun.)

502
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:48,635
(Jung Jae is eating everything together at Fresh off the Sea too.)

503
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,975
(He's eating his steamed bun with spicy radish salad.)

504
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,544
I'm looking forward to the pork backbone stew.

505
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:02,515
Gosh, I'm going to have to do a good job.

506
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:06,025
(Glancing over at Jun Myun)

507
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,525
(Stealing from Jun Myun's soup)

508
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,695
Gosh, why are you stealing from my soup?

509
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,094
(Laughing)

510
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,895
(Stealing makes the soup taste even better.)

511
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,334
(Once a thief, always a thief.)

512
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:20,005
(Glaring)

513
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:22,934
(The avocado is ripening.)

514
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,475
- Gosh. - What happened?

515
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:27,675
She keeps stealing my shiitake mushrooms.

516
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,715
Here, take these.

517
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:31,784
She stole from me yesterday too.

518
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:33,885
- She took my bean sprouts. - Right.

519
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,485
(It turns out this isn't her first time stealing.)

520
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,375
Where are we going for our outing tomorrow?

521
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:40,524
There's this place in Sokcho,

522
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:43,055
- with a Ferris wheel. - I see.

523
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:45,425
- In the group chat... - Wait.

524
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,834
It's not like that. I mean...

525
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:49,895
I think Sokcho will be crowded tomorrow.

526
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:52,515
Are you going to go dressed like this?

527
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,635
(The avocado is happy.)

528
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:56,935
Obviously, we'll be dressing up tomorrow.

529
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,244
You said you wouldn't dress up.

530
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:00,245
(Don't stop me!)

531
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,744
Did everyone bring outfits to dress up in?

532
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:05,121
- We'll be dressing up to an extent. - We'll be wearing jeans.

533
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:06,285
It's only to an extent.

534
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:07,714
Our only option is to wear jeans.

535
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:08,755
(Tomorrow, we wear jeans.)

536
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:12,225
Couples usually share a kiss there.

537
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:15,095
Why would they go all the way there to kiss? They can do that anywhere.

538
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:20,225
(Jung Ah is way ahead of Jun Myun.)

539
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:23,294
I think this was the easiest work I had to do on this show so far.

540
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:24,864
- Really? - You think so?

541
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,504
- Out of all the work we had to do. - Out of everything?

542
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:29,111
(Is today's work easy even for Grasshopper Jun Myun?)

543
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:31,135
- Right now, I... - My back hurts so much, though.

544
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,174
- It's because... - I kept doing this.

545
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:36,374
Jung Jae did all the work and just handed the fish to us.

546
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,514
He put all the strings,

547
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:39,484
- so all we had to do was hang them. - All we had to do was hang them.

548
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,944
Jung Ah, I realize that we...

549
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,255
How is this a variety show?

550
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:45,484
Jung Jae even helped us out with our box of pollack.

551
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,054
This feels like a documentary show where you experience different jobs.

552
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:50,395
- He really did all the hard parts. - Right.

553
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,895
- If it were just us... - I take back what I said.

554
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:55,835
(Exhausted smile)

555
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:59,265
I didn't know that hat could look so cool.

556
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:00,535
What?

557
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:03,134
- Right? He looks so cool. - I thought you wouldn't have hats,

558
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,674
- so I actually brought four more. - Really?

559
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,404
- Gosh. - Then why don't we...

560
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:08,291
all wear that hat when we go to Sokcho tomorrow?

561
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:09,315
(Excited)

562
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,551
- That sounds great. - I have them over there.

563
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:12,415
I want to wear it too then.

564
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,154
- Gosh. - Gosh.

565
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,155
(Jung Jae brought hats for the Fresh members.)

566
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,454
- They're all different colors. - My goodness.

567
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:19,024
- They're all different colors. - Gosh.

568
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:20,455
This is so cute.

569
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:23,194
- There's a dark one too. - I want the black one.

570
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,224
(Jung Jae prepared different colors for them.)

571
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:25,294
This one?

572
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,564
(They open Jung Jae's gift.)

573
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:27,695
This is cute.

574
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:29,915
- Gosh, it's so cute. - This is cute.

575
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,434
I'm going to try it on right now.

576
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,195
(They excitedly put the hats on right away.)

577
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,735
(Ji Yeon looks like a golden retriever.)

578
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,675
Thank you.

579
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,645
They will at least keep you warm.

580
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:44,414
- It's nice. - It's really warm.

581
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:45,514
I can't believe you brought these for us.

582
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,315
(Moved)

583
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,254
(Surprised)

584
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,815
I think it suits you the most.

585
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:52,354
He says it suits you the most.

586
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:53,584
I can pull off most things.

587
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:55,345
(Jun Myun looks amazingly good in the hat..)

588
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,695
- It's very warm. - I love it.

589
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,064
- It's warm. - It's warm.

590
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:00,801
(Now that they've become united over the hats, )

591
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:01,995
Let's get back to work.

592
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:04,835
(it's time to go hang the pollack again.)

593
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:07,834
- What do you want to do? - Jung Jae should...

594
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,975
- join the younger members. - The ladder...

595
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,175
(Jung Jae and Jae Wook hold the ladder in place.)

596
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,545
- You got this, right? - Of course.

597
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:17,375
We got this.

598
00:27:19,745 --> 00:27:21,385
- We have to put one up, right? - Yes.

599
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:23,554
(About 20kg)

600
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:25,255
Make one side shorter.

601
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,485
Let's move it more toward that side.

602
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,594
All right. This is good. Let's pull it closer to us...

603
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:31,865
so we can work comfortably.

604
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,265
We can push it back later.

605
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,805
(Mr. Freeze and the younger members climb up to the 2nd floor too.)

606
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:41,375
(They're now ready to hang the pollack.)

607
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:44,405
(They're diligently hanging the pollack on the bar.)

608
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,174
(Glancing at Jung Jae)

609
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:50,845
(Jae Wook can't help but look at Jung Jae.)

610
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:55,155
It feels weird to hang pollacks with Jung Jae.

611
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:56,384
You're right.

612
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,514
(Laughing)

613
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:59,195
I'd never even imagined this could happen.

614
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:02,485
(The person they're talking about is calmly doing his work.)

615
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:05,624
Jung Jae, isn't this your first time being on a show like this?

616
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,594
- What? - As an international star,

617
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,534
you're used to traveling abroad to promote your work.

618
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:12,465
How does it feel to be hanging pollacks here?

619
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:14,365
I have to leave on Sunday.

620
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,305
I'm flying to Milan.

621
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:20,804
(Milan)

622
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:22,715
(A week from now)

623
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:25,984
(Daegwallyeong)

624
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:27,645
(Present)

625
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:31,484
(Jung Jae is spending quality time with the Daegwallyeong pollack.)

626
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:33,985
(Happy)

627
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:35,455
We're working really fast.

628
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,124
- Right. - Because there are three people.

629
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,394
Having a third person here...

630
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:40,635
- makes us work faster. - Because there are three of us.

631
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:43,411
(The two older members are working smoothly too.)

632
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:44,634
(Glancing over)

633
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,405
Gosh, they already finished two logs.

634
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:49,775
Having a third person to hand out the pollack is...

635
00:28:50,935 --> 00:28:53,375
This was easier for us when Jung Jae was helping us out.

636
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:55,385
- We have to bend down ourselves. - Right.

637
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,545
(Mr. Freeze, your absence is making us appreciate you even more.)

638
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,085
(Let's hang some dried pollack.)

639
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:07,685
("Pollack" by Kang San Eh)

640
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,125
(With the cold wind of Daegwallyeong on their faces)

641
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:11,765
(Sniffling)

642
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,865
(They repeatedly bend down...)

643
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:27,005
(for the dried pollack that will be freezing and thawing over and over.)

644
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,115
- This log. Oh, no. - All right.

645
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:33,745
It's heavy.

646
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:35,614
(The log is getting way too heavy for them to lift.)

647
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:36,785
It's too heavy.

648
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,725
Gosh. It's up.

649
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:43,994
(They may be too exhausted.)

650
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,125
We got this.

651
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,994
(Catch)

652
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,864
(A mole)

653
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:52,505
(However, a professional worker chooses to still have fun.)

654
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:54,974
We're so fast.

655
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:57,004
We're working so fast because there are three of us.

656
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,405
(The younger members are becoming professional workers too.)

657
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:02,545
(Mr. Freeze is becoming a professional worker too.)

658
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,244
It's really cold here.

659
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:07,015
Right, it's so cold.

660
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,685
(Weather, you can be as cold as you want.)

661
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:12,654
(You'll only make the dried pollack taste better.)

662
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:14,125
We're working on our second box.

663
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:22,235
- This is beyond my imagination. - It really is.

664
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:24,395
All done.

665
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:25,904
(The younger members and Mr. Freeze finished six logs.)

666
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:28,005
- We were so fast. - We were really fast.

667
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:30,305
(Proud)

668
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,475
(Jae Wook is staring at something.)

669
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:35,515
(The two older members are still working hard.)

670
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,605
Should we do more work while you finish that log?

671
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:38,845
Sure.

672
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:41,915
Shall we make more money, then?

673
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:43,285
Let's do as much as we can...

674
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,455
until they finish.

675
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,595
Let's finish another log since we work fast anyway.

676
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,125
(The younger members and Mr .Freeze begin extra work.)

677
00:30:56,065 --> 00:31:00,065
(The two women keep up their pace as they near the end.)

678
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:03,835
We're done.

679
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,244
This goes here. And we're done.

680
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,375
- Here? - Yes.

681
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:10,315
This one?

682
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,215
They're...

683
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,615
(The younger members and Mr. Freeze are still working.)

684
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,955
(They're not done yet.)

685
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:22,795
- Should we do another one? - Another row? Sure.

686
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,124
One, two.

687
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,605
(This is how a game of wits began at the pollack drying yard.)

688
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:29,265
(The two women also begin doing extra work.)

689
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:32,164
(Without realizing this, )

690
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:33,734
(these three keep mechanically hanging the pollack.)

691
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:37,375
(So far, they've finished 38 logs, which are 4,560 pollacks.)

692
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:41,175
(They're done.)

693
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:44,375
(After finishing their work, they discover...)

694
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,915
(these two doing extra work.)

695
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:50,455
They're still working.

696
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:53,155
(Should we do more too?)

697
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,594
- I'll tie this up. - Let's finish up.

698
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:56,825
We're done.

699
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,064
Do you want to do more?

700
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:00,464
- No. - No.

701
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:01,495
(Sniffling)

702
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:02,835
Let's go down.

703
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,605
(Leader Yum ends their game of wits.)

704
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:10,735
Gosh, when did they do all this?

705
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:13,605
(They now have time to look down at the pollack drying yard.)

706
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:18,985
(The dried pollack that the Fresh members hung today...)

707
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:24,155
(withstood against the winter snowstorms of Daegwallyeong...)

708
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:30,095
(and are now waiting for the sweet spring breeze.)

709
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:33,894
- Let's go. - We're all done. Let's head down.

710
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,165
- Let's go. - This is...

711
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,965
Here. Come to the front.

712
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:40,805
(Shy)

713
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,725
Let's give it up for Lee Jung Jae.

714
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:45,174
Thank you for your hard work.

715
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,974
Thank you for your hard work today, hanging pollacks...

716
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:51,115
in this cold weather at Daegwallyeong.

717
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:53,615
Here is the payment for your work.

718
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:54,984
(Running toward the money)

719
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:57,185
Wait, do you know how many logs you finished?

720
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,995
- We finished 38 logs. - You did 38 logs?

721
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,795
- I've been keeping count. - She's amazing.

722
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,055
We earned 152 dollars.

723
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:07,845
You're counting the money right here?

724
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:10,964
- Gosh, right in front of them? - Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

725
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:12,864
- We have to make sure. - Gosh.

726
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,065
It's the correct amount.

727
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:16,375
- You like to be sure. - I do.

728
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:18,105
Thank you.

729
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:22,475
- Dried pollacks. - This is exciting.

730
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,015
Gosh, dried pollack skin.

731
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,114
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

732
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,915
- We will. - Thank you for the dried pollack.

733
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:31,884
Thank you.

734
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,485
(After the Fresh members left, )

735
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:37,695
(the dried pollacks, which endured the harsh winter of Daegwallyeong, )

736
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:42,395
(finally greeted the warm air of spring.)

737
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:45,965
(The dried pollacks have turned golden.)

738
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:52,505
(With the fresh, warm spring air on their skin, )

739
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,715
(they are ready to leave the drying yard.)

740
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:06,585
(Now, they embark on another journey to all parts of the country.)

741
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,954
(The Fresh members are grocery shopping.)

742
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:12,065
Come here.

743
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:14,264
You can choose any snack you want.

744
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,894
Go choose any snack you want. I'll buy it for you.

745
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:19,635
(Thankful)

746
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:21,035
- All right. - All right.

747
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:22,275
Pork backbones.

748
00:34:22,675 --> 00:34:24,775
We're going to make pork backbone stew.

749
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,375
(While the pork backbones are being cut into pieces, )

750
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,875
I found mung bean sprouts.

751
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,145
(they pick up mung bean sprouts.)

752
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,044
You said you needed them, right?

753
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,155
- We should get 2 bags then. - Let's get 2.

754
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,225
(While Jung Ah is picking the vegetables)

755
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,455
What?

756
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,855
Gosh, these chips are on sale.

757
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:47,495
(Thinking)

758
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,705
(Ji Yeon cautiously approaches their shopping cart with the chips.)

759
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:55,705
Should we get lettuce to make geotjeori?

760
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:57,004
Lettuce?

761
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,725
(Ji Yeon turns her body to hide the chips.)

762
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:00,244
- Hey, be quiet. - Why do you...

763
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,844
Why do you keep looking at me after grabbing something?

764
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:03,075
Be quiet.

765
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:04,674
I have to hide them.

766
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,995
(She covers the bags of chips before the others see them.)

767
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:08,515
Now what?
She's just standing in front of snacks.

768
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:11,284
She's only thinking about what snack she wants.

769
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:12,755
No, I'm not.

770
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:15,995
No, I'm not. I picked out the mung bean sprouts.

771
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:19,195
What about these?

772
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:20,994
I like those.

773
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,295
(Her next target is puffed rice.)

774
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:25,164
This is good to snack on.

775
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,681
(The younger members are smuggling puffed rice into their cart too.)

776
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,164
- Let's check our list. - Okay.

777
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,734
Based on what we wrote down last night...

778
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,034
Who put the puffed rice in here?

779
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:33,144
(Glaring)

780
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,874
(She did. He did.)

781
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,515
(Pointing at Jae Wook)

782
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:38,545
I'm just kidding.

783
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:40,385
It's not even expensive.

784
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,314
There's so little.

785
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,584
- Gosh, that's... - This one bag of potatoes...

786
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,745
- would only feed one person. - That's way too little.

787
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,895
- These wouldn't be enough. - Should we get more?

788
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:50,694
How much are they? Is it 2.40 dollars per bag?

789
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:52,494
- We need three... - Three potatoes per person?

790
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:54,664
One person should have at least three potatoes.

791
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,165
(Fresh members eat large portions.)

792
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,864
- You want three potatoes, right? - No.

793
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:58,904
- No? - Just one.

794
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,305
- You eat one potato? I see. - Yes.

795
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,334
My gosh.

796
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:04,455
I feel embarrassed for picking up all these potatoes.

797
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:07,604
(The light eater just smiles.)

798
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:10,674
(They bought everything in their full shopping cart!)

799
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:13,245
(After loading up the car, )

800
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:16,254
(Jae Wook gets in the driver's seat.)

801
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:18,955
(They are now ready to hit the road.)

802
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:21,024
Are we going sledding now?

803
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:22,094
It's right there.

804
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:23,855
- It's less than a minute's drive. - Really?

805
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:27,194
(The Fresh members decided to go to the open snow sled park...)

806
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:29,476
(that the pollack drying yard owner recommended to them.)

807
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:34,835
(This place is normally used as a field.)

808
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:38,335
(But when it snows, it becomes a playground for local children.)

809
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:42,245
(It's a natural snow sled park in Daegwallyeong.)

810
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:46,845
(The Fresh members are going to have fun here.)

811
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,161
This is going to be so much fun.

812
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:53,325
(Ji Yeon was hoping to go sledding.)

813
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:55,025
She's built differently. We...

814
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:57,824
- aren't looking forward to this. - Her? Even when we first met,

815
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:00,065
she talked about wanting to go sledding.

816
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:02,734
She's so excited right now.

817
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,234
(Ji Yeon's wish is finally granted.)

818
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,265
(She hands out the sleds.)

819
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,735
That's the biggest smile I've seen on her face since we got here.

820
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,374
(Let's go up to start sledding.)

821
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,375
Gosh, look at this snow.

822
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,744
Gosh, this is going to be fun.

823
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:22,615
(She's stomping up the steep hill.)

824
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,625
Gosh, I'm tired.

825
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:29,205
- I'm tired. - Let's walk up together.

826
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,524
Do you want me to push you from behind?

827
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:32,794
No, I'm good.

828
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,595
(Sweet Jae Wook takes care of Jun Myun.)

829
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,864
(Ji Yeon is walking way ahead of them.)

830
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:39,735
(While everyone is having trouble climbing up the steep hill, )

831
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,004
(Ji Yeon is the first one to arrive.)

832
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,545
(Happy)

833
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,274
(Laughing)

834
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,575
Ji Yeon is so excited. It's adorable.

835
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:53,115
(Ji Yeon's personal color is winter.)

836
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:55,905
Now that we're here, I want to go even further up the hill.

837
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,184
- You're going further up too? - Yes.

838
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,731
(The excited younger members decide to go further up the hill.)

839
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,255
You're going to go further up?

840
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,055
We're here anyway. We might as well sled down from the top.

841
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,525
(Mr. Freeze is watching them go.)

842
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:10,465
Jung Jae is walking up too.

843
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,964
He should experience it too.

844
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,134
(Mr. Freeze follows the younger members as if he's entranced.)

845
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:15,635
- Be careful. - Be careful.

846
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:19,444
- Jung Jae's here. - You're here.

847
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:21,045
- Jung Jae, come sit between us. - Gosh.

848
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,175
- The camera. - Goodness.

849
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:26,114
Goodness.

850
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:28,191
(After struggling up the hill, he sits next to the young siblings.)

851
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,515
(I can't believe we're sledding with Mr. Freeze.)

852
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:34,385
They're so funny.

853
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,325
You go first, then I'll go after you.

854
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:40,195
(Okay. Let's Go!)

855
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:41,735
You go first, then I'll go after you.

856
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:44,795
(Okay. Let's Go!)

857
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:50,865
It's pretty fast.

858
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:54,775
(Ji Yeon is also coming!)

859
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:57,405
Oh my! It's so much fun!

860
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,535
Snowflakes are getting on my face.

861
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:01,855
Is it supposed to be like this?

862
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:04,484
(Here comes Mr. Freeze!)

863
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:05,515
Oh, my!

864
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:09,195
(Sliding down at high speed while fluttering his trapper hat)

865
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:10,555
This is really fun!

866
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:16,825
(Joyful Jung Jae brings them great smiles.)

867
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:19,765
Sisters!

868
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:22,205
It's so much fun!

869
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:30,505
Oh, my!

870
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:33,275
(My gosh!)

871
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:39,085
(Coming all the way down in the blink of an eye)

872
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:42,025
(Arriving at the bottom)

873
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:43,255
(Oh, my.)

874
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:44,785
My gosh.

875
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:48,925
(Still enjoying the moment)

876
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:52,235
(Hey!)

877
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:56,035
(Jung Ah is coming down calling out loudly to someone.)

878
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,675
(Crying out to the front)

879
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,475
- She doesn't look straight ahead. - Mom.

880
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:02,945
Mom.

881
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:05,915
Mom.

882
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,345
(Tired)

883
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,514
I'm coming.

884
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:11,955
(Jun Myun is coming instead of Mom.)

885
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:15,325
(She's going to be slow.)

886
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:16,755
(Laughing)

887
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:20,255
Why does it stop?

888
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:21,754
(It stops for no reason.)

889
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,925
Why does it stop?

890
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,695
(Trying it again)

891
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,165
Why is it not moving?

892
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:28,035
Why is it not moving?

893
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,864
(The rescue shows up out of nowhere.)

894
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:31,364
- Move back a bit. - Okay.

895
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,375
Move back just a bit.

896
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:34,304
Hold on. It's so funny.

897
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:35,704
(Out of breath)

898
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:37,345
(She's trying to hold back her laughter.)

899
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,044
(Embarrassed for each other)

900
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,675
It's so funny.

901
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:43,185
- Are you ready? - Yes.
One, two, three.

902
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:48,215
(Sorry about that.)

903
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,485
(While coming down smoothly...)

904
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:54,025
(Whatever)

905
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,264
(Ending up lying down on the sled)

906
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:59,495
(Laughing)

907
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:01,235
She's lying down on the sled.

908
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,635
What? What's going on?

909
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:04,965
Why are you lying down on it?

910
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:07,235
(What an interesting sight.)

911
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,104
(Making eye contact with Mr. Freeze)

912
00:41:09,105 --> 00:41:10,105
(Flopping)
It's so funny.

913
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:12,914
- Come on down. - Okay.

914
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,475
(I really want to come down.)

915
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,485
Why is it not moving?

916
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,185
Anyone, please push me.

917
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,785
(Here comes the rescue again.)

918
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:24,924
(Please help Jun Myun.)

919
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,025
- Here you go. - Please.

920
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:31,365
(The rescue hopes she slides down.)

921
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:34,235
(Slipping)

922
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,535
(With the help of the rescue)

923
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,674
You're doing great. Come on.

924
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:41,311
(Arrived after going through lots of trouble)

925
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,375
I won't do it anymore.

926
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:44,905
It's enough.

927
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,845
(Park Jun Myun's sled show is over.)

928
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,584
It's hilarious. No!

929
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:51,585
(Falling)

930
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:52,754
(Again)

931
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:53,755
(Laughing)

932
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:55,355
You can sled one more time.

933
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,024
- We'll wait for you here. - Okay.

934
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:58,125
- Really? - Yes.

935
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,105
- Would you wait for us? - Of course, we would.

936
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:01,754
You wanted to sled more.

937
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,225
- They wanted to. - I mean...

938
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:04,795
Go ahead.

939
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,064
- Go ahead. - I feel bad for making you wait.

940
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,094
You don't need to feel bad.

941
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:08,855
- Just one more time. - We'll hang out here.

942
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:10,305
Go up now.

943
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:11,581
(They're trying to ensure Ji Yeon doesn't feel bad.)

944
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:12,835
I'll go first this time.

945
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:14,995
- You're in front of me now. - I mean sled.

946
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:17,844
I had no idea there was a place like this.

947
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,774
We got to see snow, anyway.

948
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:21,815
Indeed.

949
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:24,584
(He enjoyed the snow from head to toe.)

950
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:27,254
When was the last time you went sledding?

951
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,825
I did it only when I was little.

952
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:31,084
- Just in the neighborhood. - I never did it when I was little.

953
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:32,565
(Back to childhood after a long time)

954
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:35,795
Ji Yeon is like a kid.

955
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:37,325
She's adorable.

956
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:43,605
(Getting ready to go back to childhood)

957
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,915
(Happier together)

958
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,355
(Winter, the second season of Fresh members)

959
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:09,225
(Fully enjoying the moment)

960
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:12,165
It's so much fun.

961
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:33,514
(Laughing)

962
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:34,515
I'm having so much fun.

963
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:37,685
My buttocks hurt a lot. It's so much fun, though.

964
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,725
(The day their wish came true)

965
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:46,434
(Laughing)

966
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:48,095
(Watching them enjoy themselves, )

967
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:51,134
(Jung Ah feels pleased.)

968
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:52,135
Let's go.

969
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,875
I'm hungry.

970
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:56,574
(Having a snowball fight without knowing everyone is leaving)

971
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:58,075
No. Stop it.

972
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:03,045
Okay, fine. They're leaving. Let's go.

973
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:04,915
Let's finish it quickly.

974
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:07,555
(Hitting her directly)

975
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:10,684
Stop it.

976
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:12,155
(I'll hit you again.)

977
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:19,794
They wouldn't want to sled one more time, would they?

978
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:20,795
No way.

979
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:24,604
You said it would take four hours to make dinner.

980
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:26,004
When would they start to cook?

981
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:27,245
We need to start making dinner.

982
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,175
Come after sledding more.

983
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,705
- Get a taxi later. - Ji Yeon! Jae Wook!

984
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,915
Take the bus later.

985
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,185
Let's go now.

986
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,755
(They had a lot of fun on the snowfield.)

987
00:44:44,855 --> 00:44:47,425
(It's time to go home.)

988
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:51,594
What time do we get home? What? Is it already...

989
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:52,595
It's 4pm.

990
00:44:52,596 --> 00:44:54,341
- Is it 4pm? We're in trouble. - We should start right away.

991
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:55,864
I can't believe it's this late.

992
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,011
(Worried about dinner already?)

993
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,635
- Can you make a fire quickly? - Yes.

994
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:00,445
You simmer dried radish greens.

995
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:02,135
I'll prepare the bones.

996
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,945
Ji Yeon, you make dough.

997
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,345
(She quickly assigns tasks to each person.)

998
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:09,145
(Impressed)

999
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:11,615
Have you ever failed to make a fire?

1000
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:14,514
Or have you ever spilled the food?

1001
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:17,055
So, have you ended up with nothing to eat?

1002
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,025
- Why would we spill the food? - What?

1003
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:21,455
Who knows?

1004
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:24,395
- We use a rice cooker to cook rice. - I see.

1005
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:28,365
Jung Ah cooks only the main dish over a fire.

1006
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:32,005
(Amazing)

1007
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:34,595
Do you want me to pair your phone?

1008
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:36,075
Do you want to listen to music?

1009
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:37,604
Should we start with this song?

1010
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:39,014
(I love it.)

1011
00:45:39,015 --> 00:45:41,415
(What is the first song?)

1012
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:43,684
("Apt." by Rose and Bruno Mars)

1013
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:45,385
(Good)

1014
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:49,355
(The club in the tunnel is open!)

1015
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:56,225
How many times did you listen to this song during the show?

1016
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:58,364
- It's the first time. - It's the first time.

1017
00:45:58,365 --> 00:45:59,664
Oh, really?

1018
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:00,995
(I know. I love this song!)

1019
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:04,135
(Excited)

1020
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:07,275
(Synchronized dance)

1021
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:10,545
(Grooving to the beat while twisting the bottle cap)

1022
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,815
(Jung Ah and Ji Yeon are really into the song.)

1023
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:16,515
(Tired of them)

1024
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:19,315
(Calm)

1025
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,015
I think this could be a meme.

1026
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:22,824
A meme about Types E and I.

1027
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:24,154
(Types E and I in the MBTI test)

1028
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:25,354
We're the type E people.

1029
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:26,494
Among us,

1030
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,925
I think I'm the only introvert.

1031
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:31,325
Jung Jae. What's your type in the MBTI?

1032
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:32,565
- Me? - Yes.

1033
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:33,864
I'm ENFJ.

1034
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:35,534
- Are you a type E? - Are you E?

1035
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,965
All of you are E, and I'm the only I.

1036
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:40,305
I'm like a remote island.

1037
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:42,545
- Are you a type I? - I am.

1038
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:45,074
(If so...)

1039
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:48,545
I'll choose a song Jung Jae would like.

1040
00:46:48,745 --> 00:46:50,614
(Looking forward to it)

1041
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,014
I think I should restart it.

1042
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:55,315
(Searching for it hard)

1043
00:46:55,885 --> 00:46:58,185
(Will she satisfy Mr. Freeze?)

1044
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:01,425
(The next song is only for Jung Jae.)

1045
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:07,105
- Did you pick another "Apt" song? - Yes.

1046
00:47:07,765 --> 00:47:09,204
From that "Apt" to this "Apt."

1047
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:10,364
(Satisfied)

1048
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:11,565
We moved to the old apartment.

1049
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:16,145
(They are moving to the old apartment together.)

1050
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:19,275
(Humming)

1051
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,374
(Shaking the hand warmer instead of a tambourine)

1052
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,985
(One shoulder dance)

1053
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:26,615
(Hold!)

1054
00:47:28,585 --> 00:47:29,924
(Making eye contact with her fan)

1055
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:32,955
Ji Yeon is full of energy.

1056
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,994
(Powerful energy)

1057
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:37,365
Go!

1058
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:41,195
(Following the beat with the bottle)

1059
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:43,805
(Dancing to the beat)

1060
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:48,235
(Heading to Fresh House, not an apartment)

1061
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:50,944
Are we staying here?

1062
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:52,874
- Yes, there is... - Is it like a Hanok Village?

1063
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,075
It feels like a Hanok Village.

1064
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,515
(A tranquil village with captivating stone walls)

1065
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:07,155
(Jung Jae takes a moment to soak in the village's charm.)

1066
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,664
- Here we are. - Here we are.

1067
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:12,635
(Arriving while enjoying the stone walls)

1068
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:17,865
(The afternoon when the sun turns reddish)

1069
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,774
(Dozing)

1070
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:23,345
(You might doze off.)

1071
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:24,975
I couldn't believe you fell asleep.

1072
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,375
(Laughing)

1073
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:27,475
You fell asleep so quickly.

1074
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:32,045
- Is this it? - Ta-da. It's our house.

1075
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,354
- Fresh House? - Yes.

1076
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:37,395
(Returning to Fresh House with five family members)

1077
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:38,784
(Fresh House)

1078
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:41,225
(With Lee Jung Jae)

1079
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:42,395
Oh, my gosh.

1080
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:44,365
We're back.

1081
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:48,795
- We're back. - We're back.

1082
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:51,204
It's heavy.

1083
00:48:51,205 --> 00:48:53,035
(Putting the heavy box down first)

1084
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,274
Let's tour the house first.

1085
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:56,574
(Clasping his hands behind his back)

1086
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,105
(What is this?)

1087
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:01,245
(Surprised)

1088
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:03,815
Don't tell me we sleep here.

1089
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:06,414
(Here?)

1090
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:08,154
What? No. We'll have dinner here.

1091
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:09,885
There is one for Jung Jae.

1092
00:49:10,785 --> 00:49:12,625
- There is one for you. - That's right.

1093
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:15,425
- There are slippers for you. - It has JJ on it.

1094
00:49:16,425 --> 00:49:18,294
- We all have ours. - Is that so?

1095
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:20,465
(New slippers for Jung Jae)

1096
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:24,705
(Interesting)

1097
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:26,975
All of our names start with J.

1098
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:28,935
What a coincidence.

1099
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:31,004
We all have J in our names.

1100
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:33,315
(Jung Jae, Jae Wook, Ji Yeon, Jun Myun, Jung Ah)

1101
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:37,415
So, Jung Jae.

1102
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:39,515
- We should take a selfie here. - Okay.

1103
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:41,985
- Jae Wook. - Yes.

1104
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,715
- Can you hold it for a selfie? - Sure.

1105
00:49:46,155 --> 00:49:47,325
One, two, three.

1106
00:49:47,995 --> 00:49:51,295
(More people in the family photo)

1107
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:53,565
Photos are the best souvenirs.

1108
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:54,795
I'll send it to you.

1109
00:49:58,335 --> 00:50:00,175
- Okay. Let's go in. - I'll make a fire first.

1110
00:50:00,275 --> 00:50:01,334
- Ji Yeon. - I'll make a fire.

1111
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,645
Give Jung Jae a tour of the house.

1112
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:06,314
Jung Jae?

1113
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:07,315
(Surprised)

1114
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:14,255
(Mr. Freeze is amazed by the crocks.)

1115
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:18,755
- Jung Jae. I'll show you inside. - Sure.

1116
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:20,955
Let's see.

1117
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:23,425
(Taking off one)

1118
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:25,465
(Taking off the other)

1119
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,935
(Putting her shoes in place)

1120
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:31,465
- Please come in. - Okay.

1121
00:50:32,305 --> 00:50:33,605
This is the room.

1122
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:35,035
You also have a TV.

1123
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:36,375
- Of course. - Yes.

1124
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:38,125
We never had a chance to watch it, though.

1125
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:41,315
(Please watch me.)

1126
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:44,214
- This is... - You can use this room.

1127
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,091
(Showing Jung Jae's room after the living room)

1128
00:50:46,115 --> 00:50:48,354
- It's a big room. - It's cozy. Do you like it?

1129
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:49,624
Yes. It's big.

1130
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,885
You can use this room.

1131
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:54,024
(It's a small room where you can see everything at a glance.)

1132
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:55,154
(Laughing)

1133
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:58,065
(Country flower edition amenity items are prepared.)

1134
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:01,294
I think it'd look good.

1135
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,775
(While he is looking around his room)

1136
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,635
Fridge. Open the door.

1137
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,445
(Fridge. Open the door.)

1138
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,304
(Opening)

1139
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:12,505
It listens to you well.

1140
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:14,774
It's really convenient when carrying heavy items.

1141
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:15,915
I know.

1142
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,415
- I'll put everything in here. - Okay.

1143
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:20,954
Please take onions.

1144
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:22,654
We'll prepare onions later.

1145
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:23,784
Sweet potatoes should be out here.

1146
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:25,784
- Take out the items we'll prepare. - Okay.

1147
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:26,865
(Sorting them out together)

1148
00:51:27,155 --> 00:51:28,854
(Organizing is finished quickly.)

1149
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:30,065
It's Ji Yeon's gummy.

1150
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,294
Fridge. Open the door.

1151
00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:35,364
(I want to try it.)

1152
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:37,134
(Nothing happens.)

1153
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,375
- Why isn't it working? - Fridge. Open the door.

1154
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:41,305
- Oh, my! - My gosh!

1155
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:42,604
This is ridiculous.

1156
00:51:42,605 --> 00:51:44,474
(Feeling so good)

1157
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:46,715
(Disappointed)

1158
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:48,945
It doesn't understand you because of the way you speak.

1159
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:50,615
Fridge. Open the door.

1160
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:53,384
- It worked. - It's working now.

1161
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:55,185
Ji Yeon probably doesn't have good diction.

1162
00:51:58,155 --> 00:51:59,155
What are you doing?

1163
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,531
These are all the items we have in the fridge.

1164
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:03,225
This is so cool.

1165
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:06,494
- Are these what we have? - Yes.

1166
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:07,495
(Pressing the image of the ingredient in the fridge)

1167
00:52:07,496 --> 00:52:09,265
Searching for recipes.

1168
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:12,064
You can find recipes.

1169
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:14,346
(Recipes you can cook with the ingredients in the fridge)

1170
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:18,705
(Cut desired vegetables into bite-sized pieces.)

1171
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:20,945
I think anyone can cook if they have this.

1172
00:52:21,115 --> 00:52:22,315
This is amazing.

1173
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:24,145
I believe you can also cook.

1174
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:26,055
(Chuckling)

1175
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:28,285
You could cook like Jung Ah.

1176
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,755
(Water running)

1177
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,825
(Jung Ah, the human recipe, is busy.)

1178
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:39,065
I'll soak the meat in the water first.

1179
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:41,594
I have to do it now.

1180
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:42,595
(Pork backbones for pork backbone stew)

1181
00:52:42,596 --> 00:52:44,905
I know how to remove the remaining blood quickly.

1182
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:46,435
(Opening the bottle)

1183
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:47,634
Did you shake it?

1184
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:48,935
(The secret is makgeolli.)

1185
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,874
The meat is quite a lot. I'll add all of it.

1186
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,615
(Using the whole bottle of it)

1187
00:52:54,315 --> 00:52:56,284
I was wondering why you bought makgeolli.

1188
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:57,444
(Impressive)

1189
00:52:57,445 --> 00:52:58,514
Add doenjang.

1190
00:52:58,515 --> 00:52:59,584
(The next secret is doenjang.)

1191
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,014
(Leader Yum's recipe)

1192
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,184
(Soak the pork backbones in water with makgeolli and doenjang...)

1193
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:03,931
(to remove its odor and any remaining blood quickly.)

1194
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:05,554
(Soaking all the backbones)

1195
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:08,055
- So, you soaked the meat. - Yes, I did.

1196
00:53:09,295 --> 00:53:10,865
What time is it now? I need to...

1197
00:53:11,395 --> 00:53:13,795
Let them soak until 5pm.

1198
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,505
Are we taking a break, then?

1199
00:53:16,665 --> 00:53:18,934
Sure. Let's take a break and chat.

1200
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:20,075
(Taking a break)

1201
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:27,915
(Jung Jae got changed to the Fresh members' uniform.)

1202
00:53:33,955 --> 00:53:38,125
(The floral-patterned uniform makes him laugh.)

1203
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:42,254
It feels like you belong here now, doesn't it?

1204
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:44,215
(Doesn't it feel like you belong here, Jung Jae?)

1205
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:49,605
(Jung Ah is doing her hair during the break.)

1206
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:52,065
How do I look?

1207
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:53,605
You look cute.

1208
00:53:55,205 --> 00:53:56,205
(Making a V sign)

1209
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:58,704
(Capturing her cute look)

1210
00:53:58,705 --> 00:53:59,865
- Did you get it? - Jung Jae.

1211
00:54:00,475 --> 00:54:02,344
(Ready with a V sign)

1212
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:04,515
(Jung Jae is also making a V sign.)

1213
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:08,685
(Matching clothes and poses look cute.)

1214
00:54:09,685 --> 00:54:11,385
As I'm in charge of taking photos,

1215
00:54:11,525 --> 00:54:12,725
I'll keep capturing moments.

1216
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:16,565
(I'll count on you.)

1217
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:19,794
Jung Ah, can you remind us what we're making today again?

1218
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:21,195
- Okay. - Also, about our tasks.

1219
00:54:21,535 --> 00:54:23,816
We need to begin working on it when you tell us to start.

1220
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:25,835
When I tell you to start...

1221
00:54:27,335 --> 00:54:28,834
Make a fire at the two stoves since we don't have enough time.

1222
00:54:28,835 --> 00:54:30,344
- I'll make a fire. - Okay. Make it two.

1223
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:32,604
We'll boil the pork on one of the fires.

1224
00:54:32,605 --> 00:54:34,244
- We'll simmer dried radish greens. - Yes.

1225
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:35,514
- We'll also boil the pork. - Yes.

1226
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:37,485
- We'll start with that. - Yes.

1227
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:40,414
After that, do we put them together to boil?

1228
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:42,454
Yes. We take out the boiled meat.

1229
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:45,184
Then, put all ingredients with seasoning in a pot and boil.

1230
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:46,424
What about pollacks?

1231
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:49,355
- Then, we make seasoning for it. - Make seasoning for pollacks.

1232
00:54:50,295 --> 00:54:51,564
I thought we were taking a break.

1233
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:53,335
(Didn't you say it was break time?)

1234
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:56,565
(The reason they became obsessed with a detailed plan)

1235
00:54:56,865 --> 00:55:00,604
I think we should assign tasks clearly.

1236
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:01,835
So, today,

1237
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,145
Ji Yeon forgot about the sujebi since we were busy.

1238
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:06,975
(Did she forget about the sujebi?)

1239
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,814
It's a lot.

1240
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:10,335
(Making spicy codfish stew last night)

1241
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:13,255
I forgot about the dough.

1242
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:16,114
(No way)

1243
00:55:16,115 --> 00:55:17,684
(Cutting radishes)

1244
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:19,454
(Making a fire)

1245
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:20,924

1247
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,494
(Carrying items)

1248
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:24,665
(Setting a table)

1249
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:26,164
(She forgot about the sujebi dough for spicy codfish stew.)

1250
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:28,665
- We have no choice. Skip that. - No.

1251
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,034
Imagine if we added the sujebi to this stew.

1252
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,804
- It'd be so good. - It'd be amazing.

1253
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:35,304
- Please assign tasks to us clearly. - I will.

1254
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:36,344
(So I have decided.)

1255
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:38,644
After boiling for 30 minutes, let it sit for another 30 minutes.

1256
00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:39,845
So it'll take you one hour.

1257
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:41,851
- You're right. - One hour for dried radish greens.

1258
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,185
I need to peel potatoes.

1259
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:45,465
- Have you used a potato peeler? - Of course, I have.

1260
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:47,654
- We'll use all the potatoes. - Yes.

1261
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:49,495
(Scaring Jung Jae with three bags of potatoes)

1262
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:53,125
- I'll eat only one. - You have to peel all of them.

1263
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:55,694
- Should we do that? - Don't try to get out of this.

1264
00:55:55,695 --> 00:55:56,995
Should we do that, Jung Ah?

1265
00:55:57,465 --> 00:55:58,624
(Task assignment for preparing dinner today)

1266
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,434
Jae Wook makes a fire.

1267
00:56:00,435 --> 00:56:03,235
Jung Jae peels potatoes, and I make sujebi dough.

1268
00:56:04,035 --> 00:56:06,605
You're in charge of simmering dried radish greens.

1269
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,404
Boil them for only half an hour.

1270
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:09,604
- Half an hour. What it means is... - So, 30 minutes?

1271
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:12,675
To add them after boiling for 30 minutes.

1272
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:14,415
I'll do cucumbers and that one.

1273
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,975
Spinach and...

1274
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:18,785
Who will cook the rice?

1275
00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:22,615
What about rice? After you do that, cook the rice.

1276
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:25,224
After that, you cook the rice. And Ji Yeon, you make dough.

1277
00:56:25,225 --> 00:56:26,945
(In case you forgot, it is break time now.)

1278
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:30,264
(These two ended up falling asleep.)

1279
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,265
Look at this.

1280
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:32,865
They were taking a nap like this.

1281
00:56:33,665 --> 00:56:35,495
- What’s that? - Isn't it funny?

1282
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:36,904
Take another photo of them now.

1283
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,235
(Sleeping sisters)

1284
00:56:38,505 --> 00:56:39,875

(Moving slowly)

1291
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,085
Did you eat?

1292
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,025
(Nodding)

1293
00:56:58,725 --> 00:57:01,155

1298

(She is grating something.)

1299
00:57:22,715 --> 00:57:25,685
We have a lot of potatoes here in Gangwon Province.

1300
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:29,085
Add some carrots and salt to it.

1301
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,384
Then, just griddle it.

1302
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:32,425
(Griddle it on a pan.)

1303
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:41,564
(Chewy, crispy, and light-flavored potato pancake)

1304
00:57:41,565 --> 00:57:43,034

(Today's seasonal dishes at Fresh House)

1311
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:02,454
For today's dinner,

1312
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:05,425
we use pollack from the pollack drying yard.

1313
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:08,255
We're making grilled dried pollack.

1314
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:11,495
For the meat, we're making pork backbone stew.

1315
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:15,395
(Let's get started cooking dinner.)

1316
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:19,005
(Opening the fridge first)

1317
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:20,504
What's this?

1318
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:23,034
- I made soybean water yesterday. - I see. Tofu.

1319
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:24,874
- This is tofu. - Tofu.

1320
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,451
(Leftover soybean water from making tofu)

1321
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:28,715
- You won't get to finish it. - Do you want to drink it?

1322
00:58:28,745 --> 00:58:30,584
- You won't get to finish it. - Soybean water?

1323
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:33,115
- Yes. - Then we take it home.

1324
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:34,454
This...

1325
00:58:34,455 --> 00:58:35,535
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

1326
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,655
- I'll take a bottle. - Take it.

1327
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:41,895
(Bouncing)

1328
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:43,365
I love soybean water.

1329
00:58:44,295 --> 00:58:45,794
- Here. - Is it salty?

1330
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:47,235
Yes. It isn't sweet.

1331
00:58:48,795 --> 00:58:51,265
(His eyes go wide.)

1332
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:53,445
- Soybean water is tasty. - This is incredible.

1333
00:58:54,205 --> 00:58:55,274
The soybean water is...

1334
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:56,375
thick.

1335
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,875

(He takes a sip.)

1341
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:23,265
(Why is he going to the kitchen?)

1342
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:27,605
(Water running)

1343
00:59:28,135 --> 00:59:30,345
(He switches to the spray mode.)

1344
00:59:31,645 --> 00:59:34,375
(Then he washes the cup right away.)

1345
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:39,115
(Cleaning)

1346
00:59:39,215 --> 00:59:41,215
We can do the dishes at once later.

1347
00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:45,254
You're the type...

1348
00:59:45,255 --> 00:59:46,525
- to clean right away. - Yes.

1349
00:59:46,595 --> 00:59:48,195
I can't stand seeing the dirty dishes.

1350
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:49,824
(Spraying)

1351
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:50,895
My goodness.

1352
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:54,865
(He washes Jung Ah's cup as well.)

1353
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:56,935
You're washing mine as well.

1354
00:59:59,105 --> 01:00:01,335
(He quickly finishes doing the dishes.)

1355
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,675
This is...

1356
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:06,574
This is the compost bin.

1357
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:09,145
(He exits after figuring out the location of the compost bin.)

1358
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:13,114
(But he comes back.)

1359
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:15,315
(Turning on the faucet again to wash the dirty bottles)

1360
01:00:15,355 --> 01:00:19,425
(He rinses the bottles now.)

1361
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:24,925
(He takes the rinsed bottles to the recycling box.)

1362
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:29,635
(He even takes off the label.)

1363
01:00:31,705 --> 01:00:33,275
Are you recycling?

1364
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:38,074
Jung Jae is taking off the label on the plastic bottles.

1365
01:00:38,075 --> 01:00:39,705
(Eco-friendly Jung Jae)

1366
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:45,885
(He crushes the bottles as the final step.)

1367
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:50,384
(He cleans after himself.)

1368
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:51,455
(Clean)

1369
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:55,595
(A clean person leaves behind a clean place.)

1370

(Jung Ah checks up on the meat.)

1371
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:00,795
- The blood came out, right? - Yes.

1372
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:02,464
The blood came out.

1373
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:06,234
(The blood came out thanks to makgeolli.)

1374
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:07,504
Will you start the fire?

1375
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:08,505
Shall I do it now?

1376
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:10,144
I need a strong fire. Level five.

1377
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:11,575
Level five? Okay.

1378

(Walking over)

1380
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:19,384
- Will you lay them out? - Yes.

1381
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:21,085
I need to lay out eight bricks.

1382
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:22,984
Do you need eight more bricks?

1383
01:01:22,985 --> 01:01:24,524
No, I got them.

1384
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:26,595
(I'll do the heavy lifting, Jung Jae.)

1385
01:01:26,755 --> 01:01:29,254
(The diligent youngest one lays out the bricks.)

1386
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:33,495
(Mr. Freeze delivers the furnace.)

1387
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:37,705
(Heave-ho)

1388
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:42,875
(They carry the firewood together.)

1389
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:48,375
(Jae Wook works on the firewood in a skilled way.)

1390
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,985
(Let's see.)

1391
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:55,354
(When it comes to building a fire, )

1392

(Jae Wook is a senior with 1 experience...)

1393
01:01:57,155 --> 01:01:59,025
(and Jung Jae is a junior with 0 experiences.)

1394
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:05,265
(The senior is busy doing things.)

1395
01:02:07,095 --> 01:02:12,135
(Jung Jae gets the fireproof gloves first.)

1396
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:16,675
(Safety comes first.)

1397
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:18,144
(Shall we get started?)

1398
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:19,205
(My goodness)

1399
01:02:20,145 --> 01:02:23,045
(This is my 2nd time starting a fire.)

1400
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:25,515
(It only takes two tries.)

1401
01:02:27,755 --> 01:02:30,455
(Firing up)

1402
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:33,725
(Senior Firewood has fiery charisma.)

1403

(Junior Freeze marvels at it.)

1404
01:02:36,525 --> 01:02:37,565
(Impressed)

1405
01:02:42,295 --> 01:02:46,035
(Jung Jae wants to make use of the fireproof gloves.)

1406
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,435
Jung Jae, help me with this.

1407
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:50,204
(Running over)

1408
01:02:50,205 --> 01:02:51,374
- Put it over there. - Where?

1409
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,744
- By the firewood? - Yes. Over there.

1410
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:56,074
(He runs another errand while wearing the fireproof gloves.)

1411
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:57,114
My goodness.

1412
01:02:57,115 --> 01:02:58,314
(He runs another errand while wearing the fireproof gloves.)

1413
01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,744
You just need to rinse them once.

1414
01:02:59,745 --> 01:03:01,865
(He runs another errand after taking off the gloves.)

1415
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:04,555
(Heave-ho)

1416
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:06,524
(Mr. Freeze is closer to water than fire.)

1417
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:09,325
- I think it'll be better. It's hot. - Okay.

1418
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:15,265
(Meanwhile, Jae Wook got two fires going.)

1419
01:03:15,595 --> 01:03:18,605
(Leave the fire to the expert.)

1420
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:20,604
Flour.

1421
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:24,675
(Ji Yeon comes to the kitchen.)

1422
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:27,575
- I'll make the dough with flour. - Sure.

1423
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:32,085
(Adding the flour)

1424
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:36,185
(She picks up potato starch next.)

1425
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:38,325
(Chewiness)

1426
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:40,024
Salt.

1427
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,994
(A pinch of salt and a splash of water)

1428
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:44,065
How much water should I add?

1429
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:46,934
(She's unsure, )

1430
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:49,335
(but she decides to go with it.)

1431
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:54,005
(She begins making the sujebi dough.)

1432
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,305
(Diligent)

1433
01:03:56,945 --> 01:03:58,674
(Sticky)

1434
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:00,444
Am I doing this the right away?

1435
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:01,445
(Is this right?)

1436
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:09,985
Did Ji Yeon start with the dough?

1437
01:04:13,825 --> 01:04:14,925
Do you know how to make it?

1438
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:17,294
(Showing off)

1439
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:18,824
I'll make sujebi.

1440
01:04:18,825 --> 01:04:20,295
(She acts big.)

1441
01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:23,364
(The dough should be made...)

1442
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:27,174
(with spirit.)

1443
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:29,335
(Moving the bowl)

1444
01:04:30,705 --> 01:04:34,545
(Is she choking it?)

1445
01:04:35,715 --> 01:04:37,184
(Is she handwashing the laundry?)

1446
01:04:37,185 --> 01:04:38,415
All right.

1447
01:04:42,985 --> 01:04:45,055
I think it's coming along.

1448
01:04:52,465 --> 01:04:55,035
(Maybe not.)

1449
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:57,264
(This won't do.)

1450
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:59,634
(She changes her plan.)

1451
01:04:59,635 --> 01:05:01,035
It's exhausting.

1452
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:05,545
(She kneads the dough on the floor.)

1453
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:09,215
(Kneading)

1454
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:12,585
I'll make sujebi that's incredibly chewy.

1455
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:16,584
Are we making pork backbone stew here?

1456
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:17,685
- Yes. - Okay.

1457
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:21,494
(Leader Yum steps forward.)

1458
01:05:21,495 --> 01:05:24,625
(She adds one ladleful of doenjang.)

1459
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,935
(She pours in a bottle of soju.)

1460
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:30,934
(Next come...)

1461
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:33,705
(the pork backbones.)

1462
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:38,775
(The soaked backbones go into the pot.)

1463
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:44,515
(To remove any unpleasant smell, parboil the backbones.)

1464
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,725
(Whole peppers to remove the unpleasant smell)

1465
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,254
Bay leaves.

1466
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:56,055
(Bay leaves to remove the unpleasant smell)

1467
01:05:56,395 --> 01:05:59,294
(They're ready to parboil the backbones.)

1468
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,564
It's nice.

1469
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,465
(Rustling)

1470
01:06:04,605 --> 01:06:05,735
All right.

1471
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:09,035
(From the back, they look like 2 thieves.)

1472
01:06:09,205 --> 01:06:10,705
- My goodness. - It's okay.

1473
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:12,744
They're bound to break. It's okay.

1474
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:14,265
(What are they taking out cautiously?)

1475
01:06:15,215 --> 01:06:19,645
(The dried radish greens that were hanging in the yard)

1476
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:24,085
(It's a precious ingredient for the pork backbone stew.)

1477
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:29,295
(How do you soften the crunchy radish greens?)

1478
01:06:29,555 --> 01:06:30,864
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1479
01:06:30,865 --> 01:06:32,865
- I need some flour. - Okay.

1480
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:36,135
(An ingredient for the soft radish greens)

1481
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,434
(Adding flour speeds up the cooking process...)

1482
01:06:39,435 --> 01:06:41,935
(and softens the radish greens.)

1483
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:47,315
(Dried radish greens, become soft.)

1484
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:52,285
(Cover with lid and boil thoroughly.)

1485
01:06:52,785 --> 01:06:56,815
(Now, the backbones and dried radish greens are cooking.)

1486
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,824
What should we do?

1487
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:02,524
Now, I need to peel some potatoes.

1488
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:05,164
- Shall I peel potatoes? - Yes.

1489
01:07:05,165 --> 01:07:06,725
Peel all the potatoes. There are a lot.

1490
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,805
(Going insane)

1491
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,135
Ji Yeon.

1492
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:15,975
Why am I so busy?

1493
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,544
Things are so hectic.

1494
01:07:17,545 --> 01:07:19,225
I told you that there was no time to rest.

1495
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:21,914
Don't even think about sitting down.

1496
01:07:21,915 --> 01:07:23,644
What's this?

1497
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:24,645
(Ji Yeon is sitting down.)

1498
01:07:24,646 --> 01:07:26,985
How am I so busy?

1499
01:07:27,055 --> 01:07:28,055
(His hands are full of work.)

1500
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:29,215
Hold on.

1501
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:32,885
(Looking around)

1502
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:34,355
(A potato peeler)

1503
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:38,924
(He pours out the potatoes.)

1504
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:40,024
(2 bags)

1505
01:07:40,025 --> 01:07:42,165
(He pours out the potatoes.)

1506
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:48,705
(He picks up a potato and begins to peel it.)

1507
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:51,744
(Peeling)

1508
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:55,515
(The water runs.)

1509
01:07:56,215 --> 01:08:00,415
(The sound of peeling and water running fill the kitchen.)

1510
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:07,825
(He gets the solitary and quiet time for the first time in a while.)

1511
01:08:08,555 --> 01:08:13,835
(He enjoys the silence.)

1512
01:08:14,895 --> 01:08:19,035
(It's a time between Jung Jae and the potatoes.)

1513
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:24,904
(He finds peace of heart by peeling potatoes.)

1514
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:26,205
Jung Jae.

1515
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:29,975
There are more potatoes.

1516
01:08:32,815 --> 01:08:34,984
There are more potatoes.

1517
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,225
- Okay. - There's one more bag.

1518
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:37,924
(Laughing)

1519
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:38,984
I'm in trouble.

1520
01:08:38,985 --> 01:08:40,395
(I'm in trouble.)

1521
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:41,825
- You know, - Yes?

1522
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:44,025
I thought that I'd talk a lot...

1523
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,995
since it was a variety show.

1524
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:48,265
- There's no time to talk. - There's no time to talk.

1525
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:51,865
(Relaxing time is a luxury in the evening.)

1526
01:08:52,605 --> 01:08:57,175
(His hands move like a motor since he's in a hurry.)

1527
01:08:58,345 --> 01:08:59,645
(Wriggling)

1528
01:09:00,205 --> 01:09:04,815
(Despite being in a hurry, he removes every imperfection.)

1529
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:10,785
(Clean)

1530
01:09:11,585 --> 01:09:18,465
(Thus, Jung Jae locks himself up in the potato purgatory.)

1531
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:22,635
(The woman with the handmade dough is sitting on the same spot.)

1532
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:26,005
(Slapping)

1533
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:28,105
All done.

1534
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:33,475
Jung Ah, I finished it.

1535
01:09:34,475 --> 01:09:36,045
(Ta-da)

1536
01:09:36,245 --> 01:09:38,815
(Her eyes show that she wants a compliment.)

1537
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:40,715
(Sucking in breath)

1538
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:46,225
- It looks a bit wet, Ji Yeon. - What?

1539
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:48,025
Doesn't it look a bit wet?

1540
01:09:48,695 --> 01:09:50,464
How is it? Touch it.

1541
01:09:50,465 --> 01:09:52,194
(It's shocking news.)

1542
01:09:52,195 --> 01:09:53,225
Is it good?

1543
01:09:54,535 --> 01:09:56,065
Shall I add more flour?

1544
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:58,804
Yes. It's a bit wet, so touching it...

1545
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:00,805
- You should add more flour. - Okay.

1546
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:03,844
Did you add a bit of cooking oil?

1547
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:05,904
Cooking oil? I didn't know that.

1548
01:10:05,905 --> 01:10:06,945
(Not really.)

1549
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:09,374
Jun Myun, I'll use some more flour.

1550
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,815
I'm done with the flour.

1551
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:11,885
I'll take it then.

1552
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:14,855
(She retrieves the flour.)

1553
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:16,414
(As Leader Yum instructed, she adds more flour.)

1554
01:10:16,415 --> 01:10:20,185
(She also adds cooking oil.)

1555
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:23,695
(She kneads the dough for the 2nd time.)

1556
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:26,125
(Staring)

1557
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,834
I added some more flour since it was wet.

1558
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:31,835
(Giving an excuse)

1559
01:10:32,305 --> 01:10:34,235
- What? - Nothing. I like it.

1560
01:10:34,705 --> 01:10:35,745
Is there something to say?

1561
01:10:36,705 --> 01:10:37,705
Work diligently, okay?

1562
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,675
(Humiliated)

1563
01:10:42,475 --> 01:10:46,715
(The dough is smoother than before.)

1564
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,284
It works.

1565
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:50,965
(Now, she can tear the dough like sujebi.)

1566
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:54,395
So that's the texture. I should've known.

1567
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:57,265
- Jung Ah. - Yes?

1568
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:58,894
(The second checkup)

1569
01:10:58,895 --> 01:11:00,464
- I think it's ready. - Yes.

1570
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:01,795
(It gets a pass!)

1571
01:11:02,535 --> 01:11:03,535
You're good.
(Ji Yeon, you're good.)

1572
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:06,665
(Happy)

1573
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:08,504
Shall we put it in the room?

1574
01:11:08,505 --> 01:11:09,605
- Yes. - It's warm there.

1575
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:15,915
(The finished dough gets moved to the warm room for rising.)

1576
01:11:16,775 --> 01:11:19,585
(Please wait.)

1577
01:11:20,415 --> 01:11:22,255
Jung Jae, did you finish peeling the potatoes?

1578
01:11:22,285 --> 01:11:23,955
The potatoes? One remains.

1579
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:28,125
All done.

1580
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:33,625
(He finished peeling three bags of potatoes...)

1581
01:11:34,565 --> 01:11:37,965
(or not.)

1582
01:11:38,135 --> 01:11:42,805
(He rinses the peeled potatoes.)

1583
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:46,205
(He rinses the strainer.)

1584
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,075
Gosh, you're so neat.

1585
01:11:48,445 --> 01:11:49,775
I'm not neat.

1586
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:51,715
There was something.

1587
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:53,714
(He doesn't even allow a speck.)

1588
01:11:53,715 --> 01:11:57,755
(He cleans the sink.)

1589
01:11:59,455 --> 01:12:03,695
(He even empties the sink drainer.)

1590
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:07,025
(Jung Jae's potato peeling...)

1591
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:08,034
(is finally done.)

1592
01:12:08,035 --> 01:12:10,195
- Jung Jae, are you done? - Yes.

1593
01:12:10,735 --> 01:12:12,404
- My goodness. - I'll move them as they are.

1594
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:14,074
How do you work in such a cool way?

1595
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:15,935
- Don't be ridiculous. - Jung Ah.

1596
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:17,605
Look at the potatoes he peeled.

1597
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:19,744
- Don't be ridiculous. - They're insane.

1598
01:12:19,745 --> 01:12:20,745
They're shiny.

1599
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,214
The potatoes look so...

1600
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:24,214
- They look pretty. - The potatoes became gentle.

1601
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,585
There's no scratch.

1602
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:30,315
(The gentle potatoes are done with the shave.)

1603
01:12:30,925 --> 01:12:33,084
Most people leave behind...

1604
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:35,294
- the dark spots. - That's right.

1605
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:36,624
I can't do that.

1606
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:37,694
They're so shiny.

1607
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:39,264
They're for the actresses.

1608
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:40,565
You're amazing.

1609
01:12:42,465 --> 01:12:43,864
- The fire is strong. - It's boiling hard.

1610
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,504
(The ingredients are cleaned, )

1611
01:12:45,505 --> 01:12:47,251
(so shall we begin making the pork backbone stew?)

1612
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:49,775
(Let's prepare the ingredients for the pork backbone stew.)

1613
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:52,675
(The main ingredient, pork backbones)

1614
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:58,585
(The parboiled pork backbones get moved to the faucet.)

1615
01:12:59,245 --> 01:13:00,584
Ji Yeon, wash the backbones...

1616
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,085
- and drain the water. - Okay.

1617
01:13:02,515 --> 01:13:03,914
Rinse the pot...

1618
01:13:03,915 --> 01:13:06,055
and put the washed backbones back in it.

1619
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:09,794
The impurities between the bones are problem.

1620
01:13:09,795 --> 01:13:11,395
(They wash the blood between the bones.)

1621
01:13:11,495 --> 01:13:13,864
It's congealed blood.

1622
01:13:13,865 --> 01:13:15,735
(Getting rid of the unpleasant smell.)

1623
01:13:17,735 --> 01:13:19,765
(In charge of scooping)

1624
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:23,375
(In charge of washing)

1625
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:28,845
(The backbone factory runs without a break.)

1626
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:32,345
We're done. There are no more backbones.

1627
01:13:33,515 --> 01:13:34,585
Gosh, there's another one.

1628
01:13:35,115 --> 01:13:37,555
(The work is never-ending.)

1629
01:13:37,885 --> 01:13:39,754
(Jung Jae becomes curious.)

1630
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:43,555
Are we making enough food for the staff members?

1631
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:45,725
We'll eat all of it.

1632
01:13:45,825 --> 01:13:47,025
- All of it? - Yes.

1633
01:13:49,335 --> 01:13:50,535
Is there too much food?

1634
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:52,235
There are only five of us.

1635
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:54,075
(Are you guys serious?)

1636
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:56,505
Isn't there enough to start a business?

1637
01:13:57,745 --> 01:13:59,374
(Laughing)

1638
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:00,775
There's a lot indeed.

1639
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,345
We can eat all of it.

1640
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:06,414
(It's nothing to Ji Yeon when her stomach is empty.)

1641
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,585
(Her appetite explodes.)

1642
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:11,184
- All done. - Are you done?

1643
01:14:11,185 --> 01:14:12,385
There are no more backbones.

1644
01:14:13,885 --> 01:14:17,095
(Dried radish greens will add texture.)

1645
01:14:17,195 --> 01:14:18,764
(Jun Myun is in charge of the blanched radish greens.)

1646
01:14:18,765 --> 01:14:19,765
Let's work together.

1647
01:14:19,766 --> 01:14:22,371
(Jun Myun and Jae Wook are in charge of the blanched radish greens.)

1648
01:14:22,395 --> 01:14:26,534
If you look over here, there's the outer layer.

1649
01:14:26,535 --> 01:14:28,205
That's what you remove.

1650
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:31,245
- It looks like plastic. - Okay.

1651
01:14:31,645 --> 01:14:32,645
(Jun Myun's tip:)

1652
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:34,314
(Remove the outer layer of the radish greens...)

1653
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:35,945
(to enjoy the softer texture.)

1654
01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:39,415
- It's so much work. - That's right.

1655
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:43,254
(A lot of effort goes into the pork backbone stew.)

1656
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:44,255
Like this.

1657
01:14:44,256 --> 01:14:48,294
(The cleaned radish greens get rinsed in water.)

1658
01:14:48,295 --> 01:14:50,254
(Then they get delivered to Chef Yum.)

1659
01:14:50,255 --> 01:14:52,164
- And... - How about this much?

1660
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:54,764
Okay. But everyone likes radish greens, right?

1661
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:56,765
- Let's add another fistful. - Shall we do that?

1662
01:14:57,335 --> 01:14:59,165
We'll have leftovers anyway.

1663
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,835
(Her fistful is quite big.)

1664
01:15:03,335 --> 01:15:04,735
- Let's just add this much. - Okay.

1665
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:09,145
(She delivers a bowl that's full of radish greens.)

1666
01:15:09,245 --> 01:15:13,145
(She slices them into bite-sized pieces.)

1667
01:15:16,815 --> 01:15:18,084
- Will you season them? - Yes.

1668
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:19,601
(She moves them to a big-sized basin.)

1669
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,624
(Let's season them.)

1670
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,894
(A heap of garlic)

1671
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,595
(A generous amount of soy sauce)

1672
01:15:27,965 --> 01:15:31,764
(She mixes the ingredients with her hands.)

1673
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:35,305
(Become tasty.)

1674
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:36,635
Now...

1675
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:39,145
(The special seasoning for the pork backbone stew)

1676
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:41,744
(One big spoonful of garlic)

1677
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:44,284
(Two big spoonfuls of garlic)

1678
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:45,285
(Halting)

1679
01:15:45,286 --> 01:15:47,514
(Two big spoonfuls of garlic)

1680
01:15:47,515 --> 01:15:49,355
(One more spoonful)

1681
01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:53,424
(She adds enough garlic to satisfy the Korean tastes.)

1682
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,595
(Cooking wine)

1683
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:56,925
Gochujang.

1684
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:01,095
(The amount of chili powder will satisfy any Korean.)

1685
01:16:01,195 --> 01:16:05,165
(Mix everything and the seasoning is done.)

1686
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:08,835
Now, we add everything and boil.

1687
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:12,675
(Ingredient Avengers, assemble!)

1688
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:14,244
(The entrance of the pot...)

1689
01:16:14,245 --> 01:16:16,545
(featuring Lee Jung Jae)

1690
01:16:16,645 --> 01:16:18,615
(Adding water)

1691
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:20,245
(Pouring)

1692
01:16:20,345 --> 01:16:22,215
(The pork backbones go in.)

1693
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:25,085
(Green onions and onions for the broth)

1694
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:26,155
(Potatoes)
(Radish greens)

1695
01:16:27,156 --> 01:16:28,655
(Seasoning)

1696
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,525
(The ingredients go in endlessly.)

1697
01:16:33,695 --> 01:16:36,064
- Do we just boil them now? - Yes.

1698
01:16:36,065 --> 01:16:38,635
We just need to add the green onions later on.

1699
01:16:40,905 --> 01:16:43,035
Hold on. How much soup is there?

1700
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:46,375
- You can't see it. - The fire is the strongest.

1701
01:16:46,945 --> 01:16:48,314
(The ingredients are invisible in this mysterious pot.)

1702
01:16:48,315 --> 01:16:50,445
Hold on. I can't see anything.

1703
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:52,484
(In this pot are the pork backbones, radish greens, )

1704
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:53,485
(three bags of potatoes, onions, green onions, )

1705
01:16:53,486 --> 01:16:54,515
(and special seasoning.)

1706
01:16:55,855 --> 01:16:57,185
Shouldn't there be more water?

1707
01:16:58,255 --> 01:16:59,255
(Feeling the water with the spoon.)
(Splashing)

1708
01:17:00,256 --> 01:17:03,425
- We don't need more water. - I think you're right.

1709
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:07,965
(After Chef Yum's confirmation, he closes the lid.)

1710
01:17:08,635 --> 01:17:11,635
(Now, they wait!)

1711
01:17:11,705 --> 01:17:13,365
Is there anything else you want me to do?

1712
01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:14,605
- Yes! - Okay.

1713
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:17,135
- Here! Help! - Okay. What is it?

1714
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:20,644
- What is it? - Use a peeler to peel...

1715
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:21,965
- The cucumbers? - the cucumbers.

1716
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:24,444
- Trust me. - Are you good with a peeler?

1717
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:25,485
That's right.

1718
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:28,685
Don't peel them completely.

1719
01:17:29,155 --> 01:17:30,214
How should I say it?

1720
01:17:30,215 --> 01:17:32,055
- Leave some parts behind. - Understood.

1721
01:17:32,955 --> 01:17:35,954
I'll cut them like this and make seasoned cucumbers.

1722
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:36,955
Seasoned cucumbers?

1723
01:17:37,025 --> 01:17:39,794
- I'll cut them like this. - I see.

1724
01:17:39,795 --> 01:17:40,795
How many millimeters?

1725
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:42,465
I don't know.

1726
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:43,694
(I don't know.)

1727
01:17:43,695 --> 01:17:44,705
About five?

1728
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:46,465
My goodness.

1729
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:47,935
(Jun Myun leaves.)

1730
01:17:49,075 --> 01:17:53,275
(The peeler master's solo performance begins.)

1731
01:17:53,705 --> 01:17:57,015
(Peeling)

1732
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:01,255
(With his calm gaze...)

1733
01:18:01,455 --> 01:18:04,325
(and delicate touches, )

1734
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:09,695
(the cucumbers become thin.)

1735
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:10,855
(Leave some parts behind.)

1736
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,764
(I refuse to leave some peels behind.)

1737
01:18:13,765 --> 01:18:18,505
(He peels it completely.)

1738
01:18:18,565 --> 01:18:20,864
(He slices the cucumber now.)

1739
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:23,835
(He calmly uses the perfect angle.)

1740
01:18:24,945 --> 01:18:27,775
(There's edginess to the tip of his pinky finger.)

1741
01:18:28,815 --> 01:18:32,315
(He's serious about each and every cucumber piece.)

1742
01:18:33,345 --> 01:18:37,784
(He does a thorough job of not leaving behind any traces.)

1743
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,584
(The cucumbers became pale.)

1744
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:40,985
- Did you leave some behind? - Yes.

1745
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:42,824
- Are you done with the cucumbers? - The cucumbers are here.

1746
01:18:42,825 --> 01:18:45,625
(He gets the homework checked.)

1747
01:18:45,925 --> 01:18:47,194
It's good.

1748
01:18:47,195 --> 01:18:48,565
(Proud)

1749
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,495
Where did we put the washed knife?

1750
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:52,064
Ji Yeon washed it.

1751
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,305
(What should I do now?)

1752
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:55,575
Would you set the table over there?

1753
01:18:55,835 --> 01:18:57,074
- Shall I do that? - Yes.

1754
01:18:57,075 --> 01:18:58,905
(The work hunter is happy to have work.)

1755
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:00,344
It's heavy.

1756
01:19:00,345 --> 01:19:02,075
(He sets the table in the warm greenhouse.)

1757
01:19:02,115 --> 01:19:04,914
(He wipes the surface cleanly.)

1758
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:08,885
(While Jung Jae prepares the table, )

1759
01:19:10,015 --> 01:19:14,395
(Chef Yum begins to clean the pollacks.)

1760
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:19,425
(Wet the pollacks with water to soften them.)

1761
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:22,795
These pollacks must be delicious.

1762
01:19:23,335 --> 01:19:24,504
They must be delicious.

1763
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:26,104
- They gave us the best ones. - I know.

1764
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,674
(The Daegwallyeong pollacks show off their golden bodies.)

1765
01:19:28,675 --> 01:19:31,375
(Shall we clean them now?)

1766
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:34,914
(Break up with me)

1767
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:38,384
(She sings a melodious song...)

1768
01:19:38,385 --> 01:19:42,355
(as she cuts the pollacks without hesitation.)

1769
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,385
(Cutting)

1770
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:52,465
(The inedible parts are guilty.)

1771
01:19:52,995 --> 01:19:56,395
(She removes them without showing mercy.)

1772
01:19:57,735 --> 01:20:01,335
(She uses her hands to remove the hidden bones.)

1773
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,275
- Pollacks have a lot of bones. - Yes.

1774
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:06,875
They're scary.

1775
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:09,744
- There are bones here as well. - I see.

1776
01:20:09,745 --> 01:20:11,714
- So I need to check. - Is it all right?

1777
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:13,675
Do you need to pull out each one with your hands?

1778
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:15,155
Yes.

1779
01:20:17,215 --> 01:20:20,125
Still, these pollacks are plump.

1780
01:20:20,585 --> 01:20:22,255
I bet they gave us good ones.

1781
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:27,594
(It's a lot of work, )

1782
01:20:27,595 --> 01:20:31,365
(but she checks thoroughly since her family will eat it.)

1783
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:38,075
- Now... Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1784
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:41,614
- Shall I score them? - Score them like this.

1785
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:43,421
(They need to be scored so that they can be seasoned.)

1786
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:45,115
Don't run the knife through it.

1787
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:47,245
The fish should remain intact.

1788
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:52,255
(Ji Yeon gets to work.)

1789
01:20:52,485 --> 01:20:55,255
(Serious and determined)

1790
01:20:55,395 --> 01:20:58,625
(Their facial expressions are the same.)

1791
01:20:59,365 --> 01:21:02,894
(So that they become seasoned, )

1792
01:21:02,895 --> 01:21:05,135
(she scores them thoroughly.)

1793
01:21:06,305 --> 01:21:07,365
All done.

1794
01:21:07,835 --> 01:21:08,905
The pollacks are ready.

1795
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:11,705
(I did a good job, right?)

1796
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:14,775
(It's time to make the sauce.)

1797
01:21:14,815 --> 01:21:16,344
(She adds the condiments in an order.)

1798
01:21:16,345 --> 01:21:17,861
(Soy sauce, cooking wine, and sesame oil)

1799
01:21:17,885 --> 01:21:20,344
Spread it on both sides.

1800
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:22,084
- Okay. - Spread it.

1801
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:23,791
(Spread the seasoning evenly on the pollacks.)

1802
01:21:23,815 --> 01:21:25,485
- I shouldn't put too much. - No.

1803
01:21:26,085 --> 01:21:27,284
- An adequate amount. - An adequate amount.

1804
01:21:27,285 --> 01:21:28,425
(I got it.)

1805
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:30,394
We'll season them further later.

1806
01:21:30,395 --> 01:21:33,195
(This process ensures that even the inside gets seasoned.)

1807
01:21:33,365 --> 01:21:36,534
Now, let's sprinkle some glutinous rice flour.

1808
01:21:36,535 --> 01:21:37,934
(Glutinous rice flour)

1809
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,004
(Coating the surface with glutinous rice flour...)

1810
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:42,034
(makes the grilled pollack crispier.)

1811
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:43,104
Put them on a plate...

1812
01:21:43,105 --> 01:21:44,945
- and set them aside. - Okay.

1813
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:48,144
(It's time to make the sauce that'll go on top of the pollacks.)

1814
01:21:48,145 --> 01:21:49,545
Chili powder.

1815
01:21:50,475 --> 01:21:52,844
(Adding the 3 spicy ingredients, )

1816
01:21:52,845 --> 01:21:55,254
(chili powder, gochujang, and garlic.)

1817
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:58,125
(Cooking wine, soy sauce)

1818
01:21:58,225 --> 01:21:59,424
And...

1819
01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:00,755
(Now comes Chef Yum's kick)

1820
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,325
Allulose syrup.

1821
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:05,924
This is what I use at home.

1822
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:08,434
(Interested)

1823
01:22:08,435 --> 01:22:10,965
It's used for various dishes.

1824
01:22:12,205 --> 01:22:14,634
Isn't the package design luxurious?

1825
01:22:14,635 --> 01:22:16,004
- Seriously. - Right?

1826
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:17,135
It's nice.

1827
01:22:18,445 --> 01:22:20,644
(She adds the allulose syrup to the sauce...)

1828
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:24,315
(for sweetness.)

1829
01:22:24,885 --> 01:22:27,614
It's nice to use it for various dishes.

1830
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,015
- Allulose syrup? - Yes.

1831
01:22:29,485 --> 01:22:31,384
(Stir it so that the ingredients mix well.)

1832
01:22:31,385 --> 01:22:32,385
Now...

1833
01:22:35,425 --> 01:22:37,354
(How does it taste?)

1834
01:22:37,355 --> 01:22:39,765
(How is it?)

1835
01:22:39,925 --> 01:22:42,094
It's tasty.

1836
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:43,095
(It suits her taste.)

1837
01:22:43,165 --> 01:22:45,705
(This time, Ji Yeon tastes it as well.)

1838
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:47,235
It's sour.

1839
01:22:47,835 --> 01:22:51,205
It's the sweetness that's familiar and tasty, right?

1840
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:53,745
It's tasty.

1841
01:22:54,505 --> 01:22:57,344
Ji Yeon, cover it with plastic wrap and put it over there.

1842
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:58,445
Okay.

1843
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:01,814
Jae Wook, I'm going to grill the pollacks now.

1844
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:02,855
Okay.

1845
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:04,885
(Let's grill the pollacks.)

1846
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:07,554
(Very excited)

1847
01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:12,165
(After Jae Wook adjusts the fire, )

1848
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:16,665
(she coats the griddle with oil.)

1849
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,365
(The pollacks are on standby.)

1850
01:23:25,775 --> 01:23:30,675
(The pollacks enter.)

1851
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:34,414
(Watching in a daze)

1852
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,285
Let's do this.

1853
01:23:36,955 --> 01:23:41,125
(From the start, the sizzling sound is appetizing.)

1854
01:23:42,025 --> 01:23:43,694
Ji Yeon, bring me more oil.

1855
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:45,225
(She sets off right away.)

1856
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:46,695
Pour it here.

1857
01:23:47,495 --> 01:23:48,995
That's good.

1858
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:50,435
(Turning over)

1859
01:23:51,605 --> 01:23:55,305
(It already looks perfect with the golden surface.)

1860
01:23:58,575 --> 01:23:59,675
(My goodness)

1861
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:02,215
- It looks so tasty. - It looks so tasty.

1862
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:06,045
(Watching from the 1st row)

1863
01:24:06,415 --> 01:24:10,355
(Thanks to the glutinous rice flour, the pollacks become crispier.)

1864
01:24:10,855 --> 01:24:13,024
Now, we grill them over low heat...

1865
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:14,155
as we apply sauce.

1866
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:18,565
(It's time for them to wear the sauce.)

1867
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,664
(He lowers the heat first so that the sauce doesn't burn.)

1868
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,565
(The human burner)

1869
01:24:25,905 --> 01:24:27,165
Yes. The small bowl.

1870
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,645
(The finishing touch of the grilled pollack)

1871
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:35,744
(Here comes Jung Ah's special sauce.)

1872
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:38,544
(It catches...)

1873
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:41,185
(their attention.)

1874
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:45,224
(On top of the crispy pollacks, )

1875
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:49,995
(spread the spicy and sweet sauce.)

1876
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,495
Jung Ah, you're the best. It looks so delicious.

1877
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:57,434
(Chef Yum's happiness level goes up.)

1878
01:24:57,435 --> 01:24:59,165
It smells amazing.

1879
01:24:59,765 --> 01:25:01,034
- It smells good. - Right?

1880
01:25:01,035 --> 01:25:04,235
(The smell of grilled pollacks fills the yard.)

1881
01:25:05,705 --> 01:25:10,175
(Flip them over repeatedly so that the sauce doesn't burn.)

1882
01:25:13,045 --> 01:25:17,085
(The grilled dried pollack gets cooked in a tasty way.)

1883
01:25:22,355 --> 01:25:24,824
(The grilled dried pollack is sailing smoothly.)

1884
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:28,465
(Ji Yeon is doing the dishes.)

1885
01:25:29,235 --> 01:25:31,705
- We wash the dishes right away. - Yes.

1886
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:34,165
(Glancing over)

1887
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,004
- I'll do it. Move. - No.

1888
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:38,644
- No. - Jung Jae, come on.

1889
01:25:38,645 --> 01:25:39,645
It's okay.

1890
01:25:40,405 --> 01:25:42,544
- It's okay. I'll do it. - My goodness.

1891
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,074
It's the only work I can do...

1892
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:45,584
- since I don't know anything. - Don't say that.

1893
01:25:45,585 --> 01:25:46,885
- I feel bad. - It's okay.

1894
01:25:46,945 --> 01:25:47,945
(The man who's obsessed with dishwashing...)

1895
01:25:47,946 --> 01:25:49,226
(feels comfortable by the sink.)

1896
01:25:50,255 --> 01:25:53,054
(Ji Yeon is out of work.)

1897
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:55,494
(She looks around for work.)

1898
01:25:55,495 --> 01:25:57,024
(They're almost done setting the table.)

1899
01:25:57,025 --> 01:25:59,525
(What should I do then?)

1900
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:02,295
(Spotting Ji Yeon)

1901
01:26:02,995 --> 01:26:05,865
Ji Yeon, sujebi!

1902
01:26:06,835 --> 01:26:07,904
Sujebi!

1903
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:09,135
(My sujebi!)

1904
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:11,284
(She made the sujebi dough by kneading 1,000 times.)

1905
01:26:11,308 --> 01:26:13,178
(But something isn't right.)

1906
01:26:13,438 --> 01:26:14,738
She's in trouble.

1907
01:26:15,778 --> 01:26:18,178
(What will become of the sujebi?)

1908
01:26:18,618 --> 01:26:19,677
(After endless cooking, )

1909
01:26:19,678 --> 01:26:22,918
(their eyes become unfocused.)

1910
01:26:23,588 --> 01:26:24,988
(Don't worry.)

1911
01:26:25,188 --> 01:26:27,518
(The dishes are done.)

1912
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:31,068
(Looking like the pork backbone stew from a 30-year-old restaurant)

1913
01:26:32,358 --> 01:26:33,698
(This is incredible.)

1914
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:36,127
(The seasonal feast is complete!)

1915
01:26:36,128 --> 01:26:37,767
(Without hesitation, )

1916
01:26:37,768 --> 01:26:38,897
(they put the food...)

1917
01:26:38,898 --> 01:26:40,337
(straight into their mouths.)

1918
01:26:40,338 --> 01:26:42,908
(Impressed)

1919
01:26:43,568 --> 01:26:45,888
(Now, Jung Ah opens the pollack and rice cake soup place!)

1920
01:26:46,178 --> 01:26:47,737
(However)

1921
01:26:47,738 --> 01:26:50,408
(I can't see the bones.)

1922
01:26:50,778 --> 01:26:52,477
(They struggle from the start.)

1923
01:26:52,478 --> 01:26:54,418
(I'm doomed.)

1924
01:26:54,678 --> 01:26:55,747
Squeeze it.

1925
01:26:55,748 --> 01:26:57,688
(The situation gets worse.)

1926
01:26:58,558 --> 01:27:00,217
(Will they be able to have a meal...)

1927
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,388
(without a problem?)

1928
01:27:02,828 --> 01:27:05,257
(Let's have fun!)

1929
01:27:05,258 --> 01:27:06,258
- Hold on. - Okay!

1930
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:08,097
(But...)

1931
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,198
(in order to have fun, )

1932
01:27:10,328 --> 01:27:12,367
(they need an allowance, right?)

1933
01:27:12,368 --> 01:27:14,067
I know this well!

1934
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:15,968
It's impossible!

1935
01:27:16,268 --> 01:27:17,868
(We'll give you an allowance...)

1936
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:20,878
(if you win in a game.)

1937
01:27:22,448 --> 01:27:25,178
(If you can win in a game.)

1938
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:26,747
A guest is here,

1939
01:27:26,748 --> 01:27:28,748
but you don't even want to buy a cup of coffee!
