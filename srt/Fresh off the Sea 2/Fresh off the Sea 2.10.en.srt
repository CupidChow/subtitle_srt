1
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,663
(Cherry blossoms are in full bloom in April.)

2
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,332
(I love that we're spending this season together.)

3
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,503
(Moved)

4
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,602
(With spring, )

5
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,972
(the four siblings visited a place.)

6
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:44,843
(Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province)

7
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:48,443
(The first labor in the fields and sea of Boryeong)

8
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:50,242
Boryeong has the best scallions.

9
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,243
(They harvested scallions!)

10
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:54,583
(The youngest ones worked in the field for the first time.)

11
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,813
(I'll show you how to work in the field.)

12
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,283
Keep yourself busy.

13
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:00,023
(Watch carefully.)

14
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:01,952
(Pull...)

15
00:01:01,953 --> 00:01:03,222
(and pull...)

16
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,293
(and pull some more.)

17
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,192
(Quick hands...)

18
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:07,193
(and pursed lips)

19
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,233
(Passionate)

20
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:09,533
Jun Myun.

21
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,902
(The work wasn't always easy.)

22
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,263
(Shaking)

23
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,873
(Did you think that the work would end quickly?)

24
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,573
(Gosh, you shouldn't work so slowly!)

25
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:22,013
(Jung Ah, he's so funny.)

26
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,973
(Jae Wook was on fire.)

27
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:26,413
(He pulled out scallions in an excited state.)

28
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,253
(The fragrant scallions in season)

29
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,783
(I must make kimchi with them.)

30
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,093
(With Seasoning Park's touch, the high-end scallions became...)

31
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:38,223
(the spicy and sweet scallion kimchi.)

32
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:41,133
(Pancake Lim also worked on the high-end scallions.)

33
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,033
(The scallion pancake was crispy outside and moist inside.)

34
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,573
(The highlight of the day)

35
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,872
(It stimulated the eyes...)

36
00:01:51,873 --> 00:01:54,113
(and the nose.)

37
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,173
(Chef Yum's spicy stir-fried chicken on a cauldron lid)

38
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,582
(Spicy stir-fried chicken...)

39
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,943
(went into their mouths.)

40
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,382
(It's so tasty!)

41
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:02,683
(Proud)

42
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:05,853
(Their dinner was hearty and tasty as always.)

43
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,193
(And someone secretly visited the Fresh members.)

44
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,493
(Actress Kim Hye Yoon)

45
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:14,533
(She surprised the four siblings when they were sleeping!)

46
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,533
(Jae Wook!)

47
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,462
(Startled, )

48
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,602
(Jae Wook went back to the dreamland.)

49
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:21,632
(Mom!)

50
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,302
(To be continued)

51
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:27,003
(Ye Seo's sudden visit woke up the members.)

52
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,273
(The first meeting was a bit humiliating.)

53
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:34,013
(Let's go and catch the webfoot octopuses together.)

54
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,833
(And)

55
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,273
I'm so humiliated, okay?

56
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:39,604
(Ji Yeon has talked about being humiliated 100 times.)

57
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:44,244
(She sets up the frying pan...)

58
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:54,113
(and begins to make one fried egg.)

59
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,823
(Two fried eggs)

60
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,383
(Three fried eggs)

61
00:02:57,384 --> 00:02:59,994
(Four fried eggs)

62
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:02,994
(To Ji Yeon, it's the perfect amount.)

63
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:06,194
(Sprinkling salt)

64
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:09,434
(Sprinkling a lot of pepper)

65
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:12,873
(Scratching the edges)

66
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,804
(She had a traumatic experience of failing to flip food.)

67
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,013
Let's just scramble them.

68
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,673
(Scrambled eggs are perfect for breakfast.)

69
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,383
Scrambled eggs are the best.

70
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,183
(She suddenly changed the menu.)

71
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,284
(In any case, )

72
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:29,984
(why is she cooking in the morning?)

73
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:32,954
Hye Yoon hasn't even had breakfast.

74
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:37,464
Come to think of it, I feel bad about the reactions I've shown.

75
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:40,064
I reacted as if she shouldn't be here.

76
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:41,804
Gosh, I feel bad.

77
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,603
(She made scrambled eggs since she felt bad.)

78
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,074
- Hye Yoon.
- Yes?

79
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:47,504
- Yes?
- I made fried eggs.

80
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,004
Thank you.

81
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,243
Apparently, Hye Yoon hasn't eaten.

82
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,484
- Really?
- Yes.

83
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,314
My goodness.

84
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,554
- Hye Yoon.
- Yes?

85
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,224
This is incredible.

86
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,094
- Go ahead and eat.
- Okay.

87
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,454
Thank you for the food.

88
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,394
This is incredible.

89
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,564
(She blows on it.)

90
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,234
(Impressed)

91
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:19,604
(She changes her sitting position.)

92
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,544
It's so tasty.

93
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,884
(She inhales the dish.)

94
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:31,653
Hye Yoon, do you drink coffee?

95
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,483
- Yes.
- Shouldn't you drink milk?

96
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,553
(Mom's love)

97
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,054
I'll give you coffee. Do you want hot coffee?

98
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,623
Cold coffee?

99
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,824
Cold coffee, please.

100
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:41,794
(Ye Seo is all grown up. She even drinks iced Americano.)

101
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,964
I'll make iced Americano...

102
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:47,093
for Hye Yoon.

103
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,633
I must give people a warning...

104
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:50,234
about the water.

105
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,103
- Please.
- Don't put water in the fridge...

106
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,373
- after taking a single sip.
- Who did that?

107
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,603
Who did that?

108
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:57,603
Who did that? The kids...

109
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,374
(Showing off her charisma in front of the guest)

110
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,943
When you drink water,

111
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,214
bring the bottle to your spot.

112
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,413
- Okay.
- Don't put it back in the fridge.

113
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,653
(Nagging Park)

114
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:08,824
Okay.

115
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:12,224
- It has to be Jae Wook or Ji Yeon.
- I must teach them a lesson.

116
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,564
Seriously, Ji Yeon...

117
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,993
Hold on. At what time did I wake up?

118
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:24,364
(The youngest one talks to himself as he wakes up.)

119
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,404
(He woke up at 7:34am.)

120
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,073
(Half asleep)

121
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,004
Isn't it too cold over there?

122
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:32,814
Hye Yoon, aren't you cold?

123
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,644
Hye Yoon, aren't you cold?

124
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:39,454
("Hye Yoon, aren't you cold?")

125
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,684
(Hold on a second.)

126
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,693
(Earlier, )

127
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:51,364
(I had a strange dream.)

128
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:58,173
(The girl who brought confusion is calm as ever.)

129
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,174
Why isn't Jae Wook waking up?

130
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,103
Jae Wook won't be able to wake up.

131
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:03,274
- Really?
- Yes.

132
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,274
At what time did he go to bed?

133
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:06,873
- Shouldn't we wake him up?
- We should wake him up.

134
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,183
- Maybe we should wake him up now.
- Let's wake him up now.

135
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:09,283
(She goes back to wake him up.)

136
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:10,414
Let's wake him up now.

137
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:11,984
What?

138
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,154
Speak of the devil.

139
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,354
I went back to sleep because I thought it was a dream.

140
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:20,724
Seriously.

141
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:22,994
At what time did you leave today?

142
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:24,564
I got here at 6:30am.

143
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,534
Are you okay?

144
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,134
I'm fully awake.

145
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,804
It's cold. I'll go back to my room.

146
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,204
Where are you going?

147
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:36,044
Your seniors are there.

148
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,313
Did they finish making preparations?

149
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,544
(Did they finish making preparations without me?)

150
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,013
(The seniors are here.)

151
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,783
- After making fried eggs, - She should clean up.

152
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,054
She should throw away the shells.

153
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:46,754
- Seriously.
- The shells are on the counter.

154
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,553
She only enjoyed cooking.

155
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:49,754
(She's in trouble today.)

156
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:52,454
Don't throw them away. I'll tell Ji Yeon...

157
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,123
what she did wrong.

158
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,124
(Nagging Park spotted an excuse to nag.)

159
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,423
Don't touch them.

160
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,864
I'll teach her a lesson!

161
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,434
(What's going on?)

162
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:02,904
(The one who enjoyed cooking enters.)

163
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:05,003
- It's so tasty.
- Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

164
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,204
See me in the kitchen.

165
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,374
Do the dishes.

166
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:10,844
I'm so annoyed.

167
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,214
Hey.

168
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,314
(The family always has an embarrassing moment.)

169
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,154
(She can't eat because it's so funny.)

170
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:20,554
Im Ji Yeon!

171
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:23,553
Don't leave the shells behind after cooking eggs, okay?

172
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:24,824
- I mean...
- Seriously.

173
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,323
I was... I was in a hurry.

174
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,624
- That's no way to behave.
- Okay.

175
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:31,794
Also, someone drank water and...

176
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:35,034
Are you the one who puts the bottle in the fridge after taking a sip?

177
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:36,663
(She's so scary.)

178
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,934
I asked you if you were the one.

179
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,844
I won't put the bottle in the fridge after drinking water.

180
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,744
(Eating)

181
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,543
Hye Yoon, you must be cold. Come here.

182
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:47,883
- Come here.
- Come here.

183
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,643
You'll get a stomachache if you eat there.

184
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:50,983
- That's right.
- Come here.

185
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,013
If you get an upset stomach,

186
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,054
you won't be able to catch webfoot octopuses later.

187
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,554
You're done, right?

188
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,083
Yes. I'll clean the dishes.

189
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,424
- You should do that.
- Yes, you're right.

190
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:00,694
You're right.

191
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,494
I'll clean the dishes.

192
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:07,833
"Im Ji Yeon."

193
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,034
(Im Ji Yeon, victim number 1)

194
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:11,373
(I feel anxious.)

195
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,834
Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

196
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,244
You should put away the frying pan.

197
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:20,143
And you should've put away the cup...

198
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:22,514
- you used yesterday.
- I...

199
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,543
Hey, Park Jun Myun!

200
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,083
(This person is looking for Jun Myun.)

201
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,384
Park Jun Myun!

202
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:29,583
- Park Jun Myun!
- Yes, Jung Ah?

203
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,083
Is that your idea of folding the duvet?

204
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,454
(Is that your idea of folding the duvet?)

205
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,193
You just shoved it in there.

206
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:35,293
(Do something about that duvet!)

207
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:36,694
- For goodness' sake.
- Come on.

208
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,633
I can't even close the door...

209
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,164
because you shoved them in there.

210
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,534
I can't believe it.

211
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,164
Fold them again!

212
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:46,603
I did my best, Jung Ah.

213
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,144
(Nagging Park ended up getting nagged instead.)

214
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,174
(This house is fun.)

215
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,744
Hye Yoon's performance was quite nice.

216
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,783
- What was the name? Ye Seo?
- Yes. Ye Seo.

217
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,214
- That's right.
- Ye Seo.

218
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,183
You're still Kang Ye Seo...

219
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,754
and I'm still Han Seo Jin.

220
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,094
Do you cook?

221
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,153
- No.
- Does it look like she cooks?

222
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,624
(Ye Seo only knows how to study.)

223
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:10,824
Same here.

224
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:12,963
You can cook well now.

225
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:15,303
- You can cook for the guest now.
- Yes.

226
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,134
- You can make fried eggs well.
- Yes.

227
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,503
(She's embarrassed since her skills aren't impressive.)

228
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,374
I made them so quickly.

229
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:24,344
Please put on work clothes.

230
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:25,813
- What?
- Work clothes.

231
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,944
(He acts cold for no reason.)

232
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,154
(Let's put on the work clothes for webfoot octopuses.)

233
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,484
It's cute.

234
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,784
Fresh off the Sea.

235
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,454
All right.

236
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,224
I'm scared of these clothes.

237
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:45,364
- These clothes bring something bad.
- I don't want to wear them.

238
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,003
(The youngest ones became worried...)

239
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:52,874
(as soon as they saw the work clothes.)

240
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,703
I'm excited.

241
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:56,704
(Last February, Gangwon Province)

242
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,043
The uniforms are so cute.

243
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:00,314
(They put them on happily for their first work.)

244
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:02,714
(Retching)

245
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,653
(The youngest ones almost died in those clothes.)

246
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:07,884
I'm dying.

247
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,924
I'm scared of these clothes.

248
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,023
(Meanwhile, Hye Yoon hasn't done this labor before.)

249
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:17,664
- The weather is nice today.
- Yes.

250
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,863
I don't think it'll be cold.

251
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,464
You're right. It's so nice.

252
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:24,734
(Sighing)

253
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,574
(Sighing)

254
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,514
Why do you keep sighing? It's scary.

255
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,044
You don't know anything.

256
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,054
He's hilarious.

257
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,924
(A selfie with the one who doesn't know anything)

258
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,923
(May their smiles never fade.)

259
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,624
Let's go.

260
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,924
- Shall I drive?
- Yes.

261
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:51,223
(Sighing)

262
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,664
(Their steps are heavy today.)

263
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,263
When I had my first shoot, I thought...

264
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,504
- I was immune to seasickness.
- Okay.

265
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,804
I threw up 5 to 6 times.

266
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,544
- Really?
- Yes.

267
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:04,674
That's shocking.

268
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,243
(The Fresh House is in Hapyeong Village.)

269
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,853
(Wonsan Island)

270
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,684
(They set off to Wonsan Island to catch webfoot octopuses.)

271
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:19,554
I wonder how we'll catch webfoot octopuses.

272
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:23,223
(Thinking)

273
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,564
The wind... Here's the thing about webfoot octopuses.

274
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,533
After finding out about the labor,

275
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,304
I looked up information on catching webfoot octopuses.

276
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,104
You can catch a lot of them when it's windy.

277
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,544
Thus, we must be going to an incredibly windy place.

278
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,314
- We'll need to steel ourselves.
- We'll need to steel ourselves.

279
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,413
Will we use fishing rods...

280
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:42,314
- or nets?
- Seriously.

281
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:50,984
(The shocking truth about catching webfoot octopuses is coming soon.)

282
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:57,794
(They arrive at the destination.)

283
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,033
What? What's this?

284
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,964
(There isn't a boat in sight. Why is there a beach?)

285
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,504
What's here?

286
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,274
(Feeling suspicious, she gets off the car.)

287
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,174
(Dazed)

288
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:14,044
(She also gets off the car without knowing what's happening.)

289
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,183
(She follows the four siblings who move in fluid motion.)

290
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:17,184
What?

291
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,413
Each of you, take one.

292
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:20,654
(Receiving the dreaded orange boots)

293
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,054
(Among those groaning in pain...)

294
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,323
- Gosh, my back.
- Why am I feeling bitter?

295
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,354
(Putting the boots on without hesitation)

296
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,164
- Hye Yoon, to keep the water out, - Yes.

297
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,263
Your pants need to be on the outside.

298
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,264
- They need to be on the outside?
- Yes.

299
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,064
I should put this on first, right?

300
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,064
I'll do it for you.

301
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,133
- Hold this. Hold it like this.
- Okay.

302
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,134
(Switching to Ye Seo's mom mode)

303
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,644
You're really in trouble now.

304
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,143
This is scary.

305
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,343
(She is terrified by Jae Wook's prank.)

306
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,014
- He's just trying to scare you.
- Is that so?

307
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,383
(Come here.)

308
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,384
I'm scared.

309
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,154
(I'll protect my daughter.)

310
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,384
- What's so scary?
- Right.

311
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,724
- Exactly.
- You just do it.

312
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,623
- That's right.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

313
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,023
- You're right.
- It's just hard. But that's all.

314
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,264
(Ye Seo, there's nothing to fear. It's just tough.)

315
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,533
That's what scares me.

316
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,434
(We agreed to call that being scared.)

317
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:11,264
(Meanwhile, with the sound and scent of the sea...)

318
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:14,404
(Sighing)

319
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:15,874
(Groaning)

320
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,274
Am I the only one who's scared?

321
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,714
I'm not the only one who's scared, right?

322
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:24,014
- Why do I feel so heavy inside?
- Feeling heavy...

323
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:27,714
Let's do this. Yes.

324
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,454
It's here. There's the boat.

325
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:35,063
What are those dark shadows? That's scary.

326
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,064
(Am I the only one seeing those dark shadows?)

327
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,694
- There are 2.
- There are 2 of them.

328
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:40,964
- Oh, my.
- We're splitting up.

329
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,334
Gosh.

330
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,034
(Two boats are waiting for the crew.)

331
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,803
There are two boats.

332
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,604
(It's already scary enough, and now we're splitting up.)

333
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:51,144
It's my first time catching something on a boat like that.

334
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,114
- Is that so?
- Yes.

335
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,483
You'll do it today and never want to come back.

336
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,014
Right. What if I cry and say I want to go home?

337
00:13:58,584 --> 00:13:59,714
I want to go home.

338
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,324
I really feel heavy inside.

339
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:07,494
You two look like you're about to cry, sighing and all...

340
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,423
- Hello.
- Hi.

341
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:11,964
Hello.

342
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,493
Would you like this?

343
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:14,764
Yes, could you pass that one over here?

344
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:16,664
That will do.

345
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:18,804
(While wrapping up the preparations...)

346
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:20,674
(Sighing)

347
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,004
Let's go.

348
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:25,314
You've sighed like ten times already.

349
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,443
- Thank you.
- You're making me scared.

350
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:29,484
(The final check before departure)

351
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,213
No, we can do this.

352
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,314
(I can do it.)

353
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,654
Wait, which one's my camera?

354
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,323
(Somehow, we ended up filming a behind-the-scenes video.)

355
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,754
Which one's my camera?

356
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:41,823
Jae Wook's not the type to say he can't do something like this.

357
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:44,323
He's not someone who sighs or gets discouraged.

358
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,164
She's so chatty in front of the camera.

359
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:48,763
- He's not...
- She is skilled at interviews.

360
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,833
- I see.
- He's not someone...

361
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:50,864
who gets scared like this.

362
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:54,674
But he has sighed ten times already.

363
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,274
Now, let's get on the boat.

364
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:58,104
Hello.

365
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,583
Today, you'll be joining us for a day of webfoot octopus fishing.

366
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:03,584
Yes, of course.

367
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:06,513
(Laughing)

368
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:07,514
Why?

369
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:08,923
(Jun Myun's boat with Ji Yeon)

370
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,353
Just trust me.

371
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,893
I'll count on you. Pancake Im.

372
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:13,994
Hey, Pancake Im.

373
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:15,794
(Drooping head)

374
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:17,724
(Coughing)

375
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,994
(We can see the future of this boat.)

376
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:23,134
(Jung Ah's boat is vibrant and lively.)

377
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:27,773
Webfoot octopus from Boryeong is in season these days.

378
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,544
- Yes.
- The egg-filled webfoot octopus.

379
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,443
(This isn't just any webfoot octopus.)

380
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,514
The egg-filled webfoot octopus.

381
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:35,144
(It's the egg-filled webfoot octopus.)

382
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,143
This one's a male.

383
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,454
(The male has a smaller body.)

384
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:39,954
You can't even compare them, right?

385
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,654
(The female is twice as big as the male.)

386
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,453
To spawn once,

387
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:47,994
they carry about 200 to 300 eggs in their heads.

388
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,463
This is when they taste the best.

389
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,863
(A seasonal delicacy only available from March to April)

390
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,604
With just the right mix of mud and sand,

391
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:59,234
this place offers the perfect conditions for them to live in.

392
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:02,473
That's why they grow significantly bigger here.

393
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,274
(Large and fresh egg-filled webfoot octopus from Boryeong)

394
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:06,114
- We're going to start fishing.
- Okay.

395
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,943
We're going to start fishing, using a method called sorabang.

396
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:12,684
It's a traditional technique passed down from long ago.

397
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:14,154
- Did you say sorabang?
- Yes.

398
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:17,084
The webfoot octopus is inside this sorabang.

399
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,053
(What?)

400
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:21,624
We attach the sorabangs evenly along a rope...

401
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,624
and leave them in the sea for about two weeks.

402
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:27,163
Then the webfoot octopus goes inside to spawn.

403
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:28,934
(The webfoot octopus seeks narrow and dark spaces.)

404
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,663
(Hello?)

405
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,734
We scatter them because they go into things like shells.

406
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,344
- And a webfoot octopus is inside?
- Yes, it's actually inside.

407
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,714
Then let's head out and give it a try.

408
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,844
(What should we do now?)

409
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:43,714
- Yes, like that.
- Hye Yoon, sit down.

410
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,654
- I'd better sit while I still can.
- Right.

411
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:48,954
Sit here.

412
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:51,084
She said, "I'd better sit while I still can."

413
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,694
- Do it while you can.
- She always does what she's told.

414
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,964
If she's told to sleep, she sleeps. If she's told to study, she studies.

415
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:03,233
(If she's told to catch webfoot octopuses, )

416
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:07,034
(she catches them.)

417
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,443
(Setting out for webfoot octopus fishing)

418
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:10,704
Good luck.

419
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,874
- Let's do this.
- Good luck.

420
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:17,743
(They miss each other for some reason.)

421
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:21,213
Goodbye. Come back safe.

422
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,184
(This fishing will surely touch your heart.)

423
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,723
(Waves)

424
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:31,524
(Do not weep)

425
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,233
("Deserted Island" by Kim Choo Ja)

426
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:36,803
(Waves, rise and dance)

427
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:40,804
(Waves, do not grieve)

428
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:42,773
We really have a lot to do today.

429
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,744
- We're really short on money.
- The money...

430
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,344
We need to add brisket to the webfoot octopus.

431
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:50,344
- Shabu-shabu.
- We should make shabu-shabu.

432
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,213
I also need to buy fruit to make tanghulu.

433
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:53,954
The fruit is expensive.

434
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:57,524
How many webfoot octopuses do we need to catch today?

435
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,854
(There is no time to worry about seasickness.)

436
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,393
Let's make an acrostic poem with webfoot octopus.

437
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,723
Okay, "Web."

438
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:06,194
Webbing through the waves, we catch the webfoot octopus.

439
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,794
"Foot."

440
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,464
Footsteps steady, I want to work sincerely.

441
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:11,934
"Octopus."

442
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,504
Octopus-like, I want to work with relentless energy.

443
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,404
(Up to this point, the two did not know.)

444
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:20,574
Are we there yet?

445
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,383
We're in trouble. We have to catch a lot quickly.

446
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,714
(I'm going to catch them all.)

447
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:28,684
(Jung Ah's boat quickly reaches the fishing spot.)

448
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:31,854
(Starting the engine)

449
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:34,953
(The roller begins to turn.)

450
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,124
Something appears to be coming out now.

451
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,134
(The sorabangs are rising one after another.)

452
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:46,134
(Among the quickly passing sorabangs, )

453
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,944
(they're searching for the ones with a webfoot octopus inside.)

454
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,274
There aren't any.

455
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,313
(Where are these little ones?)

456
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:53,344
There's nothing.

457
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:56,084
Wait, I think they're inside here.

458
00:18:57,684 --> 00:18:58,684
There's nothing here.

459
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:00,384
Why isn't there any?

460
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,353
If we keep going, we'll find some.

461
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,454
(Most of them are empty.)

462
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:07,354
(Waiting in tense anticipation)

463
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,724
- This is it.
- Catch it.

464
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:12,594
Twist it more.

465
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:14,094
(Using force to open the shells)

466
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:17,134
(The hidden webfoot octopus appears.)

467
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,304
- There you go.
- Oh, my.

468
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:22,174
(Putting the caught webfoot octopus into the container)

469
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,704
Here it is.

470
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,574
(It's hiding a conch shell.)

471
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,614
(Using the hook)

472
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,854
Come on out. This one's really strong.

473
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:39,854
(Sorabangs are rising without pause.)

474
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:41,793
- Here it is.
- It's inside here.

475
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,164
This one's here as well.

476
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:44,924
It's inside.

477
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,334
It's a mess.

478
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:51,364
(But we absolutely can't let it slip away.)

479
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:52,473
No.

480
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,534
(We must not fall behind.)

481
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:54,934
I found one.

482
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:56,304
(Hye Yoon spots it.)

483
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,814
(If she's unable to pull it out, )

484
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,113
There's one inside the shell.

485
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,374
(she tosses it to Leader Yum.)

486
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:02,743
Twist it.

487
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,744
(When it gets tough for Jung Ah, )

488
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,213
Jae Wook.

489
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,014
(it goes to Jae Wook.)

490
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:10,124
(Twisting open the sorabang...)

491
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:13,054
(reveals the webfoot octopus.)

492
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:15,893
Gosh, it's really big.

493
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,694
(Jae Wook's closing)

494
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,634
Here it is.

495
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,364
(Establishing a 3-stage defense system)

496
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,074
I just spot them.

497
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:28,943
I've got to earn my keep.

498
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,104
- Here it is.
- It's here.

499
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:31,904
This one, too.

500
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:34,543
- Catch it.
- Pull it.

501
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:35,583
(Paying her dues with some intensity)

502
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,584
(Adding to her dues)

503
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,444
(Adding another due)

504
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,454
- We're really busy.
- We're busy.

505
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,924
We have to stay busy.

506
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:46,694
Webfoot octopus.

507
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:48,624
Webfoot octopus.

508
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,764
(However, )

509
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:53,464
(there was a difference between the two boats.)

510
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,534
(This support on Jung Ah's boat...)

511
00:20:57,504 --> 00:21:00,134
(is not on Jun Myun's boat.)

512
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:02,573
This one is really hiding deep.

513
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:04,304
(A difference in labor intensity arises.)

514
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,214
(The rope is pulling up automatically.)

515
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,314
(But they have to pull the rope by hand on Jun Myun's boat.)

516
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,614
(Although there is a roller...)

517
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,754
You have to pull to make it come up faster.

518
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,124
It just gives a little help.

519
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,023
Okay.

520
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:23,024
(When a webfoot octopus is spotted, )

521
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,263
(work temporarily pauses.)

522
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:27,363
There's none.

523
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:29,863
(It's 100 percent manual work.)

524
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:30,934
Here it is.

525
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:32,434
Gosh.

526
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,733
(Using the whole body due to lack of support)

527
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,274
Just a moment.

528
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:40,943
You have to catch it. Don't let it go.

529
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:42,444
(Before and after the Industrial Revolution)

530
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,483
Here it is.

531
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,314
(They are like factory workers, )

532
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:48,553
- Is it here?
- Jun Myun.

533
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,053
Did you find it?

534
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,524
(and here are the primitive hunters.)

535
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,764
(The two have not encountered modern civilization.)

536
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,494
We're heading out to hunt webfoot octopuses

537
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,603
Webfoot octopus

538
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,404
Each webfoot octopus is this precious.

539
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,033
We have to eat it so deliciously.

540
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:10,474
Because this webfoot octopus is caught so preciously.

541
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,073
We must appreciate the taste.

542
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:14,074
(Gently pulling out the precious one)

543
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,584
(And then releasing it?)

544
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:21,813
- No. Don't do that, Jun Myun.
- I'm sorry.

545
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:24,183
- Gosh, what should I do?
- I can't believe this.

546
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:25,753
- I won't let this one go.
- We can't let go of this.

547
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:26,823
Goodness. No.

548
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:28,124
(On Jun Myun's boat, every webfoot octopus is precious.)

549
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,924
We don't have a lot. Make sure not to let it go.

550
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:33,833
We have to hang on tight to each one.

551
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,804
- These webfoot octopuses.
- We have to brace ourselves.

552
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:40,274
(They renew their determination.)

553
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:41,574
I'm not going to let them slip away.

554
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,103
Don't let them slip away.

555
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,603
(Ji Yeon's competitive side is showing.)

556
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:45,614
We have to catch them.

557
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,184
(We won't let them slip away.)

558
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:51,784
(We got this!)

559
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:54,384
(Let's go!)

560
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:58,154
(Bracing and pulling)

561
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:02,094
- Gosh, they're relentless.
- Gosh, they're relentless.

562
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:03,963
(Let's go!)

563
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:05,164
(Let's go!)

564
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:09,204
- This one's so big.
- Gosh.

565
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:11,803
It's big.

566
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:12,804
(Jun Myun is in charge of the final step.)

567
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:15,703
(She suddenly transforms into a masked terrorist.)

568
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,344
Gosh, I put this on the wrong way.

569
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:21,744
(Hand over your webfoot octopus if you want to live.)

570
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,683
(In that case)

571
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:24,883
(Let's go!)

572
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:27,014
(Let's go! Here!)

573
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:29,924
(Using the hook without hesitation)

574
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:31,854
- You're good at this.
- Right?

575
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,454
You're doing a good job.

576
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,363
(The webfoot octopus hunters are improving quickly.)

577
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:38,594
Gosh, we're doing well.

578
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,463
(Set aside your worries)

579
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:43,364
(All right!)

580
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,473
(In total darkness)

581
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,003
(Here we go!)

582
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,074
(All right!)

583
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,374
It's huge.

584
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,914
(Even if she can't see, she won't let go of the webfoot octopus!)

585
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,044
(Feeling her way around)

586
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,344
Gosh, wait.

587
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:59,584
I put this on the wrong way.

588
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:04,054
(The webfoot octopus hunter continues to do what she has to do.)

589
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:08,823
(The sound of them hyping themselves up echoes throughout the boat.)

590
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,624
Gosh, this one's huge.

591
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:13,033
Here it is.

592
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,794
(Meanwhile, on Jung Ah's boat, it's all about speed.)

593
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,603
(When they catch one, )

594
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,664
Here's another one.

595
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:18,973
Another one?

596
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,074
(another one comes right after.)

597
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,474
(They're getting a nonstop stream of orders for webfoot octopus.)

598
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:26,674
(Is this the side effect of industrialization?)

599
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,314
Do you usually work this fast?

600
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:30,384
- We usually work faster.
- Really?

601
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:32,384
But how... Gosh.

602
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:35,724
Things are busy even when the sorabangs are ten percent full.

603
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:37,053
- I see.
- Right.

604
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:39,124
This is only two percent.

605
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:40,494
- Really?
- Yes.

606
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:42,694
It's so hectic, even with three of us working.

607
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:45,934
(Gosh!)

608
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,164
(Let's do this!)

609
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,034
- I think there's one inside.
- There's one inside.

610
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:54,174
There's one inside.

611
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:57,504
Here's one.

612
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:01,844
(She takes out the webfoot octopuses without a second thought.)

613
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:05,684
(Mom, I give up on Sun Jae. Instead, I'll catch webfoot octopuses.)

614
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:08,924
(She's catching webfoot octopuses with fierce determination.)

615
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:11,123
(Jung Ah takes over during Hye Yoon's momentary absence.)

616
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:12,224
Jae Wook, there's one here.

617
00:25:12,924 --> 00:25:14,753
- Hye Yoon is...
- She's really good at this.

618
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:15,894
She's...

619
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,024
That's my daughter.

620
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:20,933
Here.

621
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,093
(Hye Yoon opens up the shell...)

622
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:24,233
(and Jung Ah pulls out the webfoot octopus.)

623
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,134
(Perfect teamwork)

624
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:30,073
(They join forces to tear apart the sorabang.)

625
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:31,544
She's like a machine.

626
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:34,414
I think you and I work well together.

627
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,483
Jae Wook, you take care of the ones me and Jung Ah can't open.

628
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:38,514
Right.

629
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,054
Here's one.

630
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,284
(Not that it's likely to happen.)

631
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:46,854
(Words are not necessary...)

632
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:48,453
(in their flawless teamwork.)

633
00:25:48,454 --> 00:25:50,064
You're totally in sync.

634
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,064
Jae Wook, take this!

635
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,493
All right.

636
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:55,904
(Jae Wook takes care of it.)

637
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,164
Now I can relate to the dopamine rush.

638
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:01,403
(There's a clear division of labor here.)

639
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,444
Gosh, this is so big.

640
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,644
- We're good.
- We're like a factory.

641
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:09,784
(They were so absorbed in running the operation...)

642
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:14,154
(that they didn't even realize their faces were covered in mud.)

643
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:18,353
You got mud on your face.

644
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:19,694
That's okay.

645
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,324
(Impressed)

646
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,823
You all should come and stay a month next year.

647
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,464
What? A month?

648
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,734
- Are we even qualified for that?
- Sure.

649
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:31,263
(She's proving that she's qualified right away.)

650
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:33,003
Here's another one.

651
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:34,303
Look how nimble her hands are.

652
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:35,504
(Hye Yoon is skillful with her hands.)

653
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:37,973
- Gosh.
- I think she's the most skilled...

654
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:39,374
among all the guests we've had so far.

655
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:41,243
- Really?
- Really.

656
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:42,314
- Really?
- Yes.

657
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:46,253
I feel reassured with you here.

658
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:47,714
(Totally confident)

659
00:26:48,513 --> 00:26:49,683
Yes, open it.

660
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:51,483
- You're so skilled.
- Pull!

661
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:52,783
She's so nimble.

662
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:57,982
(Thanks to Hye Yoon and her unmatched work ethic, )

663
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,593
- This is fun.
- That's...

664
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,223
Come on.

665
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,963
That's it.

666
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:04,123
Really?

667
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,933
You don't want to miss anything, do you?

668
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,733
- How did you know?
- She's so good.

669
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:09,902
How did you know?

670
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,032
(Hye Yoon, the webfoot octopus ace)

671
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,502
- She's skilled and efficient.
- Yes.

672
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:14,602
(That's my daughter for you.)

673
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:15,842
Are we doing one more?

674
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,002
- Yes. We're doing three more.
- Got it.

675
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,273
- Gosh.
- We can do five more.

676
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,042
- We have such good teamwork.
- Yes.

677
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:23,312
- Our teamwork is fantastic.
- It's the best.

678
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:24,483
We have such good teamwork.

679
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:26,933
We have such good teamwork.

680
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:28,533
- Yes. Our teamwork is fantastic.
- It's the best.

681
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:29,734
We have such good teamwork.

682
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,011
Let's see how many we caught.

683
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,950
(They caught a basket full of webfoot octopuses.)

684
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,721
Their heads are full of roe.

685
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:38,521
- We caught so many.
- We caught so many.

686
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:41,651
I saw a really huge one earlier.

687
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,090
- Gosh. That's true.
- Gosh, that's really huge.

688
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,961
(Webfoot octopuses are in season, so they're full of roe!)

689
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,530
This one is huge too.

690
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,661
(This one is as big as an octopus!)

691
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,361
It's really big.

692
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,130
(Excited)

693
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,231
This is going to be tasty.

694
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,001
- What's wrong with him?
- What should I call you?

695
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,611
- What should I name you?
- Don't name it.

696
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:01,611
We won't be able to eat it.

697
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,141
(Like mother, like daughter)

698
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,981
Since you have a big head,

699
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:07,711
I'll call you Bobblehead.

700
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,921
- Hey.
- What's wrong with you?

701
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,691
Hey, Bobblehead.

702
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:14,421
What's wrong with her?

703
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,761
Stay alive, guys.

704
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,521
Bye, Bobblehead.

705
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,530
(Jung Ah's boat is moving to another point.)

706
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,260
- This is fun!
- It's fun, right?

707
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,331
Yes!

708
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,001
This is nice.

709
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,131
(Even though I'm covered in mud.)

710
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:27,871
This is nice.

711
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,971
I've gotten used to standing on a boat.

712
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,070
- I feel much more at ease.
- Right.

713
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,071
(So long, Lee Jae Puke!)

714
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,971
(Proud)

715
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,241
I was worried.

716
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,940
He was sighing 15 times.

717
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:39,951
(I'm a sailor now.)

718
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,721
I wonder how many the other boat caught.

719
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,490
Webfoot octopus

720
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,050
Come on out

721
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,090
Here they come, Jun Myun!

722
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:52,691
(Covered in mud)

723
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,031
Here they come, Jun Myun!

724
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,500
(They sacrificed their beauty to catch webfoot octopuses.)

725
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,531
There.

726
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,331
It's full of roe.

727
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,311
Gosh, my face must be really muddy right now.

728
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:12,240
(Mud splattering on her face)

729
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,250
The more the mud rises, the messier it gets.

730
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,811
(Ji Yeon still thoroughly checks the shells.)

731
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,851
(Jun Myun is a muddy mess too, from pulling at the rope with her.)

732
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,721
(Still, the hunters do their best.)

733
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:25,791
Gosh, this is hard.

734
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,861
Pulling the rope itself is really exhausting.

735
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,561
This is how precious webfoot octopuses are.

736
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,431
- It's so hard to catch them.
- Right.

737
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,540
There's 1 in about 15 shells we check.

738
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,541
- This is no joke.
- Right.

739
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,541
(Work on Jun Myun's boat is slower compared to Jung Ah's.)

740
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,970
Come on out.

741
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:41,410
(They're running out of energy fast.)

742
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,740
Come on out.

743
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,280
(Webfoot octopuses)

744
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,381
(Come on out)

745
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:52,521
(Shaman Park is chanting a spell.)

746
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,690
(This sound is the chant of a shaman, who is exhausted...)

747
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,460
(from the fishing, summoning the webfoot octopuses.)

748
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:01,030
(They won't be able to bear)

749
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:06,001
(Not coming out)

750
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,771
(Jun Myun's spell failed.)

751
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:12,400
- Gosh. My hands are...
- Do you feel it now?

752
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,071
My hands feel too weak.

753
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,440
(Please come out)

754
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,050
(Come out, please)

755
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,751
(Come out now)

756
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:25,420
(Come out, you little rascals)

757
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,921
- I think there's one here.
- I knew it.

758
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:30,461
You're amazing.

759
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,161
(Happy)

760
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:36,101
I have a feeling about this one. I was right.

761
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,000
(Impressed by themselves)

762
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,631
We're webfoot octopus hunters!

763
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,970
- Gosh. Webfoot octopus hunters!
- Webfoot octopus hunters!

764
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:43,271
(We're webfoot octopus hunters!)

765
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,371
(They look like a pathetic mess, but...)

766
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:48,641
Here's one.

767
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,281
- As it should.
- As it should.

768
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,511
No!

769
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,711
(Startled)

770
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,451
You! How dare you try to...

771
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:00,251
- I got you.
- Gosh.

772
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,291
It just looked into my eyes.

773
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,690
- Gosh.
- It just looked into my eyes.

774
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:04,821
This one's huge.

775
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:06,530
You're good at this.

776
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,890
(I have no choice.)

777
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:11,230
Webfoot octopuses, can you even bear

778
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:14,300
Not to come outside?

779
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,330
(Handling with care)

780
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,001
They're so precious.

781
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:19,170
Good job. That's it.

782
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,241
(Jun Myun's boat finally finished one row too.)

783
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,110
This isn't easy work.

784
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:26,851
- My shoulders and upper arm area...
- My upper arm area...

785
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,450
Seasickness is the least...

786
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,551
- of our concerns.
- The least of our concerns.

787
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,380
If it means we can catch webfoot octopuses.

788
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:34,451
Seasickness isn't a problem with laser-like focus...

789
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,021
and anxiety.

790
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,790
I don't feel seasick.

791
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,461
(But they can't stop the mud.)

792
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,861
Gosh, you're beautiful.

793
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,201
You're beautiful too.

794
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,201
Does the splattered mud complement me?

795
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:48,631
It complements you so well.

796
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,311
(They spot Jung Ah's boat.)

797
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,511
They're working over there.

798
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:57,881
Look, they're working.

799
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:01,311
The three of them are working side by side.

800
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:04,151
How's it going?

801
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,490
There's another one behind that.

802
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,851
(They're swamped with the factory in full swing.)

803
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:11,191
(They didn't hear Ji Yeon talking to them.)

804
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:13,261
They're busy. They can't hear you.

805
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:16,231
What are they... What's that?

806
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:19,601
They're working so conveniently on that boat.

807
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,371
(They finally came face to face with modern technology.)

808
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,870
- I didn't know that existed.
- What is that?

809
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:29,140
- I want that machine!
- They have a stand.

810
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,111
Give us that stand.

811
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,710
Gosh, seriously?

812
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:35,911
(Jun Myun and Ji Yeon feel a sense of betrayal.)

813
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,320
We were here...

814
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:39,391
(They were better off not knowing.)

815
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,791
- We should be paid more.
- Yes.

816
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,621
Pay us more money.

817
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,360
They're doing quickly thanks to the equipment.

818
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:48,591
They look like they're at a factory with that machine.

819
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:50,701
(Worn out)

820
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:53,601
- We have Pancake Im, though.
- We have Pancake Im.

821
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:59,911
(She's just here without doing anything.)

822
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,010
(Regardless, Jung Ah's factory keeps running.)

823
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,181
Twist it.

824
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,511
Here you go. Here's another one.

825
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,151
- This one?
- And here's another one.

826
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:08,181
Here's another one.

827
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:10,580
(They're still struggling to keep up with the pace.)

828
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:13,091
Great work, team! There's more coming.

829
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:16,320
- Jae Wook, pull this one out.
- Here's another one.

830
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:17,421
There's more here.

831
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,690
Jung Ah just used both her hands.

832
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:22,691
(She caught one in each hand.)

833
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,530
- You guys are showing good form.
- We are?

834
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:27,001
You're getting better.

835
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,071
Maybe we should work with you.

836
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,471
(You're always welcome to do so.)

837
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,180
This is nice. We'll be able to enjoy today's meal proudly.

838
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,581
(Today's meal will be good.)

839
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,911
(But as they keep doing this...)

840
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:42,750
(Spaced out)

841
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:44,251
I feel like I might dream about this.

842
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:47,590
(They've been at this for 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

843
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,191
- This feels like a factory.
- Right.

844
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,490
(They've processed 1,200 sorabangs.)

845
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,631
I missed one.

846
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:57,801
Gosh.

847
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,360
This is amazing.

848
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,930
(They caught so many.)

849
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:02,971
Or maybe not.

850
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:06,311
Twist it.

851
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,011
Twist it.

852
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:10,581
Gosh. Jae Wook, twist this.

853
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,310
(Even as he's getting dragged along, )

854
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,710
(he's not letting go of the webfoot octopus.)

855
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,120
Here are some more.

856
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,251
- Over there.
- Here?

857
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,890
(Though the atmosphere is quite different, )

858
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,091
- This is hard.
- Goodness.

859
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:26,120
(they're each fighting their own battles.)

860
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:28,131
- You'll end up aching all over.
- I know.

861
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:32,461
(Ji Yeon will end up aching all over too.)

862
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,001
- Hye Yoon.
- Yes?

863
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,971
- If we do a good job today, - Yes?

864
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,711
We can add beef to today's shabu-shabu.

865
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,841
Really?

866
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,670
- There are more coming.
- Let's do this.

867
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:44,240
- Yes, let's go!
- Come on!

868
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,681
(Working hard to upgrade the shabu-shabu ingredients)

869
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:48,781
I can't cook dinner after this.

870
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,750
- I can't.
- Gosh.

871
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,151
- My arms hurt so much.
- Just a little more.

872
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,051
Let's order delivery.

873
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:57,121
Let's just order stir-fried webfoot octopus.

874
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,691
(Exhaling)

875
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,261
Deep breaths in and out.

876
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,730
(They're barely holding on to their sanity.)

877
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,101
(Groaning)

878
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,671
Do you think they're done?

879
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,071
What's going on?

880
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:17,011
(Something suspicious showed up!)

881
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:18,510
It's a long-arm octopus.

882
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:20,581
- A long-arm octopus?
- Yes.

883
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,380
- A long-arm octopus?
- A long-arm octopus?

884
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,551
(Not a webfoot octopus, but a long-arm octopus?)

885
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,591
(They caught a long-arm octopus.)

886
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:31,861
- It's a long-arm octopus.
- We caught a long-arm octopus.

887
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:35,291
(The webfoot octopus hunters caught a long-arm octopus.)

888
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,600
Long-arm octopuses aren't usually caught here,

889
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,601
but today must be a special day.

890
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,370
- Goodness.
- We caught a long-arm octopus.

891
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,201
(We must have the best of luck!)

892
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:45,971
I just want to catch three more.

893
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,311
(All right!)

894
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:52,741
(The hunters gather their strength and start pulling again.)

895
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:54,751
You really have an eagle eye.

896
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:56,351
You don't miss anything.

897
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,080
(Park Jun Myun is the best webfoot octopus hunter in Joseon.)

898
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,650
She can tell without even touching.

899
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:00,921
(Park Jun Myun is the best webfoot octopus hunter in Joseon.)

900
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:03,261
(She conquers the webfoot octopus with fierce power.)

901
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,220
Gosh, Pancake Im.

902
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:06,731
(She's Im Ji Yeon, the best hook fisherman in Joseon.)

903
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:09,800
It's very big.

904
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,201
Gosh, it's huge.

905
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,871
This webfoot octopus is very huge.

906
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,071
We're good at this, aren't we?

907
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:21,241
- You are.
- Right?

908
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:22,671
- We're almost there.
- Are we?

909
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,181
- Yes, we are.
- That's it.

910
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:27,711
- You're done.
- We're done.

911
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,520
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah's boat is moving to a different spot.)

912
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,691
Jung Ah and Hye Yoon...

913
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:37,321
We worked on our chemistry so much that it's perfect, right?

914
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,020
They don't even talk to each other. When Hye Yoon twists the shell,

915
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,191
Jung Ah pulls out the webfoot octopus.

916
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,660
I twist the sorabang and show it to her.

917
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:43,701
Then she instantly...

918
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,400
- This is nice.
- Right.

919
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:49,001
(With good teamwork, the sea breeze feels extra refreshing.)

920
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,841
When all three of us...

921
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,511
are not filming anything, we should come down here...

922
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:56,880
- and make money.
- Do simple labor?

923
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,940
Yes.

924
00:36:57,941 --> 00:36:58,941
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

925
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:00,311
- When we have a lot on our minds.
- Yes.

926
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,480
Instead of going on a drive, we'll come to catch webfoot octopuses.

927
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,620
(When you feel overwhelmed, come to the webfoot octopus factory.)

928
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:05,881
- Right.
- Sounds great.

929
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:08,150
I want to catch as many as I can.

930
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:09,451
Me too.

931
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:13,290
(Just then, Jun Myun's boat comes into their line of sight.)

932
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,461
Over there.

933
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:18,201
- I'm curious how they're doing.
- Gosh. Right.

934
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,500
They were full of energy earlier, saying "We got this!"

935
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,041
(Laughing)

936
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:26,671
(Worn out)

937
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,281
(The hunters are in a pitiful condition.)

938
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,180
It seems like she's venting about something.

939
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:37,580
She's probably talking about her hand.

940
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:39,221
Our hands are...

941
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:41,891
I don't think I can cook dinner today.

942
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,791
What's going on? Is something wrong?

943
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,491
No, we're just exhausted.

944
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:48,091
Jun Myun, what's with the frown on your face?

945
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,401
- We want to do more.
- Just one more row.

946
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:53,801
We want to do one more row.

947
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:56,771
Go ahead.

948
00:37:57,671 --> 00:38:00,771
We have to pull at the rope with our hands here.

949
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,481
Gosh, I see.

950
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,450
They must not have a rail there.

951
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,711
- Gosh, that must be so hard.
- It's over here.

952
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:10,120
- You're doing one more?
- We did two rows.

953
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,251
(It's a miracle that we were able to finish two rows.)

954
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,991
Our hands feel numb right now.

955
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:17,020
- I can't cook today, Jung Ah.
- Me neither.

956
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,920
My hands are a mess.

957
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:19,931
(Jun Myun waves her hands around to get her point across.)

958
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,591
You guys just eat.

959
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,990
I'll make the food.

960
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:24,031
(Don't worry. I'll handle the cooking!)

961
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,600
You stop here. We'll keep going.

962
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:27,971
We'll quickly go and do one more row.

963
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:30,471
(Goodbye)

964
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,671
(Jung Ah's boat is on its way to work on one more row.)

965
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:36,611
We'll stop here.

966
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,480
(If you say so.)

967
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:41,411
They have three people working on that boat.

968
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,921
You think you can do one more? I don't think I can.

969
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,150
Can you do one more?

970
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:48,991
(The hunters are torn.)

971
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:51,791
(We have to be able to afford beef for Hye Yoon.)

972
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,131
- Shall we do one more?
- You want to do one more?

973
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,530
Sir, we'll work on one more row.

974
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,461
(Jun Myun and Ji Yeon decide to work on one more row.)

975
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:00,670
They don't look exhausted at all.

976
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,700
- I'm so drained.
- Why do they...

977
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,371
- not look tired at all?
- What's the reason?

978
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:05,000
Is it because they have advanced equipment?

979
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,071
Right.

980
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,111
- Here it comes.
- Here it comes.

981
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:13,211
(They're currently working on their fourth row.)

982
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:14,751
Here.

983
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:16,310
(But it's not like the work is easy here.)

984
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,481
Here.

985
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:19,050
Why do these keep slipping away?

986
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,251
Gosh, this one too.

987
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:23,090
This one is clinging too hard.

988
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:24,261
Jae Wook.

989
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,291
We're falling behind.

990
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:30,560
Goodness.

991
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,001
(The workers are being gradually pushed sideways.)

992
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,431
- There's more.
- Jae Wook.

993
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,071
Jae Wook, help.

994
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:38,971
Gosh, this is...

995
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,941
(They're now 2 hours and 40 minutes into the operation.)

996
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,281
Stop.

997
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:55,850
- Stop. Let's pause for a bit.
- Okay.

998
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,961
(The factory operation is halted.)

999
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,961
(What's going on?)

1000
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:03,701
(The rope got tangled in the motor.)

1001
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:07,000
It must be so hard to do all this by himself.

1002
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,170
Right.

1003
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:10,871
(It's impressive that he does all of this alone.)

1004
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:13,341
(Problem solved)

1005
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,181
(Operations are resumed at the webfoot octopus factory.)

1006
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,051
(Things are going smoothly.)

1007
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:21,781
Something got stuck.

1008
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:24,520
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1009
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,921
(Right after restarting, the work came to a halt again.)

1010
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,821
- Something must be stuck.
- Yes.

1011
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:33,290
The wind is blowing this way, so the rope keeps getting caught.

1012
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,531
We have to stop. The rope got stuck again.

1013
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:39,131
(The wind picked up.)

1014
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,530
(Unlike when they started working, )

1015
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:44,541
(the sky is now filled with dark clouds.)

1016
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:47,541
(The weather has clearly turned gloomy.)

1017
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,911
(Concerned)

1018
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:51,780
(Clenching her fists)

1019
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:52,980
I'm ready.

1020
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:54,511
(The webfoot octopus ace is ready to work even harder.)

1021
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,321
Here we go again.

1022
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,921
(Back to work)

1023
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:04,491
(Before the weather gets even worse, )

1024
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,431
(let's catch as many as we can!)

1025
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,960
All right. We're doing well.

1026
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:11,131
(Meanwhile, on Jun Myun's boat, )

1027
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,930
(the line isn't even getting tangled because it's all done by hand.)

1028
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,601
I can do it.

1029
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,841
(Her face doesn't look like she can do it.)

1030
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:25,841
(Brutal)

1031
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:29,411
(This is too brutal.)

1032
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:33,181
(Tear-jerking work song)

1033
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:37,891
(The captain has never seen anything like this in his life.)

1034
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,861
I'm losing my mind.

1035
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,701
There is no webfoot octopus!

1036
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:45,861
(Screaming)

1037
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:52,941
(While losing their minds, they still hold the rope tightly.)

1038
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,811
- Nothing is easy in this world.
- Right.

1039
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:59,111
- Is there nothing?
- Nothing!

1040
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:05,220
Where are you, webfoot octopus?

1041
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:07,851
(Scolding webfoot octopus for not showing up)

1042
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:10,191
You can do it

1043
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,631
Webfoot octopus, go

1044
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,831
(Continuing webfoot octopus hunting)

1045
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:21,331
(Let's go until the end!)

1046
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:28,311
(Let's go for the victory.)

1047
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:31,211
(Jung Ah's team also keeps working.)

1048
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,281
I can do it!

1049
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,421
There it is.

1050
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,591
(Leader Yum stays focused.)

1051
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:43,050
(Taking it off together)

1052
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:45,220
You two are the perfect duo.

1053
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:46,491
(Still working perfectly together)

1054
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:49,030
- This is big.
- The last one.

1055
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:52,000
- All right.
- This is the last one.

1056
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:53,001
(The last one is the extra-large size.)

1057
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,001
That's really big.

1058
00:42:54,002 --> 00:42:55,271
(Isn't it big?)

1059
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,111
- Thanks.
- Thanks for your hard work.

1060
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:05,110
(The number of sorabangs they worked on was about 3,500.)

1061
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:06,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1062
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,811
- Good job.
- Let's do a high-five.

1063
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:10,520
- Thanks.
- Yes!

1064
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,621
(High-five!)

1065
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,281
(Funny ladies)

1066
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:15,290
(Sweet end after all the hard work)

1067
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,451
It was really tough.

1068
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:18,560
It ended when you finally got used to it.

1069
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:19,561
(Nodding)

1070
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:22,861
How much is what we caught worth?

1071
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:24,831
Let's see.

1072
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:26,561
(How many did they catch?)

1073
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,301
- You caught a lot.
- Really?

1074
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:31,170
(They caught 15kg of webfoot octopus that day.)

1075
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:32,541
You really caught a lot.

1076
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:35,811
If you could catch this much,

1077
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,140
one of you could keep working here.

1078
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:40,681
(One of you, stay here to work with me.)

1079
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,551
It's done.

1080
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,180
Let's go back.

1081
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:47,220
(Going back to the land after tough work)

1082
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:49,291
Do you have a headache or something from the cold wind?

1083
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,520
No, I'm good.

1084
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:52,691
(Worrying about Hye Yoon catching a cold)

1085
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,891
Your number is still saved as "Ye Seo" on my phone.

1086
00:43:55,991 --> 00:43:57,001
Really?

1087
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,860
It's not Kim Hye Yoon but Ye Seo.

1088
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:01,631
(Hye Yoon is still like a daughter to Jung Ah.)

1089
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:04,571
(Shy)

1090
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:06,241
Let's have fun today.

1091
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,041
- It sounds good.
- Ye Seo.

1092
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,441
Yes.

1093
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:12,281
Are you happy I'm not scolding you to study?

1094
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,381
Yes.

1095
00:44:13,382 --> 00:44:14,481
(Promising to make many good memories)

1096
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,780
- The port here is so beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

1097
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:17,781
It's so pretty.

1098
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:23,461
(The webfoot octopus factory workers are leaving work.)

1099
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,761
(Jun Myun's boat is arriving.)

1100
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,101
(Hold my arm, Jun Myun.)

1101
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:31,361
(The webfoot octopus hunters arrived safely.)

1102
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:32,561
I'm so tired.

1103
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:37,200
(Reuniting after three hours)

1104
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,470
Come on!

1105
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:40,571
They look like they worked on a different thing.

1106
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:44,111
(Before getting on the boats, )

1107
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,511
(the siblings looked fine.)

1108
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:51,051
(Leader Yum is coming to greet them.)

1109
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,064
(Before getting on the boats, )

1110
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:55,564
(the siblings looked fine.)

1111
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:59,634
(Leader Yum is coming to greet them.)

1112
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:00,744
I'm so tired.

1113
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:03,744
(Bursting into laughter)

1114
00:45:04,214 --> 00:45:05,813
(They went to catch webfoot octopuses.)

1115
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,913
- What happened to you?
- I'm exhausted.

1116
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,744
(It looks like webfoot octopuses caught them.)

1117
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:12,014
It was so hard.

1118
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:13,084
(She doesn't know what to say.)

1119
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:16,973
I think I need to go home to Seoul.

1120
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:18,543
It was really tough.

1121
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:20,984
How come you all look clean? What is it?

1122
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:23,184
They had the automated machine.

1123
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,853
- Look at my face.
- It's a mess. It was all splashed.

1124
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:26,854
(Her face tells everything.)

1125
00:45:26,914 --> 00:45:29,353
(You did a great job.)

1126
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:32,354
Thanks for your hard work on catching webfoot octopuses today.

1127
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:33,794
We'll pay you now.

1128
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:37,234
(Hurrying)

1129
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,833
The pay is calculated for each rope.

1130
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,103
Is it about 20 dollars? Or 30 dollars?

1131
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,104
(How much are they paid for 7 ropes?)

1132
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:44,304
Four.

1133
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:45,734
(Quite a lot of money)

1134
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:47,744
- It's quite a lot.
- One, two, three, four.

1135
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,373
(Excited)

1136
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,173
It's 210 dollars.

1137
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:54,284
(They are paid 210 dollars for a total of 7 ropes.)

1138
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,144
Thank you so much for your hard work today.

1139
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:57,814
Please take this with you

1140
00:45:57,914 --> 00:45:59,783
and cook shabu-shabu with it.

1141
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:01,083
Thanks a lot.

1142
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:03,794
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1143
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:07,494
(Fresh members caught it themselves.)

1144
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:10,594
(A box of egg-filled webfoot octopus)

1145
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:15,464
I feel bad to just let you go like this.

1146
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:17,674
There is a noodle place that the women's association runs.

1147
00:46:18,104 --> 00:46:20,804
They make great dishes. I told them about you.

1148
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:22,603
So, enjoy the food before you leave.

1149
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:24,443
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

1150
00:46:24,444 --> 00:46:26,313
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

1151
00:46:26,314 --> 00:46:29,313
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1152
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:30,453
Thank you.

1153
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,953
Thank you.

1154
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,424
(On another grateful day, webfoot octopus fishing is done.)

1155
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:38,354
The best webfoot octopus is from Boryeong!

1156
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:41,694
The best webfoot octopus is from Boryeong!

1157
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:46,234
(The best egg-filled webfoot octopus from Boryeong)

1158
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:50,674
(After same-day auctions and sales, )

1159
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:54,104
(with a spirit of a fresh spring sea, )

1160
00:46:58,744 --> 00:47:01,684
(it was delivered all over the country.)

1161
00:47:03,014 --> 00:47:04,313
(Today's lunch)

1162
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:06,884
I think that is it. That noodle place.

1163
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:10,694
(The noodle place next to the sea)

1164
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,924
This is a noodle place. They have spicy noodles.

1165
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:15,763
It sounds good.

1166
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:18,164
(Parboiled webfoot octopus and noodles)

1167
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,703
(Webfoot octopus that was caught today)

1168
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,534
(Parboil them slightly in boiling water.)

1169
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:26,734
(Bouncy)

1170
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:30,644
(Cutting the big webfoot octopus)

1171
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,073
The webfoot octopus is big.

1172
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:34,413
It's also in season.

1173
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:35,614
(Parboiled egg-filled webfoot octopus)

1174
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,383
(Rich anchovy broth)

1175
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:40,383
- It'll be hot and tasty.
- Right.

1176
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:42,454
(Hot banquet noodles with Manila clams)

1177
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:43,754
(The seasoning with kimchi aged for 3 years)

1178
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:48,064
(Mixing with noodles)

1179
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:52,594
(Spicy and sour noodles with a crunchy texture.)

1180
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:58,174
(Made by the women's association in town)

1181
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:01,874
- Spicy noodles.
- It looks delicious.

1182
00:48:04,274 --> 00:48:06,644
- Her face. It was messy.
- Are you okay, Jun Myun?

1183
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:12,554
It must've been really tough for them.

1184
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:15,083
I thought they worked as we did.

1185
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:17,223
So, I wondered why it was tough.

1186
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:20,394
Our boat was different from yours.

1187
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:21,494
- Yes.
- It was different.

1188
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:25,434
We had to pull it with our hands.

1189
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:27,233
So, it was...

1190
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:28,964
Did you take it off while pulling it up?

1191
00:48:29,064 --> 00:48:30,673
- Yes.
- Yes, we took it off...

1192
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,304
- while pulling it up.
- We had to do it.

1193
00:48:33,234 --> 00:48:34,904
We stopped pulling and took it off.

1194
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,373
As we were pulling it up...

1195
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,974
My hands are so tired.

1196
00:48:38,074 --> 00:48:39,414
How was it, Hye Yoon?

1197
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:44,884
We had an automated machine, not hand-operated.

1198
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:48,053
- Anyway, she was good.
- She worked so well.

1199
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:49,184
- No.
- I'm serious.

1200
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:51,424
- Is she really meticulous?
- I think she is.

1201
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:54,794
After she did two shells,

1202
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:58,294
she started twisting them and put her fingers into them.

1203
00:48:58,594 --> 00:49:00,963
(Meticulous Hye Yoon)

1204
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:01,964
(Embarrassed)

1205
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:03,003
She could do it at once.

1206
00:49:03,004 --> 00:49:05,134
- She's skillful.
- No, I'm not.

1207
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:07,643
She's even humble.

1208
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,704
(Snorting)

1209
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:11,374
(Shy)

1210
00:49:11,544 --> 00:49:12,544
She's cute.

1211
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:16,844
I really wanted hot soup.

1212
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,814
- Help yourself, Hye Yoon.
- Yes.

1213
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,054
(Shall I start with the soup?)

1214
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,354
- It's good.
- The soup is amazing.

1215
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:31,334
The soup is really refreshing.

1216
00:49:32,194 --> 00:49:35,064
(The soup tastes good after hard work)

1217
00:49:36,134 --> 00:49:38,734
(Now that the body warms up, she's having noodles.)

1218
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:48,114
The banquet noodles taste so good.

1219
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:52,654
It tastes like the one my mom made.

1220
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,754
Yes, it does.

1221
00:49:56,084 --> 00:49:58,054
(The taste warms up the body.)

1222
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,864
(This is it!)

1223
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:08,334
(It's impossible to stop eating.)

1224
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,464
It's so good.

1225
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,134
(Hot soup is perfect after work.)

1226
00:50:13,134 --> 00:50:15,374
(And, here is...)

1227
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:18,644
(Staring)

1228
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:22,314
(Falling in love with spicy noodles)

1229
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:24,414
(Slurping)

1230
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:27,953
(Amazed)

1231
00:50:27,954 --> 00:50:29,283
- Is it good?
- Do you want to try it?

1232
00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:30,924
- Yes, just a little bit.
- It's good.

1233
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,394
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1234
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,134
(Agreed)

1235
00:50:39,894 --> 00:50:41,903
The noodles are cooked perfectly.

1236
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,363
- Really?
- Yes.

1237
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:44,834
(Jae Wook is already...)

1238
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:48,144
(so into spicy noodles.)

1239
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:50,713
(He continues eating...)

1240
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,774
(red noodles.)

1241
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:55,414
(Is he that hungry?)

1242
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:57,883
(He finished it after five bites.)

1243
00:50:57,884 --> 00:50:59,514
(Scraping the bowl)

1244
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:01,884
(The other members are still eating.)

1245
00:51:02,484 --> 00:51:04,554
(He finished a bowl of spicy noodles.)

1246
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:07,094
(Clean)

1247
00:51:07,694 --> 00:51:09,764
(Sighing)

1248
00:51:10,224 --> 00:51:12,464
- I really like the spicy noodles.
- It's good.

1249
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:15,404
- The webfoot octopus is big.
- Yes.

1250
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,034
(Shall I try the fresh webfoot octopus?)

1251
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:21,644
(Happy)

1252
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,674
(Eating the head of webfoot octopus)

1253
00:51:25,074 --> 00:51:27,214
(Surprised)

1254
00:51:28,444 --> 00:51:29,684
The webfoot octopus is so good.

1255
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:32,054
(Tender and chewy webfoot octopus)

1256
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,483
The webfoot octopus is good.

1257
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:34,984
(Hye Yoon also tastes it.)

1258
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:37,184
(Surprised)

1259
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,323
(The webfoot octopus lover...)

1260
00:51:40,324 --> 00:51:43,194
(tastes the head first.)

1261
00:51:43,224 --> 00:51:45,364
- The noodles are cooked well.
- There are eggs.

1262
00:51:46,464 --> 00:51:49,304
Since it's in season, it's filled with eggs.

1263
00:51:49,604 --> 00:51:52,334
(The egg-filled webfoot octopus in season is tastier)

1264
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,244
(I love eggs.)

1265
00:51:55,674 --> 00:51:58,144
(Eating only the eggs)

1266
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,784
(The enemy of the webfoot octopus)

1267
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:06,154
(She's in the zone.)

1268
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:08,384
Ji Yeon likes the head.

1269
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:11,324
(The head of the webfoot octopus is the size of a tennis ball.)

1270
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:15,024
Are you okay?

1271
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:17,994
- Do you need scissors to cut it?
- No. It's tasty.

1272
00:52:18,564 --> 00:52:19,734
The webfoot octopus is really good.

1273
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,304
I can't stop eating it.

1274
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:23,133
- Everything is delicious.
- Yes.

1275
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:24,303
- It's so good.
- Yes.

1276
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:25,574
(Delicious lunch with egg-filled webfoot octopus)

1277
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,334
(Turning her head)

1278
00:52:28,004 --> 00:52:29,204
Did you finish?

1279
00:52:29,904 --> 00:52:31,173
(I'm full.)

1280
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:32,974
(But...)

1281
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:34,844
I want a twisted donut.

1282
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:36,744
- I want a glutinous rice donut.
- And some coffee.

1283
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:39,184
- It'd be delicious.
- Glutinous rice donuts.

1284
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:41,583
(She just said she finished eating.)

1285
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:42,753
It'll be in a market.

1286
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:43,924
(Let's go to a market.)

1287
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:47,964
(There's always room for dessert.)

1288
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:51,734
(Going to do some grocery shopping)

1289
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,533
A market? Are we going to a market?

1290
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:55,534
Yes.

1291
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:56,534
(Going to a market, leaving the sea behind)

1292
00:52:56,964 --> 00:52:59,574
(Heading to a market, driving alongside the view of Boryeong)

1293
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,144
(Driving alongside the wide sea)

1294
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:06,444
(Watching spring flowers that just bloomed)

1295
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,584
It's cherry blossom!

1296
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:11,484
When would we get to see something like this?

1297
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,114
It's so beautiful.

1298
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:18,093
Do you have the grocery shopping list?

1299
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,124
- Yes, we wrote it down.
- We wrote it down.

1300
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:22,694
I can't get myself together.

1301
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:26,194
Why did you keep opening your eyes? I told you to just take a nap.

1302
00:53:26,964 --> 00:53:28,204
I did take a nap.

1303
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,664
Do you want anything for shabu-shabu?

1304
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,274
For shabu-shabu?

1305
00:53:33,434 --> 00:53:34,843
Hye Yoon loves mushrooms.

1306
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,804
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

1307
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:38,414
Which one do you like?

1308
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:40,243
- I like both.
- Get both of them.

1309
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:42,013
Let's make a generous meal.

1310
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:43,184
(Today's dinner is webfoot octopus and mushroom shabu-shabu.)

1311
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:47,414
Get your favorite dried snacks.

1312
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:50,994
I can't believe I'll have a drink with Ye Seo.

1313
00:53:51,424 --> 00:53:53,994
(Her daughter has grown up.)

1314
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,293
This is the last one.

1315
00:53:56,294 --> 00:53:57,764
(Completing the grocery shopping)

1316
00:53:58,394 --> 00:54:00,834
(Heading to a market next to the supermarket)

1317
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,134
- Hotteok will be delicious.
- I can smell hotteok.

1318
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:04,873
Hotteok.

1319
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,074
(Delicious smell that draws them)

1320
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:08,304
Yes, this is it.

1321
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:11,013
Hotteok looks so good.

1322
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,114
(Sweet and chewy hotteok)

1323
00:54:12,644 --> 00:54:13,713
(Freshly fired corn dog)

1324
00:54:13,714 --> 00:54:14,814
Look at that.

1325
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:17,043
- I want a corn dog, too.
- Me too.

1326
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:18,714
(We can't skip these snacks.)

1327
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:20,283
- Let's get four corn dogs.
- Four corn dogs.

1328
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,654
Four corn dogs and four hotteoks.

1329
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:27,564
(Freshly made hotteok)

1330
00:54:29,794 --> 00:54:30,863
(Fried crunchy corn dogs)

1331
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:33,164
- It looks delicious.
- Which sauce do you want?

1332
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:36,303
- For one, please cover with sugar.
- Sugar for one.

1333
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:38,004
(Rolling it on sugar)

1334
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:39,903
It'll be delicious.

1335
00:54:39,904 --> 00:54:42,144
(Spreading ketchup)

1336
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:44,413
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1337
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,344
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Have a good day.

1338
00:54:47,014 --> 00:54:49,214
- We can have a corn dog now.
- Okay.

1339
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,454
- It's hot.
- Here it is. Which one do you like?

1340
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,483
- Hotteok?
- Yes.

1341
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:54,584
(Hotteoks and corn dogs taste best when freshly made.)

1342
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:58,294
(Crunchy)

1343
00:55:00,054 --> 00:55:01,364
(It's hot.)

1344
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:03,063
(Having a bite again)

1345
00:55:03,064 --> 00:55:04,994
We could do it more if we want.

1346
00:55:05,694 --> 00:55:07,464
- This corn dog is good.
- Yes.

1347
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,063
It's really good.

1348
00:55:09,064 --> 00:55:10,664
(It's so crunchy because it's freshly fried.)

1349
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:15,874
(Ji Yeon is eating a corn dog, too.)

1350
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:21,714
(Only Hye Yoon is eating the hotteok.)

1351
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,814
(It's tasty.)

1352
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:29,654
(Sharing the corn dog)

1353
00:55:31,124 --> 00:55:33,254
(Enjoying their snacks)

1354
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:35,564
- I think the dough is special.
- Yes.

1355
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:38,434
This corn dog is perfectly chewy.

1356
00:55:39,864 --> 00:55:41,533
I didn't know it was made this way.

1357
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:45,634
(Going home, having snacks)

1358
00:55:46,374 --> 00:55:47,403
Let's go in.

1359
00:55:47,404 --> 00:55:49,404
(Coming back home with Hye Yoon)

1360
00:55:49,774 --> 00:55:51,043
Let's take a break until 5pm.

1361
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:52,044
(Fresh House's Breaktime)

1362
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:53,974
- I'll go to wash first.
- Yes.

1363
00:55:55,244 --> 00:55:56,983
Hye Yoon, make yourself at home.

1364
00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:58,014
Okay.

1365
00:55:58,854 --> 00:55:59,953
(Jung Ah worries about Hye Yoon, who came early in the morning.)

1366
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:01,024
I'm tired.

1367
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:05,494
(Hye Yoon's way of taking a break)

1368
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:08,194
The bag is cute.

1369
00:56:09,694 --> 00:56:11,834
(Watching Fresh members' bags)

1370
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:15,704
(It seems she really likes the bag.)

1371
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:20,704
(Checking the tag)

1372
00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:25,074
(I'll buy it when I go back to Seoul.)

1373
00:56:26,074 --> 00:56:29,283
(Checking her face)

1374
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:30,484
I look fine.

1375
00:56:31,384 --> 00:56:32,954
Am I talking to myself too much?

1376
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,484
(Pause)

1377
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,194
(Thinking about what to do)

1378
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:49,564
(Massaging her back with a foam roller)

1379
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,574
(Satisfied)

1380
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:56,004
(Exclaiming)

1381
00:56:57,674 --> 00:56:59,043
(Hey!)

1382
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:00,544
I can't move.

1383
00:57:03,344 --> 00:57:04,783
(Whatever)

1384
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:06,214
I'll just take a nap.

1385
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:09,284
(A new way to use a foam roller)

1386
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:12,724
(Sleeping soundly)

1387
00:57:16,994 --> 00:57:19,564
(What are you doing?)

1388
00:57:19,864 --> 00:57:21,864
(Embarrassed)

1389
00:57:22,004 --> 00:57:23,664
I was trying to work out.

1390
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:26,204
- What?
- But I can't.

1391
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:29,173
While working out, I found out this position was comfortable.

1392
00:57:29,174 --> 00:57:30,873
(Laughing)

1393
00:57:30,874 --> 00:57:32,944
(You're unbelievable.)

1394
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:34,984
Get some sleep.

1395
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:36,814
I should take a nap.

1396
00:57:37,384 --> 00:57:38,953
- I can take a nap now.
- Yes, you can.

1397
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,253
(Taking out a pillow for her)

1398
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:41,424
I'll take a nap now.

1399
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:43,324
Thanks.

1400
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:44,994
That's enough.

1401
00:57:46,124 --> 00:57:47,594
Get some sleep. Or you’ll be tired later.

1402
00:57:48,194 --> 00:57:49,864
Preparing dinner is a lot of work.

1403
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:51,564
Really?

1404
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:55,764
Why does he keep saying everything is tough?

1405
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:01,174
He sighed 15 times when we went to catch webfoot octopuses.

1406
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,274
He says everything is tough.

1407
00:58:03,544 --> 00:58:05,343
He says making dinner is tough.

1408
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:06,874
He says catching webfoot octopus is tough.

1409
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:09,314
That's not like him.

1410
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:14,584
Jae Wook got weak.

1411
00:58:19,694 --> 00:58:20,723
(Whatever. I'll just take a nap.)

1412
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:21,924
This feels so good.

1413
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:25,864
- Hye Yoon.
- Yes?

1414
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:27,964
Take a nap in my room.

1415
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:31,174
It'll get noisy here when Jung Ah comes and dries her hair.

1416
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,003
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1417
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:34,374
(Her friend's thoughtful gesture)

1418
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,244
Thanks. I won't say no to that.

1419
00:58:39,844 --> 00:58:43,144
(Thanks to thoughtful Jae Wook)

1420
00:58:44,784 --> 00:58:47,414
(She's finally lying down.)

1421
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:50,584
(Is she asleep?)

1422
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:56,324
(Checking the room temperature to see if it's cold)

1423
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:59,564
(Carefully)

1424
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:05,874
(She doesn't want her guest to catch a cold.)

1425
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:12,344
(Putting a duvet on her)

1426
00:59:14,544 --> 00:59:17,414
(Closing the door for her to rest quietly)

1427
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:20,384
She's sleeping soundly.

1428
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:22,284
She must've been exhausted.

1429
00:59:22,454 --> 00:59:24,124
She had the last shoot of her drama yesterday.

1430
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,194
We usually film a lot of scenes on the last day.

1431
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:28,524
It must've been exhausting.

1432
00:59:30,224 --> 00:59:31,634
Then, she came here straight.

1433
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:34,734
She's nice.

1434
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:36,633
She's so meticulous and kind.

1435
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,034
She's really kind.

1436
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:44,573
When I was filming "Cleaning Up" three years ago,

1437
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:46,673
she came for a special appearance.

1438
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:48,583
She came several times.

1439
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:50,514
(Jung Ah was thankful to Hye Yoon for coming several times.)

1440
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:51,784
Hye Yoon is nice.

1441
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,023
Also, she's such a great actor.

1442
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,754
- She is indeed.
- Seriously.

1443
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:01,023
When she was doing "SKY Castle,"

1444
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:02,194
she was a rookie.

1445
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:04,394
(Admiring)

1446
01:00:04,464 --> 01:00:05,964
She knew what to do.

1447
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:09,363
- She works well, doesn't she?
- Yes.

1448
01:00:09,364 --> 01:00:10,834
She never missed her lines.

1449
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:12,934
She never messed up her lines.

1450
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:15,804
- She's thorough.
- Yes.

1451
01:00:17,174 --> 01:00:21,284
(She'll take a thorough nap.)

1452
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:25,014
(The sun sets.)

1453
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:29,024
(It's time to prepare dinner.)

1454
01:00:30,324 --> 01:00:33,194
(Jae Wook comes to wake Hye Yoon up.)

1455
01:00:33,694 --> 01:00:34,864
Ms. Kim Hye Yoon.

1456
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:36,864
What?

1457
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:39,164
- Shall I wake up?
- It's nighttime.

1458
01:00:39,394 --> 01:00:40,494
Really?

1459
01:00:41,434 --> 01:00:42,533
"Really?"

1460
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:43,563
(Jae Wook loves making fun of Hye Yoon.)

1461
01:00:43,564 --> 01:00:45,174
It's the morning.

1462
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:46,874
I mean, it's daytime.

1463
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,874
(Let's go and prepare dinner.)

1464
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:54,913
(What do people make for dinner in Hapyeong Village...)

1465
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:57,244
(as the sun sets?)

1466
01:00:58,854 --> 01:01:02,654
(Camelia flowers have bloomed at Ms. Han Ok's house.)

1467
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:06,494
(My mom made tasty side dishes.)

1468
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:11,234
Webfoot octopuses and scallions are the tastiest now.

1469
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:16,433
I harvested these scallions from my garden yesterday.

1470
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:18,234
(She blanches the scallions she grew and squeezes out excess water.)

1471
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:20,503
Bell pepper, crab stick...

1472
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:23,574
(Wrap bell peppers and crab sticks with scallions.)

1473
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:25,743
It's crunchy and chewy.

1474
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:27,444
(The chewy and crunchy texture is as fun as the vibrant colors.)

1475
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:29,383
(Then the springtime delicacy of Boryeong, )

1476
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:30,683
Webfoot octopus

1477
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:33,184
(webfoot octopuses get blanched.)

1478
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:37,683
Webfoot octopus and scallion sashimi.

1479
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:40,024
(Webfoot octopus and scallion sashimi are complete.)

1480
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:43,323
(She adds a heap of fragrant mugwort.)

1481
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,133
I add mugwort when it boils.

1482
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,134
(It's mugwort and doenjang soup.)

1483
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,063
I add perilla seed powder.

1484
01:01:48,064 --> 01:01:50,004
(Add the nutty perilla seed powder and boil.)

1485
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:51,733
It's mugwort and doenjang soup.

1486
01:01:51,734 --> 01:01:54,774
(Mugwort and doenjang soup)

1487
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:58,313
(This is Ms. Han Ok's dinner with the scent of spring.)

1488
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,314
(Webfoot octopus and scallion sashimi, )

1489
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:00,314
(seasoned coastal hog fennel, and mugwort and doenjang soup)

1490
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:03,514
(Meanwhile, Ms. Kim Ok Ja's house)

1491
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:06,854
(Ms. Kim Ok Ja is also making a side dish using mugwort.)

1492
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:10,884
Chili powder, doenjang, and soy sauce.

1493
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:15,424
(The best fish in spring, flounder appears.)

1494
01:02:15,894 --> 01:02:18,764
Mugwort and flounder make a good combination.

1495
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:24,534
(She boils everything with the flounder in season.)

1496
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:28,504
(Braised flounder and mugwort)

1497
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,373
(Ms. Kim Ok Ja's dinner can only be eaten in spring.)

1498
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:33,374
(Scallion kimchi, braised flounder and mugwort, and seasoned scallions)

1499
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:35,083
(What will the Fresh members eat for dinner today?)

1500
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,614
For dinner...

1501
01:02:36,814 --> 01:02:39,453
(A webfoot octopus...)

1502
01:02:39,454 --> 01:02:41,084
(set meal)

1503
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:43,754
(They add fresh webfoot octopuses without reservation.)

1504
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:47,754
(King-sized webfoot octopus shabu-shabu)

1505
01:02:48,194 --> 01:02:52,494
(A cheat code for a rainy day, fried webfoot octopus)

1506
01:02:53,094 --> 01:02:58,674
(A new dish, 30-minute cucumber kimchi)

1507
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:03,804
(The rising side-dish master, Ji Yeon's dried squid stir-fry)

1508
01:03:04,304 --> 01:03:06,613
(Shall we make a tasty meal today?)

1509
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:08,614
Let's clean the ingredients.

1510
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:11,953
What should I do?

1511
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,914
(Inside the box Jae Wook brings...)

1512
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:18,593
(are the webfoot octopuses they caught today.)

1513
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,724
There are a lot.

1514
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:21,963
(Boryeong's huge webfoot octopuses)

1515
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,394
- Are they alive?
- Yes.

1516
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:25,393
They're alive.

1517
01:03:25,394 --> 01:03:26,734
(They're still fresh.)

1518
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:28,133
- They're alive.
- Are they alive?

1519
01:03:28,134 --> 01:03:29,934
- Yes.
- My goodness.

1520
01:03:30,564 --> 01:03:31,803
Flour.

1521
01:03:31,804 --> 01:03:32,804
(Jung Ah's tip for rinsing the webfoot octopuses)

1522
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:34,173
- The suction cups...
- It feels strange.

1523
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:35,703
Might have dirt.

1524
01:03:35,704 --> 01:03:37,674
(Rub with flour to clean the dirt in the suction cups.)

1525
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,613
Look at the color.

1526
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:42,114
The dirt is coming out.

1527
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:46,654
(Rub the flour on the suction cups thoroughly.)

1528
01:03:47,354 --> 01:03:49,354
(Staring)

1529
01:03:50,454 --> 01:03:52,353
- Hye Yoon, do you want to do it?
- Shall I do it?

1530
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:53,624
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

1531
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,193
It looked like you wanted to try it.

1532
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:56,393
(She wanted to try it.)

1533
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:58,294
I don't know if I'll be able to do well.

1534
01:03:59,494 --> 01:04:01,704
(She's cute.)

1535
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,463
(She ties her long hair...)

1536
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:06,104
(with a hair clip.)

1537
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:08,444
(Then she washes her hands.)

1538
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:12,914
(Hye Yoon begins to help them clean the webfoot octopuses.)

1539
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:15,083
It's like a tactile play.

1540
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,344
- Right?
- Yes.

1541
01:04:16,614 --> 01:04:17,713
(It sticks to her palm!)

1542
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:19,583
- It's so strong.
- Can you see it?

1543
01:04:19,584 --> 01:04:20,584
Yes.

1544
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,253
It isn't dead yet.

1545
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:23,323
It's still alive.

1546
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:24,894
(Chuckling)

1547
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:26,993
I'll wash it.

1548
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:28,263
(They rinse the webfoot octopuses as they enjoy the strange texture.)

1549
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,123
Aren't the suction cups fascinating?

1550
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:33,234
(The webfoot octopuses become clean.)

1551
01:04:34,034 --> 01:04:36,164
I'll only use the legs for the fried dish.

1552
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,503
The bodies are tasty.

1553
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,104
- Let's use them for shabu-shabu.
- Shall we do that?

1554
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:45,044
Let's cut the legs for the fried dish.

1555
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:51,184
(She begins to prepare the webfoot octopuses for frying.)

1556
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:53,653
It's alive.

1557
01:04:53,654 --> 01:04:56,453
(She attempts to separate the head and legs.)

1558
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:57,554
(Gosh!)

1559
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:00,594
(Oh, my)

1560
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:01,763
- The eyes...
- Isn't it too big?

1561
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:02,794
Shall I cut it in half?

1562
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:05,063
Jung Ah, I think it'll be okay to fry one leg at a time.

1563
01:05:05,064 --> 01:05:06,734
Two legs at a time.

1564
01:05:07,764 --> 01:05:09,863
(That means...)

1565
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,774
(I'll need to do more slicing!)

1566
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:16,674
(She cuts two legs at a time.)

1567
01:05:17,374 --> 01:05:19,143
Is it really a webfoot octopus?

1568
01:05:19,144 --> 01:05:20,544
How is it so big?

1569
01:05:20,714 --> 01:05:23,283
Did you catch regular octopuses instead?

1570
01:05:23,284 --> 01:05:24,384
(Suspicious)

1571
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:26,653
- Each leg is as big as a squid's.
- Yes.

1572
01:05:26,654 --> 01:05:29,024
(The legs are quite big.)

1573
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,853
Are they big in this neighborhood?

1574
01:05:30,854 --> 01:05:32,524
Are they the same in other places as well?

1575
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:36,864
(Big webfoot octopuses from Boryeong Training Center)

1576
01:05:36,964 --> 01:05:39,033
I've never imagined webfoot octopuses to be so big.

1577
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:41,764
(The size is beyond imagination.)

1578
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:43,433
All done.

1579
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:45,073
(She cut the webfoot octopus legs with much effort for frying.)

1580
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,274
(They get blanched to remove the mucus.)

1581
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:51,744
(The webfoot octopuses for frying are ready.)

1582
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:53,414
All done.

1583
01:05:54,444 --> 01:05:56,643
They're for shabu-shabu.

1584
01:05:56,644 --> 01:05:58,314
(The webfoot octopuses for shabu-shabu are complete.)

1585
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:01,084
Can I get some water in here?

1586
01:06:01,114 --> 01:06:02,823
- What water? Oh, okay.
- I...

1587
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:03,984
just need to boil water.

1588
01:06:04,524 --> 01:06:05,624
What is it for?

1589
01:06:06,054 --> 01:06:07,123
Cucumber kimchi.

1590
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:08,564
(Cucumber kimchi!)

1591
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,293
(Why does she need to boil water to make cucumber kimchi?)

1592
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:14,164
(It'll be revealed soon.)

1593
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:17,104
It's the quick cucumber kimchi.

1594
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:19,403
(Salt, )

1595
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:20,933
(season, )

1596
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:22,904
(and mix.)

1597
01:06:23,174 --> 01:06:25,613
(The process only takes 30 minutes.)

1598
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,814
(Seasoning Park's secrets will be revealed!)

1599
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:29,983
It's a quick dish.

1600
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:32,054
(It might end too soon, so follow the steps with care.)

1601
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:36,624
(Cut off the ends of the fresh cucumbers.)

1602
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:39,824
(Cut them into pieces that have two fingers' width.)

1603
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:44,194
(With one end intact, make X-shaped cuts.)

1604
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:47,964
(Don't cut them through since the seasoning needs to go in.)

1605
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:51,674
(It's the textbook example of the cucumber kimchi shape.)

1606
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:55,804
(She's absorbed in the cucumbers.)

1607
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:59,574
(Running a cucumber factory)

1608
01:06:59,874 --> 01:07:01,884
Jun Myun, the water is boiling. Shall I bring it to you?

1609
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:04,013
No, I need to add salt.

1610
01:07:04,014 --> 01:07:05,914
I'm coming. Hold on a second.

1611
01:07:06,384 --> 01:07:09,953
(She hurriedly cuts the last piece.)

1612
01:07:09,954 --> 01:07:13,294
(Seasoning Park is coming.)

1613
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:16,124
Jun Myun, what is the water for?

1614
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:17,464
- I'll make salt water...
- Okay.

1615
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:19,033
To salt the cucumbers.

1616
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,563
I see. Okay.

1617
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:23,334
(She dissolves coarse salt in the boiling water.)

1618
01:07:24,534 --> 01:07:28,074
(All the cucumber pieces go in!)

1619
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,403
(Seasoning Park's tip for the 30-minute cucumber kimchi:)

1620
01:07:30,404 --> 01:07:31,973
(If you salt the cucumber pieces in hot salt water for 15 minutes, )

1621
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:33,544
(they'll stay crunchy and absorb the seasoning faster.)

1622
01:07:33,974 --> 01:07:35,513
Is that how you make...

1623
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:37,013
- cucumber kimchi?
- Yes.

1624
01:07:37,014 --> 01:07:38,614
I guess so. Isn't it cool?

1625
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:40,984
(It's nothing.)

1626
01:07:41,154 --> 01:07:42,553
(Now come the ingredients for the seasoning such as carrot...)

1627
01:07:42,554 --> 01:07:44,624
(and garlic chives.)

1628
01:07:44,954 --> 01:07:47,553
(Sprinkling sesame seeds)

1629
01:07:47,554 --> 01:07:50,894
(Green plum syrup, ginger extract, salted shrimp, minced garlic)

1630
01:07:50,994 --> 01:07:53,963
Jae Wook, I'm making cucumber kimchi...

1631
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:55,934
- because you like it.
- Really?

1632
01:07:55,964 --> 01:07:57,134
- Yes.
- I love it.

1633
01:07:57,864 --> 01:07:59,033
Of course.

1634
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,674
(Adding a lot of chili powder to match her love for Jae Wook)

1635
01:08:00,974 --> 01:08:03,974
(The tasty cucumber kimchi seasoning is complete.)

1636
01:08:04,304 --> 01:08:08,884
(The two will come together soon!)

1637
01:08:09,014 --> 01:08:11,343
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen, )

1638
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,814
(Hye Yoon is preparing the vegetables.)

1639
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:15,623
(The kitchen is very spacious, )

1640
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,523
(but she's working in a corner.)

1641
01:08:17,524 --> 01:08:19,494
I saw it somewhere.

1642
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:22,924
You cut along the green line.

1643
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:28,604
(Separating with her hands)

1644
01:08:29,134 --> 01:08:33,274
(She's preparing enoki mushrooms.)

1645
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:34,774
(Oyster mushroom)

1646
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,774
(Shiitake mushroom)

1647
01:08:36,974 --> 01:08:38,514
(Bok choy)

1648
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:40,074
(One more time!)

1649
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:42,443
What's the napa cabbage for?

1650
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:43,914
Napa cabbage? Shabu-shabu!

1651
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:45,614
- No?
- Here.

1652
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,414
- Okay.
- Cut it like this.

1653
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:49,353
(Separate one leaf at a time!)

1654
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,253
- Like this...
- Shall I rinse them?

1655
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:52,724
Slice it if it's too big.

1656
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:54,323
- Okay.
- Do it only if it's big.

1657
01:08:54,324 --> 01:08:56,264
- Okay.
- The leaves inside will be small.

1658
01:08:56,294 --> 01:08:57,324
Okay.

1659
01:08:58,194 --> 01:09:01,904
(She prepares the napa cabbage as she has learned.)

1660
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,104
(Staring)

1661
01:09:04,334 --> 01:09:05,474
Hye Yoon, is that the right way?

1662
01:09:06,534 --> 01:09:07,704
Hye Yoon, is that the right way?

1663
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:09,643
Jung Ah told me to cut it like this.

1664
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:11,403
(Come on.)

1665
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:12,574
Is that the right way?

1666
01:09:12,674 --> 01:09:16,114
(Teary-eyed)

1667
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:18,284
Jung Ah told me to cut it like this.

1668
01:09:19,814 --> 01:09:21,984
- Cut it like that.
- See?

1669
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:24,723
That was so funny. You prepared them well.

1670
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:25,993
(He praises her after teasing her.)

1671
01:09:25,994 --> 01:09:27,353
She told me to cut it like this.

1672
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:29,123
(What's wrong with you?)

1673
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,824
I need to rinse them. They haven't been rinsed yet.

1674
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,764
(As Hye Yoon continues to prepare the vegetables, )

1675
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:38,673
(Ji Yeon opens the bag of dried squid.)

1676
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,834
Let's rinse it.

1677
01:09:41,004 --> 01:09:45,114
(The hard dried squid gets rinsed in water.)

1678
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:49,514
(She soaks it for a short while so that it becomes soft.)

1679
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:52,113
I'll make the seasoning.

1680
01:09:52,114 --> 01:09:53,284
Despite being inexperienced,

1681
01:09:53,614 --> 01:09:56,184
you're very good.

1682
01:09:56,884 --> 01:09:58,183
Are you talking about me?

1683
01:09:58,184 --> 01:09:59,524
Pancake Im.

1684
01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:02,363
- Please call me Seasoning Im.
- It's too early...

1685
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,463
It's too early for that title.

1686
01:10:04,464 --> 01:10:05,493
(Sighing)

1687
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:06,933
- You'll need to wait.
- I'll go ahead...

1688
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:09,104
and make the seasoning.

1689
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,634
Suit yourself.

1690
01:10:13,034 --> 01:10:14,073
Firstly...

1691
01:10:14,074 --> 01:10:16,544
(I'll show Seasoning Im's skills.)

1692
01:10:17,374 --> 01:10:19,343
Two spoonfuls of brewed soy sauce.

1693
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:20,344
(Pouring soy sauce)

1694
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:22,514
Half a spoonful of gochujang.

1695
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:24,944
Are you giving me the recipe?

1696
01:10:25,284 --> 01:10:27,814
No. I'm eyeballing the ingredients to make the seasoning.

1697
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:29,323
Minced garlic.

1698
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:30,854
(She adds minced garlic as well.)

1699
01:10:31,254 --> 01:10:34,354
It also needs chili powder. One spoonful.

1700
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:37,294
One spoonful of sugar. Gosh, it's MSG.

1701
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:40,433
(They look similar.)

1702
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:41,804
MSG makes a dish tasty.

1703
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:45,903
I don't use MSG when I cook. What are you talking about?

1704
01:10:45,904 --> 01:10:46,934
(What?)

1705
01:10:47,234 --> 01:10:48,234
(She must be confident.)

1706
01:10:48,235 --> 01:10:50,104
(Whatever)

1707
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:53,714
(She also adds two spoonfuls of sugar.)

1708
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:56,684
- Is that the seasoning?
- Yes. All done.

1709
01:10:57,844 --> 01:11:00,954
(She prepares the shishito peppers that'll get stir-fried together.)

1710
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:04,254
The shishito peppers aren't very fresh.

1711
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:08,054
Right? Aren't they too shishito?

1712
01:11:11,424 --> 01:11:13,264
They're too shishito.

1713
01:11:13,364 --> 01:11:14,364
They're too shishito.

1714
01:11:14,365 --> 01:11:17,064
("Shishito" is Hye Yoon's expression for the wilted shishito peppers.)

1715
01:11:17,134 --> 01:11:18,803
I was going to add shishito peppers only,

1716
01:11:18,804 --> 01:11:21,904
but they aren't very fresh.

1717
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:23,903
So I'll add some red chili peppers.

1718
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,374
(She hurriedly adds some red chili peppers.)

1719
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:29,314
Depending on how you tweak the recipe,

1720
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,184
the dish can taste very different.

1721
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:33,884
- So you can use...
- Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

1722
01:11:33,984 --> 01:11:36,053
- What?
- Are you giving a lecture...

1723
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:37,324
on cooking?

1724
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:39,594
Listen, Jun Myun.

1725
01:11:41,394 --> 01:11:43,293
(The two sisters begin to have a war of nerves.)

1726
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:46,893
I'm putting my soul, heart, and passion...

1727
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:49,234
- into the dried squid.
- Hey, Im Ji Yeon.

1728
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,433
That's the thing about cooking.

1729
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,704
You can go with your feel without following the exact recipe.

1730
01:11:55,004 --> 01:11:56,203
You can express yourself that way.

1731
01:11:56,204 --> 01:11:58,404
Kim Hye Yoon, did you nod just now?

1732
01:12:00,044 --> 01:12:01,144
For goodness' sake.

1733
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:03,343
What do you know about seasoning?

1734
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:04,484
(Let me run away before I get caught up.)

1735
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:09,824
I made the seasoning for the dried squid very well.

1736
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:11,993
- This is my seasoning.
- I'll judge...

1737
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,793
- Ji Yeon's seasoning.
- I want to brag about it.

1738
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:16,024
Is it for the dried squid?

1739
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:20,233
Yes. I didn't follow a recipe.

1740
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:23,204
You read up on the recipes for two hours earlier.

1741
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,603
I need to read the recipes.

1742
01:12:25,604 --> 01:12:29,204
(Exclusive: Seasoning Im was seen reading the recipes.)

1743
01:12:29,504 --> 01:12:32,344
I'll give a cool-headed review of Ji Yeon's seasoning.

1744
01:12:34,944 --> 01:12:38,144
- I guess it isn't bad.
- It isn't bad, is it?

1745
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:39,414
- No.
- How is it?

1746
01:12:39,714 --> 01:12:41,084
- What's lacking?
- It's a bit salty.

1747
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:42,583
- I see.
- I think it's a bit salty.

1748
01:12:42,584 --> 01:12:44,824
- Is it a bit salty?
- Yes. Jung Ah, try it.

1749
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:47,793
It's okay for a side dish to be a bit salty.

1750
01:12:47,794 --> 01:12:49,764
- No.
- I see.

1751
01:12:51,794 --> 01:12:55,194
It's a bit salty. I think you can make it a bit watery.

1752
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,504
- Shall I add some water?
- Yes.

1753
01:12:59,504 --> 01:13:00,704
(Scoffing)

1754
01:13:02,304 --> 01:13:06,244
How dare she try to take my title of Seasoning Park?

1755
01:13:07,114 --> 01:13:09,244
The war of nerves is no joke here.

1756
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:10,644
Excuse me?

1757
01:13:11,414 --> 01:13:12,454
Nothing, Jun Myun.

1758
01:13:13,654 --> 01:13:16,023
(They're so funny.)

1759
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,624
Apparently, it's a bit salty.

1760
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,754
(Spilling)

1761
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:22,223
What should I do?

1762
01:13:22,224 --> 01:13:24,564
(She uses the bottle cap to measure the amount.)

1763
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:26,994
The public taste is important.

1764
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:31,564
- Cook the dried squid well.
- Okay.

1765
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:34,834
Don't eat dried squid only.

1766
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:37,344
Rice and dried squid make a tasty meal.

1767
01:13:38,974 --> 01:13:40,543
Shishito peppers.

1768
01:13:40,544 --> 01:13:43,614
(Shishito peppers and red chili peppers enter.)

1769
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:49,424
(Then comes the seasoning in question.)

1770
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:50,784
I'll add a little bit.

1771
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:52,493
It's nice.

1772
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,494
(She only adds half of the seasoning.)

1773
01:13:54,594 --> 01:13:56,024
Did the recipe tell you to add half of the seasoning first?

1774
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:59,564
I just thought of the method.

1775
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:05,103
No one told me to do it. I just thought that it'd be nice.

1776
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:08,034
- I see.
- That was why I did it.

1777
01:14:08,904 --> 01:14:09,944
It smells so nice.

1778
01:14:12,944 --> 01:14:14,743
Let's add the dried squid.

1779
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:16,114
(She adds the soaked dried squid.)

1780
01:14:16,844 --> 01:14:19,483
Let's add the remaining seasoning.

1781
01:14:19,484 --> 01:14:21,484
(Add the remaining seasoning!)

1782
01:14:21,784 --> 01:14:23,884
(She mixes them well.)

1783
01:14:24,354 --> 01:14:27,053
Stir-fry them until they become soft.

1784
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:28,763
(Stir-fry until the dried squid soaks up the seasoning...)

1785
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:29,824
(and turns soft.)

1786
01:14:29,964 --> 01:14:31,223
Let's add sesame oil.

1787
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:35,834
(Add the nutty flavor with sesame oil.)

1788
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:37,464
It looks tasty.

1789
01:14:38,034 --> 01:14:39,034
It's nice.

1790
01:14:39,035 --> 01:14:40,934
(Seasoning Im's dried squid stir-fry is done!)

1791
01:14:41,404 --> 01:14:42,503
It looks tasty.

1792
01:14:42,504 --> 01:14:44,404
- Right?
- Yes. It smells amazing.

1793
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:47,074
(Sniffing)

1794
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,284
It's incredible.

1795
01:14:50,514 --> 01:14:51,943
The smell is incredible.

1796
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:52,954
(Happy)

1797
01:14:54,584 --> 01:14:56,923
My cooking skills have improved so much.

1798
01:14:56,924 --> 01:14:58,754
(The appetizing dish makes her praise herself.)

1799
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:00,524
- Hye Yoon.
- Yes?

1800
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:06,694
(She gives Hye Yoon a bite since she is curious.)

1801
01:15:08,164 --> 01:15:09,503
- It's so tasty.
- Is it tasty?

1802
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:12,333
- Yes. It's spicy.
- It's good, right?

1803
01:15:12,334 --> 01:15:13,334
- Yes.
- Is it salty by any chance?

1804
01:15:13,434 --> 01:15:14,474
- No, it isn't.
- No?

1805
01:15:14,704 --> 01:15:16,244
I could eat it by itself.

1806
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:17,903
(Seasoning Im)

1807
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:19,213
It's really tasty.

1808
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,244
(I did it.)

1809
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:23,684
(She's ridiculous.)

1810
01:15:23,884 --> 01:15:25,783
I made a side dish easily.

1811
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:28,314
(Will it captivate everyone's taste?)

1812
01:15:28,954 --> 01:15:30,154
Let's make fried webfoot octopus.

1813
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:31,754
- Shall I get the fire going?
- Yes.

1814
01:15:33,124 --> 01:15:36,624
(Get the fire going while I make the frying batter.)

1815
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:40,864
(While Jung Ah makes the frying batter, )

1816
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:44,704
(Jae Wook goes back to his main job.)

1817
01:15:45,304 --> 01:15:49,204
(Hye Yoon joins them with a basket of vegetables.)

1818
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:50,404
All right.

1819
01:15:52,074 --> 01:15:54,413
I can't believe I'm cooking a meal with Hye Yoon.

1820
01:15:54,414 --> 01:15:55,414
I know.

1821
01:15:55,614 --> 01:15:56,744
She's 30.

1822
01:15:57,244 --> 01:15:58,913
- Yes.
- I can't believe it.

1823
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:00,554
(Kim Hye Yoon, seasoned actress with 13 years of experience)

1824
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:04,354
Did Ye Seo end up going to the medical school at SNU?

1825
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:05,823
Since Ye Seo is smart,

1826
01:16:05,824 --> 01:16:07,094
- she would've done it.
- Right.

1827
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:08,754
She would've done something.

1828
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,163
The drama didn't show that she had gotten in, right?

1829
01:16:11,164 --> 01:16:12,164
No, it didn't.

1830
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:13,164
(The mom and the daughter go back 8 years.)

1831
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:15,963
You make a lot of money these days.

1832
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:19,234
(The mom and the daughter chat.)

1833
01:16:19,774 --> 01:16:22,744
(Jae Wook remembers a past.)

1834
01:16:23,174 --> 01:16:25,944
(Hye Yoon and Jae Wook were engaged in a drama.)

1835
01:16:27,214 --> 01:16:29,944
(It was quite romantic.)

1836
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,743
I played her fiance.

1837
01:16:31,744 --> 01:16:32,784
(Fiance and fiancee)

1838
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:34,114
She played your daughter.

1839
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:37,054
(They were daughter and mom.)

1840
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:38,553
(In that case)

1841
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:40,293
- She played your daughter.
- Call me Mother-in-law.

1842
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:42,124
Gosh, Mother-in-law.

1843
01:16:43,094 --> 01:16:44,094
(Mother-in-law!)

1844
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:46,294
(Making a deep bow right away)

1845
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:49,464
Mother-in-law.

1846
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:51,663
Call me Mother-in-law.

1847
01:16:51,664 --> 01:16:52,874
But things didn't work out...

1848
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:54,004
- Really?
- in the drama.

1849
01:16:54,634 --> 01:16:56,574
(I'm sorry, Baek Kyung... I mean, Jae Wook.)

1850
01:16:56,674 --> 01:16:58,074
- Thank goodness.
- Right?

1851
01:16:58,244 --> 01:17:00,114
Otherwise, things would've been awkward between us.

1852
01:17:00,914 --> 01:17:02,113
You almost became my mother-in-law.

1853
01:17:02,114 --> 01:17:03,144
(An awkward relationship)

1854
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:06,684
You even sleep next to me at times. If I'm your mother-in-law...

1855
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:08,154
(A shocking melodrama)

1856
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:10,254
It sounds so weird when you put it like that.

1857
01:17:10,954 --> 01:17:13,554
(Jung Ah and Jae Wook are fast asleep.)

1858
01:17:13,954 --> 01:17:18,794
(Meanwhile, Hye Yoon spots them in this position.)

1859
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:20,294
(Mom!)

1860
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:21,933
(Startled)

1861
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:23,334
(Hye Yoon.)

1862
01:17:24,104 --> 01:17:27,574
(To be continued)

1863
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:29,903
(Let's go and fry the webfoot octopuses.)

1864
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:30,904
Let's do it now.

1865
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:35,614
(She sets up the frying pot that's as big as her body.)

1866
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,383
(Pouring cooking oil)

1867
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:40,614
Shall we add two bottles?

1868
01:17:40,954 --> 01:17:43,624
(As the cooking oil gets heated up, )

1869
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:46,693
(she takes a plastic bag.)

1870
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:48,524
Let's coat them in flour.

1871
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,763
You'll put them in a plastic bag and shake them, right?

1872
01:17:50,764 --> 01:17:51,764
Yes.

1873
01:17:52,894 --> 01:17:54,763
Just bring the tools for frying.

1874
01:17:54,764 --> 01:17:56,334
Okay. I'll bring the tongs and such.

1875
01:17:56,904 --> 01:17:58,934
(Shaking)

1876
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,473
(Jung Ah's tip for keeping the hands clean...)

1877
01:18:01,474 --> 01:18:03,674
(while coating the ingredient in the frying powder)

1878
01:18:04,274 --> 01:18:08,244
(The webfoot octopuses are ready to be fried!)

1879
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:14,314
It comes up right away.

1880
01:18:17,754 --> 01:18:18,853
The fire is strong.

1881
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:21,254
(For frying, Jae Wook adjusted the temperature perfectly.)

1882
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:24,624
- We can put them in, right?
- We can put them in.

1883
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:26,694
(Adding another piece of webfoot octopus)

1884
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:32,534
(She shakes off the batter and puts it in the pot!)

1885
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:36,144
It'll be so tasty.

1886
01:18:39,544 --> 01:18:42,013
- You know, it's big.
- It's big.

1887
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,014
(The big-sized piece looks very appetizing.)

1888
01:18:44,014 --> 01:18:45,343
After frying it once, we'll fry it again for the color.

1889
01:18:45,344 --> 01:18:48,654
Yes. Fry it once. Then we'll fry it again later.

1890
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:51,784
Although we only fried it once, shall we try a piece?

1891
01:18:51,884 --> 01:18:52,894
Try a piece.

1892
01:18:55,254 --> 01:18:56,264
- Hye Yoon.
- Okay.

1893
01:18:57,064 --> 01:18:58,064
It's hot.

1894
01:18:58,065 --> 01:18:59,293
(Crunchy)

1895
01:18:59,294 --> 01:19:01,233
(What do you think?)

1896
01:19:01,234 --> 01:19:02,363
I only ate the fried coating.

1897
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,434
(Give it to me again.)

1898
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:07,374
(Chuckling)

1899
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:10,004
- The fried coating is tasty.
- It's hot.

1900
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:16,114
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1901
01:19:16,684 --> 01:19:19,653
It doesn't even need a sauce. It has been seasoned perfectly.

1902
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:20,784
- Has it been seasoned?
- Yes.

1903
01:19:21,184 --> 01:19:22,184
I see.

1904
01:19:22,185 --> 01:19:24,254
(Jae Wook inhales a piece as if his mouth is a suction cup.)

1905
01:19:25,154 --> 01:19:26,224
It's very tasty.

1906
01:19:28,454 --> 01:19:29,464
It's tasty.

1907
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:31,194
(Her eyes go wide.)

1908
01:19:31,194 --> 01:19:32,194
It's really tasty.

1909
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:35,464
The fried coating will stick once we fry it again.

1910
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:39,074
(Then hurry up and fry them again.)

1911
01:19:46,544 --> 01:19:48,343
- The fire is strong, so it's fast.
- Right.

1912
01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:50,114
(They become tasty in oil.)

1913
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:53,754
(He takes out the pieces when they turn golden.)

1914
01:19:54,684 --> 01:19:57,754
(Appetizing)

1915
01:19:58,724 --> 01:20:03,094
(He adds more pieces without resting!)

1916
01:20:07,064 --> 01:20:11,164
(While the webfoot octopuses get fried to perfection, )

1917
01:20:16,744 --> 01:20:20,314
(Seasoning Park checks the salted cucumber.)

1918
01:20:20,544 --> 01:20:22,073
I'm done with the dish.

1919
01:20:22,074 --> 01:20:23,613
I just need to mix in the seasoning.

1920
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:24,744
- You made it so quickly.
- I know.

1921
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:26,513
It looks tasty.

1922
01:20:26,514 --> 01:20:28,114
(The cucumbers got salted in 15 minutes.)

1923
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:31,423
(She takes out the salted cucumbers...)

1924
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:35,024
(and removes the excess water.)

1925
01:20:36,394 --> 01:20:38,264
(All preparations are done!)

1926
01:20:38,364 --> 01:20:40,034
(She picks up a piece of cucumber.)

1927
01:20:40,394 --> 01:20:42,704
(She opens the slits...)

1928
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:46,534
(to insert the seasoning to complete the dish!)

1929
01:20:48,334 --> 01:20:50,243
- It's easy.
- It looks so tasty.

1930
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:51,344
(It's easy, right?)

1931
01:20:52,744 --> 01:20:54,974
(Seasoning Park doesn't disappoint.)

1932
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:58,744
(It's the simplest recipe.)

1933
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:05,284
(But the taste isn't so simple.)

1934
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:08,253
(Amazed)

1935
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,024
- I can't believe it.
- Would you like to try one?

1936
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:12,263
(Here I come.)

1937
01:21:12,264 --> 01:21:13,634
Taste it like this.

1938
01:21:18,534 --> 01:21:20,233
(Impressed)

1939
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:21,904
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1940
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:27,844
We won't need to age it.

1941
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:29,184
It's so tasty.

1942
01:21:31,244 --> 01:21:32,413
There are so many side dishes that'll go well with rice.

1943
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:35,554
(The 30-minute cucumber kimchi is complete.)

1944
01:21:36,654 --> 01:21:40,524
(You should make it at home.)

1945
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:44,864
(Dropping)

1946
01:21:45,424 --> 01:21:49,534
(Jae Wook fries a piece of webfoot octopus again.)

1947
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,204
I should return the favor.

1948
01:21:53,704 --> 01:21:54,803
It's hot.

1949
01:21:54,804 --> 01:21:55,943
(Jun Myun, open up.)

1950
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,873
(What?)

1951
01:21:58,874 --> 01:22:00,044
It's hot.

1952
01:22:00,974 --> 01:22:03,313
- It's hot.
- My goodness.

1953
01:22:03,314 --> 01:22:05,084
(It's hot!)

1954
01:22:05,714 --> 01:22:06,814
Bite into it.

1955
01:22:07,284 --> 01:22:08,284
Bite into it.

1956
01:22:10,454 --> 01:22:14,324
(Are they having a tug of war?)

1957
01:22:14,394 --> 01:22:15,394
Bite into it.

1958
01:22:15,395 --> 01:22:18,424
(Why is she flirting with webfoot octopus?)

1959
01:22:20,364 --> 01:22:21,534
Gosh, it's hot.

1960
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:27,234
(While the siblings share their hot friendship)

1961
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:29,204
I should make the broth now.

1962
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,203
Shabu-shabu.

1963
01:22:32,204 --> 01:22:34,814
(She pours water into a wide pot.)

1964
01:22:34,844 --> 01:22:36,783
I want to use just a little bit of this radish.

1965
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,014
(She slices the radish.)

1966
01:22:38,644 --> 01:22:40,554
(Putting in)

1967
01:22:41,854 --> 01:22:43,984
Use a generous amount...

1968
01:22:45,554 --> 01:22:46,724
so that it becomes tasty.

1969
01:22:47,794 --> 01:22:49,694
(She adds green onions as well.)

1970
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:51,123
Ta-da.

1971
01:22:51,124 --> 01:22:52,834
(The shabu-shabu broth is ready!)

1972
01:22:53,864 --> 01:22:55,633
The seasoning.

1973
01:22:55,634 --> 01:22:57,334
(While the broth boils, shall we make the seasoning?)

1974
01:22:57,834 --> 01:22:59,773
(Slicing scallions)

1975
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,544
(Slicing chili peppers)

1976
01:23:03,204 --> 01:23:04,344
To soy sauce,

1977
01:23:05,574 --> 01:23:07,143
let's add vinegar...

1978
01:23:07,144 --> 01:23:08,314
and sugar.

1979
01:23:08,844 --> 01:23:10,313
I'll also add garlic.

1980
01:23:10,314 --> 01:23:11,544
(Minced garlic, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce)

1981
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:13,953
(Jung Ah picks something up.)

1982
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:16,783
It's tasty with some light mustard.

1983
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:17,784
(Squeeze in light mustard for spiciness.)

1984
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:23,524
(Mix them well to complete Jung Ah's special shabu-shabu sauce.)

1985
01:23:24,094 --> 01:23:27,494
Jun Myun, please try the shabu-shabu sauce.

1986
01:23:28,494 --> 01:23:30,234
It's clean. Come on.

1987
01:23:30,434 --> 01:23:31,963
- Isn't it too rich?
- No, don't dilute it.

1988
01:23:31,964 --> 01:23:33,304
It's just right. It's tasty.

1989
01:23:33,904 --> 01:23:34,974
It's good.

1990
01:23:35,074 --> 01:23:37,443
(The completed sauce goes on the table.)

1991
01:23:37,444 --> 01:23:38,644
It looks tasty.

1992
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:42,744
Hye Yoon's hands must be cold.

1993
01:23:44,114 --> 01:23:46,213
(Hye Yoon rinses the vegetables without knowing...)

1994
01:23:46,214 --> 01:23:48,314
(that Jung Ah is talking about her.)

1995
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:52,794
I'll rinse the napa cabbage all the long...

1996
01:23:53,354 --> 01:23:54,553
before eating dinner.

1997
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:56,294
I can't do anything else.

1998
01:24:00,364 --> 01:24:03,104
I'm so bad with household chores. What am I going to do?

1999
01:24:03,534 --> 01:24:05,034
How am I going to get married?

2000
01:24:05,934 --> 01:24:08,604
I hope my mom won't watch this video.

2001
01:24:09,674 --> 01:24:11,403
Are these fully rinsed?

2002
01:24:11,404 --> 01:24:12,614
Who are you talking to right now?

2003
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:17,314
I need to chat in order to get more screen time.

2004
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:20,314
Are you the type to want more screen time?

2005
01:24:20,486 --> 01:24:22,085
Yes. If I want...

2006
01:24:22,086 --> 01:24:24,226
more screen time on a variety show,

2007
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,166
I need to speak.

2008
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,096
Isn't she so cute?

2009
01:24:30,736 --> 01:24:32,665
(Even after that)

2010
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,106
(Oh, no!)

2011
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:38,605
Please edit out the unhygienic parts.

2012
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:39,706
(Mumbling)

2013
01:24:42,306 --> 01:24:43,676
What is she saying?

2014
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:47,715
- It's a private show.
- Is it a private show?

2015
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:48,746
Yes.

2016
01:24:49,186 --> 01:24:50,215
All done.

2017
01:24:50,216 --> 01:24:51,616
(She finishes rinsing the vegetables.)

2018
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:52,986
You piled them up well.

2019
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:54,455
- Really?
- Yes.

2020
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,626
They look pretty.

2021
01:24:56,626 --> 01:24:58,595
We're ready to eat shabu-shabu.

2022
01:24:58,596 --> 01:25:00,396
(They're ready to eat shabu-shabu.)

2023
01:25:01,026 --> 01:25:04,296
(Shall I get started?)

2024
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:08,366
(She takes out strawberries.)

2025
01:25:09,006 --> 01:25:11,875
- The skewers...
- Pepper? It's on the top.

2026
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:13,945
No. Skewers.

2027
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:15,006
They're here.

2028
01:25:17,776 --> 01:25:20,015
I'll skewer fruits...

2029
01:25:20,016 --> 01:25:21,886
and make tanghulu.

2030
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:26,826
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2031
01:25:27,926 --> 01:25:30,955
I don't want to make tanghulu...

2032
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:33,695
with only four pieces of fruit.

2033
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:35,126
I'll skewer many pieces.

2034
01:25:35,596 --> 01:25:37,396
One, two, three, four...

2035
01:25:38,336 --> 01:25:40,466
- Gosh, you're here.
- Yes.

2036
01:25:41,106 --> 01:25:43,176
Chef Park, you like strawberries.

2037
01:25:43,976 --> 01:25:46,275
Are you trying to get on my good side with strawberries?

2038
01:25:46,276 --> 01:25:48,605
You worried a lot about me today,

2039
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:50,275
so I'll make this for you.

2040
01:25:50,276 --> 01:25:51,875
Okay. Strawberries.

2041
01:25:51,876 --> 01:25:54,016
(She takes out Seasoning Park's favorite fruit, strawberries.)

2042
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:55,986
I'll only use the plump ones.

2043
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:57,856
Let's begin.

2044
01:25:58,556 --> 01:25:59,586
I'll skewer them.

2045
01:26:00,826 --> 01:26:02,555
(1 green grape)

2046
01:26:02,556 --> 01:26:04,225
(2 green grapes)

2047
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:05,425
(3 green grapes)

2048
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:07,265
(4, 5 green grapes)

2049
01:26:07,266 --> 01:26:08,896
(6 green grapes)

2050
01:26:10,636 --> 01:26:12,136
(Is this enough?)

2051
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:14,205
(As per Im's philosophy on tanghulu, she adds a lot of fruits.)

2052
01:26:14,206 --> 01:26:16,306
It's nice. I'll add strawberries.

2053
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:18,705
I'll make a strawberry tanghulu.

2054
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,606
(She skewers the strawberries.)

2055
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,876
I'll do a collaboration.

2056
01:26:25,276 --> 01:26:29,246
(Strawberries and green grapes)

2057
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:33,886
(The collaborative tanghulu is complete.)

2058
01:26:34,286 --> 01:26:36,096
Ji Yeon, you can cook well.

2059
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:37,425
- Me?
- Yes.

2060
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:38,795
- Really?
- Yes.

2061
01:26:38,796 --> 01:26:40,696
Cooking isn't hard.

2062
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,766
If you're genuine about it, it won't be hard.

2063
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:46,305
You can cook well.

2064
01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:48,236
(Im family's tanghulu is made with genuine care.)

2065
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:50,805
Now awaits the hard part.

2066
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:52,006
(However, this is only the beginning.)

2067
01:26:52,176 --> 01:26:54,476
(They need to harden, but I don't think it'll happen.)

2068
01:26:54,946 --> 01:26:56,746
(Sticky)

2069
01:26:57,146 --> 01:26:58,216
Is it a success?

2070
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,486
(What will become of the Im family's tanghulu?)

2071
01:27:00,646 --> 01:27:01,815
(The table is about to collapse...)

2072
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,215
(because the dinner is an absolute feast.)

2073
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:04,815
(The webfoot octopuses go in.)

2074
01:27:04,816 --> 01:27:06,256
(The meat goes in.)

2075
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:08,386
(The webfoot octopus shabu-shabu with various ingredients)

2076
01:27:08,426 --> 01:27:10,325
(She takes a bite...)

2077
01:27:10,326 --> 01:27:11,356
(of a plump webfoot octopus.)

2078
01:27:11,656 --> 01:27:13,596
(This place is good at making fried webfoot octopus.)

2079
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:14,966
(This is the taste.)

2080
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,596
(Hye Yoon knows how to eat.)

2081
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:18,666
(She also knows how to take photos.)

2082
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:20,405
(The difficult customer loves her work.)

2083
01:27:20,406 --> 01:27:23,236
(They even master the dance.)

2084
01:27:23,636 --> 01:27:25,005
(For the multi-talented Hye Yoon, he prepares...)

2085
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,675
(the webfoot octopus ramyeon.)

2086
01:27:26,676 --> 01:27:27,905
(This is for Hye Yoon.)

2087
01:27:27,906 --> 01:27:29,175
(An insane scene)

2088
01:27:29,176 --> 01:27:30,375
(They slurp the noodles...)

2089
01:27:30,376 --> 01:27:31,746
(endlessly.)

2090
01:27:31,816 --> 01:27:33,045
(The taste...)

2091
01:27:33,046 --> 01:27:34,315
(makes them exclaim.)

2092
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:35,915
(Double thumbs up for Jae Wook)

2093
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:38,055
(Three, four!)

2094
01:27:38,056 --> 01:27:39,315
(They exude good cheer that can't be contained.)

2095
01:27:39,316 --> 01:27:40,556
(Grooving passionately)

2096
01:27:40,886 --> 01:27:42,756
(The four siblings drive along the blue South Sea.)

2097
01:27:43,296 --> 01:27:45,826
(The fourth story in Yeosu, South Jeolla Province)

2098
01:27:46,026 --> 01:27:47,565
(And...)

2099
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:49,865
(Dex is back...)

2100
01:27:49,866 --> 01:27:51,936
(as a guest!)

2101
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:53,635
(It's Dex.)

2102
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:55,035
(Dex's goal: Surprise the Fresh members.)

2103
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,936
(They're about to meet.)

2104
01:27:58,476 --> 01:28:00,906
(The exciting moment is coming soon.)

2105
01:28:01,293 --> 01:28:03,293
