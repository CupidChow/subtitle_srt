1
00:00:55,222 --> 00:01:02,644
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,644
(Previously) Have a safe flight.
And win that award, our big director.

3
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:08,911
Do you want to explore the city?

4
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,600
I want to stay here.

5
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:14,311
Be careful. It's not as easy as
jumping over there.

6
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:20,422
Let's go to the hospital.

7
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:25,044
Your dad, Siam, is indeed my idol.

8
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,422
He said he would look after me.

9
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,644
And he never once failed to do that.

10
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,400
The doctor said the pain could get worse tonight

11
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,333
and he's given me a lot of painkillers for it.

12
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,555
I almost blabbed to him that it was unnecessary.

13
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:52,622
After all, there's no better painkiller than wine.

14
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,844
Happy belated birthday.

15
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:09,666
- I don't get how you could enjoy this.
- It's because you didn't do it right.

16
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,866
- To enjoy wine, you need...
- Alright, alright.

17
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,466
You don't need to lecture me.

18
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,400
There's no way I can
learn to appreciate everything.

19
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:19,044
I don't like wine.
Just leave it at that.

20
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:22,977
Actually, it's not just wine.
I don't like anything with alcohol.

21
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:25,844
Then why are you drinking?

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,733
Because you went
to the other side with me today.

23
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:31,711
I'm returning you the favour.

24
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,911
You don't like to drink.
Your dad didn't like to drink either.

25
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:44,244
That's what I don't understand.

26
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,555
All my life, I've known him
to be an alcoholic.

27
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,533
He even died because of alcohol.

28
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,955
Somehow,

29
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,133
I'm still not over that.

30
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,111
You call that enjoying wine?
You just gulped it down.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,622
Pleae tell me more about Dad.

32
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,111
For five years in school,

33
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,288
your dad was my best friend.

34
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,933
And the big brother I didn't have.

35
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,888
We were close. Closer than twins.

36
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,911
Being the clever student that he was,

37
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,777
he was the only one in our school

38
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:54,377
to get accepted into
an architecture school in Bangkok.

39
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,800
Everyone in school was so excited about it.

40
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,533
The principal couldn't stop smiling

41
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,311
when he gave him the Best Student award.

42
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,888
He was an inspiration to everyone.

43
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:09,955
Including me.

44
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,822
But you had to go to high school
without him for a year.

45
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,977
You're right.

46
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,711
I felt like a part of me was lost then.

47
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,866
But that made me more determined than ever

48
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,622
to get into his architecture school.

49
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,600
I wanted to go there.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,933
But I wasn't sure I could do it.

51
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:41,200
We couldn't afford extra tutoring.

52
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,644
And I wasn't gifted to begin with.

53
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,177
But then Siam told me.

54
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,266
He would tutor me himself.

55
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,044
He said "We can do it."

56
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,333
"I will always be there for you."

57
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,377
I remember him coming home every weekend

58
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,333
despite his busy schedule as a college student.

59
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,844
He came home justto tutor me.

60
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,177
He taught me how to draw.

61
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:24,733
From him, I learned
how a line can be important.

62
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:33,600
With strength, accuracy, confidence,

63
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,844
and purpose, he taught me how to draw.

64
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,222
A single line

65
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:47,800
can turn into a platform or a wall

66
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,400
or even a bridge to cross over.

67
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,177
And in the end, you managed
to cross over that bridge.

68
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:05,444
And we got even closer after that.

69
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,066
We studied in the same department.

70
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,444
We took a lot of classes together.
We even shared a room.

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,688
I didn't keep any secret from him.

72
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:18,177
And he was always there to listen.

73
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:25,644
They even called us
"the Brothers" on campus.

74
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,088
Because we had a lot in common.

75
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:34,266
Because we dreamed
of a journey together.

76
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:41,666
Siam once told me.

77
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,822
He wanted to travel
from the north pole to the south pole.

78
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,200
Was there something
you guys didn't have in common?

79
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:00,688
Of course.

80
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,244
There was just one thing we didn't agree on.

81
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,022
Siam loved sports.

82
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,511
He played rugby for
our school of architecture.

83
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,511
Unlike him, I wasn't athletic.

84
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:17,844
My interest was in art, philosophy, and literature.

85
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:20,955
That's why I joined the play
your mom directed.

86
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,444
That was our story,
of how we became the Brothers.

87
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,422
The big brother played in the field

88
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,644
while his younger brother
watched in the audience.

89
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:35,088
And whenever I had rehearsals,
he, too, made sure he was there for me.

90
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,422
That's when you and dad
met the Great Sasiwimol.

91
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:48,511
Answer it.

92
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,044
Hello?

93
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:59,333
Honey? Did I wake you up?

94
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,466
No, I was just talking to Uncle In.

95
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,260
I hope you weren't discussing me
behind my back.

96
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,444
You bet we were.

97
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,266
Do you want to talk to In?

98
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,688
No, don't bother him.

99
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,266
I only called to say goodnight.

100
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,911
You know, Honey?
I went dress shopping today.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,777
It took me very long
before I could find the perfect dress.

102
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:24,022
Fon ultimately lost it
and threw me out of her boutique.

103
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:27,177
Make sure you watch me on TV tomorrow.

104
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:31,622
Of course. Make sure you
talk about me in your speech if you win.

105
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:35,066
Why should I?

106
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,266
I don't want the public
to know I'm a divorcee with a son.

107
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:47,066
I'm hanging up.
Have fun talking behind my back.

108
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:51,600
- Goodnight. Kisses.
- Goodnight. Kisses.

109
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,577
The Great Sasiwimol
hasn't changed a bit.

110
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:28,377
She always makes a big impression
on people with her immense strength.

111
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,111
It's raining again.

112
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,800
What happened when you and Dad met Mom?

113
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,333
- Your Mom fell in love with your Dad.
- But did Dad fall for her?

114
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,022
He wasn't one to show his feelings.

115
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,311
But you said you guys shared secrets.

116
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,088
- I said I shared mine.
- But what about Dad?

117
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,133
I thought I knew what he was thinking.

118
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:06,350
I thought he went to the rehearsal
with me because he fell for her.

119
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,844
He told you that himself?

120
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,866
We three became best friends.

121
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:17,533
We always hung out together.

122
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:26,044
We three, Siam, Inthawut, and Sasiwimol.

123
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:30,133
Mom said you were
her matchmaker. Her bridge.

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,866
Sasiwimol was sure of her feelings.
And she was a real risk taker.

125
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,266
She had feelings for Siam
and wasn't afraid to let him know.

126
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:40,533
That sounds exactly like Mom.

127
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:42,955
She always gets what she wants.

128
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:49,111
- No one dares to resist her.
- So, you told Dad to go out with her.

129
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,333
Well, they were perfect for each other.

130
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,622
Was that really the reason?

131
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,311
Siam was my dear brother.

132
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:01,755
Sasiwimol was also my best friend.

133
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
They loved each other.

134
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:07,444
Of course, I wanted them to be together.

135
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,266
- To have a perfect life together.
- But was that really the reason?

136
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:14,088
- They loved each other.
- Who told you that?

137
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:16,044
- Sasiwimol.
- What about Dad?

138
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:17,111
You heard that from his lips?

139
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,133
Well, I wanted them to be together.

140
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,111
And what did you do?

141
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,000
I stepped back.

142
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,822
And the group was no longer three.

143
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,444
I wanted them to have
a perfect life together.

144
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:40,955
So, you decided to hang out alone?

145
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,000
- No.
- You had a girlfriend?

146
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,422
It's normal for a man to have one.

147
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,355
But the Great Sasiwimol
didn't know that?

148
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,222
I didn't have to tell her.

149
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:53,977
Did Dad know?

150
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:55,288
Of course.

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,844
Rosalin. She went to
our junior-senior high school.

152
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,355
She went to the university
in our hometown.

153
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,711
So, it was a long-distance relationship?

154
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,777
- But I saw her every weekend.
- You wanted them to be alone together.

155
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,666
When you reach a certain age,
goodbyes become inevitable.

156
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:16,933
Was she pretty?

157
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:19,266
Who?

158
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:20,822
Rosalin?

159
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,422
Right? Is her name Rosalin?

160
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,933
Yes, Rosalin.

161
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,444
Was she pretty?

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,488
She was simple.

163
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:34,533
A reserved woman
whose charm rivaled a cold breeze.

164
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,111
She sounds nice.

165
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:37,933
Why did you guys break up?

166
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,688
Because I wanted to live in the ocean
where no one could find me.

167
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,133
That's too bad.

168
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,666
When did you guys break up?

169
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:50,577
A long time ago.

170
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,000
Before or after Dad married Mom?

171
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:55,488
After.

172
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,400
Was she upset?

173
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,822
- Who?
- Rosalin.

174
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,200
Is that right? Is her name Rosalin?

175
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,333
Can you stop asking about her?

176
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,422
You don't even care about her.

177
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:10,866
More wine.

178
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,355
Too much wine isn't good for you, you know.

179
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,466
But my leg hurts.

180
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,200
One more glass, then.

181
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,440
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

182
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:41,533
Your uncle Inthawut isn't a good person.

183
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:49,200
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

184
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:11,311
Of course. She was upset.

185
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:15,000
At the time

186
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,755
all I could do was

187
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,088
hope she'd recover one day.

188
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:32,333
I wanted her to meet someone better
and start a family together.

189
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,688
You're saying it as if you were
bad news for her?

190
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,955
That would be an understatement.

191
00:15:54,577 --> 00:16:01,022
Your uncle Inthawut isn't a good person.

192
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:07,066
Uncle In.

193
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:10,022
Stop drinking.

194
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,422
I didn't know.

195
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,066
I didn't know it would end that way.

196
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,866
You know?

197
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,533
I never once forgave myself
for what happened.

198
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:57,444
What happened after Dad married Mom?

199
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,155
All I know was

200
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,622
it didn't go as planned.

201
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,444
They didn't get their happy ending.

202
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,355
So, this is what's been bothering you.

203
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,511
Did you come here on purpose?

204
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,133
It was fate.

205
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,422
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:12,955
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:18,244
Dad wouldn't blame you for it.

208
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,288
Neither do I.

209
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,777
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,622
I'm sorry I hurt you guys.

211
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,266
You only did it

212
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:53,044
out of your love for Dad.

213
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,377
Love isn't the right word.

214
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:03,555
It was worship. I looked up to him in every way.

215
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:07,666
I know.

216
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,666
Dad loved you, too.

217
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,911
His voice.

218
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,466
I can still hear his voice.

219
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:39,755
"I will."

220
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:45,733
"I will always be there for you."

221
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:53,200
Despite that,

222
00:19:58,466 --> 00:19:59,755
I left him.

223
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,911
It was me who left him.

224
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,111
I, too, will always be there for you.

225
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:53,422
You should go to sleep.

226
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,888
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

227
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,111
- Wang?
- Yes?

228
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,733
If it's uncomfortable,
you can get in bed with me.

229
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,800
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

230
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,244
- Wang?
- Yes?

231
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,955
What can I get you?

232
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:34,866
Nothing.

233
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,177
I don't need anything.

234
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,088
Go back to sleep.

235
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,711
Looks like it's going to rain all night.

236
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,466
I like it.

237
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,000
The mountain rain.

238
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,733
It can sing us to sleep.

239
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:17,266
Is it cold?
Feel free to grab more blankets.

240
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,533
I'm good.

241
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:35,911
Wang?

242
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:38,733
Yes?

243
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:45,000
Are you comfortable there?

244
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,088
I'm alright.

245
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,800
If it's uncomfortable,

246
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,844
you can get in bed with me.

247
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,844
Do you like going to bed listening to the rain?

248
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
I do.

249
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,066
I thought you'd prefer it to be quiet.

250
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,355
Because it's quiet in the ocean.

251
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,733
No one can find you there.

252
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:21,511
For some things,

253
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,911
it's up to us how we want them to be.

254
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,022
Same goes with a line.

255
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,088
It's up to us
whether to draw it or not.

256
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,977
Or whether to connect it to another line.

257
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,377
I see you've drawn that line.

258
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:49,777
And are you okay with that?

259
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:53,044
Am I okay with what?

260
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:06,888
The fact I drew that line
and followed it here.

261
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,022
Yes.

262
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:22,444
How do you feel about it?

263
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:25,911
I feel like

264
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:35,222
the clock has turned back.

265
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:43,777
I feel like it has turned back decades.

266
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,311
And that I'm now with someone from my past.

267
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:03,466
Dad, right?

268
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,866
I feel like he's here with me.

269
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:16,911
And while I know it's not him,

270
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:23,733
it nevertheless feels like him.

271
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:31,733
Das never left us.

272
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:33,977
What about you?

273
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,711
How do you feel about all of this?

274
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,822
I feel.

275
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:57,800
I feel the dad I've been looking for...

276
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:05,377
he isn't with you.

277
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:13,400
He isn't out there either...

278
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:20,644
But he's actually here...

279
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,000
inside me.

280
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:05,733
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

281
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,288
Wang, do you have a best friend?

282
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:10,044
Do I look like I don't have one?

283
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,688
- No. I mean...
- No, I don't.

284
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,733
You're right. I don't have a best friend.

285
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,933
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

286
00:29:31,155 --> 00:29:34,555
That night, I lay there
listening to the rain

287
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:39,044
and his slow and steady breath.

288
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:46,777
It was a new feeling. It's hard to explain.

289
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,888
It felt like a discovery but it was invisible.

290
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,844
A fulfilment but it was empty.

291
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:01,511
A feeling of loneliness but it was warm.

292
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,866
And before I drifted into unconsciousness,

293
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:11,355
I felt like we had gotten closer,

294
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,844
but we couldn't touch each other just yet.

295
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:20,555
It was like a thin wall that is separating you

296
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,066
from the answer to your mystery.

297
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,511
The answer I was looking for.

298
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:33,000
Now I know where it is.

299
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,888
It's next to me. And inside me.

300
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:52,333
The next morning, I woke up
early to make him breakfast.

301
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,377
I did everything meticulously,

302
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,777
the way In taught me
without even realizing it.

303
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,622
Make it finer.

304
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,977
Seems like there is still a lot to learn.

305
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:09,000
See? It's because
you didn't make it fine enough.

306
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:12,355
But thank goodness
he is patient enough to teach me.

307
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,066
Here is your breakfast.

308
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,155
I am learning how to look after him.

309
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:26,977
And to get to know him better.

310
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,644
I'm doing this to earn his trust,

311
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,733
so that he'd let me in
on the big secret.

312
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,044
You're stuck here with me.

313
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,177
Don't you find it boring?

314
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,288
I told you.
I'm going to take care of you.

315
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,600
For young people like you,

316
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,666
there are still a lot of things
to explore in the city.

317
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:28,444
I'd rather learn them from
old people like you. It's easier.

318
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,333
Kids these days still think
they can learn something from adults?

319
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,066
I think they still do.

320
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:37,266
But both parties have to be
willing to learn from each other.

321
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,733
And adults must admit
where they're wrong.

322
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,688
Careful.

323
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:49,311
I don't mind reasonable adults.

324
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:52,022
The problem is
they all think they're reasonable.

325
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,355
Same goes with you kids. Am I right?

326
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,066
I admit. Sometimes, kids can be hot-headed.

327
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:59,955
But that only happens
when the adults are being unreasonable.

328
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:01,266
So, you're saying
it's okay to retaliate?

329
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,711
How is that reasonable?

330
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:05,688
Because two people of different beliefs
and ages think differently.

331
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,466
And that makes it okay
to resolve it through a fight?

332
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,400
Do you think I'm one of those kids?

333
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:14,200
I hope not.

334
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:16,355
I can assure you I'm not.

335
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,555
Honestly, I don't think I would stand
a chance if you decide to fight me now.

336
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,466
You're sure about that?

337
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,066
Look at your gigantic feet.

338
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,977
I wouldn't stand a chance against them.

339
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:28,600
I broke my leg. I couldn't fight you.

340
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:31,066
But once I can stand on my feet,
you better watch out.

341
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,955
Then I'll delay the fight
until you recover.

342
00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:48,488
Wang.

343
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:50,600
Do you have a best friend?

344
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,777
Why did you ask? Of course, I do.

345
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,555
Do I look like I don't have one?

346
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,777
- No, I mean...
- No, I don't.

347
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:03,111
You're right. I don't have a best friend.

348
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,155
What about girls?

349
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,044
You told me you were seeing someone.

350
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,177
Yes, but I don't know
if we were ever a thing.

351
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:15,755
You two met in college?

352
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,577
Tell me about her.

353
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:19,422
No.

354
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:21,733
We met in boarding school.

355
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:36,466
When I was sent there, I was a crybaby.

356
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,444
I was one of the smallest kids.

357
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:41,644
I became a target for the big kids.

358
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,488
They pointed at me and laughed.
I had no one by my side.

359
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,377
And then I grew up
and learned how to defend myself.

360
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:54,044
I stopped crying
and started to fight back.

361
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:58,311
If he laid a hand on me,
whether he was bigger or older,

362
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,444
I'd fight him.

363
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,355
In the end, they stopped bothering me.

364
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,466
And my peaceful days began right after.

365
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:10,533
One day, a new kid
was transferred there.

366
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:16,466
His family was going
through a tough time.

367
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:21,577
There was no one
to look after him every day,

368
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,466
hence, the boarding school.

369
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,444
He was delicate. Fragile.

370
00:35:30,355 --> 00:35:31,688
Both emotionally and physically.

371
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:40,222
Students, no matter what year
they were in, started to pick on him.

372
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,266
They called him the C-word.

373
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:43,066
"You faggot."

374
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,844
"Your parents sent you here
for anal sex?"

375
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,133
It was painful. It was cruel.

376
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:56,622
They thought they were big in number
so they could do anything to him.

377
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,444
To them, anyone who was different
was not right in the head

378
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:02,066
and deserved to be punished.

379
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:04,577
When in truth, what they did was only
a facade to hide their own cowardice.

380
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:11,955
Not everyone was mean to him.

381
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:18,977
But the other kids, including
some teachers, just laughed it off

382
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,022
as if it was normal to get picked on.

383
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,822
They said "don't bully him."

384
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:28,044
"He's a nice kid."
I couldn't stand them.

385
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,060
They told the bullies not to
bully him because he was a nice kid

386
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,088
instead of calling them out
on their bullying and ugly hearts.

387
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,244
The rest of the school

388
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:46,777
ignored what was happening.

389
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,533
No one should go through what he did.

390
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,088
No one should be treated as if they were less-than.

391
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:17,955
That's why I approached him
and decided to be his friend.

392
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,377
I did it because he deserved it.

393
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:25,688
The reason was innocent.

394
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:33,666
After that, those bullies
stopped coming for him.

395
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,955
But even then, I could still see contempt

396
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:38,800
in their eyes, their smirks,
and the way they talked.

397
00:37:46,955 --> 00:37:53,511
That's when I realized some people
would never see us as their equals.

398
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,311
I'm glad I befriended him.

399
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:11,888
In a world that's filled with hatred and judgement,

400
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:14,666
I was able to make life a little more
tolerable for him.

401
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:26,333
Why are you looking at me like that?

402
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:30,511
Nothing.

403
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:33,400
You...

404
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:36,822
I think...

405
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,333
You were very brave
and I'm proud of you.

406
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:45,955
Thank you.

407
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:52,222
And then one day,

408
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:57,244
he told me he loved me.

409
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:02,400
But it wasn't the kind of love
you had for a friend.

410
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:04,777
His feelings for me were deeper.

411
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:12,444
And what did you do?

412
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:20,688
I admit I was stunned at first.

413
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,133
Speechless.

414
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:23,911
I couldn't think straight.

415
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,600
I think there was fear between us.

416
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:35,400
And suddenly, all I saw was him.

417
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:42,155
The look on his face. His eyes.

418
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,888
He was obviously more scared
about this than I was.

419
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:50,088
And that was it.

420
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:56,288
The story of two lonely students,
plagued by fear.

421
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:02,177
But it was nice though to know

422
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:07,066
that we could still find love.

423
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,533
You're saying as if no one loved you.

424
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,911
I know. My mom loves me.

425
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:19,355
I'm everything to her.

426
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:25,822
But I guess deep down...

427
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:30,200
I was longing
for my missing puzzle piece.

428
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,711
And did you find that puzzle piece?

429
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:43,977
I told you, didn't I?

430
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:49,022
We were two lonely kids. Consumed by fear.

431
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,111
His fear was different from mine.

432
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,644
His fear was from the outside.

433
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:00,288
He was afraid he wouldn't fit in.

434
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:04,200
You could say
we wanted to walk a different path.

435
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:07,177
He was a good student.

436
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:11,400
And in the end,
he got accepted into his dream college.

437
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:18,733
He made new friends.
And we started to drift apart.

438
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:23,977
But I'm happy for him.

439
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,711
He has finally managed to fit in.

440
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:30,911
What about you?

441
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,488
What was your fear?

442
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,155
My fear was that.

443
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,111
I didn't want to lose myself just to fit in.

444
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,000
Even if it meant being alone and lonely?

445
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:06,488
This is weird.
I don't know why I brought that up.

446
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,022
It's not that I'm hiding it or anything.

447
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:12,288
But I don't know.

448
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,600
I suddenly felt like I had to tell you.

449
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,555
Thank you.

450
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:32,177
Thank you for trusting me.

451
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:41,288
Perhaps in order to be able to find out
what someone is hiding,

452
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:45,977
we may need to
come clean about ourselves first.

453
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,200
And maybe then, they'll let you in on it.

454
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:31,244
(Next Episode)
- The soup is superb.
- Already? You've barely touched it.

455
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,600
Didn't you say it was superb?

456
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:35,422
It is. It really is.

457
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,088
But I'm afraid I will get addicted to it.

458
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:40,977
I want to hear more about Dad.

459
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:43,911
His married life with Sasiwimol didn't improve at all.

460
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:45,977
In his eyes,

461
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:53,888
there was just so much misery.
