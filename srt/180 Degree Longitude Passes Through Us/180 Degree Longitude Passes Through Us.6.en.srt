00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:03,888
(Previously)
Wang?

3
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:04,977
Yes?

4
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:11,177
If it's uncomfortable, you can get in bed with me.

5
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,000
What about girls?

6
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:14,711
You told me you were seeing someone.

7
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:16,844
Yes, but I don't know if we were ever a thing.

8
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,600
You two met in college?

9
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,666
No, we met in boarding school.

10
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,644
One day, he told me he loved me.

11
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,266
It wasn't the kind of love you had for a friend.

12
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,622
His feelings were deeper.

13
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,133
Here's your breakfast.

14
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:17,555
It's my signature dish. You'll love it.

15
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,577
All-in noodles.

16
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:22,977
It smells good.

17
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:26,000
I always made this in boarding school.

18
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,511
The noodles were mine.

19
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,244
But the vegetables and the meat,

20
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,755
everything else was from the school kitchen.

21
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:37,733
We took whatever we found in the kitchen
and we made it in our dorm rooms.

22
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,866
What did you put in here?

23
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:45,200
Everything I could find in the fridge.

24
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:54,777
The soup tastes good.

25
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,022
I guess you don't usually eat this.

26
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,066
Since you take everything so seriously.

27
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,688
An easy dish can be delightful, too, you know?

28
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:08,200
Whoever invented instant noodles deserves a Nobel Prize.

29
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:12,533
You know I used to eat this every day too.

30
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:15,222
Yeah, but that was a lifetime ago.

31
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,044
It's good.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,933
Where had you gone earlier?

33
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,777
I was out looking for a signal.

34
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:34,000
You needed to send an e-mail?

35
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:37,377
No, I just wanted to read some news.

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,888
The guest room has a TV.

37
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,177
The TV is no good.

38
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:46,666
They only report rubbish.
You won't find any of the good stuff there.

39
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:49,177
You're right.

40
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,311
Does that mean
you only watch TV for news?

41
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:59,822
Would you think less of me
if I told you I don't watch the news?

42
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:01,511
They'd call you an ignoramus.

43
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,422
And what should they call you?
An enlightened person?

44
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:08,044
No, I'm a citizen whose eyes are open.

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
A citizen whose eyes are open?

46
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,533
I've never heard of it before.

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
Cause' I made it up.

48
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,066
Care to explain what it means?

49
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:19,311
I don't think it's right
to support the government

50
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,222
the way you support
your favorite football team

51
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,777
or your favorite K-Pop group.

52
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,177
When it comes to politics,
you need to open your eyes.

53
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,133
You need to keep an eye on
how they spend your money.

54
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:29,755
Otherwise, who would do it for you?

55
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:30,911
We have the opposition for that.

56
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,355
I love your sense of humor.

57
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,333
You do? I wasn't making a joke.

58
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,844
What do you think is politics?

59
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:43,955
Everything is politics.

60
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:47,000
Your job. Your surroundings.

61
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,000
Your friends. Your money.

62
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,244
Even your family.

63
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,711
I agree. Family is politics.

64
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,222
Did you speak from your experience?

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,466
Yeah. You've seen us.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,844
Then, I think your mom is the ruling government.

67
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,222
And I'm the opposition.

68
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,200
What about you? What's your role?

69
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:14,755
What role do you think I can take?

70
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,822
Anything but the Senator.

71
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,688
Do you think love is politics?

72
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,066
Yes. What do you think?

73
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:33,444
No.

74
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,511
Love is between two people who love each other.

75
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:41,488
But in practice, love usually
involves more than two.

76
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,466
If it's not between two people,
then it's not love.

77
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:49,288
You think so?
Let's say the chopsticks are a couple.

78
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:53,133
Take a look at them. What do you see?

79
00:05:58,422 --> 00:05:59,244
I see you.

80
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:01,711
You're overlooking it.

81
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:10,177
I see two straight lines,
but they're different in size and color.

82
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,933
And they are also parallel
to each other meaning they can never meet.

83
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,911
All right, they can never meet,

84
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:26,511
but when they're placed
next to each other like this...

85
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:31,733
they become more practical
as if they were made for each other.

86
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,844
What grade did I get, Professor?

87
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,555
For this lesson
on chopstick philosophy.

88
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,311
Are you done? You've barely touched it.

89
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:56,666
You said it was good.

90
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:00,111
It was good. Really good.

91
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,822
But I'm afraid I'd like it too much.

92
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:04,866
You can learn how to make it.

93
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,444
What you usually make
is even more complicated.

94
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:11,733
Or would you like me
to make it for you every day?

95
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:29,466
And now it's time for Best Director.

96
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:34,400
This year's nominees are:

97
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,622
Pichaya Saleebutr for Forever Yours.

98
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:49,155
Kietrabue Sripisut for My Mafia Baby.

99
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:55,000
Naruebadee Yinyom for True Love? I Don't Get It.

100
00:07:55,733 --> 00:08:00,600
Cheat Kusolsong for You and Me in the Shadow.

101
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:07,000
And Sasivimol Pakdeebadintr for Silver Sand Castle.

102
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:17,288
And this year's Best Director Award goes to...

103
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:25,844
Sasivimol Pakdeebadintr for
her national hit, Silver Sand Castle.

104
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,288
I've been working in the industry for years now

105
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,622
but this is actually my first win here.

106
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,200
I thought I wasn't good
enough for you guys.

107
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:58,533
Before I came here today, I thought that

108
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:03,444
maybe my time as a director was coming to an end.

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,511
But the award tonight proved
me wrong. My magic still prevails.

110
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:19,377
I'm so honored to have been nominated
alongside the other four contenders.

111
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:23,466
And I'm sorry I beat you guys.

112
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,555
I don't know who started
calling my kind of show a soap opera.

113
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:31,800
However, I prefer to use the term "The Drama of Your Dream."

114
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:36,755
By calling it a soap opera, they
look down on my fans and their dreams

115
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,755
even though their dreams aren't
that much different from my fans'.

116
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,377
When your favorite show ends

117
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:48,022
and you become aware once again
of your sad little life,

118
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,800
are you sure you're not going to take it

119
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,444
if you have a chance
to live happily like my TV characters?

120
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:02,666
I want to thank my crew and the cast,

121
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:09,155
and most importantly,
I want to thank my dear, dear fans...

122
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,844
The fans who I have faith in.

123
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,266
The fans who I have faith in.

124
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:18,466
The fans who still tune in for my show.

125
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:21,755
The fans who still tune in for my show.

126
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:28,088
Dream on and I'll continue
to give you this glimpse of hope.

127
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,111
I promise.

128
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:39,644
You even knew what she was going to say?

129
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,088
She recited it at home.

130
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,600
And we'll be back for Best Drama.

131
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,955
Where are you going? Don't you want to
know who will win Best Drama?

132
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,333
I need some fresh air.

133
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:09,350
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

134
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,222
Please tell me more about Dad.

135
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,444
I said it was a graduation party,
but it felt more like their wedding.

136
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,244
Your Dad and your Mom
were the stars of the night.

137
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:24,244
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

138
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,422
Please tell me more about Dad.

139
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:21,000
Sit.

140
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:43,244
Together, Siam and Sasivimol graduated.

141
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,444
I was one year behind them.

142
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,600
On the day of their graduation ceremony,

143
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:56,133
Rosalin came to Bangkok
to congratulate them in person.

144
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,177
Unfortunately, she got sick

145
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:06,488
and had to stay in bed
in our dorm room, Siam's and mine.

146
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,577
That's why she didn't join
the evening party.

147
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:15,000
That's why Mom
didn't know you had a girlfriend.

148
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,466
The evening party was insane.

149
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,711
There was booze, beer, wine.
You name it.

150
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:38,755
I think that was the first time
I saw your Dad with a drink.

151
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:44,155
I said it was their graduation party,

152
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:50,133
but it felt more like their wedding.

153
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,777
Your Dad and your Mom
were the stars of the party.

154
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,577
Everyone said
they were perfect for each other.

155
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,511
I noticed it was getting late.

156
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,155
So I asked to leave.

157
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,377
But then your Dad told me.

158
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,666
"Today is my special day."

159
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,133
"You can't leave now."

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,533
"We'll always be there
for each other, remember?"

161
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,288
I told him.

162
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,622
I wanted to check up on Rosalin.

163
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:52,955
Then I congratulated him.

164
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,333
I told him I wanted nothing
for him but happiness.

165
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,333
"Your life starts now."

166
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,800
"I hope you find success
in everything you do"

167
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:23,511
"whether in your career or your love life."

168
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,933
Soon after that,
your Mom and your Dad got married.

169
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:42,133
And then you and Rosalin broke up.

170
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:50,600
Is this why you don't want to mention her?

171
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:00,266
What happened after their wedding?

172
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,533
Sasivimol got pregnant.

173
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,511
Siam was over the moon.

174
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,577
He came to see me.

175
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:16,066
I swear he had never been happier.

176
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,311
He said he was going to be a father.

177
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,111
And I was going to be an uncle.

178
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,133
He wanted a son.

179
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,755
He said he would name
him Wang (longitude in English).

180
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:43,244
'cause it was our dream to travel to
the north pole and south pole together.

181
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,466
Do you know?

182
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,755
Your Dad...

183
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:03,977
He loved you very dearly.

184
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,533
He fell in love with you

185
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,733
the minute he found out
he was going to be a father.

186
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:20,577
Yes...

187
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,111
Then,

188
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:38,866
why did you say Mom and Dad weren't happy?

189
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,644
Or it wasn't a happy ending?

190
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:49,577
When you were born,
you became our favorite boy.

191
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:55,644
I went to see you, too, when I heard the news.

192
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,222
You looked like an angel

193
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,288
with your cute little hands

194
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,422
and your cute little feet.

195
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:15,022
You were the fruit of my best friend
and my dear brother.

196
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,688
Siam wouldn't leave you.

197
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,222
Whiile he was working as an architect,

198
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,777
he dedicated all his free time to you.

199
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,355
After that...

200
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,133
I didn't see you again.

201
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:48,133
Why?

202
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,888
- I had to study. Siam was busy with...
- You're lying.

203
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:57,333
Tell me the truth. I want to know.

204
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,755
- I don't think...
- Please?

205
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,866
Do it so I can finally put this behind me.

206
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,444
Do it so you can finally let go.

207
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:31,022
According to Sasivimol,
Siam had nothing but love for you.

208
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,466
But with her,

209
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,022
he held back.

210
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:46,488
She couldn't get through to him
as he always kept to himself.

211
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:49,800
He barely smiled.

212
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:56,555
I told her maybe
it was because of his job.

213
00:19:57,177 --> 00:20:00,022
He was trying to build a life
for his family.

214
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:07,888
I didn't get to see him that much
after his graduation.

215
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:17,377
Sometimes, he called.

216
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,466
We exchanged a few friendly words.

217
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:27,488
I told him then, I was happy for him.

218
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,088
He had a nice job.

219
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,955
He had a beautiful family.

220
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:44,888
I'm happy he had a wife
and an angelic baby.

221
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,377
I said I'd forever look up to him.

222
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:53,711
But the truth is...

223
00:20:56,222 --> 00:21:00,666
his relationship with your mom
wasn't getting any better.

224
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,733
And then one night,

225
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,800
Siam came to see me at the dorm.

226
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,111
He'd been drinking.

227
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:17,422
I asked, what happened?

228
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,822
He didn't answer. He didn't move either.

229
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:26,822
When he saw I kept asking, he asked me.

230
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:37,466
Will I be able to handle the truth?

231
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,733
In his eyes…

232
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:49,555
there was so much misery.

233
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,333
And I was...

234
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:00,844
I was sacred.

235
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,711
And then he kept asking.

236
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:15,888
"Will you be the same
if you know the truth?"

237
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:19,600
I said,

238
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:23,400
yes.

239
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:31,777
Nothing could tear us apart.

240
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:44,511
Then, he told me what it was.

241
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:54,577
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

242
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:58,977
After that day, every time the phone
rang in the middle of the night,

243
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,955
I didn't bother getting up.

244
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,511
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

245
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,088
Then, he told me what it was.

246
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,066
It was strange.

247
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,044
What he told me was merely a word.

248
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,400
But it held so much power, so much force

249
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,888
that you got hurt keeping it a secret.

250
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:00,800
You got hurt saying it out loud.

251
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:10,488
And when the truth was finally out in the open,

252
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,933
it hurt him.

253
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,822
And it hurt me.

254
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,355
We sat there together

255
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,533
in silence

256
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:44,955
until the sun came up.

257
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:46,955
That's when he left.

258
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:51,866
And I decided...

259
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,688
I decided to move away.

260
00:24:58,355 --> 00:24:59,333
In.

261
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:04,466
I thought if I moved away,

262
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:08,444
If I disappeared from their life,

263
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,066
things would get better between them.

264
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,911
I had to leave so that

265
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:24,133
your Dad, your Mom, and you

266
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,355
could stay together as a family.

267
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,955
So that your family could be whole.

268
00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:31,333
A few days after that,

269
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,155
Siam called me from somewhere.

270
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:41,422
I guess it was a bar.

271
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,422
The people there
and the music were pretty loud.

272
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,733
I could hear it over the phone.

273
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:55,200
But even then, I could still discern
the sadness in his voice.

274
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:05,355
Siam told me he was sorry,

275
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,977
that he should've kept it a secret and

276
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:15,533
if I could forget about it?

277
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,777
He wanted everything to go back
to the way it was.

278
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:23,977
But I...

279
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,088
I hung up on him.

280
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:52,088
You must be disappointed in me.

281
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:57,088
Your uncle, Inthawut,
isn't who you think he is.

282
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,355
He's a coward.

283
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,622
After that day,

284
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:12,600
in the middle of the night

285
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,155
every time the phone rang,

286
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:28,244
I just let it ring and ring.

287
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:42,044
Then I got a scholarship
to study abroad.

288
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:50,800
I hoped the long distance
would make everything easier.

289
00:27:54,044 --> 00:28:00,666
I thought it would help
us get back on with our lives.

290
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,711
But I was wrong.

291
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:10,400
I still woke up in the middle of the
night for a call that never rang again.

292
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:24,711
But the call came eventually.

293
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,177
The way the speaker said
it was so distant.

294
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:37,933
They told me.

295
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,733
They told me Siam had died.

296
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,177
The brother, who I worshipped.

297
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,066
The brother, who told me
he would always be there for me.

298
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,022
Actually, you did keep your promise.

299
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:22,044
You didn't leave me.

300
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:28,755
As it was me who left you.

301
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,688
I'm a coward.

302
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:44,333
- Your baby brother is a coward.
- No, no.

303
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:50,688
You're no longer a coward. Look up.

304
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:06,600
Good and please stop crying.

305
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,911
I, Siam, don't want to see you cry.

306
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:12,688
You know that.

307
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,422
But I left you.

308
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,244
I left you because
I was too scared to admit it.

309
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,155
You're admitting it now.

310
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:29,733
I know it. Dad would know, too.

311
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,733
I left you.

312
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:42,666
- And you couldn't find me.
- But I found you, didn't I?

313
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:45,866
I think at some point, Dad did, too.

314
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,244
I didn't even get a chance
to say sorry.

315
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:55,444
Dad would understand.

316
00:30:58,644 --> 00:30:59,755
I know I don't blame you.

317
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,777
But look at what happened
because of my cowardice.

318
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,977
Dad wouldn't blame you
because he loved you.

319
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:19,111
I don't blame you either
because I love you.

320
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:40,511
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

321
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:41,866
Honey!!

322
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:44,177
- Did you watch me on TV?
- Yes, I did.

323
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:47,422
Is In there? Can I talk to him?

324
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,644
(180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us)

325
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:58,711
Dad would understand.

326
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,911
I know I don't blame you.

327
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:09,844
But look what at happened
because of my cowardice.

328
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:14,200
Dad wouldn't blame you
because he loved you.

329
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:22,222
I don't blame you either
because I love you.

330
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:52,622
- Hello.
- Honey!!!

331
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,666
I won the two biggest awards!
Best Director and Best Drama.

332
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,933
Did you watch me on TV?

333
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,422
I did. I loved your speech.

334
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,800
I got home and called you immediately.

335
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:12,622
Too bad you aren't here.
We could celebrate together.

336
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:15,422
What about the crew?

337
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:22,422
They went home to celebrate
their wins with their families.

338
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,266
Is In there?

339
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:30,577
Yes. We were just
watching you on TV together.

340
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,955
Can I talk to him?

341
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:39,400
In.. He left.

342
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:41,911
I think he's out checking on the bridge.

343
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,022
I see. Tell him
I'm flying there tomorrow.

344
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,044
The plane leaves around noon.

345
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,155
Have Sangkam pick me up at the airport.

346
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,311
Sure.

347
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:57,622
We will celebrate together.

348
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,977
Great.

349
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,622
Did you have dinner?

350
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,022
You didn't give In a hard time, right?

351
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,644
You should've come with me, you know?

352
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:15,066
I'm home alone and I have no one
to talk to about this evening.

353
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,288
Honey, I gotta go.
I'm in the middle of a shower.

354
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,800
But how? I see.

355
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:26,422
See you tomorrow, then. Kisses.

356
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,000
Kisses.

357
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,022
Honey, wait.

358
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:33,666
What?

359
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:38,111
You know I love you, right?

360
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:42,444
I love you, too.

361
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:10,777
Can I be alone for a second?

362
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:56,955
Elsa, where are you?

363
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:58,111
What are you doing?

364
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:02,111
Nothing, it's nothing.

365
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:07,400
Do you have plans tonight?
Wanna come in for some wine?

366
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:13,866
No. No one's here.

367
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:16,622
I'm alone.

368
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,866
Really?

369
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:24,466
I see.

370
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,755
That's fine. We can meet
when it's convenient.

371
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:19,800
When did you wake up?

372
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,466
In.

373
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:55,088
Please talk to me.

374
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,555
I don't know about you.

375
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,511
But for me,

376
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,600
my time here with you so far...

377
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,555
has been one of the
greatest joys in my life.

378
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,177
All my life I've been looking for this.

379
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:40,444
But if you want to cut it short...

380
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:47,222
if you insist you want to be alone,

381
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:56,355
then I won't bother you.

382
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:14,133
(Next Episode)
The Great Sasivimol won the two biggest awards!

383
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:19,022
Can I have some friends over to celebrate?

384
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:21,311
With pleasure. Do it however you want.

385
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,955
What do you think I should major in?

386
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,155
Your whole existence
screams a philosophy major.

387
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:28,800
How do you know me so well?

388
00:43:29,688 --> 00:43:30,600
I changed my mind.

389
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
What do you mean?

390
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,911
I want to stay here. With In.
